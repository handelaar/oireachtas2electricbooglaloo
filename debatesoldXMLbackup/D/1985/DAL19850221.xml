      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been four or five major changes in the budget introduced here on budget day.  We are still dealing, theoretically, with the budget which was introduced on budget day.  Is that a point of order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, there are four radical changes in the budget.  Could I suggest this, to put the budget debate in some sort of rational order &mdash; that the Minister for Finance would bring in a new budgetary table for us?  Would that be possible?  Would you ask him to do that, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is serious and deserves more than the flippant answer given by the Taoiseach, one he has been giving for quite some time.  It is far more urgent on the Cork scene than contraceptives.  Will the Taoiseach give a specific answer as to when the Bill will be introduced?  I do not mind which Minister introduces it.</P>

I am concerned about the legislation that will deal with alterations in the Industrial Development Authority and other industrial development legislation.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They are separate issues.  The National Development Corporation Development Bill is a separate Bill to the other mentioned by the Deputy.  The National Development Corporation Bill will be before the House before long.  The Industrial Development Bill will take somewhat longer.  We will endeavour to have it introduced in this session but I cannot absolutely guarantee that.  I expect it will be, but I cannot be absolutely certain that it will be through the House in this session.  We would hope to have it introduced in this session.</P>

Do I take it when the Taoiseach said that the Bill will be introduced in this session that the IDA Bill will be introduced?

      <P>The National Development Corporation Bill will be introduced <Col N="468" /> before long.  The IDA Bill will take somewhat longer.  It will be introduced in this session, I think, but it will depend upon the time available in the House as to whether it is enacted in this session.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a sum of £20 million set aside in the national plan for the public pay deal.  This sum has now been increased to £108 million, £58 million of which has been explained by the phrase &ldquo;taxation buoyancy&rdquo;.  Bearing in mind last night's decision and all the additional rubber available to the country I wonder if this will assist this buoyancy.</P>
      <P>I referred last week to the additional 10p on the price of a gallon of petrol.  As you well know, Sir, from your Border constituency, the price difference between the price of a gallon of petrol north of the Border and here is in the region of 90p, something in excess of £10 on a full tank of petrol.  Do the Govern-ment not think that this will benefit the Border counties?  There will be a further flood of motorists across the Border to fill up their tanks and the Government should have no doubt but that the wives of such motorists will accompany them to do their shopping, which will occasion a further major loss to our Exchequer. As far as I can recollect this is the first Government in the history of the State that appointed no Cabinet Minister representing a Border county.  This reflects the poor treatment being meted out to Border counties by this Govern-ment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since assuming office over two years ago this Government stated that their committed intention was to do something about the unemployment situation.  To be fair, they certainly have.  They have raised it by 90,000 people to 235,000 in that period.  Can anybody understand the logic of a Government who kick the one labour-intensive industry we have in the teeth?  I speak of the construction industry, which was dealt a body blow in this budget by a 100 per cent increase in <Col N="474" /> VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. The construction industry is our second largest after agriculture and is probably the most labour intensive.  Fianna Fáil have always been convinced that it makes good economic sense to encourage the construction industry because it gives a high level of employment on the capital invested, in turn producing valuable assets of long term benefit proving to be a worthwhile return on the investment made and producing a high proportion of indigenous materials of which we have a plentiful supply.  One must ask: what have this Government done to date for that industry?  In addition to capital cutbacks, planning charges have been massively increased, once again in order to placate the Labour Party &mdash; as they did last evening.  Residential property tax was introduced.  They have introduced also a land tax, again to placate the 4½ per cent Labour Party.  Section 23 incentives have been virtually abolished, all of which pales into insignificance when one considers the increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And 45,000 unemployed in that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, as the House is aware, in the past week mortgages have been increased by 1¼ per cent as a direct result of this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall the effect of the VAT increases on the construction industry output will be to increase VAT on that industry by £75 million.  The average price of a new house, at £36,000, will increase by £1,750.  Despite what the Minister for Finance has said in an attempt to cause confusion the price of all new houses will be increased by 5 per cent.  Only where houses are being sold to first time buyers will the increased grant to £1,750 reduce that increased price.  Furthermore, the reduction of VAT on materials will have no beneficial effect on the builder because, being registered, he is entitled to reclaim it anyway.  New houses will be taxed at a rate of 10 per cent while second-hand houses will be subject to the 4 per cent to 6 per cent stamp duty, <Col N="475" /> showing a further bias in favour of second-hand houses and an additional kick in the teeth for the construction industry.</P>
    <P>In a submission by the construction industry they make the point that house purchasers cannot afford the increase and that the builder cannot afford to absorb it, thus leading to an inevitable reduction in the throughput and to increased unemployment. They continue to say that in turn this will increase the number of persons on local authority housing lists.  I say to the Government and to the Minister for Finance in particular: they have got it wrong again; despite their attempts in the national plan to entice people from public to private housing they have just ensured that the flow will be reversed by their performance in this budget.  I honestly believe that the treatment being meted out to the construction industry by this Government is a vindictive response to an industry which is known to be aligned to Fianna Fáil.  Is it not a sad day for this country when such petty, vindictive performance is allowed to cloud one's judgement, putting party before country?</P>
    <P>I might turn now to an area in which I am directly involved, that of health, and examine what the Government are doing in this area.  From a reading of the papers over the past couple of months it will be seen that this Government and the Minister for Health are slowly but surely dismantling our health services.  One can note from the papers even this morning a third meeting being held of the Western Health Board today, a third meeting also of the South Eastern Health Board today to discuss estimates.  There is no doubt but that there will be massive cutbacks in the allocations to health boards in 1985. In 1984 the eight health boards were expected to achieve a saving in the region of £24 million.  We all know now that they could not possibly manage to do so and, as a result, these charges became a first charge on the 1985 allocation.  I might take one example, that of my health board, the South Eastern, where we had a shortfall in 1984 of almost £1.1 million. We have been told by the Department of <Col N="476" /> Health that this will be the first charge on the 1985 allocation.  It follows that this figure must feature again in 1985 because, if that health board failed to achieve the necessary cutback in 1984, it follows that they will be unable to achieve it this year. Therefore, that figure can be doubled.  If one adds to that the additional amount required to reduce expenditure to the authorised 1985 level, which is £1.76 million, this leads to a total shortfall in the South Eastern Health Board for 1985 of £3.95 million, or, rounded off, to £4 million.</P>
    <P>I might go back a few years, to 1980, when the allocation to the South Eastern Health Board was £57.45 million.  Had that figure been brought in line with variations in the value of the pound since then, that health board would have received an allocation of £100.66 million in 1985.  Instead they received an allocation of £83.59 million, a difference of £17 million, and the Minister and Govern-ment expect us to believe there will be no resultant cutbacks or hardships.  Do they take us all for fools?  Of course, there will be cutbacks and job losses.  Wards will be closed and patients will suffer when their lives are in jeopardy.  I do not want to be an alarmist, but if in order to achieve savings the health boards will not provide locums the position will be very serious.</P>
    <P>I will give one example, which I have given before in the House.  They refused to provide a locum for a surgeon who was away on holidays. Most county hospitals have two surgeons, two physicians, two anaesthetists and so on and, if the health boards are not in a position to provide a locum, it means that the person on duty has to work 24 hours a day, seven days per week, while his colleague is on holidays or ill.  As a result, he can only provide an emergency service and cannot do the day to day work required.  Is it the Government's intention to reduce the health service to that of an emergency service?  Is that what we are offering our sick and elderly?  If so, let them say so. They should not expect the health service to do their dirty work for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> If we do not provide the financial allocation for these regions, it is the duty of the Minister and the Government to dismantle the health services, because that is what they are doing by stealth at present anyway.  We in the south east cannot possibly live within our present allocation, and it is inevitable that there will be suffering as a result.  The shortfall in the Southern Health Board is even greater than ours.  They speak of a figure of £10 million for 1985.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board are meeting today for the third time to try to achieve a saving on their estimate to run the health services in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  They have a shortfall of something in the region of £4 million, and other health boards are similarly affected.  We cannot hope to run the health services with these shortfalls.</P>
    <P>What has been the Minister's response?  He has raised the cost of private and semi-private accommodation by a massive 20 per cent.  It is cheaper now to spend a night in the Shelbourne or the Gresham than in any county hospital.  By raising the cost of hospital accommodation to this level the Minister has ensured that many patients who, up to now, opted for voluntary health insurance can no longer afford it and will have to revert to the general hospital services.  However, we have just discovered that the general hospital services cannot cope with the present demand on their services, and the Minister will now add a further group to this area while, at the same time, reducing the allocation to the general hospital service.  It is crazy that he will not provide the money for running the present service and puts further pressure on the service by increasing the private and semi-private costs.</P>
    <P>I referred here on a number of occasions to the scandal of units which cost in excess of £7 million lying idle because the Minister and his Department have refused to provide the funds to staff, equip and open them.  I will refresh the Minister's memory by listing the units involved.  The maternity unit in Galway, built at a cost of £4 million, remains unstaffed and idle.  The 30 bed maternity <Col N="478" /> unit ar Cahercalla, Ennis, built at a cost of £750,000, lies unopened.  Maybe the fact that these maternity units are unopened had something to do with the rushed family planning Bill last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no money to open it and the Deputy knows that as well as anybody else.  The 14 bed gynaecology unit at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, has been idle for three years now in spite of severe overcrowding in the general hospital.  Patients are being accommodated in the corridors in every wing in the hospital, and we cannot open that small unit because the Minister will not provide staff.</P>
      <P>The infamous <i>Building on Reality</i> spoke of the intention of the Government to make provision for the needs of the increasing number of elderly people.  We are told there will be many improvements to institutions which provide for geriatric patients.  They are lovely sentiments, but the reality is different.  There is a geriatric assessment unit in Ardkeen, Waterford, which was built at a cost of £90,000 approximately two years ago.  It lies idle because the Department will not provide the funds to staff it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money has been spent to provide paediatric facilities in the Midland Health Board region, but these cannot be opened either because no money has been made available for consultant staff. There is no money available to provide an orthopaedic service for the Midland Health Board and there is no service of that nature in the region.  It was suggested to the Midland Health Board that if they could find the funds for these requirements from within their financial allocation, maybe they could go ahead.  I have bad news for them in that regard.  The South Eastern Health Board attempted to do that, and we were promptly told by the Department of Health that as long as we had a shortfall in 1984 any funds that we managed to save would be taken as a <Col N="479" /> first charge against that.  We would not be allowed to use it to provide additional facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, made a lot of play in her speech last week of the provision of dental facilities for pregnant women.  We are all in favour of this but, unfortunately, the reality is different.  Because of the cuts in the health boards and the inadequacy of their allocations, many of the health boards &mdash; I speak specifically of the Southern and the South-Eastern Health Boards &mdash; no longer have adult dental services so how, in the name of God, can pregnant women avail of a service that does not exist?</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to a situation dear to my heart and you, a Cheann Comhairle, have an involvement whether you realise it or not.  I am referring to the Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford, and I will give the history in this regard.  We were ready to go to tender in 1981 but, unfortunately, it was the time when a previous Coalition were in office and, as you probably remember, there was a by-election pending in your constituency at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was one pending in that constituency and lo and behold the new Cavan hospital, which was way behind Ardkeen and others as regards planning, was suddenly catapulted ahead.  As a result we are still waiting for this badly needed facility.  Thankfully there is no by-election in Waterford.  I appeal to the Government, in the interests of fair play, to allow this complex to go ahead now.  We have suffered more than most in Waterford.  We lost Clover Meats in the weeks before Christmas.  It could have been saved if the Government agencies and the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture had the will to save it. However that is history.  It must be our turn this year.  We have two Ministers who are from Waterford and it would look very bad for them if they fail to deliver again.  They failed to deliver on the Clover issue, and I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of these two men, to ensure that he does not renege on Waterford again.</P>
      <P>The president of the FUE in his annual report said that the return on capital for a wide range of Irish companies was less than the lowest rate at which funds can be borrowed.  Without investment there is no way out of our economic morass. We must create a climate for investment. Unfortunately the Government appear to be incapable of doing that.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that his party do not have the ability to recognise that.  It any of them have the ability to do so they have not the decency or goodwill to come into the House and praise the budget for what it is worth.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most significant budgets to be introduced in recent years.  It is a watershed in our economic history.  It improved the climate for employment and has improved the taxation system. Everyone agrees that the PAYE sector are over burdened.  This has been the position for many years, but it took this Minister to change that radically.  He has reduced taxation from the top band of 65 per cent to 60 per cent, the next band to 48 per cent and the next to 35 per cent while at the same time he has increased the personal allowance.  That was a major step given our economic climate.  I congratulate the Minister and the Govern-ment for taking that initiative.  Many of us would like if he was in a position to go further and reduce the level of taxation on the PAYE sector more significantly. However, we appreciate the constraints on him and realise it is not possible for him to take the major steps many of us would wish him to take.  Given the strategy this Government adopted they will be in a position next year and in the years to come to further reduce the burden on the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>As regards the collection of taxation we must look at sectors which are not paying their fair share.  The Minister recognised that and said attention had been drawn to this in the national plan. There is urgent necessity to make the tax collection apparatus more efficient.  The Minister said in his speech that one of the biggest problem areas was tax collection enforcement.  The Minister announced the setting up of a working group to make recommendations to the Government for substantial improvements in the enforcement process.  I urge the Minister to make this area a priority one and to set up the group immediately.  The sooner they report back to the Government the quicker we will be on the road to introducing equality in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is our most pressing <Col N="482" /> problem.  We have a very young population compared to other European countries. We do not have sufficient jobs available for those coming on to the labour market.  The most disturbing fact is that the rate of job opportunities is inadequate to meet our growing labour pool.  We have often debated the causes and effects of unemployment, but we have failed to recognise that all Western world economies are experiencing this phenomenon.  Traditional employment is reducing in all sectors of these economies with the growing impact of technology and the natural exhaustion of one time labour intensive industries.  The Western world is further threatened every day by growing competition from Eastern countries, frequently referred to as Japan Incorporated.  We have only to look at the manufacturers of televisions, motor cars, cameras and the electronics industry to see the mighty impact Japan is having on these areas.  One of the implications of this is that we will continue to have difficulty in attracting job opportunities, and as a result we need to develop our natural resources to their fullest potential. I urge the Government to press ahead with their policies on forestry and fisheries.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Department of Energy to make a matter of priority the entire exploration of our oil wells around the coast.  It is important at this stage that the exploration companies get clarification in relation to marginal wells and the economic benefits to them should oil be discovered. It is important that this be clarified sooner rather than later and I urge the Government to treat this matter as a priority.  There is an opportunity there that we should grasp.  We are going to become more and more dependent on our own natural resources, and we will have to look at them in a different light than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>The Government have concentrated heavily on the area of import substitution. I should like to congratulate the Minister concerned on the approach he has adopted in encouraging this trend.  It is something we must continue to develop in the years ahead.  I will not attempt here <Col N="483" /> to address myself to the entire problem. However, it is important to realise that this House should conduct its affairs in a way that does not give the impression to the public that the Government of the day are capable of creating the level of employment that we know is needed.  We must face the world economic facts and also the increasing and developing technology. If we are to improve our employment levels the Opposition here will have to change their attitude from the one they are adopting at the moment in relation to any bona fide and constructive proposal brought forward by the Government to reduce unemployment.  Bona fide proposals must be accepted for what they are by all sides of the House regardless of who are in government.  If this House adopts a positive approach it will encourage the people to look more to themselves and to their inherent ability. Within each person there is an ability to develop and to fend for himself.  This is so in the case of the Irish people and particularly the case in respect of our young educated people.  This tremendous ability should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>This budget was very encouraging for young people.  It lifted the dreadful depression that seemed to hang over everyone's head.  It gave a feeling of hope that the country was going somewhere, that there was potential and possibility for all on this island.  In this House we have a responsibility to give every encouragement to young people by adopting a positive approach here.  We should not have a continual negative approach where everything that is proposed is automatically opposed just for the sake of opposing it.  Instead of having constructive opposition there is a continual debate with no constructive proposals from the Opposition.  This is very unsatisfactory.  If this House is to maintain credibility we will have to change our entire approach in that area.</P>
    <P>Another area that offers great scope for development is tourism, and the budget will make a tremendous impact on that industry in 1985.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for allowing a <Col N="484" /> reduction in taxation for the hotel, car and boat hire industries.  I come from Clare, which depends heavily on the tourist industry, and I should like to welcome the measures in the budget.  Many of the people in the hotel and car hire industries and in other areas of tourism recognise the major steps the Government have taken to help the industry.</P>
    <P>When I spoke here last year on tourism I forecast a bonanza year for that industry in 1984.  At the time the hotels' federation objected to what I said and they were very annoyed about it.  They now realise they were proved wrong.  Today I am prepared to say we will have a much better tourist industry in 1985 than we had in 1984.  It is important that the tourist industry and those involved in it recognise that fact.  Tourism is a growing industry.  Employment conditions are changing throughout the world, there are increased leisure hours and longer holidays, and these factors will have considerable impact on the industry.  We must ensure that our standards are kept high across the board.  This is very important, and we must also be seen to give value for money.  There is room for improvement here.  I appeal to those involved in tourism to make every effort to ensure that high standards are maintained and improved in all areas of that service industry.</P>
    <P>Recently in this House and in the committees of this House the body responsible for the development of small industries in the mid-west was subjected to much criticism.  I should like to take this opportunity to comment on the criticism made in relation to SFADCo specifically. They are based in Shannon and are responsible for development in the mid-west region.  As a Deputy for Clare I realise that SFADCo have done tremendous work for small industries in the mid-west region in recent years.  Above all other semi-State bodies they have been very successful, and it is unfortunate that Members of this House felt justified in criticising their activities.  If it were not for SFADCo many successful small <Col N="485" /> industries would not be in existence, and that is something for which we should commend SFADCo.  We know that every State body has defects, but if I were to list in order of priority the greatest offenders so far as the semi-State bodies are concerned SFADCo would be at the bottom of my list.  It was unfortunate it was brought into disrepute in the way that occurred recently.  Possibly the Deputies who spoke in relation to SFADCo were not as well versed as they should have been.  The criticism and the scathing attacks on SFADCo were unwarranted, unnecessary and unfair.  We need only look at the American economy to see that the American Government, and particularly the Republican Party, recognise that small industries will be the major development in the future.  They are concentrating heavily on encouraging small new industries in the United States.  The White House and President Reagan frequently meet what they call &ldquo;futurists&rdquo;. In the mid-west region we are a step ahead, because we are developing what the Americans are now trying to develop. They recognise, because of increasing automation and developing technology, that everything will have to go into smaller areas because of the decreasing need for a heavy labour force.  Therefore, people must look to certain areas with a view to creating a niche for themselves.</P>
    <P>I will give an example.  A lady in my constituency of Clare saw an opportunity to manufacture radons.  She is Angela Collins-O'Mahony who operates Essco Collins Limited.  Her development has proved very successful and is a typical example of a successful small industry that saw an opportunity, explored it to its full and developed it with the assistance of greater expertise from the US. We can develop this joint venture approach further, because we are ideally situated for such joint ventures.  The IDA and other developing agencies should look to this for greater development.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the supreme importance of agriculture to the economy.</P>

      <P>5.  In page 2, before line 10, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Section 4 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of the following:</P>
      <P>`(1)  A person shall not sell contraceptives unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the sale is in accordance with regulations for the purposes of this subsection relating to the sale of contraceptives, and'</P>

      <P>`(1)  A person shall not supply contraceptives unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the supply is in accordance with regulations for the purposes of this subsection relating to the supply of contraceptives, and'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla and I put down six amendments, five of which have been ruled out of order, and amendment No. 5 is the only one which still stands.  We hoped that in tabling these amendments we would get what we have not got to date, a debate on the need for extended and expanded comprehensive family planning facilities.  I recognise the delicacy with which the Minister must tread in maintaining support for the Bill before the House at present.  For that reason we do not intend to call a vote on amendment No. 5, but we feel that there should be some discussion on the amendments which we consider necessary to the 1979 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which still stands is to that section of the original Act which prevents the distribution of contraceptives except by sale.  We are anxious that <Col N="487" /> that would be deleted and that distribution which does not require sale be allowed.  In that regard we feel that the health boards have responsibility to ensure the provision of comprehensive family planning facilities.  If that is to be so, then medical card holders would be entitled to such facilities if the health board were providing them and they should not be obliged to pay.  In other words, the health boards would be free to supply contraceptives to families holding medical cards where it is judged that they require them.</P>
    <P>Our other amendments, which clearly we will not have an opportunity to discuss at this stage, refer to the definition of a family planning service.  Under the 1979 Act that is defined solely as the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation.  The health boards in particular are restricted from providing anything other than advice, instruction, information and consultation.  Voluntary family planning clinics can provide a wider service.  Again we are anxious that health boards would be obliged under the Act to provide, for instance, for tubal ligation and vasectomy.  There is a clear need for that kind of service.  On second Stage I indicated the demands that exist for tubal ligation.  There is no legal obstacle to the provision of that, but we feel that it would be necessary to broaden the definition of family planning services to ensure that health boards would be obliged to make this service available.</P>
    <P>The only amendment we have before us is No 5, which refers to the substitution of distribution for sale, in other words to allow health boards to be permitted to provide for medical card holders services which people who can afford to pay for them can get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the spirit in which Deputy De Rossa has opened up this aspect for discussion.  By way of explanation to the House at large I make the point that section 4 (3) of the 1979 Act provides that contraceptives may not be supplied <Col N="488" /> other than by way of sale, that is generally. Of course, the outlets are confined in the 1979 Act to chemists' shops.  The other provisions of the section as amended govern who may sell and who may purchase.  The 1979 Act draws a distinction between the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation on contraception and contraceptives, and their sale.  It draws a clear distinction, and Deputy De Rossa has underlined that point.  If family planning services were to be defined as including the supply of contraceptives this would entail provision for their free supply including the free supply by health boards, and that would be a totally new and different position.  I make the point about non-medical contraceptives and medical contraceptives.  I am sure the House would agree with me that they are generally cheap and when available without a doctor's prescription they will be now in the same category as relatively cheap over-the-counter items in the controlled outlets, and that will be a major improvement.  They are now available in that setting.  Also, Deputy De Rossa is aware that the contraceptive pill is available under the general medical services scheme.  It is generally available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be at variance with their obligations under section 59 of the 1970 Health Act for the health boards to supply non-medical contraceptives free of charge.  The section obliges them to supply drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to medical card holders. In addition there would be very considerable difficulty in the enforcement of the necessary controls in the even of contraceptives being supplied free of charge.  That point has been made by a number of Deputies.  Many would argue that while the law should permit contraceptives to be available we could hardly support the formal subsidisation by way of public funds of non-medical contraceptives, items which are relatively cheap.  Another factor is that when I have had to restrict the number of general medical services items available to medical card holders, it would hardly be appropriate to be adding these items to <Col N="489" /> the list.  For instance, such items as Dettol and cottonwool have been removed from the list.  Elastic stockings continue to be available by way of the health boards and public health nurses but not by chemists free of charge to medical card holders. The reason for the restriction in so far as chemists are concerned is that there was appalling abuse of the facility.  That is the main point I would make to Deputy De Rossa in relation to Amendment No 5.  I appreciate that he was anxious to elaborate on the other amendments but I have just heard that they are not regarded as being in order for a variety of reasons, either because they would involve a charge on the Exchequer or because they would involve amending the 1979 Act when we are confined at this stage to the limited purport of this amendment. Consequently, under the rules of the House, I must refrain from commenting on that aspect, and I regret that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I only saw the amendment for the first time this morning and I have had some difficulty in determining the precise purport of it.</P>

      <P>It appears that amendment No. 5 is preventing other Members from raising various points.  Deputy Doyle referred to the possibility of some people being upset by the making available of contraceptives free of charge to medical card-holders.  I would merely make the point that there are people who are upset, for instance, because unmarried mothers receive moneys from the State to help them support their children. Likewise, other people might be upset because of some other payments that are made, so that is hardly an argument against ensuring that those who require family planning facilities, whether for health reasons or in the interest of spacing their families, should be denied that facility simply because they cannot afford it. That is the basis of the amendment.  As I explained earlier none of our amendments is intended to create a crisis either for the Minister or for the House.  They are designed to open up the debate on the wider question of family planning since this has not been the case to any extent in the debate up to now.  I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <P>First, we should get this debate in perspective. Last night the Second Stage of this Bill was passed, given approval in <Col N="492" /> general principle, but it has been misrepresented in my view since then as a victory for the State over outside pressure groups, presumably a reference to the bishops, and as something to do with the unity of this country.  It is very important that today we should stay within the terms of this Bill, which deals with the distribution of contraceptives.  It has nothing to do with victory over anybody and it has nothing to do with the unity of the country.  We are merely discussing the distribution of contraceptives.  I believe we would do justice to the people if we confined ourselves to the terms of reference in the Bill.  I deplore the fact that the Taoiseach went on radio this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 35 and in page 3, lines 1 to 3, to delete the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;either &mdash;</P>
      <P>(ia)  the sale is a sale of contraceptive sheaths or spermicides to a person over the age of 18 years, or'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is concern throughout the country that contraceptives will be freely available to single teenagers as a result of this paragraph.  That concern is not confined only to Members on this side of the House, because many Government Members expressed the same concern.  I could identify with a lot of what was said yesterday by Government backbenchers who pointed out that parents had expressed very genuine concern about the effects of this paragraph.  It is our opinion that confining contraceptives to single 18 year olds cannot, and will not, be possible as a result of this legislation.  This morning I had a phone call from a medical colleague in the midlands who told me he was very concerned, listening to the Minister on radio and on television and reading what he had to say, that even the Minister does not believe that it will be possible to confine the sale of non-medical contraceptives to those over 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated inside and outside this House that this is a limited measure, but this paragraph which will allow the sale of contraceptives to unmarried teenagers is a major departure from the 1979 Family Planning Act.  That Act provided for bona fide family planning in the context of primary health care and family health care and was very much in line with Article 41 of the Constitution, which gives protection to family life.  Nobody can take from the fact that this Bill is a major departure from the 1979 Family Planning Act because it is getting away <Col N="494" /> completely from Article 41 of the Constitution. That is the reality.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister and everybody else in this House if this legislation is for the common good.  If it is, would somebody point out one iota in this legislation which is for the common good, because I cannot see it?  What we are doing is offering contraceptives to single teenagers.  The argument may be put forward that as a result of this legislation girls will not become pregnant, and it is true that a certain number will not become pregnant because contraceptives are freely available, but it is equally true that a larger number of girls will become pregnant because contraceptives are freely available.  I would like to know what consultations the Minister had with anybody about this section.  The Minister quoted liberally the desire of the medical organisations to get away from writing doctors' prescriptions.  I appreciate the medical organisations would not be perturbed about not writing doctors' prescriptions &mdash; we dealt with that on Second Stage and I do not intend to repeat my arguments &mdash; but has the Minister consulted the medical organisations about the effect of making contraceptives freely available to 18 year olds, have the medical organisations ever dealt with that issue at any of their meetings and have they made any decisions on this?</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Griffin read letters which had been sent to members of his party from 17 eminent consultants who expressed very serious concern at the implications of this legislation.  I agree with Deputy Griffin when he said he had to respect their opinion.  I believe if the medical organisations were asked for their view on this issue they would be very much against giving non-medical contraceptives freely to teenagers.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister if he could give one instance which would show that this legislation was for the common good.  I ask him to look at what happened in every other country where they have liberalised contraceptive legislation.  In those countries experience has shown that the numbers of abortions and illegitimate births rose.  In the United Kingdom 20 per cent <Col N="495" /> of births are illegitimate and in Denmark 40 per cent of pregnancies end in abortion. This is an example of liberalised legislation.  I would love somebody to explain why in countries where they have liberal contraceptive laws the rate of illegitimacy and abortions have risen but if we pass this legislation it will prevent girls from becoming pregnant.</P>
    <P>If the Minister removes paragraph (1a) from section 2, effectively we will be back to bona fide family planning and contraceptives will be available for bona fide family planning.  That would meet the wishes of the vast majority of the people. Family planning would be placed fairly and squarely in the context of good family health care.  It would promote the health of couples, and that is what the vast majority of the people want.  I ask the House to support our amendment to delete this paragraph.  No matter what way they vote, the vast, majority of the Members of this House have no doubt that the people want family planning legislation in keeping with the protection of family life and for the good of the people.  That is what the 1979 Health (Family Planning) Act provided.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the comments made by Deputy O'Hanlon. He referred to the Bill as a major departure in relation to the availability of contraceptives to single people.  His amendment is designed to remove the section in the Bill which confines the availability of non-medical contraceptives without prescription to persons over the age of 18 years.  Deputy O'Hanlon used his words very carefully.  He did not say it explicitly, but he tried to give an impression, which he and his colleagues have sought to give throughout this debate, that the 1979 Act confines the availability of contraceptives to married couples.  He went on to suggest that this Bill is a major departure from that.  We should examine what Deputy O'Hanlon said to see if it is accurate.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the wondrous bona fide qualification, it is worth looking at another section in the original legislation to see does it currently confine the availability of contraceptives to married couples and does it prevent young people or single people from acquiring them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in fairness to Deputy Shatter and in case he goes off on the wrong track, I want to say I made it clear throughout this debate that I accept that the 1979 Health (Family Planning) Act refers to couples.  I did not use the term married couples.  I may have used it inadvertently, but I made it clear inside and outside this House that I accept that it refers to couples for the purposes of bona fide family planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we are making some progress with that statement.  In a moment we can investigate exactly what is meant by couples.  Could a couple be a boy and a girl of 14 years of age?  Let us look at section 5 (1) of the Health (Family Planning) Act which has nothing to do with couples.  That section provides that a person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless they are part of his personal luggage accompanying him when he is entering into the State unless their quantity is not such as to indicate that they are not solely for his own use. <Col N="497" /> Under that section a 13, 14 or 15 year old can arrive in Dublin Airport with a sack full of contraceptives, go to a customs officer and declare they are for his own use.  The customs officer cannot refute that, and he goes into the State with his luggage full of contraceptives.  There is no age limit in the 1979 Act for unmarried teenagers, never mind couples.  It is hypocritical and inaccurate to suggest that there is.  It is inaccurate to suggest that this legislation is a major departure from that.</P>
      <P>Somebody may say to me that not all our young people can afford to get on a plane and fly abroad to acquire contraceptives, and not all of them will come through Dublin Airport with their luggage full of contraceptives.  What about our young people who live in Dundalk or in other Border towns?  All they have to do is get in their car, or on their bike, or on a bus and go to Newry and return with as many contraceptives in their pockets as they wish.  If they are challenged all they have to say is that they are going to use them.  Is anybody suggesting that our young people in Dundalk or in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency are any more corrupt or sexually rampant than our young people anywhere else?  There is an implicit inherent hypocrisy about this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that this Bill is a new departure is a nonsense.  I am not saying I want to see 13 or 14 year olds engaged in sexual relations and having to use contraceptives.  Of course none of us wants to create that sort of moral climate.  It is a reality and it is happening in some part of the country at the moment.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with my colleague Deputy Doyle that tackling that problem is not concerned with a spurious provision in an irrelevant Act that tries to pretend we are confining the availability of contraceptives to persons over 18 years of age.  Tackling that problem is concerned with educating our young people for relationships, with parental responsibility and with the type of society we create and the moral values we give to them. The availability or not of contraceptives will not affect that.</P>
      <P>This amendment is hypocritical.  In a sense it is seeking to pretend to the public that an Act currently embodied in our law, and which will remain as part of our law, and which was conceived and legislated for by the current leader of the Opposition when he was Minister for Health, confines the availability of non-medical contraceptives to persons over the age of 18 years or to married couples. If you want to get contraceptives in Newry you do not need a prescription or an authorisation.  You simply go there, purchase them and come back again.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Hanlon is saying his amendment confines the availability of contraceptives to couples who get a prescription for bona fide family planning reasons, I am saying the existing legislation does not do that and never did that. A pretence was made in this House by the Government of the day in 1979 that it did that.  I find it astonishing that the members of the Opposition should proceed with that pretence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That takes us to exactly what the Opposition are about with the proposed amendment.  I dealt with the possibilities of importing contraceptives whenever one liked, without prescription, without having to qualify under this odd bona fide family planning terminology.  What <Col N="499" /> Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment seeks to do is to remove the Minister's provision confining the availability of non-medical contraceptives without prescription to persons over 18 years of age, and simply return to the formula that with regard to even these non-medical contraceptives, if made available, under the relevant section of the 1979 Act, section 4 (b) (ii), a person supplying these contraceptives or selling them must be assured that they are sought &ldquo;for the purpose, bona fide, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances and the prescription or authorisation bears an indication that it is given for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What does all that mean?  Does anybody know?  Does Deputy O'Hanlon know?  Does Deputy Haughey know, who enacted the matter?  Of course, nobody knows.  What do &ldquo;bona fide, of family planning&rdquo;, or &ldquo;or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances&rdquo; mean?  What are appropriate circumstances?  Is the chemist to be satisfied that these will be used by a couple in the bed, or in the garden?  Do they have to use them within the State or is it permissible to go on a package holiday to Gran Canaria?  Are those appropriate circumstances?  What does &ldquo;bona fide, of family planning&rdquo; mean?  It does not say bona fide family planning.  The nuance created or suggested was that this means married couples.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the constitutional protection of the family.  He said that Article 41 of the Constitution gives protection to family life.  In what way is the protection of family life given by Article 41 of the Constitution affected one way or the other by retaining the &ldquo;bona fide family planning or adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances&rdquo; formula?</P>
    <P>We made an advance this morning. Deputy O'Hanlon has admitted that his party recognise that contraceptives, first, should be made available to couples &mdash; presumably couples include married couples. None of us here would disagree with that.  Who else qualify in the category of <Col N="500" /> couples?  Are a boy and girl of 19 living together a couple who are entitled, within the context of this formula, to acquire contraceptives?  Could Deputy O'Hanlon explain that to us?  Are a boy and girl of 17 living together a couple &mdash; a boy and girl of 17 having a sexual liaison which all of us in this House would condemn on moral grounds, which should not happen, but which is happening on occasions in this country and it is a fact of our life &mdash; are they a couple who can for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances acquire contraceptives?  Can a couple of 40 years of age, unmarried, living together, acquire contraceptives? In what way is allowing them to acquire contraceptives under this provision in any way relevant to the protection of family life under the Constitution?</P>
    <P>The thing becomes even more esoteric. Sometimes we are confused as to who are couples in this country.  What is the position, for example, of a couple whose marriage has broken down and one of whom has obtained a Church annulment, who has been remarried invalidly in Church and the person who obtains the Church annulment and remarries comes to a doctor to acquire contraceptives? Which couple are the contraceptives prescribed for?  Are they prescribed for the civil marriage, the first marriage which the State still recognises, or the second marriage which the Church recognises? Take a marriage which has broken down and the husband and wife co-operate with each other &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon is familiar with this in his work on the marital committee &mdash; and go to Haiti or the Dominican Republic and get an invalid foreign decree of divorce and one remarries. The remarried spouse is living in Ireland with husband or wife number two.  Who are the couple under this formula for bona fide family planning reasons?</P>
    <P>The problem is that Deputy O'Hanlon and members of his party know that the current provisions in the 1979 Act were phrased in such a way as to make them completely impossible to interpret, in such a way as to apply to anybody and <Col N="501" /> everybody who may wish to acquire contraceptives.</P>

This is the first occasion, this morning, in this House on which I have heard any member of Fianna Fáil finally admit that, in the context of this legislation, the 1979 Act never sought to and never did confine availability of contraceptives to married couples.  Deputy O'Hanlon tells us that it confines them to couples, but how do you qualify as being a couple, if you are not a married couple, with all the legal problems and securities which can arise? Do you qualify as a couple after you have lived together for a week, a month, six months, a year?  Is there a definition of couple?  The Act does not say that.  Nothing in the Act says that contraceptives are confined to couples.  The point I am making is effectively, that Deputy O'Hanlon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out that the existing legislation does not have the effect which Deputy O'Hanlon suggests it has.  I am replying direct to points which he made in his opening comments, of which I was very careful to take a note.</P>
      <P>That leaves us in a position where this House could accept Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment and leave the legislation as it was under the 1979 Act.  It could leave this rather interesting formula of that Act there, so that we could all pretend as to what it really says when we know that it does not say what Deputy O'Hanlon would like it to mean.  There is nothing in that Act which uses the words &ldquo;contraceptives should be made available to couples&rdquo;.  It would be very simple if it said that, but it does not.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon made other comments and, in particular, referred to the making available of contraceptives to single teenagers.  I presume that his main objection to the legislation is that although it is all right if they are made available to single people above the age of 20 years his main objection is to their being made available to people under 20 who are teenagers.  I have already dealt with the point that the existing legislation does that, anyway.  This new legislation does not do anything new.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the fact that some single teenagers become pregnant is not a matter which should become of particular relevance in this debate.</P>

      <P>I think that it would be agreed that a number of teenager girls do become pregnant.  What are the numbers? Has anyone looked at this?  Instead of talking about statistics relating to Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands or Timbuktu, what is the Irish situation? The Irish situation for young teenage girls is well referred to in the Medico-Social Research Board Annual Report of 1983, page 60.  They refer to:</P>
      <P>A study of selected characteristics of women who had an illegitimate birth in Ireland in 1983.</P>
      <P>This refers to children born to girls and women who are unmarried.  The following is the quotation:</P>
      <P>The number of illegitimate births in Ireland increased from 1,843 in 1971 to 3,911 in 1981, an increase of 112 per cent in comparison with a 7 per cent increase in total births for the same period.  In 1981 illegitimate births comprised 5.4 per cent of all births contrast to 2.7 per cent ten years before. Thirty-three per cent of illegitimate births were to women under the age of 20 in 1971 whereas the percentage in 1981 had risen to 38 per cent.  Seventy-nine per cent of illegitimate births in 1981 were to women aged under 25 years.</P>
      <P>That happened at a time when the Bill before us was not being considered.  It is when I consider those statistics that I agree with Deputy Fennell, who said that the legislation is about women.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as if the making available of contraceptives will result in more young girls becoming pregnant is arrant nonsense, and the Deputy is aware of that.  The Deputy should stop ignoring the realities of Irish life and stop pretending that he has some form of extrasensory perception which will predict that because contraceptives are made available by this minor amendment to the legislation, young people who want to obtain them without prescription will not have to go to the North, fly to England or get them in family planning clinics, more illegitimate births will occur.  That is nonsense.  The Deputy is probably right in saying that unless we tackle this area in years to come there will be more births of children outside marrige.  That has to do with the fact that until recent months the State has failed to face up to the real social problems in this area and tackle <Col N="505" /> them at the educational level.  The amendment tabled by Deputy O'Hanlon is just another example of the cant and hypocrisy of the Fianna Fáil Party in being unwilling to come clean on what the reality of existing legislation is and to deal with that reality.  I find it astonishing that they should seek to maintain the pretence embodied in the 1979 Act.</P>

      <P>All Members &mdash; I assume I can count Deputy Dowling among them &mdash; have a vision of what we think family life is about here.  We visualise the parents looking after the interests and needs of their offspring until they reach a certain age.  Parents do not always succeed, because of influences on the children from without.  We are introducing legislation which affects that fundamental position which is enshrined in our Constitution.  We all concede that parents are the primary educators.  Our educational system only allows for qualified teachers being <i>in loco parentis</i> for a part <Col N="506" /> of the day in respect of academic and other subject.  We are dealing with matters, purely philosophically, affecting the upbringing of those children.</P>
      <P>If the Minister accepts that I should like to ask him if he has consulted with parents.  Is he convinced that he is acting on their behalf in allowing for a situation which Deputy Shatter has referred to, one which has got out of control but which he wants to legalise and make easy?  Is he convinced he is acting on their behalf in making available from now on over the shop counter contraceptives? Deputy Shatter told us that like Deputy Fennell he is concerned that too many women are left in the position when men will not face up to their responsibilities. What about the girl of 16 left with the responsibility of a guy of 18 using these contraceptives on her and a whole queue of them using them on her?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing fanciful about that.  It is not as fanciful as the fragile child of 13 importing a load of contraceptives through Dublin airport.  I am putting the facts.  Deputy Shatter is a legal man and I concede he is qualified in matters referring to legal trivalities for which people can get well paid in another arena, but in the matter of young people I would not concede that to him.  I have spent more time with young people than he as a teacher for 20 years.  As a teacher I had dealings with boys and girls up to the age of 18 and I know what happens. Under the legislation we are putting pressure on young girls.  It will be noted that parents who have sons only are not as concerned in regard to this as those who have daughters, because they realise that the women for whom Deputy Shatter has expressed concern are the sufferers in this.  Nobody can deny that under the legislation these will be easily available. Deputy Shatter knows that in the nature of things a boy of 18 or 19 relates to a girl of 16 or 17.  I ask Deputies Griffin, Dowling, Doyle, Bell and Conlon if they accept that from what they know of the <Col N="507" /> facts of life.  They must accept it and that is what they are agreeing to.  They may agree to this because of the political pressures on them, and I can understand that in the House there are certain political pressures.</P>

      <P>I do not want to alienate support over there for this amendment by saying I know I would not have the support of Deputy Shatter.  He and I move in different directions, and that is what this House is about.  But I know there are many others over there with whom I can relate.  I know there are many over there who share the ideal I have even though there is no guarantee of its being attainable.  Because something has crept in, without welcome, into our way of life, because it is fundamentally wrong, we reject it.  Deputy Shatter does not; that is his outlook, his ideology, his upbringing, it is not mine.  Even though I find it as difficult as anybody else I continue to have the ideal of what is the good thing.  I repeat that there is nothing in this that leads to the common good. There is nothing in it that answers the wishes of the good parents of Ireland.  In Heaven's name let us forget whatever political pressures may have been put on us in respect of this Bill.  Let us salvage the one really important treasure from it by having removed from it the dangers that exists to the whole lifestyle of the people of Ireland that will inevitably ensue if this amendment is not accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I find myself in almost total agreement with Deputy Shatter.  I should say to Deputy O'Hanlon that 30 years ago, aged 18, I went to London to work.  I went into a barber's shop to have my hair cut and the barber offered me a handful of contraceptives. I bought them.  The reason I bought them was that I thought they were shampoos.  Thirty years later my son, aged 15, was with me in Blackpool.  I said to him: Do you see all those things on the shelf?  Do you know what they are? He replied: &ldquo;You are codding me, dad.  I have a pocketful here for all my friends&rdquo;. That effectively demonstrates the difference between what happened 30 years ago and what is happening now.  Young people are not the kinds of fools we were when we took the Holyhead/Euston trip seeking employment in London, not knowing very much about the facts of life.</P>
      <P>This amendment, rather than solving problems, would create many more.  I am subject to correction by the Opposition spokesman but, as I read the amendment, it would mean that rather than producing one's birth certificate in a chemist shop or health centre one would have to produce one's marriage certificate. It would be rather difficult to go into a chemist shop or health centre and prove whether or not one was married unless one produced a certificate.  Experience to date in the sale of alcohol is typical of this.  We must accept that it will not be possible in the majority of cases to control the sale of contraceptives to people of 18 years of age and over.  It will be like the sale of alcohol &mdash; if one is big enough, one is old enough, and no matter what age limit might be set it would not make much difference.  We are not being very practical.  To impose more restrictions on married couples as against single people would be rather ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give an example of what I <Col N="509" /> mean and I am sure Deputy O'Hanlon, being a medical doctor, will appreciate this.  A relative of mine, around the age of 18, was in the process of getting married recently.  A number of weeks before the marriage she went to a doctor and told him she did not want to become pregnant, that she wanted to go on the pill.  The doctor gave her a prescription for the pill. I understood that prescriptions for that type of contraceptive would be issued on the basis of its being a corrective measure for an unmarried person.  But there a prospective married person walked into a doctor with no apparent medical defect, was issued with a prescription for the pill and left on honeymoon several weeks later.  That girl was not examined by the doctor to establish what would be the side effects of her taking that pill.  I know that a number of my relatives who have been on the pill have suffered a number of very serious side effects.  I am sure Deputy O'Hanlon would agree with me that, from a medical point of view people who do not necessarily have to get the pill for contraceptive purposes should use the condom.  To contend that single girls are not given the pill for the purpose of contraception is not correct, because I know a number of cases to the contrary. I do not know what happens in Carrick-macross but I do know what happens in Drogheda and Dundalk.  I do not know whether that would be in conformity with best medical ethics.</P>
    <P>I know of other similar cases and to sweep them under the carpet shows us as being naive.  There is no doubt in my mind that yesterday, had we been holding a secret ballot, the vote in favour would have been approximately 85 per cent. This shows up the hypocrisy, that in this Chamber one hears Deputies say one thing while in the bar they say something different.  I think there is a very small percentage only of the total membership of the House &mdash; and I say this respectfully &mdash; who will not admit privately that it is a reasonable Bill.  This flabbergasts me.  I heard a Member of the Opposition in the bar expressing agreement with the Bill yet he came into the Chamber half an hour later and spoke against it.  I cannot <Col N="510" /> understand that type of Irish hypocrisy at all.</P>

      <P>I also live in a Border consituency. Therefore, like Deputy O'Hanlon, I can speak with first hand knowledge about the situation in relation to this subject.  There is no doubt in my mind that young people of any age can travel to Newry, to travel to Newry, purchase contraceptives of one form or another and that there are no restrictions whatsoever imposed.  I would not expect somebody from Cork to take a bus to Newry to buy a package of condoms, but it does happen in Border constituencies. I know that this happens on a daily and weekly basis, and Deputy O'Hanlon must be aware of this also.  I am familiar with a number of areas in his constituency. Anyhow, that is the situation in County Louth.  I do not think this amendment will alter that situation one iota. Indeed, this amendment in its present form, rather than improve the situation, would worsen it.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister <Col N="511" /> a question.  Listening to him last night, I got the impression that he would not agree to any amendments.  Has the Minister a closed mind in regard to amendments or is he prepared to listen to both sides of the House?  Serious suggestions will be made by concerned people and I hope that the Minister has not his mind made up that he will not agree to any amendments.  If something reasonable or helpful comes from any side of the House, will he accept them and make amendments if he feels that the rift which exists can be improved?  In some ways he has caused this rift, although maybe we have all contributed to it, but it might be helpful to decide to be helpful rather than to have closed minds.</P>

      <P>Listening to some of the contributions from the Opposition, one would imagine that single persons do not have sex, never give birth to children or never suffer from sexually transmitted diseases in the Republic of Ireland. Deputy Tunney asked about the 18 year old who uses a contraceptive in the company of a 16 year old.  The first thing to be said is that is not illegal.  Is it not more likely in the event of that happening that, if no contraceptive is used, there is a greater danger of pregnancy?  The condom has a 9.6 per cent failure rate according to the World Health Organisation but, if no contraceptive is used, one can see how the risk of pregnancy increases.</P>
      <P>In this country, if I may use the pejorative classification, the normal illegitimate birth is the result of a boy and a girl having regular intercourse.  Most of them do not use contraceptives, only 16 per cent, and, ironically, lest we blame the publicans, generally speaking alcohol is not involved.  Furthermore, conception tends to happen in one or other of the parents' home.  However, the closed obscurantism which characterised some contributions in this debate does not accept that in health care or public health policy, we must cater for that kind of situation and mitigate its worst effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> As I said last night.  I am not an advocate of contraception.  I do not, as a matter of Departmental or political policy, wish to pressurise anyone into using contraceptives, whether young, old, married, single or middle aged.  I am simply obliged, under the legal statutory entitlement, to bring something outside the criminal law.  It has nothing to do with morality, and legislators should be able to see the difference.  After three days of debate we still cannot distinguish between the criminal law, the moral law, norms of behaviour and sociological reality.  I am appalled that a medical doctor should use pejorative terms in saying that I advocate teenage sex.</P>

Deputy Tunney and all the Deputies over there voted for it when they gave the legal right to every unmarried person to go across the Border or to send away on the back of an envelope for contraceptives.  That is covered in the 1979 Act and is not illegal.  Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Health, conveyed to this House that an unmarried person can send off for and purchase contraceptives from outside the State, but of course they were legally prohibited from purchasing them within the State.

      <P>I will now deal with the point raised by Deputy Tunney.  The great excitement about this Bill ignored one very fundamental issue, and the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Hanlon highlights it in a grave way.  Our courts, maternity hospitals and clinics are very aware of the fact that young people, be they married or unmarried, are in urgent need of information, guidance and strong support in relation to what they will face from the age of 14 upwards when they reach the beginning of teenage maturity <Col N="514" /> until they reach adult maturity at around 18 years of age.  They need information regarding personal relationships.  In the unitary single sex educational system in which I was reared, with profound respect to Deputy Tunney who is a teacher, how I emerged from that as a balanced person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not indulge in abuse.  I am making an observation. Young people need a great deal of information and support in relation to social relationships and in terms of the psychiatric illnesses which are hitting them today.  They need support in terms of the psychological pressures they are put under.  They need a sense of personal responsibility on issues relating to violence &mdash; violence against the person, respect for the elderly and respect for women in our society where there is rampant disrespect at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They need a sense of personal responsibility in relation to respect for women and the capacity of a male to create a pregnancy casually and experimentally and disappear into the night leaving her alone, be she 15, 16 or 17 years of age.  That is the kind of issue this House should be discussing and trying to ameliorate.  The Department should be spending millions of pounds on that and not on hassle with Mickey Mouse adjustments to health board budgets, whether they are £1 million up or down. That is the kind of issue which we run away from because we are hung up on moralistic, legalistic and statutory control of people's lives.  We cannot do that but like the Ayotallahs of politics we purport to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to contraception it is like a person who is jarring and has a whiskey and soda.  Then he has a brandy and a soda, then a gin and soda and then blames alcoholism on soda.  It is the same with contraception.  Every known disease <Col N="515" /> inflicted on humanity is attributed to contraceptives by those who object to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that, although there is general availability of contraceptives in Northern Ireland, we have a higher rate of abortion.  What are we trying to prove?  Take, for example, to use that entirely inappropriate term, the illegitimacy rate in Northern Ireland: it is 6.45 per cent per 1,000 women aged 16 to 44 years and in the Republic it is 7.6 per cent.  We cannot blame contraception for that.  The illegitimacy rate in Ireland is higher than that in West Germany, Italy and other countries where there is widespread contraception.  What are we taking about?  Look at the abortion rate. The Irish abortion rate is about 15 per cent to 20 per cent lower than that of Germany and the Netherlands.  Is that because Germany has general availability of contraception and we pretend that we do not have and want to legalise it out of existence?</P>
      <P>With profound respect to Deputy O'Hanlon, I submit that to lay at the door of contraception and one's legal entitlement to buy a packet of condoms, venereal disease, abortion, promiscuity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;illegitimacy is a perversion of any statistical data available in my Department or from the World Health Organisation.  I have spent two and a half years looking at all statistical data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on the other side of the House have swallowed some awful propaganda in relation to contraception because people are morally opposed to contraception.  I accept that the Catholic Church &mdash; not all members of it or bishops but certain strong elements within it &mdash; are opposed to contraception.  They regard its use as intrinsically immoral. Fair enough.  That is a religious belief and must be entirely respected.  Catholics are <Col N="516" /> ordained by their Church to obey that moral belief.  That is their privilege and human right, but to suggest that because that moral belief is in existence automatically all other human ills must be encompassed within that belief is a travesty of sexuality and shows an obsessive preoccupation with issues relating to sexuality and an attempt to tie them into a moral framework on a statistical basis which does not exist.  Every time a Deputy says we are allowing a single person reaching adulthood to avail of contraception, which they have a legal right to do if they so wish, there is hysteria which makes a travesty of parliamentary discussion.  This was attempted again this morning.  Deputies should get off that jag.  There are nearly 500 married couples who are under the age of 18 and I have to say to them they must still go to their general practitioner.  About 90 young men under the age of 18 and 380 women under 18 are married.  They are caught by the rigours of this legislation, of the so-called permissiveness I am alleged to be introducing.</P>
    <P>There are 31,000 women in the 18 age group and there are 32,455 young men in that age group also.  If I were one of them I would be irate at the presumptions and the assumptions of promiscuity and of a rampant preoccupation on their part with sex and of the middle-aged politicians  in this House saying to them, &ldquo;No way&rdquo;.  Could we, in God's name, grow up as legislators and parents?  All of us have to shed in a responsible way some of our appalling sexual misconceptions. There are people in psychiatric hospitals who are there because of our obsessive misconceptions in relation to sexual practice. As Minister for Health I am not going to put any more in there by imposing legal prohibitions that are repressive and do not exist in any other country in the world except, as Deputy O'Malley graphically pointed out, in Iran and Pakistan.</P>

      <P>I believe so.  I am in <Col N="517" /> acute embarrassment because I am going to Iran in about four weeks time to return the visit here of their Minister for Health. I will have to explain to him about the exigencies of Irish law and that what I said here was not meant offensively to him.  As a civilised man I am quite sure he will appreciate my predicament.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked if I had consulted the medical profession regarding the age limit of 18 years.  It is time I put on record formally the statement from the Irish College of General Practitioners by a very responsible GP, Dr. Michael Boland of Skibbereen, as chairman of the Irish College of General Practitioners.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 14 February they called for a change in existing family planning legislation.  The statement said that the existing system of making non-medical contraceptives available on prescription was &ldquo;neither practical or necessary&rdquo;. This statement was issued by the chairman of the ICGP after consultation with members of the organisation's council, and it stated:</P>
      <P>The Irish College of General Practitioners welcomes any change in present legislation which requires general practitioners to control, by doctors' prescription, the availability of forms of contraception which are not intrinsically medical.</P>
      <P>The availability of substances or appliances should only be limited by medical prescription where an unacceptable health risk to the general public would otherwise result.  If, for moral reasons, it is desirable to restrict the availability of non-medical contraceptives then some means, other than medical prescription, should be found for doing so.</P>
      <P>Doctors, in common with all other sectors of Irish society, are divided on moral issues.  They should not be asked, therefore, to act as guardians of public morality.</P>
      <P>However, the Irish College of General Practitioners reiterates its view that individual contraception and family planning advice is best given as part of an intergrated personal care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> I agree with that statement.  There seems to be a presumption in the House that overnight every young woman in the country will be running into a chemist shop or health board clinic and running out with contraceptives.  That is a travesty of contraceptive and family planning practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A woman will not normally avail of contraceptive advice and guidance without generally going to her GP.  Under the 1979 Act &mdash; and this is still retained &mdash; medical contraceptives come under the dispensation of drugs legislation except for spermicides.  Of course women will go to their doctors and seek advice and guidance.  As Deputy O'Hanlon knows, some women of 16 and 17 years will be treated in terms of cycle regulations.  The law does not prevent that, nor would we dare to purport to prevent it.  In this section we are talking about condoms which are non-medical.  I do not know why the House has got itself into such a hysterical tizzy about that matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to consultation which was referred to by Deputy O'Hanlon I will quote Dr. Aidan Meade who is chairman of the Ethics Committee of the Irish Medical Organisation.  He said:</P>
      <P>I think the attitude of the organisation will be one of relief, as doctors do not particularly want to be involved in having to prescribe non-medical contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Power, the penalties under the 1979 Act are quite rigorous for anyone selling contraceptives to people under 18 years.  It is quite different from a publican who knowingly serves drink to a young person.  The actual selling is illegal and the onus devolves on the people in the limited number of outlets.  There is no excuse, they cannot say they did not know.  Anyone can be brought before the law for the very fact of selling contraceptives to people under 18 years and it will be up to the person concerned to make <Col N="519" /> quite sure that the people who ask for contraceptives are over the age of 18 years.  The penalties for illegal sales are clear cut, and they can be invoked by any Deputy or citizen in terms of complaint. The penalties are draconian and they should allay the fears of any Deputy or parent.  Section 13 of the 1979 Act provides that on the first offence on summary convinction there shall be a fine of up to £500 or imprisonment up to six months or more.  This was introduced by Deputy Haughey.  It is so draconian that when I was examining the legislation I said there was no need to increase the penalties. The penalties are very stiff.  For a second or subsequent offence on indictment the penalty is a fine of £5,000 and for a continuing offence £250 a day or imprisonment up to 12 months or both fine and imprisonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Other countries knock their hands off.  We have very tough penalties, and rejection of this section by the House would negate all aspects of this Bill.  Considering that this House decided as a matter of public policy only a couple of weeks ago that 18 should be the age at which independent decision making was devolved in respect of all areas of life.  I find it incredible that the Opposition should regard this minor aspect as being wholly inconsistent with public policy generally.  Some Deputies are talking about 21 years of age.  Where do we stop if we start on that road?  If the intention of change was to reduce the risk of purchase by adolescents then there is no evidence that a 21 years old limit or any reasonable age limit would necessarily be any more enforceable than 18 years of age or than the existing bona fide family planning requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Hanlon. I conclude by saying that what we are trying to do in this Bill is the exact opposite of what we are being accused of doing.  Deputy Hussey as Minister for <Col N="520" /> Education, to her eternal credit has faced courageously up to the question of sex education in terms of the educational system, and I have given formal authority to the Health Education Bureau to do some work in this area and I have increased their budget from £1.25 million to £1.75 million in 1985, an increase of £0.5 million, 40 per cent.  We are in a situation of shame and we see in our daily newspapers that that situation involves 18 years old young women and 18 year old young men.  Equally I have tried to give some protection to married women and 18 year old women who are raped.  I am the first Minister for Health to provide moneys for and to direct my senior officers in the Department to become involved in, for example, the Rotunda Hospital to open up in this country for the first time a sexual assault treatment unit with a professional staff.  I am providing £30,000 for that exercise in 1985.  I am the first Minister for Health in this country to authorise research into, and I have provided £20,000 for this, the incidence of incest which affects 16 year olds, 12 year olds, 10 year olds and many young people, but we have kept that too under the carpet.  In this country those things do not happen.  If they are going to happen they are not permitted to happen and if they are not permitted to happen they cannot happen.  However, they happen.  I have been assailed for trying to do something about that.  I assure this House that it is not just an obsessive preoccupation with contraception.  I wish to God we could settle down, get this Bill through the House at 5 p.m. today and resume our normal, happy social relationship one with the other.  Dick Walsh, political correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i> said, &ldquo;It looks as though they are making a show of themselves&rdquo;. Asked again he said &ldquo;No, they are making a holy show of themselves&rdquo;.  Let us not do that.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can prove to us that anything that he is bringing before this House is to be of any benefit to family life and to the children, then we will gladly accept that.  However, this is an attack on family life.  The family is the basic unit of society.  We have today an example of what is happening.  With vandalism in this city you can put all the gardaí you like on the streets and you can have the Criminal Justice Bill or any other Bill you want to bring in, but when you hit at the basic unit of society, the family, then society as a whole collapses. This is another attack on family life and the family generally.  If the Minister thinks that introducing this legislation to make condoms and contraceptives available to young people will help the family and help parents to have their children raised and brought up in the standards which kept the family unit tight and solid, if he thinks he is doing anything for them in this legislation, then I am afraid he is away in cloud cuckoo land.  The fact that we have more illegitimate births year by year and the other various things that the Minister quotes does not justify what he is doing now.  People call us on this side of the House hypocrites.  We on this side of the House stand for the family unit and the protection of the family and, therefore, I am glad to be called a hypocrite by Deputy Shatter and other people on that side.  They can keep on calling us hypocrites because we stand for the protection of the family and family life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a part of the country from which in the past there was a great deal of emigration.  At one time our people working in Scotland and in England had to live in accommodation in which there was often overcrowding and very little possibility of adequate separate accommodation, but as a result of the moral standards with which our people had been reared there were very few cases of illegitimate births among them.  We should be emphasising the matter of discipline.  People should be taught to discipline themselves.  Instead, discipline has gone from the home and it is going from the schools.  The Minister <Col N="524" /> for Education would be better occupied concentrating on the question of proper discipline in schools instead of concentrating on teaching children about matters of sex.  When discipline disappears from the home and from the schools the effects are experienced throughout society, and that is what is happening today.  People are being geared to follow their natural instincts with no mention of discipline.  The introduction of this legislation will allow the availability of contraceptives to teenagers.  We would be naive to think that these devices will not be passed on to young teenagers.  I shudder to think of what we are doing to our young people by way of this legislation.</P>
      <P>We are not doing anything for the family by way of this Bill though we must accept that the family unit is the basic unit in society.  When we break up family life we bring about a breakdown in society, and it is because this is happening that there is so much vandalism not only in the cities but throughout the country. I support Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment. I consider it a reasonable amendment and one that should be accepted by anyone who has at heart the good of the country and of the family unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>To a large extent I sympathise with the idealistic, stylised concept of family life and <i>mores</i> indicated by Deputy Gallagher.  He spoke of his hopes, his ideas and his wishes.  But the problem is that we are not concerned here with what Deputy Gallagher hopes for; we are concerned with the realities and the practicalities of life in Ireland in 1985.</P>
      <P>We must learn from the experiences of preceding years and take into account what is likely to be the case in the decades ahead.  Unfortunately, and I use that word advisedly, the situation will not accord in the future with the hopes expressed by Deputy Gallagher.  We cannot organise our legal system or our arrangements for the people on the basis of pious hopes, however admirable those hopes might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment were to be adopted the law would be <Col N="525" /> saying to 18 years olds: &ldquo;we, the Legislature, allow you to have sexual relations. That is perfectly acceptable and legal&rdquo;. Then we would be going on to say that &ldquo;while it is acceptable for you to associate sexually you may not take protective measures to ensure that unwanted pregnancies do not occur as a result of indulging in that sexual activity which we allow you legally to indulge in&rdquo;.  Surely that kind of legal system would be a nonsense and could not in all reason be accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher argues with the Minister as to the extent of sexual activity among young people.  I have not heard the Minister at any time suggest what Deputy Gallagher says he suggested, but there is no doubt that sexual activity occurs on an appreciable scale among young adults in our community.  We are aware that 10 million contraceptive devices are used in the country each year. That fact speaks for itself, but we must face up to it and plan for it accordingly.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a letter from a number of consultants.  Deputy Griffin referred to that letter, as also did Deputy O'Hanlon.  Apparently these consultants are saying that condoms should not be made available readily.  No doubt we could find 20 consultants who would say the opposite.  I am sure we could find shopkeepers who are for the Bill and shopkeepers who are against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that other consultants have not refuted what is being said by the consultants who signed the letter.  Certainly no other consultants have contacted me on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been refuted by a number of consultants.  I have been lobbied by eminent consultants and gynaecologists in the city on this subject, so let us not assume that the 13 consultants who communicated with Deputy Griffin are in a monopoly situation or that they are representing anything but their own sincerely held views.  I accept that their views are sincere but I would say that there are consultants in greater numbers who hold a contrary view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is talk as to what the views of <Col N="526" /> the people would be in regard to overwhelming majorities and so on, but I should like to refer in some greater detail to the survey undertaken by the Health Education Bureau and to which the Minister referred briefly in his opening speech at Second Stage.  That report is concerned directly with the points in Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment and it contains some interesting reading and analyses.  It was published in March 1984 and was commissioned by Irish Marketing Surveys Limited.  The survey was based on a sample of 689 adults.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A huge number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These were adults between the ages of 18 and 50.  The interviewing was conducted at 16 locations throughout the country.  The survey showed that seven out of ten people identified themselves in favour of the general availability of contraceptives with an age constraint.  One-quarter of the total sample favoured the concept of contraceptives being available only to married couples.</P>
      <P>The survey went on to deal with the definitive options on age limits.  It showed that four out of every ten consulted felt it was not appropriate to set any lower age limit whatsoever.  A further one-fifth of the total sample prescribed an age limit of less than 18 years and 23 per cent opted for 18 years as an appropriate age limit while the remainder nominated age limits at a higher level.  In overall terms it amounts to this: six out of every ten adults in the age span covered by the survey, that is, 18 to 50 years, felt either that there should be no age limit or that an age limit of less than 18 years should be imposed.  That is a very powerful indicator if one accepts that survey, which was independently commissioned and objectively carried out.  This is a very firm base of support for the parameters set by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept is put abroad, and I heard it enunciated yet again in this House this morning &mdash; it is a most remarkable proposition &mdash; that the more condoms are made available the greater will be the resulting <Col N="527" /> illegitimacies in the community and the greater will be the transmission of sexual diseases in the community.  As a proposition that is arrant nonsense and a complete negation of the facts.  If condoms are used their object, which is 90 per cent successful, is the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and their secondary factor is the prevention of the transmission of sexual diseases.  The idea that young people are just waiting for the availability of condoms to indulge in sexual activity is not the fact.  Sexual activity is taking place using the ten million condoms that are available, and the purport and net effect of the Bill, and this section in particular, will not increase the usage of condoms but will merely legalise the present situation which is widespread, and will prevent this part of the legal system, beginning with the 1935 Act to the 1979 Act, continuing in a state of complete and utter disrepute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment because I believe the provisions in the 1979 Act are adequate.  Three polls conducted in December 1983, August 1984 and February 1985 showed that on average 60 per cent of the people were satisfied with the present contraceptive laws.  This morning we heard from various speakers, but particularly from the Minister, a lecture on how we as legislators are out of touch with reality. I fail to understand how he can make such a generalisation.  He has spoken very professionally and told this House that these are minor changes.  He referred to but did not quote section 5 of the 1979 Act regarding the opportunity under that Act for people to procure and import contraceptive devices in the State by sending outside the State for them or by going outside the State to procure them. I would like to quote section 5 of that Act:</P>
      <P>(1)  A person shall not import contraceptives into the State unless&mdash;</P>

I may not have as much education as Deputy Shatter but I understood bona fide to mean in good faith.  The 1979 Act respects the trust and confidence of the normal natural couple in a married partnership.  On the production of a single medical prescription it is possible for these people to procure the necessary contraceptive devices.  The bona fide situation as far as we are concerned would transfer to either of those partners moving in to another relationship and obtaining those devices.</P>

That will be proven conclusively on another occasion.  The Minister talked about how we emerged from this terrible system of education and family life and wondered how we survived.  Surely that is a suggestion that there is something wrong with our educational system and family life.  This is a total attack on normal natural family life. It is promoting, as if it is the natural thing to do, the use of contraceptive devices by single, young, innocent teenagers.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Tunney is in the House.  He said earlier that some Members on this side of the House voted for the Bill last night because of political pressure.  I was a short time in this House when an issue came before us about which I felt deeply.  I walked through the lobbies with Members of the Opposition. I walked in partnership with Deputy O'Hanlon, if he remembers.  That was a painful experience which Members on the other side of the House are not allowed to have.  If I felt as strongly about this issue as I did about that issue I would take the same course of action.  One of the main factors which helped me to decide how I would vote was an interpretation I got of the 1979 Bill.  An interpreter is needed because the terminology is so loose.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tunney talked about things creeping into our society which are not welcome.  I am sad to say that they crept in a long time ago.  Over the past 15 years I have been saddened to see the behaviour of young people <Col N="532" /> in their human relationships.  They have behaved in an irresponsible fashion.  I am also saddened by infidelity within marriage. I would do anything I could to promote a better way of life for our young and for our married people.  We must face the facts and have the courage to do something.  If we accept Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment we are sweeping the problem under the carpet again and not facing up to it honestly.  In supporting the Government last night I had to be honest with myself and with the young people of Ireland.  When this Bill is passed at 5 o'clock today, for the first time in a long time we will have faced up honestly to the problems before us.</P>

      <P>Even before the Minister sat down to prepare this legislation it was obvious to everyone that contraceptives would be freely available as a result of this Bill.  I challenge anybody to contradict what I am saying.  Fine Gael felt that they should not be freely available to young people. There had to be a compromise then to get the Bill before the House.  This is where all the confusion has arisen. Neither the members of the Fine Gael nor the Labour Parties could contradict the statements made by one of their members.  There was complete confusion among them.  To get this Bill through the House there had to be a compromise.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the same courtesy from others.  One side are saying that contraceptives are not freely available and the other side are saying that they are. <Col N="533" /> Deputy Shatter in his contribution this morning talked about a young person of 18 arriving at Dublin Airport with a bag full of contraceptives.  As soon as this Bill is enacted any young person can walk into chemist shops and fill a bag with contraceptives to be distributed to 13 year olds.  Contraceptives are freely available to everybody, and I challenge anyone to prove otherwise.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's position as he stands in the middle of all this confusion trying to defend the compromise that was made.  The Minister said that our young people are riddled with problems. We as legislators should direct our efforts towards helping them.  People are being mugged in their homes, cars are being hijacked and we cannot cope, with it. Because we cannot cope, is the answer to legalise it?</P>
      <P>I was at a youth exhibition in Cork last Sunday.  Young Fine Gael, Ógra Fianna Fáil and many other youth groups exhibited their work there.  I made a point of not mentioning this Bill to see if some young person would question me about it.  I talked to maybe 100 young people for the best part of an hour and a half and not one mentioned this Bill, despite the fact that we were told that here was a demand for it.  I have a long association with young people and I have never heard anyone asking for this type of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the young people are riddled with problems, what are the Minister or the Government doing about it?  In the last general election we were promised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party that they would introduce a comprehensive Family Planning Bill.  Is this the promised Bill? When the Minister talked about problems I would have assumed that he would attempt to deal with them by bringing in a more comprehensive Bill.  In this Bill we are just discussing one item.  It is a disappointment to everyone.  It is like the review of the income tax code, everything is being brought in piecemeal, or is it just breaking ground for more legislation attacking family life?  I am not playing politics in this instance, it is far too serious an issue.  I hope there will be second thoughts on this legislation.  I fully <Col N="534" /> appreciate the views that were expressed here.  The views expressed came from informed consciences in many cases. Confusion was brought about by the compromise arrived at to get this Bill through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points.  One relates to the question of enforcement, which has been a major issue.  It is my intention to avail of a provision in section 91 of the Health Act, 1947 to formally appoint appropriate medical doctors to monitor the operations of the provisions of the Family Planning Act.  This will be of benefit to everybody.  It will be of benefit to my Department in terms of being kept aware of what is going on and it will be of benefit <Col N="535" /> in terms of enforcement.  Deputy Conlon raised the question of conscientious objections, and I would point out that section 2 of the 1979 Act is in force and will continue to be in force.  As under the 1979 Act, the exercise of conscientious objection in relation to this matter still applies.  There are persons in our health services &mdash; we employ 60,000 full time and 3,000 part time workers &mdash; who may object on conscientious grounds to becoming involved at all.  All morning I have listened to Fianna Fáil objections. They remind me of a quotation attributed to the late Eamon de Valera &mdash; I am not sure whether he said it.  The quotation is this:</P>
      <P>In England people do what they like but they always say the right thing.  In Ireland people do the right thing but they always say what they like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing amendment No. 5a which seeks to delete the section of the Bill that would enable persons of 18 years or older to purchase contraceptives.  Various arguments have been made in support of that amendment, and from those arguments it seems to me the Fianna Fáil position has changed. At Second Stage they argued very strongly that their opposition was political and that they did not take any position in regard to contraceptives <i>per se</i>.  As far as they were concerned, people were entitled to use contraceptives if they saw fit.  The opposition was political, because it was an opportune time to do down the Coalition and to create divisions in the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil changed that position this <Col N="536" /> morning.  All their arguments today have been that this section of the Bill will attack the traditional family here, that in some way it will undermine some glorious system of family life which existed and still exists in Ireland.  No one in Fianna Fáil has attempted to define what he means by this marvellous family life which Fianna Fáil imagine existed or exists &mdash; some normal family life.  I should like someone on the Fianna Fáil benches to define what they mean by normal family life.  Tell us in detail what it means. What kind of values does it imply?</P>
    <P>We can have a legitimate family in the eyes of the State when there has been a marriage, or we can have an illegitimate family in the eyes of the State, of which we have many &mdash; people who live together and have families outside marriage. One of the primary objectives must be to keep families together as families. It seems to me that Fianna Fáil bear a very heavy responsibility for having destroyed families here, virtually from the time they took power and during nearly the entire life of the State.  We must consider that one million people who were born on this island are living in Britain.  Is that not the destruction of Irish family life in a fundamental way?  Is that not a breach of some kind of morality or other?</P>
    <P>What Fianna Fáil seem to get hot about is sexuality.  Everything seems to hinge on sexuality.  So long as we ignore that sex takes place, whether inside or outside marriage, we do not have to concern ourselves thereafter.  We must have laws that give the impression that a normal society exists, whatever that may be.  I am at a loss to know what &ldquo;a normal society&rdquo; is, because there is so much variety. We talk about the average man or the average woman.  There is no such thing as average or normal in those terms. Therefore, can somebody in Fianna Fáil explain precisely what is meant by traditional family life, and what criteria do they apply to establish what that is?</P>
    <P>We all know how poverty impinges on family life.  There is plenty of evidence of it in fiction and history.  We know also <Col N="537" /> how a narrow approach to sexuality has impinged on family life with, as the Minister has said, people ending up in asylums.  There was some popularity recently for a TV play called &ldquo;The Ballroom of Romance&rdquo;, which outlined clearly the kind of nod and wink about sexuality and the distortion of human relationships which we are led to believe existed and which we are told was the traditional way of family life in Ireland. Is that the kind of tradition we want to establish or to maintain?</P>
    <P>We have been told that as a result of this Bill thousands of young people will gallop down the streets, presumably to the family planning clinics in Cathal Brugha Street or elsewhere, and load up with contraceptives.  It strikes me as extremely odd that in an education system nearly totally controlled by the Roman Catholic Church there is so little confidence in the ability of that church to ensure that its ethos, views and morality will be transferred to the youth of the country.  Recently I read a paper presented by a Christian Brother in 1983 on the importance of the church maintaining control of the educational system in order to transfer its values to succeeding generations. Are the people opposing the Bill arguing that the Catholic Church has failed?  I do not believe it has.  Unfortunately, I think that in certain respects it has succeeded too well.  On sexual morality the question arises of whether the youth of Ireland will run riot buying and using contraceptives.  That argument is too ridiculous to contemplate.</P>
    <P>That young people do not come up to Deputy Wyse and me and ask &ldquo;How about getting this Bill through?&rdquo; does not mean that they are not concerned about the questions of family planning.  I know for a fact that they are concerned.  They see problems in their own families, with their friends, on the roads and streets, in the estates, about the availability of contraceptives to those who are sexually active &mdash; and will be sexually active whether there are contraceptives available or not &mdash; which would, at least, prevent the tragedy of unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> The suprious argument is made again that this section of the Bill is in some way legalising promiscuity.  The comparison is made between muggings and sexual activity.  This is a strange relationship of ideas.  The idea that there is a relationship between the availability of contraceptives and sexual relationships does not stand. You might as well say that muggings were being legalised because you were legalising contraceptives.  The logic of that argument is that to prevent burglaries you must outlaw screwdrivers, glass cutters, cars, that you must prevent the sale of petrol to people under 18 years and so on.  It is ridiculous.  It does not hold water and is an illogicality.</P>
    <P>Many declarations have been made in this House about values, without those values being spelled out.  There has been much talk about the sacredness of the family and the institution and tradition of family life, without defining what is meant.  Those who are opposing this Bill will have to define what they are talking about when they say that they are speaking on behalf of the parents of this country. I am a parent of this country and I am not talking on my behalf.  I am not talking on behalf of any of the parents to whom I have spoken within the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>One individual deliberately approached me during the last two weeks, questioning me about this family planning legislation.  He was a man close to 60 years of age, a carpenter.  He said that what Fianna Fáil are saying is total nonsense.  He could not understand it. He told me that in 1947 he was involved in the building trade in this city on the building sites and was then 17 years of age.  He said that his workmates were going to Belfast, buying contraceptives there, bringing them back to Dublin and selling them to their workmates &mdash; in 1947.  This debate is painful to listen to.</P>
    <P>Finally this country is a signatory of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights ratified in 1969 when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  Those rights include the right to choose the number and spacing of one's children and the right to safe and appropriate methods of <Col N="539" /> contraception and women's health care services.</P>

It is they who are wasting the time of this House, in refusing to accept the realities of Irish society today and that there is need for change, for getting rid of the cur i gceill, the nod and the wink in relation to sexual activity.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noel Treacy.  I visualise that award as consisting of a neatly sculpted head, rather like one of the smaller ones over there, of our dear colleague, Deputy Lenihan, most of the head being made of timber and the neck of brass.  That is the kind of reaction which I find irresistible when I hear an intelligent and educated man like Deputy Treacy &mdash; although he has tried to suggest that to say that much about him was saying too much &mdash; in 1985&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when Deputy Treacy wilfully interprets section 5 of the 1979 Act as applying only to foreigners.  It would make one wonder if one had been put into a time machine and we were still in 1935, that if one looked around a little more closely and rubbed my eyes, one would find Seán Mac Entee and Seán T. O'Kelly over there and over at this side James Fitzgerald Kenny and long forgotten figures like that.  How is it seriously <Col N="540" /> possible for an adult man, no longer in his first youth, to talk like that?</P>
      <P>He says that a person under section 5 of the present Act shall not import contraceptives into the State unless they are part of his personal luggage, accompanying him when he is entering the State.  I do not think that anybody reminded the House of the next item &mdash; and that their quantity is not such as to indicate that they are not solely for his own use.  When that section first arrived here, it caused a roar of horse laugh which was heard everywhere except within these ivory chambers.  Now I hear that that section was really envisaged, although it does not say so, as only bearing on foreigners, tourists, people who do not have the priceless advantage of being brought up in the beatific vision of Irish morality and the Irish State.  It refers to the kind of people, in other words, who would want to make love when they were on holidays and would not want to face the consequences, people who might want to bring in these things in their luggage.  Even then, of course, it would be a scandal to the world that even a Pole or a Dutchman was allowed to have that normal dimension to his desire, because he is only allowed to bring in, according to Deputy Treacy's reading of this Bill, as many devices as an Irish customs officer would think suitable.  Did you ever in your life hear such rubbish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>You did nothing all the years that you were there, but I shall come to that in a second.  I must admit that I have not had this experience myself, but Deputy Bell said this morning that he had the experience of going into the bar and hearing people there privately saying that they had absolutely no <Col N="541" /> fault to find with the Bill, but yet come in here and damn it.  I must admit that I have not come across that depth of hypocrisy in the sense that I could narrate the story in the way Deputy Bell did, but perhaps it exists.  I do not particularly fault the Deputies on the far side because it is very hard to break the habit of a political lifetime and let your party down, no matter how wrongheaded your party seem to you to be.  It is hard to do that and I do not fault Deputies X or Y for behaving like that.  However, I suspect that Deputy Treacy is in that category. Only somebody quite indifferent to whether he was thought honest or otherwise could possibly produce an argument resting on the implication that the first part of section 5 of the 1979 Bill was only intended to mean foreigners.  Does he not know perfectly well that the 1979 Act is being breached, day in day out, and not only in isolated cases but massively?  That is why there is no public demand, that is why there is no outcry.  That is why Deputy Wyse is able to go around the Cork Festival of Youth, but would none of the youths, if their pockets were turned inside out, be guilty?</P>
      <P>None of them up there would even bother their heads to mention such a thing to Deputy Wyse because they do not need his help.  Of course, that does not worry the likes of Deputy Treacy or his colleagues.  They have a neat, tight and right little act going and whether it is obeyed or disobeyed is all the one to them just as, I regret to say &mdash; this bears on both sides of the House &mdash; it is all the one whether the law on illegal broadcasting is observed or not, it is all one whether the law on litter is observed or not and it is all one whether the law on delivering drink to under age people is observed or not.  Somehow it is only when a law like this is not observed and an attempt is made &mdash; I am not all that sanguine about how good it is going to be as an attempt &mdash; to tidy it up that the roof falls in and that we get thunderings from all around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to what Deputy Treacy said about foreigners and their luggage, I can recall while a student working for two <Col N="542" /> summers at Dublin Airport.  I was 18 years of age at that time and I recall a Customs officer confiscating a woman's vanity case, or something of that type, and innocent and ignorant though I was I thought it an outrage that something had been taken from her intimate baggage and removed.  Why had it been removed?  It was shown around Dublin Airport to the roars of laughter of some of the staff &mdash; it is so long ago that I do not remember whose roars of laughter they were; perhaps it was not the Customs and it may have been my own part of the airport.  The contents of the bag were shown around and they included something which in later years I came to realise was a diaphragm.  At that time I thought that was an outrage although I did not have the courage to say so.  The idea that people's luggage can be inspected is still clearly implied in Deputy Haughey's Act, because the quantity has to measure up to the norms and the criteria of the Customs officer.</P>

      <P>We have heard about bona fides and good faith.  That was the point at which he begged compassion for his relative, as he thought it would be accepted, lack of education compared to Deputy Shatter.  There is no relativity whatever in it.  He is well able to deal with Deputy Shatter, or anybody else, and, therefore, there is less of an excuse for him to produce an argument like this. Our Act, he said, contains the words bona fide.  With elaborate sarcasm he said that the words bona fide meant in good faith.  Deputy Treacy, while he may not be as old as I am, is not a boy either and he may have heard of the bona fide system.  I should like to give the House another bit of my student recollections. Under the bona fide system public houses on the rim of the city, because of the way the licensing law worked up to 1960, were permitted by law to remain open one hour up to an hour and a half after those <Col N="543" /> in the city closed.  The point about the bona fide in it was that only those who were bona fide travellers could be served in those hours.  However, it was notorious in every pub.  Matt Smyths, The Goat and The Boot on the north side were stuffed from the time pubs closed in the city until they could be thrown out at midnight or 30 minutes after midnight.  The people there were not bona fide travellers.  They were bona fide in a sense that they bona fide wanted a drink, were bona fide willing to drive three or four miles to get a drink and would bona fide drive home again.  That was the only bona fide in it. It is late in the day to be pointing to the phrase bona fide as being a guarantee of anything.  We made enough fun of the 1979 Act when it was going through, the Irish solution to the Irish problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was and is a sleeveen solution. I know what the Minister is trying to get rid of and I am solemnly with him although we probably disagree about the National Development Corporation and a range of other things.  The idea that somehow no evil can be imputed or anything said which would allow it even be suspected about our own people is wrong. It is like in the fifties when there were references in pastoral letters, from the pulpit and by film critics, to stage shows such as those in which the innocent little Royalettes took part, or the shows that took place at intervals in theatres which for most people only held up the interval between the pictures, to cross-channel artists with their dubious routines.  We were told we had to watch out for the cross-channel artists with their dubious routines.  The country is full of dubious artists of our own.  There is no shortage of them, and it was full of them some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a small way it is like a piece of cant that used to go around UCD when I was a student there, that whenever some piece of quite spectacular savagery took <Col N="544" /> place at the college, some piece of Vandalic magnitude in terms of destruction of property or interference with human beings, is was attributed to people from outside the college.  It was never our own dear students letting off steam; it was always people outside the college who were to blame for tearing notices off the board and so on.  If the Bill does not do anything else but dismantle a few bricks from that wall of cant we all grew up behind it will have deserved to pass through the House.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputy Gallagher genuinely misheard the Minister, but although he is not in the House I hope it reaches him that I believe he clearly misunderstood what the Minister said in regard to the connection between illegitimacy and contraception. I understood the Minister to say not that most young people were engaged in irregular liaisons.  I did not hear him say such a thing but he did say that when pregnancies resulted from irregular liaisons they were in most cases from relationships with steady boy friends.  There is a big difference between that and what Deputy Gallagher understood him to say.  I hope Deputy Gallagher has the honour not to go chasing around his constituency repeating what he has taken the Minister to have meant.</P>
    <P>Nobody would make little or fun of the hopes he expressed for our young people, but the reality is that the Act has been effectively torn up.  It was never really worth the paper it was written on.  It is defied day in, day out.  The idea that Deputy Gallagher is defending anything worth defending by opposing the passage of the Bill merely in deference to his own idealistic hopes which all of us probably share in one measure or another is nonsense. He is not doing any such thing. That point of view on the part of Deputy Gallagher is all of a piece with what a great section of his party had been identified with since the debate started, previously in the debate on the 1979 Act and before that again when Deputy Cooney's Bill was on its stumbling passage through the House in 1974.  It is all of a piece with what went on since I was first elected to the Seanad.  I was elected to the Seanad <Col N="545" /> at the same time as Senator Mary Robinson, who became in those days almost a one issue Senator.  I do not think it is unfair to refer to her in that manner.  One thing she tried to do week after weary week in the Seanad was to get on to the floor of that House the question of birth control, of family planning and contraception. I want to remind the House that that was before the McGee case and before the Supreme Court, or any other court, had ruled on a matter to do with this in any shape or form.  Day after day she was literally trampled on by the Fianna Fáil majority of the day led by Senator Tommy Mullins, a man I grew to be very fond of.  I am afraid it is the curse of politics that one ends up rather fond of people that one starts out thinking of as terrible rogues.  In the days I thought of him as a rouge part of the reason I thought so was the brutal contempt with which he and the whole Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad treated Senator Robinson. She was as much entitled as any other Senator to have something discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1978 CIE have supplied about 200,000 cubic metres of beach nourishment material at Rosslare Strand, including 105,000 cubic metres of offshore material provided in 1983.  CIE hold that the 1983 provision met the board's commitment for a three year period; that is, up to the end of 1985.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Commissioners of Public Works are processing a proposal from Wexford County Council for a new coast protection scheme.  In my view this is the only long-term solution to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the beach at Rosslare has deteriorated significantly over the past ten days because of storms, that the good works carried out by the golf club, local hotel and property owners, Wexford County Council and the Office of Public Works has been negatived to the extent that the coastline there is under threat?  Is he aware that Wexford's county engineer has admitted that the coastline may be breached resulting in Rosslare village being cut in two?  Will he ensure that CIE will immediately live up to their promise of the provision of beach material?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, I visited this strand myself and am acutely conscious of the seriousness of <Col N="547" /> the problem.  On the other hand, having looked at this matter carefully, I think the only real solution lies in a long term proposal now being processed by the Office of Public Works whose responsibility it is to look after coastal erosion.  I understand that the Office of Public Works and Wexford County Council are in the process of finalising their plans in this matter.  I acknowledge that that does not solve the immediate problem but at least if we get the long term proposals processed we shall have begun to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says, that in the long term we must have a definite policy.  But is he aware that if we do not do something in the short term there will not be a Rosslare there in the long term?  This is quite serious.  The county engineer has now admitted that we are in imminent danger and that something must be done in the near future.  Will the Minister direct CIE to provide beach nourishment?  I am asking him to direct CIE to provide such beach nourishment immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE have already done a certain amount of work on this and they feel that their commitment up to the end of 1985 has been fulfilled.  The only satisfactory way to deal with this problem is through a permanent, long term solution.  That is in the course of being pursued by the Office of Public Works and Wexford County Council.  If the situation has deteriorated in the past few days, as the Deputy suggests, I will have my officials examine the matter again urgently to ascertain if there is anything immediate we ought to do pending the long term solution.</P>

      <P>In view of the critical situation now obtaining at Rosslare Strand, does the Minister concur with the view of the board of CIE that their 1983 sand nourishment programme relieves them of any further responsibility in that regard until 1986?  Nobody else in County Wexford, from the officials right down to the Rosslare Development Association, concurs in that view.  In view of the position outlined already would the Minister say whether he feels there will be any need for the capital scheme now under consideration as there is every likelihood that there will be no beach for which to provide a scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, CIE's role in this arose because of the building of an extension to Rosslare Harbour.  As Deputies will know, it is not proper for CIE to have a role in anti-coastal erosion measures; that is proper to the Office of Public Works.  They did supply beach nourishment some time ago &mdash; 105,000 cubic metres &mdash; and they feel that that has discharged their responsibilities.  Deputies will be aware that I am introducing legislation to establish a harbour authority in Rosslare.  They know there will be some delay involved because it also requires British legislation.  Therefore, despite what Deputy H. Byrne is purported to have said in <i>The Wexford People</i> recently, I intend to have meaningful involvement of local people in the running of the port when perhaps they <Col N="549" /> will be able to take some decisions about coastal erosion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct; that is provided in the national plan.  But that would not prevent a scheme being approved by the Govern-ment if it was of a sufficiently exceptional nature.

      <P>The performance of DART to date in terms of passenger carryings has been encouraging, with record numbers, in excess of 44,000 per day, using the services. Much greater usage of DART is required, however, to help remunerate the capital investment of over £113 million involved.  CIE's target is to have over 80,000 passengers per day by 1987.  Much remains to be done if this is to be achieved. In particular, the feeder bus services to the principal stations should be introduced without further delay.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE have informed me that the only dangerous chemicals transported by rail are ammonia from Cork to Arklow and acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate from Dublin to Ballina.  In addition, petrol is conveyed by rail occasionally.  The safety <Col N="556" /> arrangements involved conform to the international arrangements for the carriage of dangerous goods by rail.</P>
    <P>The chemicals are carried in train loads in tank wagons by tank containers.  The trains are operated to special operating instructions and all persons concerned in the operations are given special training. The tank wagons and tank containers are specially designed and constructed to stringent specifications and, before they are entered into service, they are required to be approved by a competent authority.  The containers must be maintained and inspected to strict standards while in service and be periodically checked by the competent authority. Because of the stringent requirements it is considered that, in the event of a major accident involving these trains, the odds are against these tank wagons or tank containers being damaged to the extent that a leak of the chemical would occur. The rupture of a container is similarly considered to be unlikely.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the special nature of the equipment and arrangements used for transporting the chemicals, in view of the likely effects of a major accident, a scheme for co-ordination of emergency services was drawn up to deal with accident situations.  The scheme covers CIE, the Garda Síochána, the services of the local authorities and the health boards, the helicopter squadron of the Army Air Corps, harbour authorities, the ESB and organisations forwarding, receiving or using dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The scheme outlines the procedure, duties and responsibilities for the various services and organisations for the duration of the emergency.  Each service would discharge its own functions at an incident, subject to the provisions made in the scheme for overall control.  The local authority services and the health boards and ambulance services would take action within the scheme in accordance with their own emergency plans.</P>
    <P>Every conceivable step is taken to ensure the safe carriage of the chemicals by rail and to eliminate, in so far as possible, all potential accident risks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that at least one of the two chemicals he mentioned, acrylonitrile, is an extremely hazardous one? There have been several major accidents abroad in recent times involving similar chemicals.  In this country the main element of risk appears to be their transportation by rail particularly across large population centres.  They go through the centre of Dublin, through Cabra, East Wall and Drumcondra &mdash; perhaps the most densely populated areas in the country. In the event of a serious accident in which the containers were ruptured the likely effect would be a major disaster&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan the Minister referred to would have little real effect should there be &mdash; unlikely though it is, and the Minister says the odds are against it &mdash; a serious accident involving these tanks.  Does the Minister feel the risk justifies the transportation of these chemicals, particularly acrylonitrile, through large population centres from Dublin to Asahi when they could be safely transported by sea thus avoiding, though not necessarily directly, major population centres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right to be concerned about the substance called acrylonitrile.  It is a very dangerous substance. When the Asahi plant in Ballina was being built the question of transporting acrylonitrile was considered in great detail.  The rail option was considered to be the best one in the circumstances. I am assured that every possible safety precaution has been taken to minimise any risk there might be of a tragedy of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  I have emphasised again and again to CIE <Col N="558" /> the need for those safety precautions to be strictly adhered to and I am assured by them that they are.  The chances of an accident of any kind are very small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

The Deputy will be aware from his previous questions to the Minister for Labour that the carriage of dangerous substances is mainly a matter for the Minister for Labour.  I have responsibility for CIE and I assure the Deputy that every safety precaution has been taken.  I am assured those precautions are being adhered to. Luckily there have been no disasters to date and the likelihood of a disaster in the future is very remote indeed.</P>

If there was a major accident it would come under the aegis of the fire service of Kildare County Council.  Is the Minister aware that a report from the fire officer in Kildare given some years ago left it in no doubt that they had not the equipment or expertise to deal with a major catastrophe involving acrylonitrile?  Is he aware of a report that only people in the fire service of 40 years of age would be competent to deal with a major accident concerning acrylonitrile?  I ask the Minister to request the company involved to transport these dangerous chemicals at night. Very stringent precautions must be taken regarding their transportation.  All local authorities should be notified when these loads are being transported.  That is not the case at present.</P>

Because of that it is very likely that some major accident will take place in a large centre of population, particularly in towns such as Naas or Newbridge.</P>

As State assistance is being provided for the development works at Rosslare harbour, a submission seeking assistance from the fund is being made.

      <P>The position is that it was only recently during our Presidency of the EC that the Council of Ministers agreed in December to set up the new transport infrastructural fund as distinct <Col N="562" /> from the European Regional Development Fund.  That was a major achievement of our Presidency.  The Italian Minister who is now President has put forward some suggestions regarding the matters that would qualify for transport infrastructural aid.  Among those listed are port developments, especially port developments that have a clear EC dimension.  In that context, if it is accepted I think Rosslare harbour would have a considerable edge.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister it was a major achievement to get a special fund.  Will he not agree with me that the real problem with regard to that kind of funding is the Department of Finance who get their hands on the money?  The problem is that it is not actually related to the development for which people have applied.  Further, will the Minister not agree that in some instances money is so received by the Department of Finance at a rate of interest much less than they charge the individual Departments when they give it to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy got that figure.  I know there has been considerable pressure for development of Rosslare harbour.  In my opinion Rosslare harbour is in need of some development, and that is why I provided £500,000 in the Estimate this year for that purpose.  When there is a local harbour authority the development of the port will be more under local control and more progress is likely to be made.</P>

      <P>A review of ports policy is in the course of being completed and I expect to publish this as part of a Green Paper on Transport Policy in the next few months.  It would be premature, therefore, to make any comment on the CII submission beyond saying that it represents a useful input to the formulation of the policy proposals which I intend to set out in the Green Paper.  I look forward to the participation of the CII and other interests in the discussion on these proposals in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go perhaps even further.  I will not say all investments with regard to ports have been because of local pressure but most of them have been.  I do not think most of them could have been justified on commercial criteria alone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  However, soon after I came to office I thought this area needed to be looked at.  There did not seen to be any real framework within which these matters were assessed. That is why I initiated a review of port policy.  Very often port developments arise because of pressure of a local nature and because of the need to upgrade the status of the local port without regard to the overall national need for it.  We have a great excess of port facilities compared to the trade that comes into and goes out of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The study mentions six ports which do 63 per cent of the trade in the country.  In view of the emphasis that the CII report places on these, will the Department be establishing a hierarchy of ports for the future development?</P>

Perhaps we should wait for that and then I would welcome the Deputy's thoughts on it.</P>

      <P>The most encouraging feature of this improvement is that it has been achieved at increased levels of both exports and imports compared with 1983.  The value of exports in 1984 was over 28 per cent higher than in 1983.  Although there was a heavy demand for imported goods for industrial use associated with the rapid growth of industrial exports and the recovery in industrial output, the overall rise in imports, at 21 per cent, was markedly lower than the rise in exports.</P>
      <P>The continuing buoyancy of exports and the consequent narrowing of the trade gap are welcome developments and are in line with the view expressed in the national plan that the projected improvement in the external account would be achieved through increased exports.</P>

      <P>Information of the type sought by the Deputy is collected by the Central Statistics Office through the household budget surveys.  The latest information from this source relates, <Col N="571" /> however, to 1980 and no up-to-date comparison is available.  As an indication of the overall change in the tax burden in the past five years, total tax revenue, as defined for budgetary purposes, has grown from 26.7 per cent of GNP in 1979 to an estimated 36.5 per cent of GNP in 1984.  Of this total, direct tax revenue increased from 11.5 per cent to 16 per cent and indirect tax revenue from 15.2 per cent to 20.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Those figures show an alarming increase over the period given in both direct and indirect taxation.  How does the Minister see the trend from this on out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the figures show a substantial increase in the tax burden over the period which I have indicated. It was precisely the Government's concern with that trend that led us to include in the national plan as one of the central policy points the stabilisation of the tax burden at 36.5 per cent of GNP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that since he came into office the total income tax payable has increased from £1,459 million to a projected £2,131 million and that the total tax has increased in the same time from £4,000 million to a projected £6,400 million? Would he not acknowledge that that increase is not consistent with what has been set out as an essential element of Government policy, the tackling of high level taxation?  Is it not the reality that in absolute terms since the Govern-ment came into office the figures as a percentage of the increase have been growing at a rate of noughts, so to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find very little to agree with in what the Deputy has said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are beyond dispute.  The increase in the tax burden in the period to which the Deputy refers <Col N="572" /> reflects a number of factors, including the fact that the party opposite embarked on a spending spree in 1977 and did not seem to care very much about what happened in the area of total expenditure.  The figures for the change in tax revenue in the past couple of years &mdash; the officially published figures which the Deputy is using and which are beyond dispute &mdash; show that the total tax burden as a percentage of GNP is increasing.  They show also, among other matters, that as nominal incomes increase the total tax take increases.  The Deputy seems to have some difficulty in distinguishing between the effect of rates of tax and the effect of the expansion of the base for tax.  For example, if a tax remains at a given rate and the people spend more money, the total take will increase.  All of that is a matter of objective record.  Total tax burden has been increasing during a period and this Government did not consider it proper or desirable, either socially or economically, to allow the tax burden continue increasing.  That is why we provided specifically in the plan for the maintenance of the burden at its current level of 36½ per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for the lecture but perhaps he would return to the figures.  He will acknowledge that, since he came into office, income tax has more than doubled as a result of the increased levels of tax he has imposed.  The higher rate was increased to 65 per cent although the Minister has now had a change of mind on that.  He may go back as far as he wishes but we are talking about the years during which he has been in office.  Will the Minister acknowledge that if in respect of income tax alone he is seeking an additional £165 million over the outturn for last year, an increase of more than 8 per cent, he cannot justifiably tell the public or anyone else in the course of his lecture that is reducing the burden of income tax at a time when the rate of inflation is forecast at 6 per cent.  Effectively is that 8 per cent increase not a real increase of 2 per cent on the basis of <Col N="573" /> the inflation figure?  The facts are rather coercive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disputing the facts, but the Deputy again is confusing tax take with tax rates.  It is a matter beyond contention that this year, for example, had we not made the changes provided for in the budget, income tax revenue for this year would amount to £58,500 million more than what will be the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that if the total income tax base is increasing, if the total amount of nominal taxable income is increasing, the total amount of tax collected will increase.  Therefore, it is not valid for the Deputy to argue that the figures this year will represent an increased tax burden.  What he is observing is the increase in tax take from the operation of the modified system to the total income tax base.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy's line of questioning and I should like the Minister to say whether the total tax burden he talks of includes or excludes charges in respect of water and refuse collection which are a burden of taxation on the average household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the figures the Minister has given this year for income tax exclude also what was not included in 1982: the income levy and the youth employment levy, which amount to £162 million?  When those are added to the burden of income tax the reality I have been pointing out is underlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the total tax burden, including the levies to which <Col N="574" /> the Deputy has referred and provided for in the budgetary figures this year, is 36½ per cent of GNP.  Our intention in conforming with the provisions of the national plan is to keep the total tax burden at that level for the duration of the plan, that is, to avoid a further increase in the tax burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take value-added tax, we find that the increase in this respect has been from £946 million in 1982 to the present projection of £1,483 million.  Would the Minister conceive that that is also a very considerable increase in real terms, either as a proportion of GNP or in any other terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is showing a most unaccustomed dexterity in regard to the manipulation of the figures.  Those are the figures for the total VAT take, a take that was increased very substantially by the strategy resorted to by Deputy MacSharry as Minister &mdash; imposing VAT at the point of entry.  Many of the Deputies opposite have been complaining about that provision ever since, but I can understand their point of view.  The total tax take for 1982 and for every successive year has benefited from the raising of the level of take as a result of the imposition of VAT at point of entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a measure to which the gentlemen opposite resorted but which has been a matter for bitter regret for them ever since and they are not prepared to claim credit for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for the tax take are beyond dispute.  They are as accurate as is possible.  They reflect the fact that over the period in question there have been increases in rates of VAT and there have been substantial increases also in the taxable base in respect of VAT.  As people spend more money and as the <Col N="575" /> total amount of activity in the economy expands, a given rate of VAT will obviously produce more revenue.  Even during the course of this year, as we reduce rates of VAT &mdash; and we have reduced the rates substantially across the board &mdash; we will have an extra take from VAT as a result of the increased level of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I had described to the House the demeanour of the Opposition when they were in Govern-ment in 1969, 1970 and 1971.  When they resolutely refused to allow Senator Robinson to bring this subject in any shape or form onto the floor of the Seanad under the pretext that they were considering legislation of their own.  In 1972-73 Mrs. McGee's case came before the High Court and then the Supreme Court and was decided in the early part of 1973.  This effectively blotted out the subsection in the 1935 Act which purported to prohibit Mrs. McGee and those like her from importing contraceptive devices for their own use.  That left it to the Legislature to act and the Govern-ment, of which the Ceann Comhairle had the honour to be a member, brought in a Bill under the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Cooney, intending to apply the absolutely minimal regularisation of the law which was enjoined on the House by the Supreme Court decision &mdash; unless the House was going to abdicate its responsibility and allow no control of any kind on the importation, whether individually in luggage or by post, singularly or in bulk, of contraceptive devices.</P>
      <P>That was obviously not what the House wanted and the then Minister for Justice made an honest attempt to regularise the situation.  In the spring-summer of 1974 Deputy Cooney promoted a Bill through this House which in many important respects was similar to the 1978 Bill.  The party to which the two gentlemen opposite belong &mdash; although Deputy O'Hanlon was not a Member of the House at the time &mdash; opposed that Bill tooth and nail.  Why?  Because they knew our Government, with a very narrow majority, would have great difficulty in carrying it through.  Deputy O'Flanagan was there in those days and there were two or three other dissenting Members whom I managed to keep out of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not realise there were as many as there subsequently turned out to be.  But Fianna Fáil saw this not in terms of what needed to be done, not in terms of their duty as a component of the Oireachtas, but in terms of what could be done to wrongfoot the Government, to do Liam Cosgrave's Government down.  They could not have hoped that he &mdash; and I say this in respect and affection for somebody I could not feel anything else for &mdash; would commit what I have to call a misjudgment of not disclosing his intentions beforehand.

Then and only then did they move and move minimally, move ludicrously, as I tried to demonstrate by reference to section 5 which Deputy Treacy was talking about, the foreigner section, alt na gcoigríoch.  They produced an Act which was not enforced and could not have been enforced from the first day it was on the Statute Book, the sleeveen solution to the sleeveen problem.</P>

It is futile to say that in this House, because three months ago when the Age of <Col N="603" /> Majority Bill was going through, not one Deputy agreed with what I said.  I said that to make statutory adults out of 18 years olds was cruel to them.  There was not a peep from those benches.  I was the stick in the mud.  I was the one who had no confidence in young people.  I was the pessimist.  I was exhorted by Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Fahey and Deputy Ormonde to show confidence in the youth, that they were better than I thought they were, that they could look after themselves.</P>
      <P>A different song is being sung now, not because anyone over there believes it or disbelieves it, but because until yesterday they saw some chance of doing down a Government who are doing their best. That parliamentary strategy has rebounded on them.  They were made to look small by Deputy O'Malley yesterday. He has appropriated, and for my money is entitled to, whatever republicanism there is in that party.  Those of them who sympathise with what Deputy O'Malley said yesterday and who think the same &mdash; and many of them do apart from the five or six dissidents who have shown themselves &mdash; should ask whether they are running the risk of ceasing to deserve what people often make fun of but what is a proud name, Fianna Fáil, and whether they are not turning into a slíbhíní sleamhna party.</P>

He dealt at length with section 5 of the Health (Family Planning) Act with which he is very unhappy.  I am amazed that, as a senior member of the Fine Gael Party, he did not influence the Taoiseach or the Minister for Health to amend section 5. He did not tell us whether he still felt the same way as he felt in 1974 when he said that if they were to put Deputy Flanagan out of the Fine Gael Party because he did not propose to follow the Government's line on a Bill, that would be an act equivalent to shooting a conscientious objector. He might have told us today whether he <Col N="604" /> was in support of the removal of the Whip from Deputy Flanagan.</P>

No Deputy tells us more often that we are shoneens because we import solutions to our problems and copy the legislation of other countries.  I agree with him when he says that.

      <P>I should like Deputy Kelly to tell us what good could come from this Bill.  We have a legitimate objection to this Bill.  We do not apologise to anybody for the stand we have taken on it.  Deputy Kelly brought in the red herring that this Bill was about republicanism and Church-State relations. This Bill is about the distribution of contraceptives. That is what we are debating today.  We can have a debate on Church-State relations and republicanism if we want to.  Producing red herrings does not do justice to the Bill presented to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard nothing from the Government side of the House today to change our opinion that there is nothing in this Bill which will do anything for the common good.  The Minister was asked by Deputy Power if he was prepared to accept an amendment which might be acceptable <Col N="605" /> to numerous Deputies on both sides of the House.  Government Deputies asked the Minister to consider amendments because they know the paragraph we are trying to delete is not in the best interests of the Irish people.  Of course we trust young people.  We do not expect young people to buy contraceptives all over the place just because they happen to be available under the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kernel of the debate.  The Minister gave us a failure rate for non-medical contraceptives of 9.6 per cent.  Some surveys would put the figure much higher in the case of teenagers.  The Minister admits there is a lack of knowledge about the use of contraceptives.  These are very good reasons why anybody who intends to use contraceptives should get the proper advice.</P>
      <P>We believe family planning should be placed fairly and squarely in the area of family health care.  It is not just about dispensing condoms.  We are talking about family health care.  In that context we believe this is a bad Bill.  If the Minister were to accept our amendment, it would improve the Bill and would accord with the wishes of the vast majority of the Irish people who are seriously concerned about this section.  They are concerned about the fact that we will be making contraceptives freely available to 18 year olds as the Bill says, but as we all know they will be available to all teenagers irrespective of age.</P>

      <P>Before I speak to the amendment I should like to refer very briefly to a report in one of the papers this <Col N="606" /> morning to the effect that my decision to vote for the Bill was influenced by the splendid contribution made by Deputy O'Malley.  I was impressed by what he said, but my mind was firmly made up about how I should vote hours before Deputy O'Malley made that very fine contribution.  I just want to put the record straight.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear that the Minister is in agreement with the conscientious objection clause.  Many parents who contacted me were worried about this.  Perhaps a young lady who had a conscientious objection to handling non-medical contraceptive items might find that her chances of being selected for a position in a teaching hospital were reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to it.  I will be very brief.  Parents hope that this conscientious objection clause will apply to potential employees of health boards.  The Minister indicated that it applies to present employees.  Lest it might militate against any young boy or girl seeking employment in the health boards, I hope the Minister will make the position clear.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 18 year age limit.  I understand that chemists are quite disturbed about it because the penalties are quite severe and it is up to the chemist to satisfy himself as to the age of the person purchasing contraceptives.  Perhaps the Minister might introduce identity cards to assist the chemists.  Chemists also wish to know the position in relation to temporary employees, such as students who work there during their summer holidays. Are they covered by this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the sentiments expressd by Members on both sides about the effects this Bill will have on traditional Irish family circumstances.  We are articulating the views of many parents who are gravely concerned about the potential consequences if this Bill is passed.  There can be a positive result from this Bill.  Already there is a greater awareness about sexual <Col N="607" /> morality and the sexual responsibility of people.  I hope that the topic of sexual morality will be brought out into the open so that people can face the realities as they are and not as perhaps we would like them to be or pretend them to be. Would the Minister consider setting up a committee with representatives from the various Departments together with parents and members of Churches so as to work out an agreed programme for sexual education so that we can bring home to our young people the implications of getting involved in pre-marital sexual exploits?  We owe it to our young people to alert them to all the implications. We owe it to our young boys and girls to go down this road a bit further and explore the possibility of setting up such an education programme.  It would have to emphasise personal responsibility.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  I have listened all morning to the debate and at times I wondered about the standard of the debate.  The sincerity of our views should be accepted and it pains me to see the sneers of certain Deputies on the far side of the House about the contributions being made by members of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The sooner we have maturity in this House the better off we will be.  The sooner the Government stop their concerted and concentrated efforts of abuse and innuendo about Fianna Fáil, and particularly about the Fianna Fáil leader, the sooner co-operation in this House will be better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell put his finger on the kernel of this problem when he said that we should face reality and acknowledge that the proposals in this section cannot be implemented.  That has been our argument all along; that we cannot prevent condoms getting into the hands of the under 18s.  If the Minister had accepted the suggestion by Deputy Paddy Power to try to meet the legitimate concern of a number of Deputies about that aspect, this legislation would be better.  There has been tremendous criticism of the 1979 legislation.  We were told sneeringly that it was an Irish solution to an Irish problem. Deputy O'Malley said last night on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme that it took a tremendous amount of hard work, consultation and effort over a long period to formulate the 1979 Bill and he congratulated Deputy Haughey on it.  It is a pity that the others would not have the same attitude as Deputy O'Malley.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Kelly's contribution. It is always a pleasure to listen to Deputy Kelly; he has the reputation of being the court jester.  The Deputy regaled us with tales of student mishaps and misdeeds and with what happened when he worked in Dublin Airport and he made a new award &mdash; the award for hard necks.  I do not think that Deputy Treacy's neck is too hard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was here for the vast bulk of Deputy Kelly's contribution and, as far as I am aware, he never referred to his own misgivings about this section. It would have been interesting to hear Deputy Kelly on that.  Deputy Shatter brought us on flights of fancy in and out of Dublin Airport and on bus trips to <Col N="609" /> Newry and talked about 13 year olds with large numbers of contraceptives and about what a customs officer should do in that case.  I heard a story about a customs officer seizing a large number of contraceptives and when he was asked why he did it he said he believed that a crime was about to be committed because if a person used all of them he would commit suicide.  Perhaps that would get over the point raised by Deputy Shatter.</P>
      <P>Last night during the discussion on Second Stage I fully accepted the sincerity of the Minister's views on this subject.  The sincerity of the views of the people on this side of the House should be acknowledged.  The word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; was used by quite a number of people, and it came very badly from some of the people who used it.  I accept that there are unwanted pregnancies among young people and that there is transmission of sexual diseases among them, but the great weight of evidence available from the UK is that, despite what can be described as the best sex education system in the world, despite the availability of contraceptives to teenagers from 13 years upwards, the rate of unwanted pregnancies has increased dramatically in the last ten years.</P>

      <P>I showed the Deputy the courtesy of listening to him.  Perhaps he would do the same.  He can make his comments later.  I hope the sex education we use here will not be of the type spoken of by the Minister and Deputy Doyle or the type available in many English schools where the number of pregnancies among young people has continued to rise dramatically.  The Minister went into flights of fantasy when he said that the 1979 Act allowed people to import contraceptives through the post.  Perhaps he would let us know which section provided for that.  Perhaps he was frustrated from having sat here for three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to have set his face against accepting anything we propose in <Col N="610" /> the way of change to this Bill, no matter how sincere our arguments have been.  If he had listened to us he would help to prevent unwanted pregnancies here.  This Bill will not do anything to improve the status of women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Calleary asked about the incidence in this field of sexually transmitted diseases.  Dr. Mary Shortt, a distinguished practitioner in Northern Ireland, recently appeared in a television programme and on the Friday before did some research.  She got figures from the office of the Registrar General in Northern Ireland to show that the rate for gonorrhoea for people under 19 years dropped from 11 per cent last year &mdash; in Northern Ireland there is free availability of contraceptives &mdash; to nil last year. Another doctor in this field made an interesting observation on that television programme.  He said that in Northern Ireland, taking just gonorrhoea as one of the notifiable diseases, in the four year period ending 1981 the official statistics for Northern Ireland showed that there were on average 404 cases per annum. He said that the official statistics for the Republic for the same four year period showed 211 cases per annum.  He pointed out that the official statistics for the Republic represent clinic returns and that the Department of Health here estimate that those figures represent at best 10 per cent of true incidence in the Republic.</P>
      <P>I have issued many directives and requests in the Department so that we would have a true return of the incidence reported.  That doctor went on to say &mdash; and I share his view &mdash; that Northern Ireland, with half of the population of the Republic, would appear to have double the incidence.  Officially, that is correct, but the Republic statistics are meaningless because they represent only about 10 per cent of the incidence.  He said:</P>
      <P>I would argue that the true number of cases of gonorrhoea in the Republic is probably 2,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Northern Ireland would have only one-fifth of the incidence in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> I hold, and it must be evident to Deputies here, that the use of contraceptives acts as a major preventive against the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. That is unquestionable.  However, Deputies who have available to them a massive volume of evidence from the mid-forties to the mid-eighties, still refuse to accept that fact.  It must be accepted that the use of contraceptives acts as a major preventive to disease incidence. I can supply a great deal more information to Deputies but I suggest that they talk to any venereologist in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>She has stated that the rate of gonorrhoea for under 19 year olds in Northern Ireland has dropped from 11 per cent to none last year.  That is a comment which she made.  It is in a transcript of a television broadcast.  I have not had a chance of double-checking it with her personally, but we all know that there is nothing more horrible and nothing more conducive to appalling disaster than that a young person, with total unawareness, casually, experimentally, should contract a sexually transmitted disease.  This imposes a devastation upon the young person.  I, as Minister for <Col N="612" /> Health, am responsible for public health, for preventative medicine.  That is supposed to be my function.  That is why we have a separate division in the Department of Health and why we have a deputy chief medical officer responsible for the public health area.  I cannot ask him in conscience to implement measures when we know, legislatively, that our Department and our directors of community care at local level are spancelled by legislative measures which do not give them the impetus and the incentive to cope with sexually transmitted diseases.  We are just not spending enough money on that.  I am appalled that three Deputies from Limerick voted against the Bill and one Deputy abstained, because the incidence there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the last point, very briefly, while I would not dispute the figures the Minister gave us in general, I do dispute one figure, a projected figure from Doctor Jack Cantrell for the incidence of gonorrhoea for the Republic of Ireland.  That can be counteracted by the statement that Deputy Griffin read out to us here yesterday from 17 doctors, consultants who are working, some of them in maternity hospitals, who would be in very close contact with patients who would suffer from gonorrhoea.  They make the case very clearly that if these proposals become law and I quote from their letter:</P>
      <P>The inevitable consequences will be an increase in promiscuity, with an upsurge in venereal disease and carcinoma of the cervix as experienced in this and other countries:</P>
      <P>They accept the high rate of failure of contraceptives which would lead to more illegitimate births and abortions.  We must accept what they said in a letter to Deputies of this House.  They are 17 consultants and we must accept their figures.</P>

He has no evidence of it.  However, these here are 17 doctors who are concerned about the implications of this legislation. That is their opinion.</P>

      <P>This is one of the problems of this debate.  The doctors concerned I do not propose to name, but I do propose to name the man who refuted their case.  There was a very major refutation of that assertion by, for example, a very distinguished professor, a colleague whom Deputy O'Hanlon knows well, a Professor Dermot Hourihan, Professor of Pathology, Saint James', Trinity College, Dean of the Faculty.  He and the deans of the other faculties in one cryptic letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> devastated that assertion.  Not one of those other 17 doctors has been prepared to come forward with any supportive evidence of their assertion.  In fact, ironically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I find it appalling that members of the medical profession, a very small number of them, 17 out of the 1,100 consultants in this country, here would attempt to make that case.  Out of the many thousands of our medical people not one would support that letter. Instead, that letter was sent to each Deputy and it was sent to parents.  It raised false fears and inculcated more misconceptions about sexually transmitted diseases.  For example, Deputy Glenn and others said that automatically it had a concomitant development of cervical cancer, which created unhappiness and tragedy for young women, married women, fearing that sexual activity within or outside marriage automatically creates an incidence of cervical cancer. This is an escalation of fear which is basically wrong.  I, as a lay politician, have only a rudimentary medical knowledge. Not professing to have any more than that, when I get that type of data I go to my chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officers and ask if there is any sound medical back-up to that assertion.

      <P>I shall be brief, so that it is hoped, everybody will get a chance to speak and I hope everybody else will be equally unselfish.  Listening to the debate today I note that the phrase, an Irish solution to an Irish problem, was bandied about; but from the attitudes exposed in the debate I decided to change that phrase to the following, it is an Irishman's solution to an Irishwoman's problem. That is exactly what has been ignored in the House during this and other debates about human sexuality and the consequences <Col N="616" /> of human sexuality, which are that babies are born of woman, planned or unplanned, wanted or not.  When we talk about the great traditions here, family values and the standard of morals which have declined so much from our heavenly times of the forties and fifties, it is forgotten that it is woman who has carried the responsibility of the babies.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the House to consider what the position would be if we were talking about the biological needs of the majority of the Members and the responsibilities asked of them for years. How would the males like it if the numbers here were 152 women and 14 men and, worse still, if during the short debate four of those men were not allowed to speak?  Four of the women in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party did not speak during this debate.  It may be difficult&mdash; possibly it is not within the imagination of the Members opposite to do so &mdash; to consider the position if the figures were reversed and then try to realise the position women are in in this Chamber and in the country.</P>
      <P>Consistently we have only had insulting concern for young girls with no minds, no wills, no choices of their own, pressured by the manly desires of 19 and 20 year olds, with the devastating result that as secondhand articles they will not be married by the same men.  Is that our perception of women?  Is that the final objectivity we give to women, shop-soiled articles?</P>

I should like Deputy Treacy to answer the question put by Deputy De Rossa: how does he define traditional family life?  How does the define the deterioration of the normal high standards of motherhood and the traditional <Col N="617" /> life that is so much under threat at present?</P>

      <P>This is typical of the Irishman's attitude and reaction to some honesty from women.  No more than women's sexuality, they cannot take it. We are talking about values of our society that have long gone.  When we talk about glorious motherhood we are not talking about maidens gambolling on the village green and rosy cheeked children.  We are talking about bleak, guilt ridden repressed times when a women had no say, no income, no right to work away from the home and no choice as to how many children she would or would not have.  I am talking about the period when if she did not get married and did not have children her value was even less.</P>

      <P>Before the debate ends I ask Members to apply their minds, their intelligence and their morality to the needs of women who produce children and the responsibility we have to the children they bring into the world.  I am amazed to hear of the dreadful figures and the permissiveness, promiscuity and depravity in other countries when I think of the bleak fifties when I, and boat loads of Irishmen and women who did not have sex education or a recognition of what we would meet in those permissive times, were shoved abroad because nobody could offer us employment at home.  All we had to rely on was what we were taught by our parents, our own choice miles from home and our own sense of <Col N="618" /> personal responsibility.  We survived.  But in 1985, when young men and women have open communication, thank God. have outlets like windows that showed us light out of the dark tunnel we were in, when they have education beyond what we could hope for or could pay for, it is different.  What is being said to the millions who were shipped from here and lived valuable lives away from here?  I resent what has occurred here in recent days and more than anything, I am angry at the way women once again have been ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House because I have a brief observation to make.  The House is considering an amendment to the Bill that was agreed last night.  That amendment deals with the age at which contraceptives are to be made freely available.  All the efforts made by way of amendment will not in any way improve this Bill.  First, the <Col N="620" /> Minister is not prepared to accept amendments. Second, it is a Bill which cannot be amended without taking away the whole of its principle, which is to make available contraceptives to all over the age of 18, married or single.  This is the first time in the history of this House that a Bill has been passed with the waving of the red flag and the clenched fist outside the gates of Leinster House which, to me, constitutes a most serious problem. Despite the fact that the red flag and clenched fists were waved at Leinster House, with abusive remarks from the crowds outside about members of the Hierarchy and others &mdash; which was despicable to listen to &mdash; we come in here today to endeavour to amend a Bill in relation to contraception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what amendment is put down, no matter what suggestions the Minister may make he can never make contraception right because it is wrong.  No amount of debate or law passed can make a wrong right.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister drawing comparisons with Northern Ireland &mdash; and the references that have been made to Northern Ireland &mdash; one would imagine that the passage of this Bill would solve all of the Northern problems, that the British were delighted with it, that the Northern Unionists and others were delighted also and were applauding the Bill.  I want to place on record the fact that I have received from the British House of Commons today a note of congratulation from a leading member of the British Government which states:</P>
      <P>Please accept my congratulations on your justified stand against the party line on contraception.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with Deputy Kelly but there are Members of this House who endeavour to make this an issue in regard to Southern/Northern co-operation and I want to say &ldquo;ballyhoo&rdquo; to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the availability of contraceptives, with particular reference to the conscientious objection people may have to handling them, dealing in them, distributing them or passing them on, there is contained in this Bill the right to conscientious <Col N="622" /> objection on the part of people who may have strong moral and religious problems in so doing.  Those who administer the law, in health boards, chemist shops or elsewhere may resort to their consciences but the Members of this Dáil passing the Bill may not.  That is a very clear distinction.  My conscience in this regard is very clear.  I went home last evening knowing I had acted in accordance with the God-given right of my conscience and intelligence.  My conscience was very clear when I was getting up this morning, knowing I had done my best to impede what I might describe as a very bad Bill for the common good.  We are not supposed here to legislate for 5 per cent of the people, or for 40 per cent, our job is to legislate for the common good of the majority of our people.  I am quite satisfied that the provisions of this Bill are not in the interests of the majority, that the common good has not been served but rather that an effort has been made to destroy the common good.</P>
    <P>I hold extraordinarily strong views with regard to the amendment of the Bill which no amount of talk or persuasion could change.  Nothing in this world could change my views.  I hold the same views in relation to anti-life measures, abortion, divorce, euthanasia and the death penalty. I feel extremely strongly on these issues.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amendment which deals with the question of the provision of contraceptives for those over 18 I equate my position, in relation to euthanasia, with those over 70 whose lives may be put at risk by the waving of the red flag and the clenched fist in another ten, 20 or 30 years.</P>

      <P>At 5 o'clock this evening the motion will be put: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.  I hope there are people in this House who at least will consult the President in relation to this.  This is something in which the President should actively interest himself with regard to the article of our Constitution which guarantees the protection of the family. This Bill does not guarantee the protection of the family.  Rather it is the very opposite, an effort to undermine the family, taking away from that unit the guarantees provided it under our Constitution.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most disastrous Bills that has come before this House in my lifetime in regard to the common good. It will help to bring about a state of permissiveness among young people already battling strongly against drugs, alcoholism, unfavourable media and many other serious problems all of which place tremendous strain on them.  This section gives the stamp of approval, of decency, of respectability to contraception which is wrong morally, in every respect, which has been condemned, and which can never be made right.  The State, this House, the Oireachtas are now giving the stamp of approval and respectability to contraception.  I hope some consideration will be given to the question of whether all of this is constitutional having regard to the safeguards contained therein for the family.</P>
      <P>I strongly object to this Bill.  I have voted against it, I am happy I did so and can go home happy in that knowledge.  I must live for the rest of my days with my conscience.  I do not know how I could live with myself, having walked into the division lobbies and voted for this Bill when I know I could never be happy again, I could never smile, I could never say I had done everything I could to safeguard our people from the provisions of a Bill which is not for the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall vote against its passage, as I voted yesterday.  If the opportunity arose <Col N="624" /> 50 times over, I would do so because no amount of talk on the part of the Minister, the Opposition or any Deputies &mdash; particularly those who appear to speak with legal or other type of authority &mdash; can make it right.  I never heard any of them contend they could make a wrong right.  Contraception is wrong and no ramount of poppycock talked here can make it right.  I am consistent, I am voting against something which I know is wrong and which the majority of people in this country also know is wrong.</P>

      <P>I listened with great surprise and disappointment to Deputy Barnes.  I heard her yesterday on the radio with representatives of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the federation of Irish women who are non-denominational and representative of all women.  Their views were at variance with hers and I am not making little of women's views by saying that.  Deputy Barnes is making little of the views of women who represent a great cross-section of women.  It was also the first occasion that we heard girls of 16 being referred to as women.  If girls of 16 were capable of looking after themselves in the fashion of their mothers, there would be no need at any level for anxiety or concern regarding the behaviour of our offspring.  Girls of 16 are not women.</P>

He was very concerned and also expressed parents' concern.  He developed that at great length yesterday but, for some unknown reason today, when an amendment which would give him an opportunity of being forthright and honest with his conscience and constituents was introduced, he decided to entertain the House with his ramblings and elucidation of the bona fide drinking of years ago, the brass necks, hard necks and rubber necks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That has happened before.  As far as I know, 13 of the 14 lady Deputies support this legislation.  I found it offensive on Second Stage to hear a Deputy referring to the ephemeral desires of the young men of Ireland, giving the impression that the woman must give in to these uncontrollable desires. <Col N="627" /> It was further said that although a young man would satisfy his lust with this young woman, he would not go back to her when he wanted a marriage partner. I found that statement grossly offensive. As they say in my part of the country, &ldquo;it takes two to tango&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The attitude that has permeated this debate is that women are somehow at fault for any sexual encounter.  We have been brought up to believe, mostly at our mother's knee, that you can flit around as long as you like but when you get married you look for a virgin.</P>
      <P>This debate reminds me of the old missions in the fifties.  I grew up in the swinging sixties, but I remember some of the great missionaries we had in our local parish.  The big night of the mission was always the night the missioner spoke on company keeping.  The debate in this House is absolutely ridiculous, I suppose it goes back to Adam and Eve, but Ireland has grown up in the meantime. Apparently the only sin here is sex.  The media focuses on anything to do with sex, every Member of the House focuses in on it, and so does the Catholic Church. There are many other issues of far more horrendous proportions than the question of sex and morality.  Is anyone suggesting that the people in Northern Ireland who have had these devices, as they were referred to, for many decades are any more degenerate than the people down here?  We are denying the right to freedom of conscience.  The Catholic Church have voted no confidence in the young people as have practically all the bishops.  Many Deputies have also done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have spoken on Second Stage and made my views known.  I am only sorry I did not come in earlier to hear the pontifications of many Members in this matter.  Although I voted against the measure last night &mdash; it was decided by a majority decision of my party that we would oppose this Bill &mdash; I regard it purely as a political matter of no great moment, good bad or indifferent, and I abide by the majority decision.  This Bill is much ado about nothing and if I was <Col N="628" /> not under the Whip of Fianna Fáil I would support the Bill, even though that would have led to further matters which would be extraneous to this House.</P>
    <P>We cannot legislate for goodness.  We cannot legislate for one kind of morality or another.  We live in a normal western democracy and like old King Canute we cannot stop the tide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note where we have come to since this morning. When I was speaking this morning I raised certain issues on the proposed amendment which Deputy O'Hanlon, presumably in all seriousness, has presented to us.  He did not respond to some of the questions I raised.  He indicated to us that in his view not merely married couples but other couples should have access to contraceptives.  Taking into account the amendment he has made limiting that access he has not yet clarified what other couples he has in mind.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of his amendment which seems to have got lost in the context of the debate.  What most Members do not realise is that this amendment is not merely concerned with age but seems also to be concerned with amending the Bill as it passed on Second Stage to reinstate the position of the &ldquo;prescription&rdquo; in the context of non-medical contraceptives.  My reading of the amendment &mdash; the Deputy can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; is that it seeks to reimpose the requirement of a prescription for non-medical contraceptives.  I presume the Deputy wants to return to the situation which my colleague, Deputy Kelly, illustrated so effectively in the context of the importation of luggage.  Presumably he agrees that it is for the common good that people seeking non-medical contraceptives go to their doctor, who looks into the whites of their eyes to determine not merely their bona fides but how many non-medical contraceptives and condoms they should have access to.  It is interesting to see how important Fianna Fáil seem to regard the retention of the prescription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> I welcome Deputy McCreevy having an opportunity to make a contribution to this debate.  I regret that other Fianna Fáil Members did not have an opportunity. One absent friend from this debate, who has been noticeable outside the House at all stages except to vote, is Deputy Noonan, Opposition spokesman on Agriculture.  On 9 February 1985 in <i>The Irish Times</i>, when dealing with the issue which is of concern to Deputy O'Hanlon and the position of the prescription, he said:</P>
    <P>As ever, we in Fianna Fáil represent the values and traditions that make us Irish and we will continue to do so on your behalf.</P>
    <P>Is one of the things that make us Irish the necessity to acquire a prescription for condoms?  Where is the Deputy?  Has the type of speech he delivered on 9 February resulted in the leader of his party warning him to stay outside&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of a Private Notice Question today.  He has eight minutes and the Minister has four minutes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that has prompted me to put down this private notice question, which you, Sir, so kindly have allowed me to raise on the Adjournment, is the very serious practice that has arisen with regard to the present Govern-ment of interference in the senior executive appointments of State-sponsored companies.  Across the board there has been a growing tendency towards ministerial interference and direction in such appointments.  The example related to this matter is that of the Minister for Agriculture who wrote to the chairman of CBF, the meat marketing board, and directed him not to renew the appointment of the chief executive of that company who has been one of the outstanding food technologists of our time in regard to his expertise and knowledge, that is Dr. O'Sullivan.  His contract has been terminated by the action of the Minister by direct interference with the board via the chairman of the board who was authorised by the Minister to ensure that before his contract period expired Dr. Tony O'Sullivan's contract would not be renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan is aware that only the first part of the question was regarded as qualifying for an Adjournment Debate.  The second part which deals with the appointment of a chief executive does not qualify because no ministerial responsibility is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Ceann Comhairle has stated.  The operative phraseology should be that it is not <Col N="635" /> a ministerial matter and should not be the responsibility of the Minister, but on this occasion, as the chairman of the board and the board themselves can vouch when they consider the ministerial letter, there was no option except to proceed in a certain way on what was basically a direction from the Minister and a suitable reward which subsequently has been given in awarding a directorship of the Turf Club to the chairman of the board concerned.  Apart from that scandal which is quite outrageous, we have the further scandal which forms the major part of the question which I put down and which the Ceann Comhairle has ruled to be in order, that is the decision not to sanction the reappointment of the ICMSA nominee to the board of CBF.  This man, Mr. Nicholas Ryan, has given outstanding service on behalf of the Irish creamery milk suppliers to the board of CBF over the years.  Now, apparently, the Minister has seen fit, again in an arbitrary manner, to interfere and refuse to sanction his appointment.</P>
      <P>I want to quote the relevant section to the Minister to show how he has exceeded his mandate.  Apparently, this Govern-ment do not bother about acting illegally in any way, nor will the press print it if they act illegally in any way.  It is quite clear under the first part of section 6 of the Córas Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979 that the Minister has certain direct ministerial appointments.  The voluntary bodies come into operation under paragraph (b) subsection (1) of section 6 which provides that the board shall consist of members including three persons who shall represent the producers of bovine animals and sheep and who shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of such organisation as the Minister considers to be representative of such producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only out for the Minister in that context is a very careful legislative exclusion of any person belonging to an organisation considered by the Minister not to be a reputable organisation suitable to make such an nomination, but in this case the Minister has rejected the nomination <Col N="636" /> of the major milk producing organisation, the ICMSA, and rejected their nominee, Mr. Nicholas Ryan, who has performed excellently on the board for a number of years.  Presumably in the interest of ensuring that some political hack is appointed, the Minister has rejected the nomination of the ICMSA. He is <i>ultra vires</i> in that regard and is acting illegally unless the ICMSA are considered not to be representative of the producers of bovine animals and milk. In any court of law that would be regarded as a ludicrous proposition. Clearly, within the terms of the subsection, the Minister has a mandatory obligation to appoint the nominee of the major representative organisation.</P>
    <P>Instead, we have a blatant example of the Minister refusing to sanction the appointment of the ICMSA nominee to the major meat marketing board.  This refusal to reappoint the chief executive, who is an outstanding man in the area of food technology, comes at a stage when the board appear to be doing a very good job, at a time when, according to an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 December 1984, in which the CBF report is commented on, there has been a dramatic increase in the exports of vacuum packed beef, an increase of no less than 54 per cent for 1983 bringing the value to £64 million.  The editorial makes the further comment that this significant development is a pointer for the future and underlies what can be achieved by scientific approach and adventerous marketing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is precisely the sort of techniques introduced by Dr. O'Sullivan into his executive position as managing director of CBF.  As Minister for Agriculture, I found CBF and the representatives of the voluntary organisation &mdash; for example Mr. Nicholas Ryan and in particular the chief executive, Dr. Tony O'Sullivan &mdash; to be outstanding in their handling of agricultural marketing in the beef area.  They were outstanding <Col N="637" /> in regard to their marketing expertise and in regard to research into producing products for the market.  Those two people particularly helped me enormously when with the CEO of CBF and members of the board I went to North Africa and opened up the market there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Coras Beostoic agus Feóla Act, 1979, provides that the board of CBF shall include three persons representing <Col N="638" /> the producers of bovine animals and sheep who shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of such organisations as the Minister considers to be representative of such producers. Each member of the board holds office for three years and is eligible for reappointment. The term of office of one of the three members representing producers expires each year.</P>
      <P>The term of office of an ICMSA nominee expired on 30 September last and, as is normal practice, I requested the ICMSA to inform me of their nomination to fill the vacancy.  They gave me a nomination and the IFA concurred with this. I accordingly proceeded to exercise my statutory function and duly made the appointment.</P>
      <P>I accepted the nomination in good faith and I have not heard officially from the ICMSA that they are not happy with this nomination.</P>
      <P>On the point being made by Deputy Lenihan, I have not interfered at any time with the activities of the board of CBF nor suggested in any way that any appointment should be either made or terminated.  In a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday last there was in insinuation that I had interfered.  As a result of that totally incorrect report I issued the following press release:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Deasy, today refuted the insinuation in a report in one of this morning's papers that he gave some form of direction to the board of CBF about the post of chief officer of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter referred to in the press report was a routine one issued from the personnel division of the Department to State-sponsored bodies when contracts or appointments of chief officers are expiring to ensure that the remuneration and other conditions applicable to the post continue to be as recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  The letter to CBF did not in any way suggest or imply that a new appointment should be made.  It asked the board to forward to the Department, for clearance by the Minister <Col N="639" /> and the Minister for the Public Service, a copy of any proposed contract or extension of the existing contract.</P>
    <P>In other words, the letter was routine, the type of letter that is sent always to semi-State bodies when the position of a chief executive is to be filled.  The letter is identical with a letter sent by Deputy Lenihan as Minister for Agriculture on 29 April 1982.  That letter was to the board of the National Stud and concerned the terms of employment of a new manager for the stud.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The appreciation of the US dollar in 1984 is estimated to have added approximately £410 million to the Exchequer's <Col N="578" /> foreign debt when expressed in Irish pound terms.  In 1983, the comparable figure was about £495 million.  When account is taken of the semi-State sector foreign debt the total figure for 1984 was approximately £480 million.  Any losses or gains due to changes in the dollar exchange rate would be realised only when the debt was paid off.</P>
    <P>In so far as borrowing in dollars is concerned, in 1983 a total of $450 million gross was drawn down by the Exchequer. This represented 30 per cent of total gross Exchequer foreign borrowing in that year.  The comparable figures for 1984 were $725 million gross and 34 per cent.</P>

It is regretted that, owing to an oversight on the part of the inspector of taxes, an amended certificate of tax-free allowances to take account of interest payable for the current year which should have been issued to the taxpayer in November 1984, was not issued until 15 February 1985.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy had intended referring to the health boards rather than the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are free to establish from time to time any advisory committees likely to be of assistance to them in the operation of their services.  In some <Col N="581" /> instances boards give financial or personnel support to local care of the aged committees established by voluntary bodies. In addition I might point out that the National Council for the Aged, while not local in character, consists largely of persons, some elderly, involved in services both statutory and voluntary at the local level.  The council has issued a series of reports and held a number of seminars intended for the guidance of those involved in these services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question I would like to say that health boards have the responsibility to co-ordinate the various community and institutional aspects of their services for the aged and to ensure liaison with the voluntary bodies, local authorities and other statutory agencies which may have responsibility in this area.  I accept however, that there is a need to review some aspects of the operation of these services and, in this regard, a small working party being established by my Department will begin work shortly.</P>

A reply to the final query was received on 14 February 1985.  It seems likely that it will now be possible to finalise the registration at an early date.</P>

      <P>Having regard to these priorities for the duration of the plan it is not possible to give any commitment to the provision of a regional college for Wexford.  In this connection it should be noted that the regional technical colleges were originally established to serve designated regions, each region comprising a number of counties or parts thereof.  The northern part of County Wexford is served by Carlow Regional Technical College while the southern part is served by Waterford Regional Technical College.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service provides a full time office at Georges Street in Wexford and part time offices in Enniscorthy, Gorey and New Ross.

The allocation of available National Manpower Services resources (especially staff resources) is kept under regular review to ensure that the best possible service is provided throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the resources allocated to County Wexford are the maximum possible within present constraints and bearing in mind <Col N="596" /> the demands being made on the Manpower Service throughout the State. Should the demand for the services of the Manpower Service in Enniscorthy substantially increase then the question of increasing the attendance by the placement officer would be considered at that stage.</P>
    <P>I should add that priorities and working methods within the National Manpower Service are currently being reviewed so as to ensure that available resources are used to greatest effect.</P>

      <P>There are three broad categories of persons liable for payment of the youth employment levy, namely (i) the PAYE sector, (ii) the self-employed and (iii) farmers.</P>
      <P>As regards the PAYE sector, the amount of levy collected in County Wexford is estimated at £761,000 in the 1983 calendar year and £820,000 in the 1984 calendar year.  These estimates are extremely tentative and are based on PRSI returns by employers in County Wexford and assumptions regarding the distribution of the returns between the youth employment levy and other charges.</P>
      <P>The amount of levy collected from the self-employed in County Wexford was £101,667 in 1983 and £82,471 in 1984.</P>
      <P>The youth levy is collected from farmers on a financial year basis.  £98,497 in Youth Levy was collected from farmers in respect of 1982-83 and £110,094 in respect of 1983-84.  Due to legal and administrative difficulties, these moneys were not collected until 1984.</P>
