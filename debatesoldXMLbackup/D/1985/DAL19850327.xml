    <P>The income ceiling is at present £12,000 and it is proposed to raise this to £13,000 with effect from 6 April, 1985. In determining this, I have taken into account, as required by the Act, the latest <Col N="683" /> information available regarding changes in the average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the last income ceiling figure was adopted. The effect of the increased ceiling is to increase the maximum contribution payable from £120 to £130.  However, the increase of £10 will fall to be paid only by persons whose income exceeds £12,000.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that raising the ceiling level from £12,000 to £13,000 will result in an increase in the amount of contributions to be collected of approximately £2,000,000 in the contribution year 1985-86. Of the estimated additional income, about £200,000 should arise in the calendar year 1985.  The remainder of the additional yield should be paid over in the first quarter of 1986.</P>
    <P>I shall be reviewing shortly the income limit for free hospital consultants' services. I am not in a position as yet to say what this limit will be.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are now responsible for collecting current health contributions from all classes including the farming sector.  Health boards remain responsible for the collection of arrears due from the farming sector for periods up to 6 April 1984.  The cumulative total of these arrears is now assessed at about £10.5 million.  I am most anxious that these arrears and indeed arrears due from other self-employed persons should be collected as soon as possible and help to relieve somewhat the very tight budgetary situation in which we are now.  In the case of arrears due to health boards, final demands have been issued in practically all cases and boards are now selecting cases in which proceedings will be taken if the demands are not met.</P>
    <P>On 1 June 1984 I introduced regulations providing for an admission charge of £100 in the case of persons seeking inpatient services in public hospitals who have not discharged their liabilities for health contributions.  I am satisfied that these regulations were beneficial in inducing defaulters to meet their commitments, but it is not of course possible to quantify the results.  Up to 31 January 1985, £6,600 had been collected under <Col N="684" /> the admission charge scheme.  This figure is not significant and, in fact, bears an inverse relationship to the fundamental objective of the scheme.  I now ask the House to approve of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1985, in draft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The health contributions have been raised each year but this year we should question whether the ceiling should be raised in view of the reduction in the level of services.  The Minister has told us he will collect an extra £2 million this year as a result of raising the ceiling.  In the past year there has been a reduction in the level of services, there has been a reduction in the number of staff employed in hospitals, wards have closed down, local cover is not available and I understand that in this city family doctors have stopped telephoning hospitals for beds for their patients because of all the cutbacks.  On the community side there is a reduction in the level of service, the dental service has been practically abolished and the sight testing scheme has been abolished in practically every health board area.  All of this is causing tremendous hardship for people and I question if it is necessary to increase the health contributions during the current year.</P>
      <P>The health contributions are collected with the 1 per cent youth employment levy and the 1 per cent special levy and up to 1984 they were collected by the health boards.  The Minister of State will be more aware than the Minister of the chaos that exists in rural Ireland where the farming community are getting demands on the basis of estimated income which often bears absolutely no relationship to their real income.  If they get accounts prepared this may cost even more than the demands and they may end up by paying the accountants and also the demand, which in most cases will be reduced after the accounts are prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that many farmers whose income is less than £5,000 have to pay the 1 per cent special levy which does not apply to anybody <Col N="685" /> else earning less than £5,000.  I wonder if he has consulted with the Minister for Finance about this aspect of collecting the health contributions and the levies? The Minister has complained on many occasions that he has not been able to collect by way of the health contributions the amount due to him.  I submit the reason is the chaos that has resulted from the method used to collect health contributions.</P>
    <P>Small businesses and farmers in particular are getting arrears demands from the health boards and new demands from the Revenue Commissioners but these bear no relation to each other on the basis of the estimated income of the farming community.  We have raised this matter on many occasions in the past two years since we were first told that the Revenue Commissioners would be involved.  It is very disappointing that this morning the Minister should tell us the same as we were told last year about the method of collection and the system used.  Will he state the position in view of the fact that the Government propose to introduce a land tax?  I thought one of the benefits of a land tax to the farming community would be that they would not have to prepare accounts, that their contribution would be based on their acreage or adjusted acreage.  They will still have to prepare accounts in order to have their health contributions and the two other levies collected.  The Minister should have dealt with this problem because we have raised it in this House on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>Will there be a different method of collection next year for the self-employed and the farmers and if they have arrears will they receive demands from the health boards, the Revenue Commissioners or from some other source?  It should never have been a function of the health boards to collect this money and they did not benefit from it.  The Minister should tell us of his proposals in view of the changed method of collecting tax from the farming community as announced by the Government and as appeared in the document <i>Building on Reality.</i> I am disappointed there has been nothing in the Minister's <Col N="686" /> speech this morning dealing with the matter of collection in 1986.</P>
    <P>The Minister should announce this morning the ceiling for benefit.  He said that was being reviewed and would be announced in due course.  I see no reason why the Minister should not tell us what will be the increase.  I know the benefit does not take effect until June but we should be told this morning the ceiling for benefit and what increase the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he had collected £6,600 by way of the £100 hospital admission charge.  To quote him, he expressed concern that &ldquo;the figure is not significant and bears an inverse relationship to the fundamental objective of the scheme&rdquo;. One of the reasons the figure is not significant is that many people cannot get into hospital because of ward closures and a reduction in the level of services.  I ask the Minister if it is reasonable of him to collect an extra £2 million of tax at a time when there is a serious reduction in the level of services directly as a result of government policy.  This not the fault of the health boards.  As the Minister of State knows, in his own area they had three or four meetings before they were able to agree on the budget for 1985 and they will still be £2 million or £3 million in deficit at the end of next year.  I question if there is justification at this time when we are reducing services to collect another £2 million from those who are liable for health contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to raise the health contribution ceiling from £12,000 to £13,000.  Health contributions are levied at 1 per cent on income up to a fixed income ceiling.  This means that as from 6 April 1985 the contribution will be 1 per cent of £13,000.  Does this mean that for those eligible for hospital services the level will also increase?  In his speech the Minister said the matter will be reviewed shortly but from past experience I have no doubt that the eligibility ceiling will also be raised.  In other words, a further group will be added to those who are catered for in the general hospital services which are already totally <Col N="687" /> inadequate.  We know how these services have suffered during the reign of this Government, and in particular of this Minister for Health.  There has been a massive 20 per cent increase in the price of private and semi-private accommodation since last Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is now cheaper to stay in the best hotel in Dublin than in any county hospital. Perhaps this is a way around our inadequate hospital building plan.  Perhaps the people in Waterford waiting for our hospital should consider renting the Ardee or the Tower Hotel to cater for our patients.  Last November the Minister increased the cost of private and semi-private accommodation by 20 per cent, forcing many eligible people who prior to that had opted for VHI cover to go back into the already over-burdened health service, a service ill equipped to cater for the demands placed on it.  By raising the ceiling by an additional 8½ per cent the Minister will place a further burden on that service.  Pay increases this year have been around 3 per cent so by increasing the eligibility ceiling level to £13,000 the Minister will ensure a marked increase in the numbers availing of the general hospital services.  There will be a significant increase in the numbers seeking these services which do not exist by virtue of the health cuts and other economic measures being implemented.</P>
      <P>There will be a shortfall of £40 million to the eight health boards this year.  In spite of that we are now going to provide less money to run the service and we are introducing legislation which will bring about an increase in the number of people demanding the service.  That sort of economic madness will not work.  If we are going to increase the demands on the service continually we must provide the funds to run the service.  The Government have not done this.  I am unhappy that in the midst of the severest of cutbacks and the virtual dismantling of the health service the Minister still has the audacity to increase the charges.</P>

      <P>The farming sector <Col N="688" /> have been unfairly assessed in relation to this scheme.  I would have thought I would have had the sympathy of the Minister of State.  Deputy Donnellan, who comes from a rural constituency. The farmers are being assessed before allowances for capital depreciation.  We are unique in Europe in assessing farmers in that way.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the scheme is amended.  Then we would get the co-operation of the farming community and all arrears would be paid.  I understand that numerous meetings have taken place in the Departments of Health and Finance with the farming organisations.  I appeal to the Minister to amend this area in the interests of the community.  It is giving a wrong impression to the community in general.</P>

      <P>The same numbers of people will be eligible.  Both Deputies O'Hanlon and O'Keeffe talked about the farmers and this seems to be where the biggest problem exists in relation to health contributions.  From the inception of the health contributions, health boards were responsible for the collection of contributions from farmers.  On the introduction of the income related scheme it was not possible to establish the actual <Col N="689" /> income of farmers.  Having regard to the fact that the coverage on farmers for income tax purposes was limited, accordingly a notional system of rateable valuation and a multiplier was used to determine farm income for health contribution purposes.  In July 1982 the High Court ruled that the RV system of determining liability for agricultural rates was unconstitutional.  While the High Court decision did not specifically invalidate the system of assessment for farm income for health contribution purposes, it was felt that cases challenged in the courts were likely to succeed.  The relevant regulations were amended in February 1983 to allow health boards assess farm income on a factual basis.</P>
      <P>In relation to the procedures adopted by the health boards a revised system of assessment operates on the basis that the Revenue Commissioners supply the health boards with income data on farmers in the income tax net and on farmers not in the tax net but asked to declare their farm income.  The health boards issued demands in 1983 and in 1984 for arrears due.  Basically because of the poor response to requests for income particulars health boards had no option but to proceed to determine liability using such information as was available in relation to a farmer's income including the income previously determined by health contributions for previous years and the known income level in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards have power under article 18 of the Health Contribution Regulations, 1979 to determine income where the information regarding a person's income is not available or forthcoming. Any farmer who disputes the amount demanded is welcome to supply evidence to the board in support of a contention that the income determined by the board is overstated.  Arrears outstanding due to the introduction of the factual assessment system have to be redetermined on a factual basis.  It was felt that the simplified procedures should be adopted to avoid farmers having to supply data on actual income for the years in question. Accordingly, farmers were given the option of paying arrears for 1979-80 and <Col N="690" /> 1980-81 on the basis already demanded, on the basis of the RV multiplier.  In the case of arrears for 1981-82 and for 1982-83 health boards redetermined liability taking into account any information they had in regard to an individual farmer's income and known farm income in the area.  The income previously determined for health contribution purposes was also taken into account.</P>
    <P>On 31 January 1985 farmers owed a total £10,625,617 to health boards. About £30,390,662 was owed to the collector general by self-employed persons. Those figures include farming arrears for 1984-85.  These amounts were based on initial assessments of the income and cover prevailing since the introduction of the scheme in 1971.  It is expected that in many cases the arrears will be reduced considerably.  Any criticism of the situation in relation to the self-employed is a matter for the Minister for Finance. Health boards are currently selecting cases, as far as farmers are concerned, in which court proceedings are likely to be taken in the near future.  Penalties attached to the health contribution collecting system are as follows: any person who knowingly makes any false statement or conceals any material fact shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  Where a person fails to pay a health contribution he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.  I should like to tell Deputy O'Keeffe that on the basis of the new factual assessment, farmers' incomes are determined on the same basis as that of other self-employed persons.  Farm income subject to health contributions is profits from farming activities after deducting expenses such as rent, rates, wages paid out, repairs to machinery and equipment, purchases of seed, fertilisers and so on, business interests and stock relief.  Any sum paid towards a superannuation fund is also allowable, but depreciation, including capital allowances such as on plant or equipment, expenditure on construction of fences, roadways, holding <Col N="691" /> yards, drains or land reclamation and expenditure on construction of farm houses or farm buildings may not be offset against profits when determining income for health contribution purposes.</P>

This expenditure was allowed against income for income tax purposes but failure to do so for contribution purposes has given rise to sustained protests from the farming organisations, particularly the ICMSA, many of whose members have invested heavily in capital projects in recent years. The answer of course is that capital allowances are not offset against income by any other sector of the population for contribution purposes and there is no good reason why any exception should be made in the case of farmers.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, on the face of it, the relatively simple and straightforward one of statutorily underpinning a holding company formed on behalf of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  However, the Bill also forms part of the basis for the action taken by the Government in the past fortnight to avoid the collapse of a large insurance company.  In my contribution to this stage of the Bill, I intend to concentrate on both the general background and the specific circumstances which gave rise to the draft legislation now before the House.  I will be commenting on the serious problems of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which have come to light in recent weeks together with the attendant implications for the Allied Irish Banks Group; the choices open to the Government and the corrective action taken to deal with these particular difficulties; and the arrangements likely to be made to enable the insurance company to be restored to a sound commercial footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to start by referring to the position of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  We are dealing with an established company of almost 50 years standing trading in a market in which they had long experience.  In these respects they differed from a newly authorised undertaking or a relatively recent entrant to the non-life insurance market, in which <Col N="693" /> cases the supervisory process applied involves particularly close monitoring of operations over the formative years of the enterprises concerned.  By contrast, ICI were a company whose state was satisfactory over a long period of years. The company were trading normally, had a consistent track record of steady profitability and were disclosing a very comfortable surplus of assets over the required solvency margin.  Prior to 1984 they had a broadly based board of directors representative of their various shareholding interests; these included American and Dutch insurance interests and other institutional investors, including Allied Irish Banks.  Since September 1983 ICI were under the full control and ownership of AIB.</P>
    <P>I should explain briefly here the manner in which my Department supervise insurance companies.  The Department receive the accounts of insurers annually and undertake detailed analysis of the information supplied in relation to the different classes of insurers' business. The examination undertaken by my Department does not and cannot substitute for the role of statutory auditors.  It would be unreasonable to expect that the State should provide resources to double-check on the work done by auditors.  My Department's work is, rather, an independent outside test on the information supplied.  This is in line with the supervisory practice for insurance internationally.</P>
    <P>Arising from the tests applied to ICI my Department began to be concerned about the adequacy of the technical claims reserves set up by the company in relation to its Irish business.  During 1983 the Department communicated formally to ICI their concern at this particular aspect of the company's operations.  The company indicated in reply that they had learned that they had not made adequate allowance for the development of some very large cases which worsened unexpectedly; they had strengthened reserves to make additional allowance for this type of potential development and they hoped <Col N="694" /> that the provisions would prove adequate.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the assurances of the company, the Department decided to examine the 1983 accounts of ICI on a priority basis when received.  These accounts were duly submitted on 26 June 1984.  Based on the 1983 accounts as submitted, ICI held free assets of £56 million, equivalent to a surplus of 124 per cent over and above the statutory solvency margin required.</P>
    <P>Following their analysis of these accounts in July 1984, the Department were not satisfied that adequate provision was made in the company's 1983 accounts for outstanding claims on their Irish business. This aspect of the accounting returns was gone into in considerable detail at a meeting between the Department and company representatives on 17 August 1984.</P>
    <P>The responses of the ICI representatives at that meeting were considered inadequate by the Department, and the company was requested to provide further detailed information on the outstanding claims provisions struck for Irish business.  The Department had already decided to engage a firm of consulting actuaries to undertake an examination of the Irish technical claims reserves of ICI. Discussions between the Department and the firm in question took place during September 1984.  The study commenced in early October, and representatives of AIB and ICI were formally advised of this at a meeting with my Department on 14 November 1984.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the meeting in November was to discuss the insurance company's results contained in the interim report of the Allied Irish Banks Group for the half year ended 30 September 1984, which were being released at that time.  At the meeting in question, it was indicated to my Department that AIB had decided to strengthen the outstanding claims provisions of ICI by £23 million as at 30 June 1984 and that the bank would be taking immediate action to strengthen the capital base of the insurance company arising from this depletion <Col N="695" /> of their free reserves.  The specific question of the London branch business of ICI was raised at that meeting also, and the Department were assured that while there were problems with the London branch, corrective measures were being taken to rectify matters; furthermore, there was no under-reserving apparent in the London claims reserves.</P>
    <P>In December 1984 the issued share capital of ICI was increased by £40 million, of which £30 million was fully paid up by AIB.  Subsequently, in a report dated January 1985 the actuarial firm engaged by my Department confirmed that the reserves of ICI in relation to their Irish business, as strengthened, were adequate.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, the above facts speak for themselves.  In relation to their supervisory functions, my Department acted quickly and with diligence in recognising the claims reserving problems facing ICI on their Irish business, following which corrective action by way of identifying the shortfall and a substantial injection of fresh capital took place in December 1984.  Although not directly within their area of supervisory competence, my Department also raised questions with AIB and ICI representatives in relation to the London branch operations of the insurance company, and received assurances that there was no under-reserving on London business, and, furthermore, that corrective measures to improve the current trading experience of the London branch were being implemented.  The Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom had not communicated any concerns to my Department in relation to the UK branch business of ICI. Given this fact and in the light of the reassurances received from AIB and ICI at the meeting in November 1984, my Department had no reason to question matters further at that stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that I am not imputing any dereliction of supervisory functions on the part of the United Kingdom supervisory authority.  Indeed, I understand that the UK branch accounts of ICI for 1983 disclosed a <Col N="696" /> surplus of some £19 million sterling in admissible assets over branch liabilities. Furthermore, the UK branch accounts were not qualified in any respect by the statutory auditors.</P>
    <P>It is clear in the relatively short space of time that has elapsed since November 1984, that there were serious problems with the London branch business of ICI in particular, about which the former owners were unaware and which had not come to light at that stage.</P>
    <P>New auditors were appointed to ICI in mid-December 1984.  Detailed audit work got under way in January 1985 and by early February the auditors realised that there were serious deficiencies in the information systems and database covering the London branch operations of ICI. Once AIB were advised of this, they immediately ordered an accelerated programme by a special investigating team to establish, as far as possible, the true financial position of ICI's London branch.</P>
    <P>By the first week of March 1985, the results of this investigation had led AIB to conclude that ICI had very serious problems with their London branch operation.  AIB notified both the Central Bank and my Department of the position at separate meetings on Friday, 8 March. By letter dated 15 March 1985 the board of ICI notified me that they had concluded that as at 31 December 1984 the company did not comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations in a material respect, and that this position still obtained.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the ultimate decision reached by the Government in relation to the problems of ICI, I would like to state that I consider that the management of AIB acted promptly and responsibly in bringing the matter to the attention of my Department.  I have to say more than this, however.  It is almost incomprehensible and more than a little disquieting that it apparently took so long for senior management in both ICI and AIB to begin to realise that there might be fundamental problems with the London branch operations of the insurance company, <Col N="697" /> which after all accounted for about 70 per cent of total business in gross terms.  This is even more difficult to understand when one considers that problems had arisen within the head office operations of ICI in Ireland, and corrective measures were taken during 1984.  The facts are far from clear even at this stage, and it is difficult to say how much of the London branch's problems arose while AIB were a minority shareholder and how much actually arose during 1984, at which stage ICI were under the full control and ownership of AIB.  It is obvious that a serious lack of management control, particularly in relation to the flow of information between London and Dublin, contributed in no small measure to the present problem.  If the problem had been spotted and the position established at an earlier date, then the magnitude of the present difficulties would not be as great.  The belated realisation that there were problems in London is, therefore, all the more disappointing.</P>
    <P>The problem which came to light in ICI was one which called for urgent, firm and decisive action.  The Government decided on 15 March 1985 to acquire ICI from the Allied Irish Banks Group for a nominal sum by a company controlled by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  The provisions applying to this holding company, Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta, form the greater part of the Bill now before this House.  An administrator was appointed provisionally by the High Court to take over the business of ICI on the evening of 15 March and the High Court confirmed the order for administration at a sitting on Monday last, 25 March.  The purpose of the take-over and administration of ICI was to ensure the continuation of the insurance business and the protection of all policyholders.</P>
    <P>The Government decision offered the best solution to the problems which arose within ICI and which could have had serious implications for the insurance market generally.  Other companies in the market could not readily have absorbed the market share held by ICI, particularly in the critically important <Col N="698" /> employer and public liability classes.  Furthermore, it was the view of the Government that it would not be feasible for the parent company, Allied Irish Banks, to undertake the addition financial commitment and other reorganisation measures required to restore ICI to an even keel; the bank could not prudently persist in the attempt to resolve the problems of ICI without the risk of adverse effects on their banking operations.</P>
    <P>The placing of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland under administration, and the funding of that operation, are covered by existing legislation, that is the Insurance Act, 1964, and the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983.  These Acts provide the statutory powers for the appointment of the administrator by the High Court on the petition of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and for the provision of moneys from the insurance compensation fund to enable the administrator to carry on the business of the company as a going concern.  I would remind the House that the administrator is appointed by, and carries out his duties under the supervision of the High Court. The insurance compensation fund is administered by the accountant of the High Court under that court's jurisdiction. The entire process of administration, therefore, is under the control of the court.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of the full investigation of the company now being undertaken under the direction of the administrator, it is difficult to say with certainty where the blame lies for the problems facing the company.  However, I have already referred to the lack of adequate information systems and of management control, particularly in relation to the London branch of the company. It appears that the information supplied by the London branch to their supervisory authority and to their head office in Dublin did not reflect the true position of the business being transacted in the branch.  The investigation now in progress is intended to establish how far the true position differs from the reported position.</P>
    <P>The problems which have come to light <Col N="699" /> in this case clearly raise the most serious questions about the role of management, directors, shareholders and of auditors of companies.  The chain of responsibility is clear.  The primary responsibility for ensuring the satisfactory conduct of company affairs lies with the shareholders and is exercised through the directors and management of the company.  The secondary responsibility for the correct presentation of the financial activities and standing of any company rests on the auditors.  In the case of the more important financial institutions, such as insurance and banking, the State has a tertiary responsibility.  The tertiary responsibility must obviously involve the State, through its various agencies, in laying down certain minimum standards and in assessing the adequacy of the systems and the competence of persons involved in the first and second stages of responsibility.  The State's role also involves, in the case of insurance, examination of the information supplied by insurers and auditors as required by statute.</P>
    <P>The failings which have been disclosed in the present case confirm the need to proceed quickly with a redefinition of the statutory responsibilities of directors and of auditors.  The Government have already approved the provisions to be included in a major reform of companies legislation and drafting has been proceeding apace.  I have now directed that those aspects of the full Bill which are of special relevance to the points which I have been making should now be finalised as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes in the area of company responsibility, I will also be giving special attention to an assessment of the supervisory role of my own Department. This will involve a full review of the frequency and quality of the information required from insurers, and of the technical capacity of my Department to assess such information.  I am particularly concerned that my Department should have access to statistical and actuarial expertise in the examination of accounts and other information supplied by insurers. I might add that the non-life insurance <Col N="700" /> industry in general could also benefit from much greater use of expertise of this type which has tended to date to be concentrated in life assurance companies.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to speak in definitive terms about the precise financial position of ICI.  The company audit is in progress and the administrator estimates that it will take at least six weeks to clarify matters.  Based on the company's own draft unaudited accounts, it appears that losses in 1984 will amount to at least £65 million, resulting in a minimum deficit of £25 million in the shareholders' funds in the company balance sheet.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to make it clear that one should be extremely wary of various amounts being bandied about in recent days.  Such figures are speculative and some of the orders of magnitude are so astronomical as to be totally unrealistic. Such speculation as there has been about possible losses in the company has not been based on the information derived by those who have examined the company's affairs.  This information, from those who have been in the company, is the only sound basis on which any decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>While I have stressed that the information available is not definitive, I must say that on the basis of all the facts known at present there are no grounds for believing that the losses incurred fall outside the range of £50 million to £120 million.  I have to stress that I mention £120 million as the known upper limit of losses and not in any circumstances as the most likely figure.  There is no information known to the Government which would place the losses outside these parameters and all of the Government's actions are based on these figures which I have stressed are the only reliable information available.</P>
    <P>As has already been made clear, any financial assistance required by the administrator will be provided by means of the insurance compensation fund. Until such time as the exact financial position of ICI is verified, it is pointless to speak other than in general terms about the likely funding requirements. <Col N="701" /> For the purposes of the administration of ICI, the compensation fund will be financed on a broad basis by a number of special arrangements involving Allied Irish Banks, the banking and insurance sectors generally, and if necessary, and only as a last resort, the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it would be productive to enter into speculation now as to the exact distribution of the burden between the different sources of financing until the precise extent of the burden is known.  Any measures to be introduced, involving levies on the banking and insurance sectors, will of course have to be debated and approved in this House.</P>
    <P>An important focus in this debate will be on the contribution by Allied Irish Banks to the rescue of ICI.  As the owner of ICI they should, in the normal course, meet the entire cost.  In fact they are contributing as follows.  First, writing off their total acquisition cost of ICI, resulting in a loss of £86 million.  Second, a major share of any damages arising out of legal proceedings against the former auditors of ICI to go to the State.  Third, interest subsidies of £6 million on a £50 million loan over three years.  Fourth, an additional interest free loan of £20 million, worth almost £3 million per year at current interest rates.  Fifth, the purchase price of £2½ million paid for Credit Finance Bank which they had &ldquo;sold&rdquo; with ICI for £5.  Sixth, the sale of a 20 per cent shareholding in the profitable and healthy Insurance Corporation Life, also for £5. Seventh, the biggest share in any bank levy that may be imposed.</P>
    <P>I would explain that the interest free loan of £20 million which AIB have placed with the Central Bank as stakeholder is in respect of the contingent liability undertaken by the State in respect of a guarantee to the Institute of London Underwriters.  This is provided for in section 14 of the Bill.  In the event of any liability arising in excess of designated reserves, the amount involved will be deducted from the £20 million before the balance is repaid to AIB.  This is the additional contribution by the bank to which reference was made over the past <Col N="702" /> weekend; it is worth, as I have said, £3 million per year at current interest rates.</P>
    <P>The amount which should be paid by AIB is, of course, open to debate.  The Central Bank, whose job it is to assure the soundness of our banking system, were involved in the discussions leading to the decision to rescue ICI.  Their strong view, as a regulator of the banking industry, was that the contribution by the bank that I have already outlined was the limit of what AIB could prudently be expected to make at this time.  The Central Bank were also most anxious that there should be certainty about AIB's liabilities, as uncertainty would be damaging to the bank and to the financial system generally.  The Government and this House must give due weight to the advice of the Central Bank who have been charged by both Houses of the Oireachtas with the responsibility of ensuring the soundness of the banking system.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House that if AIB had never bought ICI, the problems we now face would still be there.  All of ICI's losses would ultimately have to be met from the Irish headquarters of ICI.  This would inevitably have led to the crash of the company.  But, in those circumstances, there would have been no recourse to any bank for help.  No preferential loans and no bank levies would then have been available.  Instead, we would have been faced with the even more stark choice of either the collapse of an insurance company covering up to a quarter of the workers in the country for employers liability or the insurance sector and the Government, alone and without any help from the banking sector, having to resolve the entire problem.  This did not happen, and it is at this stage only a hypothetical situation.  But it is a very enlightening hypothesis.</P>
    <P>Let me return now to the actual circumstances of the present case, and the choice faced by the Government two weeks ago.  If the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, had gone into liquidation this would have had consequences for the bank itself as well.  A bank itself is borrowing money all the time.  The <Col N="703" /> terms on which banks can borrow depend critically on their standing as a bank who will, in all cases, be able to repay these loans.  They get much better terms than ordinary companies because they have this standing.  If a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank collapsed, the terms on which the bank could then borrow would immediately be affected.  If this happened all of those who borrowed from the bank would also suffer.  I believe that we have rescued not the shareholders of the AIB, but their customers, the public at large, and the policyholders of the ICI.</P>
    <P>AIB remain a strong financial institution, despite the heavy losses which they incurred on the ICI fiasco.  The AIB board have announced that they will maintain their dividend despite the losses.  While I personally regard this as a somewhat insensitive announcement, highlighting the bank's much greater concern for shareholders than for the policyholders with the ICI, or for the general public, I am advised that a cut in dividend would be taken in the stock markets here and abroad as a signal &mdash; in this case false &mdash; that the underlying strength of the AIB was somehow damaged.</P>
    <P>Confidence of this kind is very important in international financial circles.  As a country which borrows substantially abroad, it is vital that our financial institutions be seen to be strong.  The continuing uncertainty as to the bank's potential liabilities and the resultant speculation would have held many dangers for the bank.  Other proposed solutions involving meetings of financial institutions generally or an extraordinary general meeting of the bank would have lacked the confidentiality and the speed necessary for an effective rescue.  This ruled out some other solutions to the problem which might otherwise have been attractive.</P>
    <P>Turning to the arrangements for financing the rescue of ICI, there are a number of general points which have to be made.  I understand that the company have good liquidity at present and that the need for a substantial cash injection is not foreseen in the immediate future. It should be made clear that the losses <Col N="704" /> will not all have to be made good in any one year.  Finance will be required according as claims fall due to be paid over a period.  The administrator will use his commerical judgment as to how to obtain the best return for the company from the assets available to him.</P>
    <P>The commitments of contributions from Allied Irish Banks which have already been received will go a considerable distance towards financing the rescue.  It is the intention that the insurance and banking sectors should make a substantial contribution to the cost of the rescue also.  The precise form and extent of this contribution will be settled when a firmer indication of the size and incidence of the losses have been established.</P>
    <P>The idea that companies in sectors such as banking and insurance should contribute to saving the deposits and policies of failed companies is not a novel one.  It is normal in the case of rescues of financial institutions elsewhere that other companies in the same sector contribute to keeping particular businesses going where their failure would cause dramatic damage in the particular financial market generally.</P>
    <P>The insurance sector as it stands faces substantial underwriting losses in a number of classes, not least the employers and public liability classes in which ICI have a 25 per cent market share.  The cost of insurance cover and the problem of availability of cover at an economic price in some cases have been matters of serious concern to me for some time past. This is obviously an aspect which has to be considered in the context of a possible further levy on insurance.  The higher the cost the greater is the prospect of people taking the risk of doing without insurance cover.  The Government have been conscious of this danger in planning their response to the crisis in ICI.  In order to deal with the cost of insurance premia, the Government have decided to modify the right of access to decisions by jury on the extent of damages for personal injuries.  The Minister of Justice will be bringing detailed proposals before the Government on the matter.</P>
    <P>While dealing with this matter I should <Col N="705" /> also refer to some reckless statements which have been made in the past fortnight to the effect that ICI was not the only insurer which is in trouble at present. I have to say quite categorically that statements of this type should not be made unless there is very sound evidence for them and, so far as I am aware, there is no such evidence.  I trust that in debating this matter Deputies will take a responsible attitude and will not cause any doubts to be raised which might further damage confidence in this important sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>I know that others in the banking sector and in the insurance sector feel that it is unfair that they should have to pay the penalty for failures by other members of the same sector.  They will claim that this is almost a reward for imprudence.  While I can understand this sense of grievance, I would say to the financial institutions in question that they must understand that the taxpayer who is not even in the same sector would have an even greater sense of grievance at having to pay the cost. The sector as a whole must benefit from the existence of some form of mutual assistance, hence in this case of necessity it is right to turn to the banking and insurance sectors for a contribution. Although it is too early yet to give any guarantee on this point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In this regard the position will be reviewed in the light of the audit and of the claims experienced as they emerge over time.  We will have to assess the situation again not later than 31 December 1985, and AIB have agreed that, should the emerging position be deemed to warrant it, they are prepared to extend the term of the £50 million subsidised loan facility for a further period not exceeding two years.  This further arrangement takes account of the uncertainties that are inherent in insurance affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that on this side of the House we find the speech which has just been delivered by the Minister pathetically inadequate.  The legislation which was published late yesterday told us absolutely nothing about this situation and how it was to be dealt with.  The Minister's speech today was eagerly awaited both in this House and outside it and, indeed, at home and abroad, to give an outline of the situation and how the Government propose to deal with it.  The speech we have just heard from the Minister is not the authoritative authentic statement by the Government which the situation urgently calls for.  We find the speech in many aspects vague and indefinite to the point of being insulting to this House.  For instance, on the key, crucial issue of the financing of the losses of the ICI there is nothing but vague, indefinite statements by the Minister.  He talks about it being unproductive to speculate about the contributions that different sectors will make to making up these losses.  This House wants to know precisely how these losses are going to be made good.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister, after everybody has waited for 12 days to hear from him, to come into this House this morning and tell us in effect that he is not going to give us any information about this key, central matter and that he does not intend to speculate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we to make of a Minister who in a speech dealing with such a serious, <Col N="707" /> far-reaching situation, enters into a hypothetical situation?  He spent some time telling us what might have happened if AIB had not taken over ICI.  Of what importance is that?  AIB took over the ICI, and that situation resulting from that takeover and from the operation of the ICI confronts us today as a stark reality. It is absolutely ludicrous for a Minister charged with the serious responsibility that the Minister has in this matter to indulge in flights of hypothetical fancy.</P>
    <P>When we come to the extent of the losses with which we are confronted and have to deal with, again a crucial factor in this, there is a vagueness which borders on the irresponsible.  We are told that the losses are somewhere between £50 million and £120 million.  Is the Minister seriously asking this House to accept that sort of parameter?  The loss is somewhere between £50 million and £120 million. These are astronomical figures and it is not good enough to ask the House and the public to accept such a range in a matter of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reference to jury actions and changes in that regard is typical of the approach of the Government to matters of fundamental importance.  Is that any way to do business?  People have been talking for a considerable time about a need for a change in that area and for taking certain responsibilities away from juries, but nothing has happened.  Now in the middle of a crisis we get this <i>ad hoc</i> statement from the Minister that something is going to be done about it.  That is no way to run a country and conduct its affairs, to throw in the middle of a pathetic attempt to deal with this critical and crucial situationa a suggestion of that sort.  Whereas many of us might welcome it, it is not something to be pitched in here as a makeweight in a critical and dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>The story of the collapse of the ICI, the second largest insurance corporation in this State and a major subsidiary of the largest bank in the country, and the Government's handling of this matter have been from the beginning and still are confused and confusing.  The announcement <Col N="708" /> came as a major shock on the Friday before last, late in the evening after most businesses and financial institutions had closed.  It was, of course, immediately hailed as the biggest financial disaster in the history of the State. Allied Irish Banks is one of the two principal pillars on which the Irish commercial banking system rests and the fact that one of its subsidaries could collapse is, naturally, of very great concern to everyone.</P>
    <P>A stunned country was informed that the Government had intervened and taken the Insurance Corporation of Ireland out of the hands of AIB, had taken responsibility for its future and presumably for its debts, present and potential. The clear implication was that this extraordinary step had been taken to ensure that one of the important pillars of our banking system would not be damaged in its credit or standing by having to stay with a potentially disastrous situation in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  As the principal Opposition party, we immediately took a definite, responsible attitude and indicated that as the Government had said they were acting in the national interest we would, in order to avoid a crisis of conscience, make it clear that we would take the Government at their word and offer whatever parliamentary support was necessary to overcome the difficulty and protect the financial institutions of the State and the country's creditworthiness.</P>
    <P>After the initial dramatic announcement the situation developed along curious lines.  In the absence of any authoritative statement from the Government, the AIB's version of the situation was the one that came across to the public.  Statements by the bank caused a great deal of public concern, resentment and anger.  There was an unfortunate hint of smugness in the stance adopted by the bank.  They were at pains to indicate that despite any blunder they may have made they had now ensured that the State was assuming responsibility for whatever losses would <Col N="709" /> arise.  Having written off their original investment they no longer had any exposure and were in a position to carry on happily, pay a full dividend to their shareholders and have everything right in two years time or so.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any clear authentic statement from the Government this naturally caused a major public outcry.  The public got the impression that once again the banks would be allowed to get away with the cream while the State, and ultimately the taxpayer, would be left to pay for the bank's mistakes and make good any losses involved.  For a long week rumour reigned supreme.  The Government stayed silent.  Estimates of the extent of the losses of ICI ranged from £50 million to astronomical sums.  We were blandly assured by the Government that legislation was taking time to prepare because the situation was complex and complicated.  We now find that it is not complex and could have been prepared by a skilled draftsman in one afternoon if he or she had been given instructions.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that we on this side of the House did not, after the first indication given to us by the Government, have any additional information which was not available to the general public or any Deputy in the House.  We are confronted in this debate with the difficulty of trying to make up our minds and take decisions on the basis of a very inadequate presentation of the case by the Minister, a very scanty outline of the facts and certainly with no clear indication of how the matter will be dealt with from here on.</P>
    <P>Since this crisis broke, we on this side have tried to achieve three objectives. First of all, we wanted to protect the security and status of the financial institutions of the State, both public and private. Secondly, we wanted to protect the interests of the taxpayers and ensure that the taxpayers were not compelled, directly or indirectly, to assume responsibility and pay the bill for something which was not of their making and for which they had no responsibility.  Thirdly, we wanted to press for a full investigation, <Col N="710" /> review and assessment of the insurance industry and to try to have whatever action was needed taken to put that industry on a sound footing capable of serving our community, providing the protection necessary and eliminating, once and for all, any further possibility of more of these disastrous developments with which we are confronted here.</P>
    <P>On the first objective, we recognised clearly that it was our responsibility to handle this situation with care, restraint and prudence.  We saw that an insensitive political response on our part might jeopardise the position even further.  It was an obviously sensitive situation in which confidence was a key factor.  This party is there to serve the best interests of the nation whether we are in Opposition or in Government.  We intend always to discharge that responsibility.</P>
    <P>I claim that we have discharged it and will continue to discharge it in this situation. We refrained from saying many of the things we would have wished to say and which we would normally say in a political situation of this kind.  Our experience told us that the world of finance is a fragile one, suspicious, volatile and prone to rumour and speculation, where incautious words can do great damage.  We had all these things in mind in our reaction to the position.  The financial world is one where trust and confidence are everything.  It is important that the world at large should see whatever else can be said about politics in this country the Oireachtas was prepared, where necessary, to give any support needed when the Government could indicate that it was taking action in the national interest.</P>
    <P>We were also very clear in our minds that this situation would not involve the taxpayer.  The private financial sector is the strongest, most privileged and prosperous sector in the entire economy.  It earns large profits, has access to vast resources, has adequate reserves and has a very special legally protected position. If a mistake is made involving major losses, then those losses could and should be borne by that private financial sector <Col N="711" /> and not by the taxpayer.  It would be an absurdity, an unacceptable injustice and totally ridiculous if the general public, the great majority of whom have never benefited one iota from banking profits and many of whom have had very unhappy experiences at the hands of bankers, were asked to step in and take up an additional burden because of someone else's mistakes &mdash; mistakes made in this very specially privileged sector of our economy.  The taxpayer, God knows, is already heavily burdened.  At this time the Irish taxpayer is carrying a burden of taxation which is unprecedented in the history of the State.  Anyone who suggests that the taxpayer &mdash; and I use the present tense advisedly &mdash; is going to be responsible now or in the future for any element of this situation will come up against this party in a very real way.</P>
    <P>The third aspect of this situation with which we concerned ourselves, our third objective, was to ensure the best interests of the industry itself.  Nobody in the Government or in the public service can attempt to suggest that this development came out of a clear blue sky, that it was totally unheralded and could not have been suspected or anticipated.  There were many warnings and many references from many different directions that all was not fully safe and well in the insurance world.  The specialist magazines had contained many articles, some of them now, it transpires retrospectively, very accurate articles, about the dangers inherent in the situation.</P>
    <P>In particular after the collapse of the PMPA everyone in the industry and especially in the Government service should have been alert to the danger inherent in the situation.  It was raised here at the time the PMPA legislation was brought in.  Questions were asked subsequently if there was any further danger and if all the other institutions were safe and secure.  I am afraid that, in that regard, there has been a serious lapse of duty by the Government and by the agencies of the Government responsible. It is not long since in this House the <Col N="712" /> Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Collins, was asked by my colleague, Deputy Flynn, about the situation. I quote from the record one of a number of answers which he gave on that occasion:</P>
    <P>I emphatically refute the suggestion that there is a crisis in the industry. There is not.  As a former Minister in the Department it is somewhat irresponsible for the Deputy to put down this question and to pursue it in the manner in which he has done.  Not only is there not a crisis, but my Department are not aware of any insurer intending to pull out of the market.</P>
    <P>That was a statement by the Minister specifically responsible for this area not much more than a month ago.  There are many other incidents and instances which I could quote which clearly indicate that this Government and the Ministers responsible did not discharge the responsibility which rested on them in regard to this very important area.  I maintain that Deputy Collins was misleading the House when he gave that information.  In particular he was misleading the House because he should have known of the activities which the Minister has outlined in his statement which were going on in regard to the insurance business and the insurance companies.  If he did not know, he should have known.  If he did know, he was deliberately misleading the House when he gave those sort of answers.  Deputy Collins as the Minister responsible and his senior Minister should examine their respective positions in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently my attention was drawn to another item of information which apparently has now become public knowledge. Some months ago the Insurance Corporation of Ireland were struck off the list of approved insurance corporations in London because of the way they were conducting their business.  I do not know whether that information is correct but, if it is, it adds to the very substantial accumulation of evidence that all has not been well in the insurance world, certainly <Col N="713" /> since the collapse of the PMPA and the legislation passed at that time. That collapse was not given the attention it should have been given by the Government in regard to its repercussions on the rest of the industry and there has been a serious lapse of duty by the Government and their responsible Ministers in supervising and monitoring the insurance world over the past year or two.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the purpose of this legislation that we have before us today and why it has been introduced.  I cannot see that this Bill serves any purpose. I cannot understand why it took 12 days to prepare it and bring it before us. We were told it was very complex and that it would need great care and time. Apart from two relatively minor aspects of it, this Bill does nothing but set out standard stereotyped routine procedures for the governing of a semi-State body. Sections 1 to 13 are standard.  You could take them out of practically any Act governing the establishment of a semi-State body, dealing with the appointment of directors and chairmen and how the business should be conducted.</P>
    <P>Two other matters are dealt with in the legislation.  One is the statement in regard to the guarantee of £20 million which the Government are now undertaking in relation to certain underwriters in London.  It is doubtful that any legislation was needed to deal with that matter.  It is a curious matter nevertheless.  Apparently the arrangements in regard to this guarantee to the London underwriters and the position of Allied Irish were decided on Friday, 15 March when this whole matter came to light but were not disclosed for some purpose.  The Minister has not told us why they were not disclosed. It appears that the position is that Allied Irish Banks had guaranteed these underwriters to the extent of £20 million and the Government are now stepping into the shoes of Allied Irish Banks and taking over responsibility for that guarantee.</P>
    <P>In return, apparently Allied Irish Banks are going to put £20 million free of interest on deposit somewhere under the control of the Government.  Whereas <Col N="714" /> the liability of the Government for the guarantee is spelled out in this legislation, there is nothing in the Bill about Allied Irish Banks' contribution of £20 million. Presumably that has been covered in some other agreement or contract.  That is not in the legislation and it is typical of the manner in which this whole matter has been dealt with that the Government's liability is spelt out in the legislation but the Allied Irish Banks' contribution is not.</P>
    <P>Again, we assume that what will happen is that if the guarantee is called upon by these underwriters, the £20 million now being deposited by Allied Irish Banks can be called upon by the Government to make up the loss involved in meeting that guarantee, but that is not in the legislation.  We want to know more from the Minister about exactly how that will operate.  Can we take it for definite that the £20 million for which the Government are now voluntarily assuming responsibility in the form of a guarantee will be exactly <i>pari passu</i> met from the Allied Irish Banks' £20 million which will be deposited?  If that is so, we must also ask why that is not written into the legislation?</P>
    <P>The other factor in the Bill which is apart from the normal routine provisions about the establishment of State companies is a minor change with regard to the insurance compensation fund.  This fund will now have competing claims made upon it from two different administrators. As far as we can see, this provision is simply to deal with that situation and the priority between the demands.</P>
    <P>Apart from those two matters &mdash; the Government £20 million guarantee and this technical change in regard to the insurance compensation fund &mdash; there is not another single thing of any significance whatsoever in this legislation.  Why then did we wait 12 days for it?  Could this matter not have been dealt with immediately after the St. Patrick's Day weekend by a simple statement in this House by the Minister and a reasonable debate and all the speculation and rumours dampened down and, it is hoped, ended?  There is something here <Col N="715" /> which does not add up.  Is it that the Government were seriously considering some major complex legislation from which they now have backed away, bringing in this comparatively innocuous legislation instead?  The Government should tell us the truth in this regard.  This is a situation in which, to use the insurance term, we should have <i>uberrima fides.</i> We have given the Government support on the basis of trust and they should be fully forthcoming with us in this House and with the public.  They cannot persuade me, or any other reasonable person, that it took them 12 days to prepare that non-important, non-essential, non-complex, non-complicated legislation which we have before us now.  What is the position? I want the Minister to deal with the matter when he comes to reply to this debate.</P>
    <P>The nub of this whole matter is the size of the losses which have been incurred by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland to date and which potentially are going to arise in the future and how those losses are going to be made good.  There is really nothing in this legislation, or in what the Minister has said, to deal with the matter to our satisfaction and, I am certain, to the satisfaction of the general public and of the many deeply concerned and interested financial institutions.  As I have already pointed out the Minister can do no better than tell us that in his judgment and estimation and it is still not definitive &mdash; the range is somewhere between £50 million and £120 million.  After 12 days, at least, of rigorous and expert examination of the situation, I think we are entitled to better than that.  The Minister and the House are very well aware of the fact that there have been and are persistent reports that the losses are of a far greater extent than has been indicated here by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we are prepared to take the Government's view and word on this matter.  That is our duty and responsibility.  Vague though the Minister is we on this side of the House at this stage have no alternative but to accept his estimate of the situation and, presumably, <Col N="716" /> to accept that the ultimate, outside potential losses are £120 million.  But the Minister and we all must be aware that there are these other rumours.  We must acknowledge that they are there.  I did not see the programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; last night but on that very helpful programme, there was an alleged financial expert &mdash; mind you, the quality of financial experts around these days is a very dubious matter &mdash; from the city of London who gave a clear implication that since the takeover we could look forward to liabilities somewhere in the region of £500 million.  I am not accepting that and I am going along with the Minister's statement of what he believes the liabilities to be, but we must have regard to the fact that these other estimates are there.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of this which has to be taken into account also.  Whatever the extent of the liabilities and the potential losses before the Government stepped in, there is a danger, now that the Government are seen to be standing behind and responsible for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, that the situation could be exacerbated by others not accepting the responsibility and liabilities which they would otherwise undertake. Further, the Government have a responsibility to this House and to the public to tell us precisely and exactly about what they know of the extent of these losses.  There is an aspect which we must have regard to.  If, as has been suggested, the best figure that the Minister can settle on is £65 million &mdash; that is the figure he gave in his speech here today &mdash; then we must ask very definite and specific questions.  Is it seriously suggested that Allied Irish Banks would walk away from a situation in which the total outstanding potential liability was only another £65 million?</P>

      <P>I find that difficult to accept.  If there were only £50 million or £65 million involved, why had we all the drama, the burning of the midnight oil, the shock to our financial system, the risk of our creditworthiness, the Government's intervention, ripples <Col N="717" /> around the financial exchanges of the world?  Does anyone suggest that a major bank, like Allied Irish &mdash; with the reserves they have, with the financial expertise they have at their disposal &mdash; would write off an investment of £80 million, damage their reputation and standing and walk away from a situation if there were only another £65 million to be found and to be made up?  If that is so, I believe that there was gross panic, over-reaction by the Government and that the matter could have been dealt with in a totally different and separate way.  But one way or another we have a difficult situation to comprehend.  If there were only another £65 million or thereabouts to be found&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just clarify that for the Deputy.  If the Deputy looks again at my speech he will see that the figure of £65 million is mentioned in respect of losses in 1984, that it does not refer to the prospective losses which I said were within a range of £50 million to £120 million.  Therefore, we are talking about different things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this carefully with the advisers whom the Minister kindly placed at our disposal yesterday.  I have been assured by them that the losses of 1984 constitute the real kernel of this matter, that it is the losses of 1984 that form the substance of the problem.  If the losses of £65 million are the sum total of the losses of 1984 then my argument is that it was over-reaction and panic for the Government to intervene and not to leave Allied Irish &mdash; with the standing, the reputation they have, the reserve, the financial expertise &mdash; to deal with this situation as an ordinary banking crisis difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I must accuse the Minister of not being definite and specific with us in regard to this matter.  But whatever way one looks at it, if it is £65 million only, then I believe the Government intervened unnecessarily and in a panic fashion.  If the figure is far greater, if these astronomical figures that are being talked about in London and elsewhere <Col N="718" /> are true, then the Government are not giving this House the full extent of the situation.  One way or another there is a serious difficulty that must be faced whatever interpretation we put on the situation.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to come to a calm, balanced assessment of exactly what we are dealing with here.  For the moment I have to take it that what the Government are telling us is correct and that the losses are now reasonably well established along the lines they have indicated.  If that is so, then I have to accuse the Government of a panic, over-reaction, of intervening on the evening of Friday, 15 March, unnecessarily and dramatically. I seriously wonder if we had, on that occasion, another of these sudden outbursts by the Taoiseach, another unpredictable, panic type of reaction to a situation to which he did not give sufficient, careful attention or judgment before taking the action he did.</P>
    <P>This is a major, crucial question &mdash; the exact extent of these losses and what way they will have to be met.  The Minister has been totally unsatisfactory in so far as he has dealt with the manner in which these losses will be made good.  There is nothing in this legislation, no indication of powers or methods of mobilising resources to deal with the situation. There is nothing in the Minister's remarks to tell us.  Rather he tells us that it would be idle and unproductive speculation to be endeavouring to find out what contribution different people are going to make.</P>
    <P>How can we decide now how this situation will be dealt with?  As far as we can see at present the situation is being placed within the ambit of the insurance corporation fund.  That fund can command an income from the 2 per cent levy of only approximately £10 million annually.  It is already clear that it is not in a position at present to cope with the PMPA situation never mind take on an additional liability. Can the Government tell us what is the position in regard to the insurance compensation fund?  Will they be called upon to meet these new liabilities whatever their extent?  If so, from whence will they <Col N="719" /> get the funds, because it is no good talking about the £50 million that Allied Irish Banks are going to put into the compensation fund; that is only a loan and will have to be made good.  How will the insurance compensation fund be expected to cope with this additional burden of liabilities of somewhere between £50 million and £120 million at least?  We are entitled to that information and the Government are obliged to tell us and the general public.  We must suspect that, somewhere along the line, that insurance compensation fund will have resort to the Irish taxpayer for additional resources to deal with this situation.  If that is so the Government must tell us, because the £10 million annual income will not go anywhere near making up the figure needed for these losses.  Therefore the Exchequer must either borrow and add to our national debt &mdash; and the cost of financing that national debt &mdash; by giving this insurance compensation fund the additional resources or else it will have to impose a direct tax on the taxpayer to meet that situation.  We are entitled to know exactly what role the insurance compensation fund will play in this matter.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government can be accused of fudging this matter, of putting it away into the future, of not facing the reality that is there, the reality of these losses that have to be met, not telling this House today precisely what mechanics, what methods they will use to meet these liabilities when they are going to have to be met.  The only way in which that insurance compensation fund can get anything like the measure of resources which will be required will be by way of resort to the Exchequer and ultimately, to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I want to have a look at the Allied Irish Banks' situation in this regard.  Some play has been made of the fact that Allied Irish Banks are giving a soft loan to the Government, to the insurance compensation fund and therefore incurring a loss of somewhere in the region of £6 million as a result.  I do not think that stands up <Col N="720" /> or that is a real argument.  It is the business of a bank to lend money, to create credit to lend that money and to earn profits on the interest it makes on lending the money.  If Allied Irish Banks could lend those £50 million to some other borrower at the full rate of interest, then certainly they are foregoing somewhere in the region of £6 million by lending it to the insurance compensation fund.  But if, as we all know, Allied Irish and all other banks at present are seriously under-lent and cannot find legitimate and valid borrowers from the resources at their disposal, then what Allied Irish Banks are doing is lending the insurance compensation fund £50 million that they could not lend to anybody else and are at absolutely no loss in making that available to the insurance compensation fund. Neither will they be at any loss in so far as the £20 million guarantee is concerned because somewhere in their accounting systems they will already have made provision for that outstanding amount to the underwriters in London.</P>
    <P>I have suggested already another way of dealing with this situation, I wish to make it clear that I made this suggestion about a package for the financial institutions under the guidance of the Central Bank before I learned of the recent situation in regard to a bank in Canada which collapsed.  I am sure every Member of the House has become familiar with that situation.  I shall outline some of the salient factors in regard to the rescue operation which in that case was conducted under the auspices of the Canadian Government in respect of the bank that had encountered difficulties.  A sizeable sum of money was involved.  I shall outline some of the key and important elements of the package brought forward by the Canadian Government to deal with that situation which was similar to the one we are dealing with here, though admittedly the Canadian Government were dealing directly with a bank whereas we are dealing only with the subsidiary of a bank.  However, the difference in practical and realistic terms is not great. In that case the agreement required that the Canadian commercial bank, that is <Col N="721" /> the bank that was in trouble, to pay 50 per cent of its future pre-tax profits to the support group until such time as the members would be paid in full.  The remaining 50 per cent was to be retained by the bank and no common or preferred share dividends were to be paid until the repayment programme had been completed. In other words, in that situation the Canadian Government or some of their agencies arranged for a number of financial institutions to come together, prepare a salvage package and put it into operation on the lines I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that our Central Bank should have intervened in somewhat the same way in our situation, though when I was making that suggestion I was not aware that the Canadian package had been put into operation.  If, in the case of AIB, there was only confidence involved, all that was needed was a package that would be prepared by the Central Bank and backed up by the Government.</P>
    <P>If there is only £65 million involved and if we consider that AIB have written off already £80 million of their investment and provided £70 million by way of loans to the Government through the ICI fund and otherwise, is it not reasonable to expect that a package along the lines I have indicated could have been put together, that if the AIB faced up to the situation and if the Government had not intervened except in a helpful background way, the bank could have maintained their investment of £80 million, written down perhaps prudently from their reserves, and put the £70 million now available for loans into ICI and managed the ICI out of their present difficult situation?  Is there anything wrong with that scenario?  If the figures we are being given are correct, the matter could have been dealt with within the existing structures of the AIB but with some backup package of support from the Central Bank and the other financial institutions in this country.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that none of us should attempt to talk down AIB.  It would not be in the interest of anyone to do so.  The AIB are a good sound financial institution.  The bank has served the <Col N="722" /> country well for many years.  It has been associated closely with the agricultural industry.  Though from time to time we may all have had complaints as to the way in which individual cases were dealt with, by and large any reasonable person would accept that, as financial institutions go, AIB has served the community well and has performed well.  If they have made a major blunder &mdash; and I think we can all accept that is the case &mdash; we must accept that but we must place it in the context of the century of service that AIB has rendered to the community.</P>
    <P>However, they must not be allowed walk away from the situation as if nothing had happened.  As I have endeavoured to prove, what they are supposed to be doing now is not of any significant cost to them as a financial institution.  I trust that within their internal mechanisms and procedures they will deal with the blunder as it should be dealt with.  That is a matter for themselves; but it is not a matter for them that the Government, acting in the interest of AIB, should endeavour to take away from them the implications of their mistake and place them elsewhere, and certainly not on the shoulders of the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>My colleagues and I are anxious to handle this matter as responsibly and as maturely as possible, but we are not satisfied with the way the Government have handled it.  From the best assessment we can make it seems to us that there was an unnecessary panic Government intervention and that we are now faced with the worst of all possible worlds.  Because the Government are involved in the situation it may become worse rather than better.  I am making it clear to the Government and to everybody else in the House that we on this side are determined that the Irish taxpayer is not, directly or indirectly or by way of any obscure mechanism to be rendered responsible in any way for the outcome of this affair. The taxpayer has no responsibility for the matter and would not have benefited one whit if the acquisition of the ICI by AIB had proved a complete commercial and profitable success.  In such circumstances nobody would have come here with a <Col N="723" /> piece of legislation seeking to provide that those profits would be applied to the benefit of the Irish taxpayer or to the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If that is so it is entirely justified, equitable and fair that the financial institutions concerned in some way or other &mdash; I hope in a sensible and rational way &mdash; should accept full responsibility and full liability for these losses.  Because as of now it has seemed to us that the ultimate outcome of what the Government are proposing will be to place the major part or some part of the burden of this debacle on the shoulders of the taxpayers we are opposing this legislation.  We believe that by accepting this legislation we would start a process that ultimately would end up in the taxpayers carrying the burden for this debacle and we are not prepared to do that.  We are opposing this Bill and we will vote against it on that basis.</P>
    <P>We ask the Government to think again about this matter and to consider the alternative we are suggesting and which has been adopted by their counterparts in Canada, namely, a financial package under the guidance and leadership of the Central Bank and other financial institutions that would cope with the situation and deal with it satisfactorily.  If the Government do that we are quite prepared to discuss the matter with them and to be of any assistance we can.  However, as of now we are not happy with the Government's handling of the situation. We are not happy they have given us all the information we require or that they have been clear and specific as to how the losses will be made up.  We see clearly that, unless some other mechanism is provided, ultimately they will fall back on the Irish taxpayer and, for that reason, we have to reject the legislation put forward by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put the matter before the House in a somewhat broader political, but not party political, setting.  The disaster of the management of ICI, and the control over it which AIB did not exercise effectively, is on a scale which we usually associate with the public <Col N="724" /> sector.  It is a public-sector-size disaster; and the political consequences of this shipwreck in the long run is that a powerful weapon has been delivered free into the hands of people who believe in and who advocate the spread of State involvement in the economy.  These people oppose any move to take out of the State sector enterprises that should never have been in it, or which should not be in it any longer, and they oppose even the more benign form of the proposed National Development Corporation. These people have been given for nothing a most powerful weapon with which to beat the private sector, and for the next five years no one will be able, with the same confidence as before, to point at the State and semi-State millstones we have around our neck without the ICI mess being thrown back in his teeth.</P>
      <P>Although this may surprise the House, I agreed with a great deal of what Deputy Haughey said; but I did not hear him make the point that much of the anger of people in business is due to the fact that they feel they have been let down, that the private sector as a whole has been let down by this collapse, and that a free kick has been given to the crazy Left. That is what lies at the root of much of the resentment felt outside this House, quite apart from the ordinary resentment of taxpayers who feel they may be stuck with the bill for this disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early part of his speech the Minister naturally concentrated on the control mechanism exercised by his Department, and he spoke about the mechanism that this Bill represents.  Perhaps the Minister may say a little more on the subject when he winds up the debate.  I should like to hear him say what other courses might have been open to him, and why the Government and he chose not to pursue them.  For example, if the ICI had been an ordinary company with no large bank behind it, if it had been owned by a variety of medium to small and a few large shareholders and it had simply folded up, it would have left uncovered a large number of insured people, particularly the insurance that has to be taken out for employees, and it <Col N="725" /> might have threatened immediately employment and put businesses and jobs at risk.  I should like the Minister to contradict me if I am wrong, but would it not have been possible in such a case to have legislation as a matter of urgency to enable the risks to be spread among the other insurance companies which are now left uncovered by the collapse of the ICI? In other words, I am talking about transferring compulsorily in the short term &mdash; naturally with the obligation of making good a loss if it arose &mdash; the policies that have now become worthless as long as the name of ICI is stamped on them.</P>
    <P>Having taken the course it has, the State should resolve that the ICI under its new name &mdash; Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta &mdash; is not going to be a new passenger on the semi-State ship with an indefinite ticket over the horizon.  I say that, having just this moment received a document from the union which represents a large number of the employees of Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta.  It is a concern that should be wound down by the ordinary process of not renewing policies as they fall due.  No one wants this new company on board.  Insurance is the last thing the State should get into.  In this instance it is being forced into insurance, but it should not prolong its involvement.</P>
    <P>If there were no other options open to the Government than to take over ICI merely because it was owned by a large and prestigious bank, if the mere size and, therefore, the vulnerability and the horrific dimensions of a crash if anything went wrong, is behind the act of the Government, then it is time the State made a list of the enterprises &mdash; many in the financial sector and others not in that sector &mdash; that because of their sheer scale cannot be allowed to go to the wall without serious public consequences. What is happening here is the application of an inarticulate proposition which apparently the Government and the Opposition are willing to accept, although naturally with difference of emphasis and approach, and that is that in the private sector we can reach a scale <Col N="726" /> such that when a collapse has serious public consequences the taxpayer must stand in and take up the burden.  Until we have such a list and until the Government makes such a survey of the area of private sector which they effectively underwrite, we will not know the extent of the State's real exposure.  This is one collapse of a company which in world terms is only a midget, but that collapse here involves sums of money which are enough to throw out by a couple of points such a thing as a national three year plan.  What would happen if we had a few such collapses, not necessarily in the financial sector?  Suppose there are more businesses which simply have to be kept going for social purposes or for economic reasons.  We should look very seriously at what the state has taken on because the State is now the tacit insurer of these businesses.  Not only it is tacit insurer but it is an insurer which is drawing no premiums.  It is insuring businesses from which it has never received a penny by way of premium, and it is not operating with the benefit of the pool, which is at the centre of the whole insurance conception.</P>
    <P>The public feeling about this matter is of a degree of unanimity that I can never remember about anything else.  Deputy Haughey said a while ago that his party had behaved responsibly about this, and that they had not shot off their mouths and so on.  That is so.  They let a week or ten days go by without saying anything much.  In that time they sniffed the air, as any politician would do, and the feedback they got was the same as the feed back every Fine Gael and Labour Deputy got, which is that the people did not want to carry the can for this disaster.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to belabour the people in AIB or in the ICI needlessly &mdash; they are flesh and blood and I suppose experience the humiliation of being cast down from their position of public respect to a position where they are a hissing and a byword.  I feel sorry for them as individuals, but I cannot sympathise with their apparent approach to this.  The private sector are supposed to be the people who know most about public relations, but in <Col N="727" /> this they have done a ludicrously bad public relations job.  They have built up a constituency against them which is virtually 100 per cent of the people.  I am not talking just about PAYE taxpayers and people who contribute to the economy through indirect taxation; I am talking about everybody in the business sector, where the feeling is just as strong. Not a single voice has been raised in favour of the State taking on its shoulders a featherweight of the burden or the taxpayer being asked to contribute.  I never remember anything like the same unanimity from the people that are the target of Deputy Mac Giolla's scorn, the business lunch community, from them down to the fellows who are lucky to have any lunch.  That unanimity must be reflected here.</P>
    <P>That is not a matter of simply uttering a convenient and popular political sentiment. The taxpayer cannot be asked in the long run to carry this burden, although I accept that when we have a disaster with public consequences it may be the State in the short term that must provide the rescue operation; but the State should make certain that in the long run the State is indemnified for the cost of that rescue.  I noticed that at the end of the Minister's speech he said:</P>
    <P>Although it is too early yet to give any guarantees on this point, given that the cost of meeting claims will be spread out, it is the Government's objective to ensure that, if at all possible, the ordinary taxpayer does not have to pay anything towards the cost of this rescue.</P>
    <P>Not only is it the Government's objective, but it is the objective of every single member of Fine Gael and the objective of every single member of the Labour Party and of the Fianna Fáil Party.  No doubt I am going as far as even Deputy Mac Giolla would go in saying this.  The Minister is in the unusual situation of having the House 100 per cent behind him in his determination to ensure that the ordinary taxpayer does not have to <Col N="728" /> pay anything towards the cost of this rescue.  I did not say that merely to give a sounding-chamber of a resonance to a common, perhaps uninstructed, but popular public sentiment.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that it would be in the interests of the public sector to make sure that that does not happen.  I would not talk about a matter of pride in dealing with business men who must make ends meet and keep the show on the road, but I would have said that there was a certain <i>esprit de corps</i> among the private sector, which is what explains the fury of many of the ones I have met in the last few days.  It would be in their interest to make sure that a taxpayer is not asked to pay for this rescue.  Surely they cannot let it be said about them by Deputy Mac Giolla and his party &mdash; I do not mean that to sound offensive to the Deputy &mdash; and by people who would like to see the back of a lot of them, who would like to abolish the private sector, that they ran away from the situation and allowed the taxpayer, who perhaps never has a pound note to invest, to pay for the rescue.  It should be a matter of expediency and not merely pride or <i>esprit de corps</i> with the private sector to see to it that privately owned institutions, whose managers are never tired of lecturing the public sector about their whiplash methods, to make sure that they themselves do not become a burden on the ordinary taxpayer.  Many of the people involved will no doubt be shareholders in Allied Irish Banks, and they should bring their moral force to bear on that bank to make sure that the Minister's objective is fulfilled.</P>
    <P>One of the dimensions of humiliation for the people who have led us into this situation will be the recollection of the easy sarcasm which they poured on the public sector in years gone by.  In the anguish which they must be experiencing, if they are human at all, they must be thinking that it would have been better for them to have foreborne this or that crack at the expense of NET or Irish Shipping.  It should be therefore a matter of policy for the private sector to make sure that no one can say that the ordinary <Col N="729" /> taxpayers were asked to pick up the bill while the shareholders in the bank underwent only marginal injury.</P>
    <P>It may seem tough that AIB shareholders should have to bear the burden of this mess.  It is tough, but, as Deputy Haughey said, if the ICI had turned out to be enormously profitable no one would have begrudged the AIB shareholders the offspin of that success, and a Minister would not have rushed in here to confiscate the profits.  There would not have been a long debate, large-scale excitement, extended &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programmes and so on in order to confiscate the profits made by that subsidiary. Therefore, the people who stood to make those profits must expect, the way that any investor must expect, to be called on to bear the burden of the loss.</P>
    <P>I am not overlooking the human dimension.  I am sure there are many AIB shareholders who perhaps, have no other means, but that is another day's work. If there are good reasons for adding AIB shareholders to a list of social welfare recipients, or having a special fund to try to help people whose world falls to pieces through a debacle of this kind, I would not oppose them.  Let us by all means exercise charity towards everybody; but the principle ought not to be departed from that people who invest in something out of which they hope to make perhaps a profit must live with the risk that perhaps they are going to lose everything.  That must intensify their vigilance towards their own management.  That is what the whole thing is about.  If that restraint is taken away, what compulsion is there on any financial institution, or any other kind of institution, in the future, once it gets to a scale which will compel the Government to bail it out, to apply ordinary business prudence or management? What constraint is there on their shareholders to make sure that that is done?</P>
    <P>I am not a financial expert but I would like the Minister to say more about the question of diverting or confiscating some proportion &mdash; I do not think 50 per cent would be a feasible figure to mention here &mdash; of the accruing profits of the AIB over <Col N="730" /> so many years as may be necessary to pay off its liability.  I can see that, to do that is going to have a depressing effect on the value of AIB shares.  If a potential shareholder knows that before profits are distributed, or anything else like that, the bank is going to be called on to pay back a large lump of money to the State in respect of this disaster, it obviously will have a depressing effect on the bank's shares, perhaps only temporarily.  However, we should not forget that the State has already done that to the banks and, in my opinion, has done it in a rather questionable way ever since the introduction of the bank levy.</P>
    <P>What I have against the bank levy does not matter here, but I find it a somewhat arbitrary system of taxation.  It does not seem to operate on any clear principle. Some kind of principle has to underlie all taxation, but the bank levy does not seem to operate on any principle except that the banks seem to have the money and seem to be able to pay it.  That does not say that there are not other people in the country who might not be leviable on the same principle; but it is not applied to them.  I am not happy with the system of a bank levy.  However, I only mention it because the system has been in place for a few years and, presumably, it must have had some impact on the value of bank shares because a shareholder, or prospective shareholder, must have known that there would be that much less money available for distribution at the end of the year.  Would it have made that catastrophic a difference were the Government to say that they are going to top the levy up, not for banks that were innocent, but in the case of AIB?  In that case it would be based on a certain principle &mdash; namely, topping up the levy &mdash; in order to recover the mess their management at one or two removes had made the taxpayer, in the short term, disgorge.  Would it have been feasible to insist on a share issue by the AIB &mdash; it would, of course, have diluted the value of the remaining shares &mdash; to the State, an issue to the State of a slice of the bank?  That would have diluted the value of the shares of other people and have cost them money in another way. <Col N="731" /> Perhaps it would have been a preferable way from the shareholders point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether those possibilities would be feasible but I say to the Minister &mdash; I believe all Members will say the same if they get the chance &mdash; that in one shape or form, whether by one or other of those methods or a combination of them or by some other similar method, no other solution to the problem will in the long run be acceptable.  Everybody accepts that when the lifeboat or ambulance goes out, the patient or the struggling person in the sea is not asked to produce out of their hind pocket the cost of the run; but the cost has to be met somehow later.  While the State will in the first instance have to put money up front, it will be acceptable to the taxpayer only if he has the clearest of understandings that this is a temporary arrangement which will be fully reimbursed to him.</P>
    <P>Any objection from the AIB based on the idea that they are being made to suffer in a way that no outside party would have been had the ICI been owned by an ordinary set of shareholders can be met by a battery of arguments from the Government.  Firstly, to exact compensation or a contribution from the AIB in this way could be seen as a retrospective collection from the AIB of the premiums which, down the years, they should have been paying the State that was tacitly insuring it, but were never asked to pay. It could be plausibly and fairly presented in that way.  Secondly, it could be seen as a penalty of a sort, not far away from penalties which insurance companies apply anyway, for the slack management, the slack control, which permitted this crisis to arise.  Thirdly, it could be said that under this system of making the AIB repay this over a course of years, at least while the value of shares in the short term is depressed or the dividend of shareholders is cut in the short term, in the long term they will still have a slice of a very valid, sound, important and well deserving institution such as the AIB is. In other words, they will not have been ruined by the disappearance, the diminution in value of their shares to that of a <Col N="732" /> piece of paper.  That is what would have happened had the entire institution collapsed. That is what happens to any institution that collapses.  People may be left with a few pence in the pound.  The State, by taking the action it has taken, is fire-proofing these same shareholders against the devaluation of their shares to bits of paper.  There may be more arguments that occur to better financial brains than mine, but these are arguments I would put forward in support of why the AIB should not complain at being asked to make good this loss.</P>
    <P>The temper and atmosphere of the debate would be inimical to my saying something about motor insurance and the question of the adjudication on claims by juries, and I will leave that to another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation now proposed is a totally inadequate response to the solution of the ICI problem and simply gives an open ended legislative instrument to the Government to take on unlimited liability for the losses of ICI and makes the taxpayers liable for all present and future losses of the insurance company.  From which ever point of view one looks at it, whether the losses are great or small, this legislation is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the liabilities be at the low figure the legislation is unnecessary and the country and the bank should have been spared the enormous trauma, dislocation and international loss of credibility. Existing legislation with the appointment of the Administrator under the 1983 Act, together with a simple amendment to that Act was more than adequate to deal with the collapse.  The £50 million soft loan offered by the AIB together with the selling off of the Credit Finance Bank and the lucrative ICI Life Company, estimated at £40 million to £50 million was more than adequate to meet the losses.  If the Administrator was not satisfied with some of the reinsurance arrangements of ICI they could have been renegotiated.  Unsatisfactory business could have been terminated if not renewed and if thought desirable the <Col N="733" /> London office which is responsible for 95 per cent of our problem today could have been run down, outstanding claims met and ICI would end up a very limited collapse which could have been handled either internally by AIB or else by the Administrator with the help of AIB, the Government, the Central Bank and insurers generally.  So much if the liabilities are on or about the £50 million mark already suggested.</P>
    <P>If the figures are the upper limit of the Minister's suggestion or the catastrophic figures being rumoured around the world then this legislation places a millstone around the necks of the community.  The £50 million going into the compensation fund, whether with soft interest rates or not, has to be repaid and this has to be done by the taxpayer, either by direct or indirect taxation.  If the burden is £200 million then the compensation fund is the legal vehicle to be used and the present situation of the fund is totally inadequate to take on board any demand without Government intervention.  The fund has already been borrowed from heavily to accommodate the PMPA demands.  The fund's income is £10 million per annum raised by the 2 per cent levy on all insurance policies.  That ceiling is not to be raised.  Its borrowings are to be guaranteed by the State and the Minister will be using his powers under section 5 of the 1964 Insurance Act to pump money into the fund to service its requirements. All these moneys will come from Exchequer financing arrangements which mean budgetary provisions for the foreseeable future.  This blank cheque type legislation is poor law and has to be resisted.</P>
    <P>On both counts, either with a light or heavy liability outcome we are opposed to the legislation.  We are satisfied that our response to the ICI collapse has been exemplary in that we have been responsible and persistent in our attitude to protect the AIB, the financial institutions and the national interest.  This has been and still is our primary concern.  Others, on the Government side, have acted in a less than honourable way in this regard. We are highly critical of the supervisory authority under the control of the Minister <Col N="734" /> for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and we condemn his ineffective monitoring of insurance generally.  We believe there is a continuing crisis in general insurance and we demand action to rectify a potentially disastrous situation. We want the ICI life company position clarified and we demand that this valuable asset be used to benefit the State. We will not tolerate any private deal to sell it off at undervaluation.  We believe it to be worth £40 million to £50 million and it should be of major assistance in lessening the liability of the ICI collapse.</P>
    <P>The Bill in itself has no substance except specifically to empower the Minister to guarantee payments due by ICI under guarantees given to the Institute of London Underwriters.  While the aggregate limit placed on this guarantee is £20 million we believe there will be no call up on these guarantees.  Section 16 of the Bill simply gives security to those who would be lending moneys to the compensation fund and allows payments that have been approved by the High Court to be arranged in such a way as to have regard to the solvency of the compensation fund.  However, the Bill conceals a much more harsh reality for the taxpayer and it is for this reason that we must oppose the legislation.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious consequences of the AIB-ICI crisis is the instability that now exists in the public perception of our financial institutions.  The safety and security of the banking system was always recognised by the public as the one immovable object in the economic life of the country.  Irrespective of the uncertainty in budgetary or economic activity, nothing dramatic was ever expected from our banking system.  Risk taking was always regarded as a non-banking activity and individuals felt secure that their investments and banking arrangements were free from uncertainty.</P>
    <P>With banks reaching saturation in their traditional markets they have in recent times expanded their activities through diversification into non-banking areas and it was inevitable that they would be exposed to more commercial risks.  The imponderable is how a major inter- <Col N="735" /> national bank with such exclusive and selective advice available to it could have been misled to the extent of taking on board an insurance company which in a short time threatened its own continuation in banking business.  Whoever did the calculation on which the board of the AIB made its take-over bid has much to answer for.  In fairness to the AIB it had to rely on the quality of information being made available to it and when the chief executive officer of AIB announced that its new acquisition would be a profit maker in two years, everybody felt relieved that ICI were in safe hands and would be a money spinner for investors and shareholders alike.  However, non-life insurance is a risky business worldwide with an entirely different set of procedures from banking &mdash; procedures which bankers are normally unaccustomed to and, for that reason, greater caution should have been exercised before taking on responsibility for insurance. International assessors gave AIB a &ldquo;bum steer&rdquo; but because of the uncertainty of underwriting in insurance, a more prudent avenue to follow would have been an independent scrutiny of the practices and indebtedness of ICI.</P>
    <P>Reliance by the Government and the Minister on company statements and audits paid for by the company themselves is not a suitable means of monitoring by a supervisory body.  In an area of business where the State has to act as the final guarantor, such as insurance and finance houses, then the present mechanism of company statements and audits will have to be supplemented by Department or independent assessors.  A dozen people, one of them a financial accountant in the commerce office of the Department dealing with insurance, is hardly a staffing complement capable of monitoring £2 billion worth of non-life business annually and the affairs of some 62 institutions writing insurance generally.</P>
    <P>The ICI reserving policy was not in accordance with the rules and this message alone should have alerted the cautious. It has to be concluded that there <Col N="736" /> was mis-management of the ICI and worse, that they were allowed to continue to break the rules despite signals and warnings from Dáil Éireann and commentators at home and abroad.  ICI were doomed whether AIB was its parent or not.  In fact, the emergency legislation of 1983 was going to have to be applied sooner or later in the national interest.</P>
    <P>It was the clear understanding of all the consequences of the crisis that prompted the very responsible attitude of the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Haughey, and the Fianna Fáil Party to the initial announcement.  The quality of that response taken in a non-party way when political advantage was subordinated to the national interest is an indication of the hallmark of quality in Fianna Fáil leadership and national concern. National stability has been maintained and must continue to be protected in this debate.  A balanced view must be expressed so as to maintain confidence in our financial institutions and so prevent a poor situation becoming a national crisis.</P>
    <P>It would be naive for anybody to suggest that there is not widespread disbelief in the community at the whole sequence of events that lead up to Friday, 15 March.  That disbelief has now turned to anxiety as to who should pay the debt. Taxpayers and those who pay for services provided by banks and insurance companies should not have to bear the total cost.  Not understanding the niceties of financial trading the consumers principal concern now is how much will it cost and who will pay.  There is an obligation on the Government to devise a rescue that will be fair and will be seen to be fair and to take into account the liability fall-out which must of necessity last for a number of years.  It may be too much to expect that the taxpayer will be spared any cost, but the commercial private sector which in good times makes handsome profits and envious growth margins should be generous in bad times especially in the circumstances of this collapse.</P>
    <P>There are many ways that banking could show a genuine concern for this unfortunate happening, in providing finance which would help develop the <Col N="737" /> economy in areas where cash was always in short supply.  I mention one area as an example of what could be done.  The AIB have always been involved in export credit finance and export credit insurance and these areas have always been short of funding.  A willing bank could increase the funds available, reduce the risk and promote lesser charges and the effects on exporters, job creation and new markets for our exports would be significant and go some way to restore the public faith and confidence in our financial institutions.</P>
    <P>It is for the Minister to outline the various alternatives and options that were available to the Government in dealing with this crisis, but there is still the question to be answered, if, in fact, the Central Bank Act of 1942, under section 6, could have been applied to deal with the matter.  The Central Bank have the function and duty of taking such steps as the bank deem necessary, appropriate and advisable to safeguard the integrity of the currency and in the interest of the people as a whole.  There is no doubt that this problem could have and still might affect the situation of currency in the country and so this Bank Act of 1942 can be an appropriate vehicle for dealing with this matter.  Did the Minister request the Central Bank to advise on what they thought appropriate and, if so, what was the response?  Or was it the other way round, the Minister responding to the Central Bank demand?  Without causing the deep financial trauma which has rocked the financial institutions of the State, could the Central Bank together with all registered banks, institutions, finance houses and insurance interests, not come to a collective response to save the national image and free the taxpayer from penalty?</P>
    <P>We pointed to the recent rescue of the Canadian Commercial Bank as a means that might have been considered in dealing with the present crisis.  This bank had been threatened with bankruptcy because of bad loans to the troubled US oil rig industry.  The rescue operation negotiated is understood to leave the bank in a strong position of solvency.  The <Col N="738" /> rescue package was put together using an insurance corporation, the Alberta Government, the Federal Government, banking groups generally and the agreement requires the Canadian Commercial Bank to pay 50 per cent of their future pre-tax profits to the support group until their members are paid in full.  We offer this as a suggestion as to how other countries deal with the rescue of banks and insurance companies.  Perhaps a closer look at the international rescue pattern might have indicated a better way of dealing with the ICI crisis than that which is now offered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Following the PMPA crisis, surely the prudent thing for the Minister and supervisory authority to do was to make a searching inquiry into the state of health of all other non-life insurers.  Surely the Minister was alerted to the lack of effectiveness of the monitoring regime in his Department and the need for an overall review of insurance legislation.  The red flag was up but nobody heeded the warning and the result is dire consequences for the Government, the bank, ICI, financial institutions, insurance companies and the unfortunate taxpayer.</P>
    <P>However the rescue load is spread, it is the inevitability that the ordinary hard-pressed taxpayer will be asked to carry the cost whether by direct or indirect tax, increased premiums, charges or levies if this legislation is forced into law.  The financial experts of the State have let down the citizens of this State, have put a question mark on the professionalism and competence of those who control our financial destiny and show an Achilles heel where none should exist.</P>
    <P>In the national interest, the State must be in a position to provide the framework of cover to protect our financial institutions and international credibility and creditability.  The same latitude was not available for the thousands of business closures that have taken place over the past few years resulting in one-fifth of our workforce being unemployed.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is responsible, in accordance with the European Communities Non-Life Insurance Regulations, 1976, <Col N="739" /> for supervision of the overall solvency of the entire business of any insurance undertaking with its head office in Ireland, and in collaboration with other supervisory authorities for the business done at any branches of such head office in their territories.  This was confirmed no later than 30 January by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, when he, as supervisory authority in charge of the insurance industry, stated that he had an obligation to ensure that all companies licensed by him were viable.  That is stated at column 1037 of the Official Report for 30 January 1985.  On the same date, the Minister also said that the Irish insurance business was basically sound. He went on to say that he refuted any suggestion that there was a crisis in the insurance industry.  He topped off his remarks on that occasion by saying that not only was there no crisis in the insurance industry, but that the Department were not aware of any insurer intending to pull out of the market.</P>
    <P>It is the primary responsibility of the Minister, as supervisory authority, to make sure that solvency is maintained in insurance companies.  The Minister has a special role in relation to the insurance industry in so far as general price control is concerned, together with the specific functions laid down under the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1982 and the EC legislation concerning authorisation of insurers and monitoring of their operations to ensure maintenance of solvency.  No one can carry on insurance business without an insurance licence and this licence details specific classes that may be catered for and also sets out the minimum capital requirement necessary before business can be undertaken.  Before granting the licence the supervisory authority has to be satisfied with the scheme of operation, as outlined by the operator.  Detailed annual returns are made of the operations business and these returns include the gross and net underwriting revenue account, the premium and re-insurance analysis, the claim settlements analysis and the assets analysis.  These details together with the balance sheets and <Col N="740" /> profit and loss account form the basis for the detailed scrutiny which the supervisory authority are supposed to monitor on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Every undertaking is obliged to create and maintain in Ireland technical reserves corresponding to the underwriting liabilities in this country and also to maintain an adequate solvency margin.  The administration rules prescribe the nature and spread of assets held for the purpose of reserves and solvency.  It is clearly understood that the insurers must always be in a position to meet their liabilities. If an undertaking falls below the required regulation then it is the duty of the supervisory authority and the Minister to demand that the reserves be restored to an acceptable level, and this to be undertaken within a specified minimum period.</P>
    <P>In so far as the solvency requirements are concerned they dictate the minimum level of capital and retained reserves. Insurance companies generally have substantial funds available for investment. They invest these moneys in Government stocks and property which produce an income and these, together with the provisions for outstanding claims make up the technical reserves of the insurance company.  The importance of these reserves cannot be overstated as they are needed to meet the outstanding claims reserves &mdash; claims made but not settled, claims incurred but not reported &mdash; estimated cost of claims that have happened, but not reported, and the unearned premium reserve &mdash; premiums received in advance of period of risk.</P>
    <P>In addition a company is required to maintain a minimum solvency margin so as to provide permanent protection against increases in liability or a decrease in assets.  The EC solvency margin stands at 17 per cent of annual premium income.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of popular, pain-relieving proprietary branded drugs are available &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; in pharmacies, family grocers, supermarkets, etc.  A prescription is not required for purchase.  My Department have no information on the sales volume of these product lines.</P>
      <P>The information available relates only to those pain relieving drugs which are obtained under the GMS scheme, which covers some 37 per cent of the population. Nearly all of these drugs require a prescription for purchase.  The latest available figures relate to the calendar year 1983.  Some 61,876,000 pain killing tablets and capsules were dispensed under the GMS scheme in that year.  I am sure that Deputies will find this figure quite extraordinary.</P>
      <P>There is a general agreement that an unnecessary degree of psychological reliance on drugs has developed here over the last 20 years or so, reflecting similar trends in other European countries.</P>

Would he consider that there may be grounds for controlling it <Col N="742" /> because of the easy availability of these drugs over the counter, in supermarkets etc?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally satisfied that the cover under the GMS scheme is reasonable for pain-killing tablets and analgesics.  Pain-killing tablets and capsules were prescribed on 969,720 occasions under the GMS scheme in 1983.  One million people are covered by the GMS.  There were 1 million occasions on which prescriptions were issued.  The cost of those tablets was £6½ million.  The coverage is adequate.  I have not received any great volume of complaints.</P>

      <P>That suggestion has been made but the General Medical Services Payment Board do not agree with the allegation.  My main preoccupation is with the fact that too many drugs are being prescribed.  The trouble is that people who go to a doctor, particularly if they have a medical card, do not seem to be happy &mdash; nor do the doctors &mdash; unless they are given a prescription for something.

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 490 and 491 of 19 June 1984 in which I outlined the steps which had been taken to implement the recommendations of the task force at that time. The following is an outline of the progress which has been made in this area since my reply of 19 June 1984.  On the law enforcement side, the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1984, and the Criminal Justice Bill, 1984, were enacted.  All of the provisions of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, have already been brought into operation.</P>
      <P>On the education side, various information seminars, involving teachers and health board personnel, have been held which are aimed at increasing awareness of the drug problem.  In addition, more extended training has been held for smaller groups of teachers who are already engaged in health education, counselling or pastoral care work in schools.  This training has taken the form of a one week summer course followed up by day workshops held during the school year.  A group of the teachers who are participating in these workshops are preparing programmes on teaching about drugs at various age levels and based on their own work in schools.  It is hoped to disseminate these, when ready, and to prepare a video film on class work.</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau and the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee recently jointly launched a new drug education programme.  The programme consists of a series of lectures in the CDVEC adult education programme which are available to anyone interested in learning more about drug use and abuse.  Participants will be given the new booklet <i>Understanding Drugs</i> which has been developed as part of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the youth and community development side, the youth service grant scheme was increased by 13.6 per cent in 1984, bringing the total allocated to £1,871,650. This was distributed to 24 youth organisations which cater for over 300,000 young people.  In addition to this, in 1984 £160,000 was allocated to disadvantaged urban projects.  It is now the policy of the <Col N="745" /> Department of Labour, in so far as it is possible, to orientate the cash for the disadvantaged groups towards those areas identified by the task force as being at risk.</P>
    <P>In the area of rehabilitation services, the Coolmine Therapeutic Community submitted proposals for the expansion of its existing induction centre in the inner city area of Dublin and for the establishment of an induction centre in Dún Laoghaire.  I recently made the necessary funds available to enable Coolmine to proceed with these proposals.</P>
    <P>In the area of research, the Medico-Social Research Board has recently completed two surveys.  The first of these was aimed at quantifying the drug problem in the Dún Laoghaire area and to compare heroin abuse in a local authority flats district with that in adjoining housing estates.  The other survey was aimed at establishing the distinguishing features between the 90 per cent of those in the 15 to 24 age group, living in a north central Dublin area, who do not abuse hard drugs and the 10 per cent who decide to abuse hard drugs, as documented in the board's earlier report.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendation of the task force, I also recently established the new National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse, with specific terms of reference.  The committee, which will now assume responsibility for pursuing the implementation of the recommendations of the task force, had its first meeting on 25 March 1985.</P>
    <P>In the course of my replies to the next four Parliamentary Questions I will be dealing with the treatment services and I will outline the progress made in this area.</P>

      <P>A couple of questions arise from the Minister's reply.  Is there any indication that the changes in the Drugs Act and the implementation of those sections of the Criminal Justice Act which are now in effect have had an impact on the drugs problem particularly in relation to drug pushing?  Can the Minister indicate to what extent the teachers who are involved in the drug <Col N="746" /> education programme are located in high risk areas and particularly the high risk areas referred to in the task force report which included parts of the Minister's own constituency, parts of Ballymun, the north inner city area and parts of the south inner city area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Projects intended specifically to develop youth services approved to date include in the Ballymun area £24,000; in the Finglas area £24,000; in the south inner city £12,000; in Darndale £8,000; in Bonnybrook £12,000; in Kilmore £6,000 and £24,000 in Neilstown. In addition, in the Ballymun, Finglas and Neilstown areas the grants involve support for the employment of two full time youth workers.  The remaining four areas I mentioned involve support for one full time youth worker. These are new grants which are paid. I am concentrating the expenditure of money in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Misuse of Drugs Act and the operation of the Criminal Justice Act are having an impact.  The Drugs Squad are confident that the additional powers they have been given and extension of a maximum prison sentence for a convicted drug pusher from 14 years to life imprisonment are also having an impact.  The level of seizures has increased.  It seems that the level of abuse has reached a plateau to some extent.  The authorities assure me that there is no let up.  I am looking forward to the work of the National Coordinating Committee.  I expect to get regular monthly reports from that widely representative committee.  They met for the first time in the past few days and I spoke to them.</P>

I take it that the Minister does not have that information available to him at the moment.  Could I ask him to ensure that this scheme of education of teachers would be directed primarily towards schools in the high risk areas? I understand that drug abuse is highest among educationally deprived or disadvantaged young people.  Could I ask the Minister to give a commitment in that regard?</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the resources at my disposal will be geared into that area.  Currently, under this year's budget I have a total resource of £650,000 for voluntary community organisations for once-off capital projects.  I would welcome applications from areas designated as high risk for the expenditure of that money.  Equally, under the Combat Poverty Agency subhead of my Department I have a resource this year of about £1.1 million.  I would welcome projects with relevance to Combat Poverty which could be put before the new board as soon as it is established.  Legislation is going through the Seanad at the moment, which will be coming to the Dáil quite shortly.  Overall, I hope to allocate, out of those two sums mentioned &mdash; close on £2 million &mdash; a high proportion to these high risk areas. None of that money has yet been spent this year and I am awaiting applications. <Col N="748" /> There have been advertisements in the newspapers.  If Deputies know of any groups of poverty projects dealing with that area, I shall be only too willing to allocate a substantial proportion of that money to them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said there has been no let-up on the part of the authorities in the detection of drug pushers.  The Government's statement on the task force report was that the strength of the Drug Squad would be kept under constant review. This is not a specific area of the Minister's responsibility but, as he has referred to it, can he say what increase has been made in the numbers in the Drug Squad? The Minister stated that the necessary funds have been made available for the Coolmine centre expansion programme. Is it true that Coolmine have received in the region of £70,000 less than they require for their 1985 programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Coolmine first, I have met the Coolmine community officers &mdash; admittedly, this was before Christmas.  There is no indication that they are in any way short of money. When they said at the end of last year that they wanted additional moneys for their inner city induction centre and the proposed development of the services in Dún Laoghaire, I agreed to give an additional allocation of £59,000.  That money was paid out before Christmas and I do not think it has yet been expended.  Coolmine, in terms of subsidisation from the Eastern Health Board and the general facility in St. Martha's and in the city, apparently are not short of money.  If they are, I shall be only too willing to consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, I have not heard of any shortage of additional gardaí for the Drug Squad.  The last figure was around 40 gardaí, including the allocation of additional ban ghardaí in the drug units in Dublin, Cork and Limerick as recommended by the task force.  The Drug Squad are working extremely well.  The less publicity they get at times, the better they work.  I am quite satisfied with the <Col N="749" /> organisation of the Drug Squad at inspectorate, superintendent and commissioner level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that plans are well advanced in relation to the relocation of the Jervis Street Drug Advisory and Treatment Centre in an alternative city centre location.  A brief has been drawn up and possible sites for the new facility are being investigated.  The move may take place independent of the movement of the general hospital services from Jervis Street to Beaumont, if appropriate. It is possible that additional beds for detoxification and in-patient treatment will be provided at Beaumont Hospital due to the relocation of the walk-in element of the Jervis Street service in the city centre.  The need to develop further in-patient services will be examined in <Col N="750" /> the light of the demand for the places which will be available in Beaumont.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of services for young drug abusers in the 12-16 age group the position is that Talbot Centre, which should be moving into new accommodation shortly will be available to a greater number of people with drug-related problems from the north inner city area.</P>
    <P>I approved last year of the appointment of a number of counsellors-tracers in the Eastern Health Board area who are involved in establishing contact with drug abusers.  The Eastern Health Board are monitoring the situation in individual community care areas, as reported by the counsellors, with a view to organising appropriate responses to the identified needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true in relation to the three specific areas to which I refer, the Jervis Street drug treatment centre, St. James's Hospital detoxification unit and the treatment accommodation for young drug abusers, particularly in the deprived inner city areas, all of which were promised in the task force report published in September 1983, that none has so far been supplied? The Minister refers to the location of the Jervis Street facility and possible sites. Does the Minister mean buildings which can be bought and quickly renovated, or when he speaks of sites does he mean that this will involve the construction of a facility which may take quite some time?  I should like clarification of that. In relation to St. James's Hospital, which seems to be a relatively easy facility to provide on an urgent, speedy basis, can the Minister say why it has not been provided since September 1983?  Thirdly, in relation to the treatment accommodation for young abusers in the 12 to 16 year old group, the Minister refers to the relocation of the Talbot Centre to Buckingham Street.  The Talbot Centre is a drop-in centre for half a dozen young drug abusers; that is all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question, Deputy, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Task Force on Drug Abuse referred to accommodation where these young people can be detained and rehabilitated &mdash; in other words, residental accommodation &mdash; will this be provided?  That is not what is involved in the relocation of the Talbot Centre which is merely a drop-in centre. I do not want to accuse the Minister of ignoring or of covering up on the questions, very important ones in regard to the treatment of heroin addiction.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the various issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Jervis Street, a planning group comprising representatives of the Department of Health and Jervis Street Hospital have agreed on a brief for a new walk-in city centre unit.  Jervis Street have employed a firm of estate agents to produce a list of suitable properties and sites.  Equally Dublin Corporation have also been contacted about sites.  It should be possible within the next few weeks to evaluate this comprehensive list of sites.  I share the Deputy's concern about the delay.  I have been unhappy about it, and am urging the authorities to go ahead with all speed and do this work rapidly.  As the Deputy is aware, last September &mdash; indeed even in June 1984 &mdash; I indicated that it was intended to produce that facility without delay.  The Talbot Centre, when it moves to Buckingham Street in six to eight weeks, will have more space available for 16 to 12 year olds downwards, for pregnant abusers and for young mothers. There has not been a great demand on the Eastern Health Board for places for a number of actually identified 12 to 16 year old drug abusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I will have the major centre in Dundrum available shortly.  The final decisions about how that is to be brought into use have not yet been taken, but it is a possibility for relatively older young people.  It is a magnificent facility.  It will be available for them where they have been in direct trouble with the law and <Col N="752" /> will facilitate their rehabilitation.  My personal strong view is that it be non-custodial residential care.  Only the Coolmine facility has residential care for approximately 70 to 80 young people and it is full at present.  The development of that kind of non-custodial type facility would be more conducive to rehabilitating young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us the reason for the delay in finding a new site for a new inner city centre?  Will it be the authorities in Jervis Street who will be responsible for the building, purchase or renovation of that centre, or will it be that of his Department?  Also, the Minister said in his reply that it was possible that there would be beds for detoxification in Beaumont.  Has no decision been taken on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the Beaumont situation first, there is a facility in Beaumont for a number of beds specifically for detoxification.  I am quite willing to open those beds tomorrow morning provided the consultant staff of Jervis Street and of the Richmond just go up, turn the key in the door and work there. I will not accept the conditions they are laying down in order to go up there. The nursing staff in Jervis Street, where conditions are very bad, are only too willing to go up there.  Equally the vast majority of the staff would go up there. But there are some individuals who are determined to play what I might call medical politics with this and to play politics with me as well in the process. Frankly I will not bend to their particular conditions.  That is the only reason we are not up there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay has basically arisen from the fact that it is now generally agreed that for Jervis Street Hospital to go to Beaumont, leaving behind part of the hospital and converting part into a drug's treatment centre, is not really wise, that it is not feasible to do it having regard to the future use of the Jervis Street site.  That is why the general agreement is that in or about that immediate area there should be a facility in a separate building.  I might make the other point that although I have not personally looked at the sites, I have had a team in major urban areas such as New York and Los Angeles look at the walk-in treatment centres there.  They have come back rather chastened.  We do not need a huge elaborate building in Dublin dealing with drug abuse.  Centres can be very modest, very ordinary structures, very reasonably built at low cost.</P>

      <P>The delay has arisen largely in getting a suitable site.  I have no doubt that the Jervis Street staff, who are grossly over crowded there, are very anxious to do it.  My Department have the money and we are willing to spend it immediately, but the delay has been in getting an actual site.  It is not easy in the city centre and we want to have it in the inner city, downtown Dublin and nowhere else.  That is where it should be.</P>

      <P>There are two points I should like to raise with the Minister.  In the course of his replies he indicated that the incidence of known drug abuse had levelled off.  Does the Minister have any statistics indicating figures for, say, attendances in Jervis Street in 1984, or any other kind of statistics which would support the view he has expressed?  Secondly, the drug coordinating committee, recently established, have been given the responsibility of implementing the task force recommendations. Have they been given any time scale or targets which they must meet in pursuing the implementation of those recommendations?</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer the question in relation to the provision of a detoxification unit at St. James's Hospital.  Is it intended to provide that unit as envisaged by the task force and what are the reasons for the delay so far?  In relation to the Minister's statement that he is not in favour of custodial care for young heroin addicts, is this a change of viewpoint from the recommendations of the task force which refer clearly to the need to detain and rehabilitate these young people by taking them out of the environment that is so much a part of their addiction, that provides such a basis for their addiction?  Surely the Minister agrees with the need to take young heroin abusers out of that environment and have them put into custodial care.</P>

      <P>In deference to the Chair I do not propose to elaborate unduly on that.  I have stated my views on it.  The best prospects for these young people is voluntary residential care but under the Children Bill there will be some prospect of court procedures in relation to custodial care.  The decision in respect of the unit at St. James's Hospital was <Col N="756" /> made in October last.  The provision of a specific unit at that hospital is related to the development at Beaumont Hospital and consequently I should like the two to be opened together.</P>

      <P>The recommendations of the task force were incorporated in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, which I introduced last year, together with desirable changes recommended by other parties concerned with controlling the drug problem.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, based as they are on informed opinion and perceived needs provide a sound legislative basis on which the problem of drug pushing can be tackled effectively.</P>

      <P>Much as we deplore it, we must accept that in our society there will always be an element of drug pushing.  That is not to say that there should not be rigorous statutory penalties imposed on those arrested for drug pushing on the streets.  The Misuse of Drugs Act came into operation only last August while the irresponsible prescribing provisions came into operation on 1 October last.  Irresponsible prescribing is far more serious in many respects than drug pushing.  Drug pushing in O'Connell Street is spectacular whereas the prescribing of drugs by a doctor in the privacy of his surgery is very unspectacular. There are provisions in the Criminal Justice Act that will have significant implications in regard to drug pushing. When all the provisions of that Act are in operation, for the first time there will be provision for strip searching with appropriate safeguards and controls so that pushers can be arrested and examined where they are suspected of concealing controlled drugs, that is, in their bodies which is the most customary way of hiding drugs.  Equally, there will be provision under the Criminal Justice Act for majority jury verdicts because as the Deputy knows some jurors have been intimidated by drug pushers.  At present <Col N="758" /> the disagreement of only one juror is needed for a pusher to be acquitted.  All that legislation was passed six or eight months ago but it is not yet in operation. However, neither the Garda nor the Department of Justice have complained to us to the effect that there are deficiencies in the existing legislation which would impede the arrest of drug pushers. The task force on drug abuse are more than anxious to apprehend anyone who is pushing drugs but it is as much a matter of education, parental influence, peer influence and the ending of deprivation in society as it is a matter of capturing the drug pusher.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act is restricting the Garda in relation to arresting people found with small amounts of drugs on their person, especially the drug cannabis resin.  In view of the organised and sophisticated way drug pushers are operating it is very seldom that people will be found with large quantities of drugs on their person. Unless the Minister amends section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act to enable the Garda to arrest people who have in their possession small quantities of cannabis or other drugs it will be more and more difficult for the Garda to implement the Act.  Has the Minister any plans to amend section 3 of the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together, as they deal with the general area of food additives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although no research on food additives is carried out under the auspices of my Department, I am advised by the Food Advisory Committee about the suitability of individual additives for use in food.  Before the committee would recommend that an additive is suitable for use in food they would have to be satisfied by the manufacturer that it is safe from a health point of view and that its use in the food is absolutely necessary.  Both <Col N="760" /> conditions must be satisfied.  The committee would also examine all the available evidence drawn up by international bodies such as the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation, and the Scientific Committee for Food of the EC before making their decision.</P>
    <P>My Department control the use of additives through regulations made under the Health Acts, 1947-70, and the European Communities Act, 1972. These regulations, made on the recommendation of the Food Advisory Committee, specify the additives which may be used in food and in some cases, restrict the use of specified additives to certain foods up to specific limits.  These regulations apply to the importation, distribution and sale of food and are regularly updated to take account of EC directives.</P>
    <P>In addition to these specific controls, the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Food Hygiene Regulations contain provisions which provide general protection to the public by prohibiting the sale of food which is adulterated, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The controls are enforced by the health boards.  Each health board conduct planned food sampling programmes under which different foods are sampled and analysed each week.  The samples are analysed by the public analysts.  They carry out a twofold analysis, one for compliance with specific regulations where these exist and one for compliance with the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Food Hygiene Regulations. The test used, where these are not prescribed in the relevant legislation, are internationally recognised ones.  If a sample is found not to comply with the law, the analysts issue a certificate on which prosecution proceedings may be taken by the health board.</P>
    <P>With regard to artificial sweeteners, no specific regulation on their use exists at present, with the exception of the Health (Cyclamate in Food) Regulations, 1970. However, the use of sweeteners is monitored by the public analysts with a view <Col N="761" /> to ensuring that no sweeteners are being sold here which are injurious to health.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular food additive referred to by the Deputy, the scientific evidence on this was considered by the relevant members of the Food Advisory Committee who advised the approval of its use in this country.  It has also been approved for use by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives of the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation; by the Food and Drugs Administration in the USA; by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the UK; and, most recently, in a report on artificial sweeteners from the Scientific Committee for Food of the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about a report in a recent publication that the Food and Drugs Administration in the US discovered that faked results were being published by independent research institutes in the US on artificial sweeteners and the publication showed that the sweetener mentioned in my question had produced tumours in laboratory animals during tests?  Will he inform the House if there has been any communication between his Department and the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States on this matter?  Further, is he concerned with the report in 1983 of the Southern Health Board which showed that 43 per cent of cooked foods that were analysed and 42 per cent of uncooked foods analysed were found to be unsatisfactory?  What steps does he propose to take to improve the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The allegation that the sweetener in question had been banned in the United States is not true. It was made in the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme on UTV before Christmas.  I think I have clarified that point in my first reply.  Secondly, I am aware of the report of the Southern Health Board.  I have not got it here in relation to my brief but it is a more general question about the operation of the hygiene regulations of the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say why we have not under the aegis of his Department a public health laboratory similar to that in other European countries to ensure that we have our own research facilities to examine specimens and to make certain that everything is up to the proper standards?  Do the Government intend to amend legislation to ensure, through the Department of Health or the health boards, that there will be control over food sold?  As the Minister is aware, much of the control, for example, in respect of meat and meat products rests with local authorities. Does the Minister not think it more appropriate that this power should be vested in the health boards so that the directors of community care would be responsible for ensuring that food is up to the right quality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be entirely opposed to the statement of the Deputy with the proviso that there should be a transfer of resources from the Department of the Environment or the local authorities to the health boards if that work was to be done.  Secondly, there is great pressure on my Department to play a much larger role in relation to additives in respect of agriculture.  I have agreed to the Department having a far stronger role in relation to additives in meat processed.  It looks as though we are going to have our hands full.  The Department would have to have a transfer of resources from the Department of Agriculture because we have a very small staff and we do not have the facility for this kind of operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break we were making our attitude clear to this legislation dealing with the ICI business.  We said that this legislative process now being recommended by the Government is unnecessary on one front if the liability as indicated by the Minister was to be taken at face value, that if the liability is of that level an internal arrangement could have saved the day rather than inflicting the trauma and difficulty that the country, the banking institutions and <Col N="811" /> national credibility has had to suffer since that time.  If that is not the case and if the liabilities are as they are intimated to us from sources both at home and abroad, the existing legislation is tantamount to providing the Government with an open cheque to deal with the matter.  It will mean that the State will take over by and large the funding of the compensation fund set up under the 1964 Act, which now has very wide limits.  The limits laid down at that time were removed by the 1983 emergency legislation.  Consequently, we are satisfied that the Government intend using this legislative vehicle to saddle the taxpayers with contributing the funding necessary to pay the liabilities as they fall due.</P>
      <P>On both counts we have to oppose the legislation.  We offered alternatives that might have been considered had the Government not acted so hastily in dealing with the matter on 15 March.  The leader of my party gave the instance of the commercial bank in Canada, where interested parties both in government and banking circles are being brought together to provide the rescue package, as an example of what might well be contemplated under the aegis of the Central Bank Act.  We were dismissive of the Minister's attempt to rule out the Central Bank involvement in this matter because some of us believe sincerely that the Central Bank had a crucial part to play both in allowing AIB to take on this non-banking activity and in subsequently forcing their hand to get out and to bring the matter into Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talked about the necessity that arises under the supervisory authority's responsibilities in dealing with the supervision of insurance in general.  It is obvious to everyone now that we have a very serious criticism of the supervisory authority in the way that it dealt with insurance over a period.  We are critical of the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, in the way he has responded to repeated calls to deal with these matters.  The Minister of State has disregarded all the pleas and we see now the consequences.  We are being <Col N="812" /> forced into dealing with a crisis that could have been foreseen and promptly dealt with to avoid this serious crisis.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the question of the necessary technical reserves to deal with liability cover and the question of solvency requirements which must dictate the minimum level of capital and retained reserves.  The EC solvency margin stands at about 17 per cent of annual premium income.  This solvency margin is a prudent regulation had the Minister seen fit to apply it and seen to it that the margin was being maintained by ICI and others acting in this business.  It is necessary because the insurance company accepts unlimited risk and also the liability for claims are usually conservatively provided. The assets may realise less than their face valuation and there are often exceptional claims to be paid.</P>
    <P>In Irish insurance circumstances a underwriting break-even is the minimum target, but unfortunately in practice underwriting always results in utilising investment income.  The more acceptable norm should be 5 per cent underwriting profit.  Normally, insurers lay off portion of the risk with others by way of re-insurance paying a premium for the protection. This protection is necessary against the danger of exceptionally large claims and it is arranged by laying of the risk in tranches.  The net premium returns to the Department, included in the blue book figures consist of the gross premiums less the amounts laid off by re-insurance. The solvency of a direct insurer depends on the effectiveness of the transfer of some of the liability of the undertaking to re-insurers and maintaining adequate assets to meet the liability which has been retained.  These necessary safeguards and regulations were not complied with in the instance of ICI and there is considerable anxiety being expressed that these regulations are not complied with by a number of other insurers also.</P>
    <P>From the blue book, which was provided last evening, I am in a position to prove to the Minister that these solvency margins and the technical reserves are not being maintained by other insurers. While we do not want to make statements <Col N="813" /> which would put a run on anything, we are bringing it to the Minister's notice that he as the supervisory authority has not acted prudently in dealing with the technical reserves and solvency measures necessary to maintain the cover needed to cover the liabilities.  This should have been painfully obvious to the Minister after the PMPA business of 1983.</P>
    <P>The total cost of claims is the product of the number of claims and the size of the claims.  The greatest complaint adding to the cost of the claims and resulting in higher premiums for everyone is that the High Court damages as assessed by juries is completely out of line with the estimate of damages in other countries.  There is an inconsistency of awards and a lack of predictability in these awards.  There is no doubt but that claimants will fight right up to the High Court in the expectation of getting a more substantial award than if they made an earlier settlement.  The level of jury awards that have been granted in this country has actively discouraged attempts at out of court settlements. Our awards system is in advance of awards in the United Kingdom and many of the jury awards have been halved on appeal to the Supreme Court.  It would appear that many juries regard insurance companies as impersonal bodies capable of withstanding any claim.  We are now virtually on our own in so far as the settlement of awards by juries are concerned and, in fact, the United Kingdom abandoned the system of juries in these type of cases almost 51 years ago.  However, it must be stated that the jury system has always been seen as a basic feature of the independent administration of justice and should not be challenged in relation to the determination of guilt.  The aim should be to secure a level of award which is fair and just, taking the comparability of cases into account.</P>
    <P>A greater degree of consistency is necessary in awards.  There is no particular difficulty in assessing special damages, such as medical and hospital fees and loss of earnings as these are matters of proof and mathematics.  However, in the area of general damages the least that should <Col N="814" /> be entertained in advance of a Government White Paper on the whole question of the appropriateness of the jury system in damages claims is the authority to the judge to inform the jury of the going rate of general damages for particular types of claims.  The Government review, with a specified time scale to report, should also consider the whole area of pre-trial procedures, legal fees, system delays, the level of legal representation needed and jurisdiction of various courts in considering cases.</P>
    <P>If curbing the claims side is to be an integral part of official strategy in maintaining solvency of insurers and controlling premium costs and generally easing the burden on policy holders, then swift Government action is needed whether entrenched vested interests are dented or not.</P>
    <P>In the ICI case while the Government may not have a clue as to the eventual liability it will have to meet, some interesting facts regarding the London office of ICI operation give us some indication as to why AIB cut its losses and ran for Government cover.  The underwriting policy of trading in the non-marine market dealing with general insurance seems to have been the undoing of ICI. It was regarded as one of the softest markets in London, certainly it was not selective in the kind of business it took on board and was loosely referred to as the &ldquo;rubbish bin&rdquo; of the insurance world.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that prior to AIB taking over ICI completely the London market would not accept policy documents until they were guaranteed by AIB.  When one considers the type of high risk ventures ICI was insuring is it any wonder they were figured as a &lsquo;soft touch&rsquo;?  They were, in fact, thrown out of the Fire Officers Committee because they did not accept basic rates.</P>
    <P>Take the example of the suicidal rate quoted by ICI for the Association of British Travel Agents account.  A scheme had been handled by Accident and General Insurance Brokers, using Norwich Union for years, but was switched dramatically to ICI when the latter undercut the premium of £12 million reducing it to £7 <Col N="815" /> million.  An unsolicited approach by another broker had offered to arrange the cover with ICI, a subsidiary of AIB. That was the selling point in getting the premium accepted.  The whole industry regarded the deal as unrealistic.  It is understood that losses were being experienced from the first week from taking on the account.  ICI was also involved in huge claims following the Australian bush fires in 1983, the malfunction of satellites and the collapse of Air Florida. It is understood that the London office had a very aggressive role in the re-insurance markets, with particular reference to bloodstock business, which represented 25 per cent of its general accident portfolio.  As a reinsurer they were accepting business that others would not keep on their own accounts.  Trying to generate huge volumes of business at low cost in high risk areas proved disastrous for them.  The word is&mdash;and this can be verified &mdash; that ICI were doing a lot of their own re-insurance through their own office in Guernsey.  It is said that was being done through their re-insurance operation there known as Re-insurance Corporation of Guernsey.  They were also re-insuring in South America and South American re-insurance is described by Lloyds as the bucket operation of re-insurance, the last resort of any re-insurer.</P>
    <P>To get the volumes they had to utilise binding authority mechanisms and delegated underwriting devices which committed ICI to accept risk over which they had no control.  The holders of these binding authorities get paid by commission, but they are not the risk carriers. When claims arose the insurer had to make the pay out.  ICI had a large number of binding authorities.  It is to be hoped that even at this late stage the holders of these binding authorities have been terminated.</P>
    <P>A fundamental question that must be asked is who authorised this kind of risk taking and surely nobody can suggest that it was going on without the knowledge and support of its base organisation.</P>
    <P>The activity of ICI did not comply with <Col N="816" /> the scheme of operations dimension by which each licensed holder granted a licence by the Minister must satisfy the supervisory authority.  It seems nobody applied the rules to ICI, on the public liability and employers liability side.  ICI, had underestimated their claims liability by a huge 55.2 per cent in the period 1978 to 1982.  As AIB were both shareholders and on the board of ICI, this information of under provision must have been known to them.  The only question that has to be asked here is why AIB at the date of take-over did not make their offer for ICI shares conditional on an independent assessment of the ICI provisions to cover their liabilities.  The figures were never challenged by the bank or the supervisory authority and so in the apportionment of blame for the crisis ICI must have the biggest burden of responsibility followed by the supervisory authority and the bank itself.</P>
    <P>With the emergence of the figures it must have been obvious to the bank that the bank itself was looking into a bottomless pit which, if the worst came to the worst, would condemn our major banking institution to an untenable position which would not just spell disaster for its own continuation in business, but could result in a serious aggravation of our banking solvency with all the attendant national and international dangers which that implies.</P>
    <P>The delay since 15 March in producing the legislation before us, which is necessary to deal with the matter, has had a debilitating effect on both the financial market and on Government credibility. Government inaction today has exacerbated an already uncertain situation.  If it was decided that legislation was necessary and if, as we are told, that negotiations were taking place for weeks before the announcement, then arrangements should have been concluded and announcements made only when the legislative process was clear and prepared.  What we got eventually is what looks like an innocuous piece of legislation but it could be an albatross around the neck of the country for years.</P>
    <P>The Government's timing of their own <Col N="817" /> response leaves something to be desired and shows a further example of mismanagement of the country's affairs.  Another example of the Department's inefficiency is its tardiness in the publication of the blue book for 1983, which deals with the summary of the statements of insurance business.  It is just another indicator of the inefficiency at Government level in dealing with the insurance industry. Making an excuse for the delay in publication as the non-availability of the PMPA figures until December 1984 is unacceptable. This was known to the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Collins, on 30 January 1985, when he indicated that the blue book would be published in February of this year at the latest.  An inquiry made to the Department on 18 March resulted in information that the matter was before the Government and publication could be expected in the immediate future.  On Thursday, 21 March the Taoiseach seemed totally unaware of what the position was but promised to let me have the information on that day.</P>
    <P>The following morning, Friday 22 March the Department informed me that matters regarding the publication of the blue book were not yet at an advance stage and that publication must be further delayed.  The details dealing with profit and loss account for non-life insurance business, balance sheets for non-life insurance business, together with particulars of non-life insurance written outside Ireland during the year 1983 would be of considerable help in determining the true picture of the insurance debacle we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>One has to be just a little suspicious of the Government motive in not meeting their blue book publication deadline.  The blue book has now been published and shows a continuing crisis in general insurance. While I have not had much time to consider the implications in the blue book, to prove the point which the leader of Fianna Fáil made this morning and which I now confirm, there is a continuing crisis in non-life insurance here, and the Minister, even at this late stage, is not prepared to do anything about it.  The <Col N="818" /> 1983 blue book shows very clearly the problems facing the general insurance industry with underwriting losses of almost £99 million in the areas of motor liability and fire insurance.  By far the greatest loss area is motor vehicle insurance with 24 of the 25 companies reporting underwriting losses amounting to £52.495 million and also showing provisions for outstanding claims of £465.405 million, of which provision for the PMPA is £215.938 million and for the ICI £13.954 million.</P>
    <P>The other heavy loss area was liability insurance with underwriting losses totalling almost £36 million.  In this area, 26 of the 28 companies underwriting this business made heavy losses and the two exceptions only underwrote a total of £19,000 in liability premiums.  The ICI suffered the largest losses here, with an underwriting loss of over £7 million, over £3 million higher than the next loss maker.  One must remember the report printed in a Sunday newspaper recently which suggested that the outstanding claim estimates in the ICI were reduced by 42.5 per cent which would imply that the liability losses of the ICI were far greater than the figures stated.  The total premium income for business written in Ireland amounted to £419,932,000, of which £243 million was written by Irish controlled companies and which accumulated underwriting losses of £58 million, which shows that seven of the 30 companies underwriting in the Republic of Ireland accumulated over 58 per cent of the losses which must give cause for concern, especially since two of these companies are in the hands of administrators. The unsatisfactory situation which has arisen must cause the Minister concern as he is responsible for the overseeing of the industry.  It is interesting to note that the ratio between claims paid and those outstanding for motor insurance for ICI is 1.45 to one where the normal satisfactory ratio is 2.4 to one which suggests that the company were not satisfactorily estimating their motor liabilities.  This should have been enough to warn the Minister and the supervisory authority that appropriate action should have been taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> It was also suggested today that there was one motor insurer that did not lose money but the Hibernian Insurance Company &mdash; the company referred to &mdash; are under-reserving their motor insurance account and the ratio of claims outstanding in relation to claims paid is 1.76 to one.  The Minister knows that prudent underwriters would be talking about a ratio of up to 3.7 to one.  This is a clear indication that there are insurance companies who give cause for concern in so far as their technical reserves and solvency margins are concerned.</P>
    <P>At last the need for new legislation to amend the Insurance Acts 1909 to 1982 with a view to facilitating a more effective control of insurance companies must now be self-evident even to a reluctant Minister and supervisory authority.  New arrangements are necessary to deal with the revocation of authorisations in cases of doubtful solvency, minimum share capital requirements, including reserving and solvency requirements to cater for the modern circumstances dealing with reinsurance and matters related to EC Directives, including the qualifications for directors and managers of insurance companies.  There must be new regulations concerning the issue of solvency certificates, laying out the precise terms of procedures and conditions under which these certificates can be granted.</P>
    <P>There is also need for review of the calculation of technical reserves and the valuation of assets with particular reference to the underwriting of liabilities. The parameters necessary as regards information on the reinsurance arrangements should be unambiguosly stated in any new legislation.  The Minister must also have absolute general power to require information in any circumstances concerning the insurance business.  There must be new and adequate safeguards which will allow the Minister to satisfy himself that the obligations under the Acts are being satisfied completely.</P>
    <P>New procedures must also be provided for the submission of returns and accounts to the supervisory authority. These accounts and returns should and <Col N="820" /> must be certified by an auditor or an actuary nominated by the Minister and operating independently of the accountants attached to the insurer.</P>
    <P>All these new measurers must apply to the insurance company and include companies connected or dependent on the major insurance company.  Once and for all the penalty for non-compliance with the regulations should be that if the requisitions are not met then there should be immediate suspension of the authorisation to write insurance until such time as the supervisory authority is satisfied.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has reason to believe that there is doubtful solvency in the operation of any insurer or has not made adequate arrangements for re-insurance then the Minister must be able to authorise that the offending company refrain from taking new business of a specified type of classes; refrain from making certain investments and realise certain investments to bring back their margins of solvency.  It should be an underlying requirement that all insurers granted licences must maintain assets in the State to deal with all total domestic liabilities.</P>
    <P>In any new arrangements concerning the control of insurance business, from the experience gleaned during this unfortunate situation, it is paramount that the Minister will have some control over the Directors of insurance companies.  The Minister should have full information regarding the qualification and experience of those seeking authorisations, be they directors and managers and if he is not satisfied the Minister should be empowered to curtail or cancel any authorisation granted by his supervisory authority.  All changes in directors and chief executive officers should be notified to the Minister and he should retain the right to veto any appointment.  Actuarial experience is vital to insurance undertaking and the Minister should lay down certain minimum requirements of persons who may be appointed as actuaries.</P>
    <P>Because of the inherent dangers in the reinsurance business it is essential that in the future no reinsurance assurance business be allowed unless specifically <Col N="821" /> authorised in the licence to operate.  The accounts of any such reinsurance should be submitted to the Registrar of Companies under the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>There is also need to increase the paid-up share capital of undertakings seeking authorisation to write insurance business. So far as any new procedures are concerned, the Minister should be entitled to attach any conditions he thinks fit to an authorisation to carry on an undertaking with power to revoke these authorisations if conditions are not fully complied with.</P>
    <P>Had these or a similar type of regulations been in operation for the past number of years then there is no doubt that the present crisis could have been averted and the AIB instead of buying into what they confidentially expected was a prosperous and solvent insurance company, would have been spared a major embarrassment and a major upset of their growth pattern.</P>
    <P>The British Board of Trade, its supervision and monitoring régime, are also suspect and cannot escape the charge of negligence so far as ICI are concerned. Could it be that their concern for the solvency of a company with an Irish banking guarantee was less than that which applied to other insurers under their supervision?  The lines of co-operation between London and Dublin departments of supervision need some attention and perhaps a new bilateral arrangement is overdue.  As both supervisory authorities operate under EC directives and regulations, the British supervisory authority should be asked to give a full and clear account of their position in this crisis and what steps they had undertaken to see that ICI was monitored properly in their London office.</P>
    <P>There is a difference of opinion as to the responsibility of the British Board of Trade in this collapse.  The Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would hold that the British authorities are responsible for the activities of the ICI branch located in London and that the Dublin office are responsible for the overall solvency of the company. There are those who hold the alternative <Col N="822" /> view and claim that the British Board of Trade have no responsibility in effect for the ICI branch office in London.  The matter needs to be clarified at this time as conflicting evidence is being put forward by pseudo-experts on all sides.  The Minister should clear up this matter once and for all.</P>
    <P>There is widespread comment that the bank have got off lightly in this matter, but it has to be admitted that the cost has been high to the bank also.  There is no doubt that this has been an unhappy episode for AIB and that it has been a major embarrassment for them, both on the domestic front and in their continuing relationships with international bankers. In a business where confidence and competence is the hallmark of success, then this collapse has been a major loss for the bank.  The £86 million write-off together with the £6 million that the £50 million soft loan will cost over a three-year period are substantial sums and will result in very restricted profit and dividend growth for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The stock market has responded very unfavourably in so far as the price of the bank's shares is concerned and it has to be understood that the capital base of the bank has been severely weakened and it cannot withstand further weakening without rendering it very vulnerable to pressures which would undermine its solvency. There is talk of extra contributions which the bank have considered making available other than the £50 million cheap interest loan which has already been allowed.  This kind of rescue by instalment is not the best way to restore public confidence in financial institutions and it would be well for the Minister to outline in the clearest and most unambiguous terms precisely what has been agreed with the bank and when and how much will be paid to relieve the State's burden in this situation.</P>
    <P>We are led to believe that further arrangements were negotiated even in the very recent past with the bank as an institution.  The least this House can expect when considering the position is to know the full details of the contracts, deals, arrangements and so on.  Great <Col N="823" /> efforts have been made by Government spokesmen to indicate that the full liabilities are not yet known and will not be available for some time, but it has to be stated straight up that if the system operated properly, if the proper checks and balances existed at banking and supervisory authority levels, then an absolute estimate of all liabilities should have been possible within two or three days.</P>
    <P>The most advanced accounting and computerisation systems in the world are installed in these major institutions and surely it is not too much to expect that read-outs could be made available quicker than the estimated time of two months.  This whole uncertainty places Deputies at a very severe disadvantage. While some might suggest that AIB bought a pig in a poke originally, they always had the major trump card of disengagement at any time by liquidation, which was available to them, or the preferred option now utilised of using the Government as a safety net.</P>
    <P>But now the Government are in the same position.  They are rescuing the pig in the poke and are completely blindfolded as to the cost.  It is unsatisfactory for the State to take on unlimited liability in an area of high risk on a perpetual basis.  Nationalising a major percentage of the insurance business of the country has many inherent dangers for the State, and it would be undesirable if the State has to carry all the high risks, the bad risks and be the last insurer in the decline cases area.</P>
    <P>Somebody should have explained the reasoning behind the dividend pay out by the bank.  There was justified anger amongst the public that the bank were looking after their own, while they were being asked to carry the can.  Shareholders accepted the risk when the new business was taken on.  They should be expected to carry some of the liability of the loss.  Somebody should also have come clean on what the national problems would have been had the AIB ended up in serious difficulty.  Stock market confidence in the shares of AIB was, and <Col N="824" /> still is, an absolute essential.  Institutional funds, and in particular pension funds, had to be guaranteed investment income to meet the commitment which would affect thousands of ordinary people.  To weaken the capital base further than that which already has taken place, would be to render the bank vulnerable.  The consequences of such a situation can only be speculated on and the wave of resentment against the bank in guaranteeing the dividend was more acute than any other single thing that happened subsequently. If paying the dividend was necessary to maintain the bank, clear reasons as to why it was necessary should have been given.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, in fairness to the bank, that the bank did not create the problem in ICI &mdash; that problem was there before AIB came along &mdash; but if a proper public relations exercise had been undertaken by somebody to indicate to the general public the reason why the dividend had to be paid and the consequences of not paying it, the people might have adopted a more balanced attitude. It has been stated that the paying of the dividend was necessary to maintain confidence of national and international depositors and that it was taken to maintain the bank's need to continue to attract fresh capital on the international market for use in the development of the bank's business both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in excess of 60 per cent of the shareholding in AIB is held by institutional investors and most of it by pension funds of Irish workers, and there is nobody in this House prepared to say that they would like to see done down to the rights or incomes of the thousands of pensioners who are dependent on the investment income which accrues from investment made by institutions catering for their funds.  The remainder is held by 27,000 individual shareholders and 88 per cent of them live in Ireland.  The individual shareholding on average is about 2,000 shares.  The dividend it will attract, even on last year's good figures, will be no more than £200 less tax in the current year.  Those 2,000 shares held by the vast majority are only <Col N="825" /> capitalised at about £2,500.  If it was so important to pay out the dividend somebody should have told the public the reason why.</P>
    <P>There is speculation that the claims provision on the employers liability and public liability account for 1983 was deliberately cut by 42.5 per cent on the orders of management.  This is a crucial point and must be answered if the charge of culpable negligence is to be avoided by management of ICI.</P>
    <P>The competence of decision makers in the highest echelons of commercial life should be capable of being taken for granted.  Banking and related business is built on trust and confidence and this has been severely dented.  Whatever rescue package has to be devised it should be just and fair, bearing in mind the circumstances of the case, and it should be undertaken with as much speed as prudent so that we can return to normal business relationships with the minimum of disruption.  This legislation does not do that &mdash; it creates continuing uncertainty as to the extent of taxpayers' liability and makes budgetary adjustments inevitable for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Central Bank control over diversifications in the financial services sector will have to be much more rigid and unless financial institutions can prove a competence and expertise in dealing with non-related areas to their own types of business, then no licence should be granted for ventures into new types of business.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis in the general insurance industry.  The blue book statistics on the revenue accounts for 1982 and 1983 reveal that the majority of companies recorded losses.  Many of them are substantial and some are in excess of £2 million each.  The interim company results for 1983 indicate even worse results for that year and nobody disclaims the view that the position has worsened since that time.  Some companies have attempted to weather the storm with redundancies, cutbacks, permanent or temporary close of new business in the loss making classes and increased premiums with additional cover restrictions. <Col N="826" /> The latest premium increases announced at an average of 40 per cent or more means simply that fewer people will be able to provide themselves with cover, there will be more unemployment created in industries unable to pay premiums and more companies and individuals will be risking it without any general cover whatsoever.  A further increase in the number of uninsured motorists is inevitable.</P>
    <P>The big five loss makers in insurance are public liability, employees liability, motor insurance, household and fire damage.  It is generally accepted now by all the insurers that the main causes for the losses in these areas are the size of claims, the damage awards granted at High Court level, a slow legislative procedure, the rise in the crime rate, the rising number of uninsured motorists, poor safety precautions in industry and the excessive competition in the market place.  All of these areas are directly responsible to the Government but little action has taken place and what has happened so far has been ineffective.  There is, in effect, no price control mechanism operating in general insurance.  Insurance costs are out of control and, as well as putting insurance companies at risk, they are creating unbelievable burdens for industry and consumers generally.</P>
    <P>The compensation fund and the Motor Insurance Bureau demands, in addition to the increased premium being charged, are crippling the consumer and any further penalising of the consumer will leave general insurance outside the reach of the majority of the community.  Costs is an area where the Minister has a direct input.  He is responsible for the operation of the Prices Acts including insurance charges.  Keeping solvency maintenance in mind, he has to keep prices at a competitive rate.  The premiums being asked by some companies, when available at all, can increase by up to 100 per cent every premium renewal day.  On the other hand, the State company already operating is offering discounted rates in an insurance class where every insurer is losing money and this company, the PMPA, has no worth while investment <Col N="827" /> income to support its liability claims.  Its figures in the &lsquo;blue book&rsquo; make interesting reading, even for 1983.  If any worthwhile impact is to be made on the price and cost of insurance the Government will have to give first priority to the elimination of the causes I outlined.  This is the only effective way that the consumer can be given a fair chance of getting insurance at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>The Opposition will not do down the bank because to do so would be to commit economic hara-kiri.  What we want to do is to strengthen our financial institutions and protect our national integrity.  This party do not seek political advantage at the State's expense.  There has been an irresponsible outburst of craw-thumping and Government hand-wringing in the past few days, with selected inspired leaks to the media which have added further trauma to the State's dilemma.  In a crisis of this dimension it is shameful for the Government, the backbenchers in particular, to seek cheap political advantage from a mess partially created by their own incompetence and ineptitude.</P>
    <P>Labour and Fine Gael backbenchers trying to ingratiate themselves with the taxpayer and play the double game by making demands which this legislation does not purport to satisfy is shoddy and irresponsible.  They should take a lead from the responsible position taken up by Fianna Fáil which will not only safeguard the bank and the financial institutions, but also protect the taxpayer from an intolerable burden.</P>
    <P>There may be many who wish to cry over spilt milk, but they are wasted tears. What has to be done is to restore confidence, provide a rescue package that is fair and just and take whatever measures are necessary to guarantee that we will never again have to use the October 1983 emergency legislation.  We cannot accept that this legislation deals properly with the situation.  Consequently we oppose the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent from the speeches which have been made that all of us taking part in the debate do so with <Col N="828" /> a sense of great responsibility and some apprehension.  I do not think any Member of the House thought we would be discussing a financial crisis on the scale of the operation we are now discussing which has such grave implications for our economy, the entire banking system, industry, taxpayers and for our reputation for financial integrity worldwide.  For that reason it is clear that the House is treating this debate with great gravity and responsibility, fully aware of the consequences of wild and irresponsible talk from within the House over the next few days.</P>
      <P>At the outset it is important to say it would be a great pity if this debate were to turn into an orgy of bank bashing. Most of us feel, perhaps from painful personal experience or from our observations of the operations of the banks over the past number of years, that there could be much justification for such an approach.  There is very much about AIB that is positive and has been positive. AIB, an Irish bank run by ordinary, decent, responsible, patriotic Irish people, have contributed a great deal to our economic development over the past number of decades and will, I believe, keep on doing so in the years to come.</P>
      <P>This whole episode raises a number of very important questions many of which have been covered by previous speakers. There are five questions which I believe are crucial to our understanding of the entire episode and to the action which has to be taken.  The first question is what really happened at ICI to produce such a financial catastrophe.  Secondly, there is the question as to whether or not AIB could have known and should have foreseen what was to happen.  Thirdly, there is the question of the regulatory controls. This is especially important in view of the results published yesterday about the state of the insurance industry generally. The fourth question which arises from all of this is whether or not AIB are meeting their fair share of a problem which is, whether directly or indirectly, their responsibility.  The fifth and crucial question is how the interest of the taxpayer can best be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> On the question of what happened at ICI to produce this disaster, how did this apparently once profitable and lucrative company end up as it did?  It is clear that there was an element of bad luck in all of this.  What is even more clear is the fact that there was appalling judgment, reckless gambling, and irresponsibility on the part of those at the top of the ICI operation in London which was close to criminal.  It is also clear that the board of directors of ICI were not operating properly.  They were not properly vigilant. They were not aware of the decisions being taken in their names.  All of this is now very clear.  It is clear also that for some considerable time there was unease.  Not just among those in the know in high financial circles, but even on the fringes of those involved in the financial world there was unease about the problems of ICI.</P>
    <P>One employee of ICI told me recently that last October during the strike at ICI the conversation on the picket lines among the most junior staff very frequently centred on such things as the flamboyant life style of the London chief executives, the inordinate amount of entertaining at that level, the apparent disregard for cost or value at the top levels of ICI. Obviously none of this caused the problems, but it was symptomatic of something that was seriously wrong in a major and what should be a very sober organisation. It was clear at that stage to even the most junior employee of ICI in Dublin that there was great unease about the nature of the business being carried out and its potential.  There was unease about the too close association of some of the top people in London with underwriters whose reputations were less than reputable on the London scene.</P>
    <P>Other allegations were made which may very well surface in the course of time.  Deputy Flynn has done a great service today by highlighting many of the areas of concern and unease felt about the London operation of ICI.  He has done so in a way which is fully documented. These are issues which certainly deserve to be investigated in the fullest <Col N="830" /> possible way.  I urge a very full investigation of ICI and its London operation, its business, its accounts, the role of its auditors and the style of its managers. Anybody who examines the situation there must consider that at best &mdash; and that is giving it the benefit of the doubt &mdash; there was incompetence on a massive scale.  I fear it was far more than that.  I fear there may have been fraud, that there may have been malpractice.  For that reason an investigation is of the utmost urgency.</P>
    <P>I do not do this out of any sense of vindictiveness although I do say that when heads roll in ICI, as heads must roll, we should have no repetition of what happened in the case of Irish Shipping when those who were responsible for the key policy decisions got the large golden handsakes and were paid off, while the workers who were not responsible for policy decisions got very little.  There can be no repetition of that in this case.  There can be no buying off, or paying off, or softening the blow for people who are well paid to take hard decisions and right decisions.  If they fail they must be seen to pay the full price.  I do not believe the public would tolerate the paying out of golden handshakes in a case like this, and the public would be right.</P>
    <P>The main lesson we must learn from an investigation which must take place into ICI is what happened and, based on that, we must ensure that nothing of this sort ever happens again or is allowed to happen again.  If that means new legislation and new regulations, so be it.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second main point I raised, that is, should AIB have known the real situation in ICI when they made their purchase?  Obviously, they did not.  That is clear.  Should they have known?  I must admit to being very puzzled about all of this and I am not as clear in my own mind as some other speakers have been on this question. There was plenty of evidence to show that ICI was potentially a good investment.  It is ironic that some of the financial journalists who are now most critical of AIB for having done this were saying at the time <Col N="831" /> that AIB had made a very good investment and that the takeover fitted in with the expansion and development plans of AIB in their attempt to establish what is called one stop banking.  Doubts, and indeed they are more than doubts, arise about the manner in which AIB went about making this purchase.  Was the evidence upon which they based their decisions good enough?  If AIB were financing the takeover of ICI by some other firm, would they be satisfied with the sort of investigations which were carried out?  I do not think they would.  In fact I am very sure they would not.</P>
    <P>I believe that in all of this AIB broke some of the rules of good banking which they tell other people about so frequently. It is essential at this stage for us to know the evidence upon which AIB made their decision.  It is vital that the role of the ICI auditors in all of this is brought out fully into the open.  It has not been explained yet.  There must be in all of our minds a feeling that something is hidden.  Was it just incompetence or was it something worse?  That is especially true about the role of the auditors.  This is probably <i>sub judice</i> at the moment so I cannot go any further on it.  The fullest disclosures must be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the AIB, once the scale of the difficulties was apparent they acted fairly quickly.  It has to be said, for example, that the bank acquired full equity in ICI in September 1983.  At that time they had access to audited accounts showing a profit of £8 million for the year to December 1982.  The budget for the year to December 1983 forecast profits in line with those achieved in 1982.  It was only in March 1984 that it was apparent that the certified outturn for the year to December 1983 would be a profit of £2 million, a very significant downturn on the original forecast.</P>
    <P>From that point on the bank acted fairly speedily and fairly decisively.  There was the appointment of the international consultants to review structures and systems in the ICI, the appointment of a reserving committee to examine the adequacies against future claims, the <Col N="832" /> appointment of a senior bank executive to work closely with ICI management in determining future business policy and the appointment of the bank's own auditors to do an in-depth study of ICI, both in Dublin and London.  One could say that by the end of 1984 AIB had taken all the steps that were conventionally possible and acceptable for corrective action but, unfortunately, by that stage the problem was of such proportion that these steps were of little use.</P>
    <P>The third question raised here was dealt with in great detail by Deputy Flynn.  As somebody who rarely finds too much to agree with from that Deputy, I find very little to disagree with in what he said about the need for tighter controls and the type of controls which he outlined. I accept that the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism acted as soon as the warning lights began to flash.  I am not so sure that the same is true of the Board of Trade in Britain; I am not sure at all that there was proper liaison between that board and our Department.  I am not sure that the Board of Trade acted with the vigour and vigilance that one would expect.  I should like to know, before the debate ends, the extent to which there was liaison between our Department and that board in this matter.</P>
    <P>More than that, the whole episode raised very vividly the need to have an immediate review of the regulatory procedures for banking and for insurance. Nobody wants a system under which the operation of the banks and insurance companies are throttled by over-regulation or by too much bureaucratic control but the scale of the problem is such, the possibility of malpractice so great, the cost to the community so enormous, that it is essential that out of this debate and this episode there comes a strong determination to see the widest possible review of the regulations, the reporting back procedure, the liaison between our Government and the governments of other countries, where relevant.  All of this must be tackled and tackled so that something which we are now debating can never happen again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> The fourth point has raised most controversy, that is, the contribution of AIB to the overall cost.  I believe that AIB's approach initially was the right one.  They were correct to put the emphasis, on the weekend on which the story broke, on the maintaining of confidence in our banking systems and our financial institutions.  In doing that, it is clear to everybody in this House that the consequences of a major run on the AIB, of lost deposits, even of a hint of instability for our entire economy, for the country and for the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people could have been catastrophic.  In ensuring that the public knew that the shareholders' dividends were sacrosanct, in AIB's assurance that they were getting out of this comparatively lightly, they displayed an arrogance and insensitivity which has now become part of the overall problem.  That insensitivity, to put it at its mildest, has created a backlash of resentment and anger against the bank.  These are not coming just from those who perhaps spend all their time chipping away at the banks, whom they see as bastions of capitalism which must be attacked at all costs, but from all sections of the community, the most sober, three-piece, pinstripe suited businessmen in the banking and insurance world, in the board rooms, all around the city and country.  It comes from those who see themselves hard pressed by the banks and who have been lectured by them over the past number of years.  This resentment is real and tangible and it has now become part of the problem.  It raises comparisons with, say, the bailing out of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>Comparisons are being made with the way in which the banks themselves deal with those who find themselves in financial trouble.  The comparisons being made are fair and ones which the banks, in trying to put their case across, must bear very much in mind.  The banks have gone part of the way towards answering some of these questions.  I found during the past week that officials in the bank went to a great deal of trouble to try to put information at my disposal and that of other Deputies who were looking for <Col N="834" /> information on which to base their judgment in the debate here today.  There is a great deal more for the banks to do to get across a case which to me at this stage is not a particularly strong one.</P>
    <P>There is, among the general public, universal agreement that AIB should pay a greater share of the cost and that there must be some return to the Irish taxpayer. Straightaway &mdash; and I do not see why this has not happened already, &mdash; there should be a coming together of the major financial institutions to see if they can work out some sort of package and if they, collectively, have ideas which could help to resolve this crisis and alleviate the burden on the taxpayer.  Many would agree with me &mdash; and I see very little argument against it &mdash; that the State should be offered some substantial shareholding in AIB.  There may be problems associated with this, but if there are, they do not seem to be of a substantial nature and pose no ideological problems for me, nor, I believe, for anybody on this side of the House &mdash; much as that may surprise the leader of the Workers' Party who is in the hamber at the moment. This question of a major shareholding in AIB for the State should be explored as a matter of urgency by the banks and the Government.  In this way, the public will be seen to be getting some tangible return for their very substantial investment in AIB at present.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect which puzzles me. I am surprised that so far in the debate there has been no mention at all of AIB's American bank, the First American Bank, which is a major asset of theirs.  I want to draw an analogy with a farmer who is expanding, goes to the bank and borrows money.  He buys some extra land and then finds that he has overstretched himself and the advice given by his local bank manager, or perhaps the regional office, would be to sell off the most recent investment, the outlying land, in order to safeguard the home farm.  That advice has been given and followed all over the country, especially when many farmers overstretched themselves in the splurge of buying in the seventies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> In this case, AIB have on their balance sheet the outlying farm, a major asset, their first bank in the United States, which they acquired at about the same time as they acquired ICI as part of their dramatic expansion programme.  This is recognised to be a prime asset.  I have taken advice from experts in the United States who say that this bank would be readily saleable.  AIB paid $107 million for their 45 per cent shareholding in this bank.  Based on similar type deals, I am told that a strategic holding like this could be sold at present for between $138 million and $165 million.  Perhaps I am naive and do not understand.  Any perusal of my bank account would show that I am not an expert in banking matters, but this question seems to be one of central importance.</P>
    <P>If the bank was following the advice it gives other people who overstretched themselves, then I believe it would be seriously looking at this option.  I am surprised that no serious consideration seems to have been given to the option of selling this investment which would realise a major profit for AIB and could contribute in a major way towards the funding of the ICI losses.  Such a disposal would not only make substantial cash available to the bank and reduce its need to rely on Exchequer funding to support ICI but would also improve the strength of AIB's balance sheet.  As this bank in Maryland is an entirely overseas asset its disposal would have minimal impact on our economy and on AIB's traditional profit and asset base here.  I wonder why that option has not been looked at or, if it has been looked at, why the possibilities involved have not been spelled out.</P>
    <P>In conclusion &mdash; I know there is a large number of speakers wishing to contribute &mdash; I believe the Government acted decisively, that any other action would have had catastrophic consequences.  The legislation we are now debating forms an essential part of the rescue operation. Failure to pass this Bill on Friday could have enormous implications which are perhaps too frightening to contemplate. But in passing this legislation we should <Col N="836" /> not preclude the putting together of a new package with a far greater contribution from AIB, a package which would ensure that the burden of this catastrophe &mdash; which was not of the State's or the taxpayer's making &mdash; will fall as little as possible on the taxpayer and, in return, the taxpayer will be given some chance of benefiting from the very substantial investment all of us are now being asked to make in AIB.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this important Bill and the consequences of the financial problem into which the Insurance Corporation of Ireland have got themselves.  I want to put on record that we on this side of the House have been very responsible in regard to this whole matter over the last ten days.  While as an Opposition party it could be tempting for us to move in another direction, we took a very responsible line on this, not like members of other political parties who leaped in and did not know when to leap out.</P>

      <P>Allied Irish Banks have served the people, the agricultural community and industry here well.  We must also assure the public that the deposits and accounts of people held by Allied Irish Banks are in good hands at this point and are in a very sound position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> I want now to come to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and the manner in which they have conducted their affairs for some time.  It is clear to me that for some years past they had been writing up very bad business.  Here I speak as perhaps the only Deputy in this House who worked in the insurance industry in the fifties and early sixties.  Therefore I have good knowledge of the industry. That was a time when we insured cars for £8.  Those were the days.  The situation has changed much since my time. Because of my knowledge of the business I can go into some rather technical detail.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that this situation arose over four or five years and that their handling of the underwriting was disastrous.  It would appear to me that in London they were taking on risk, in re-insurance, of the worst possible type, business that nobody would touch.  When in the insurance business one must decide what is good and what is bad risk.  I believe that the management of ICI in their headquarters here and in London must be subjected to serious examination and scrutiny.  Indeed it is too late to examine them now.  Experience in underwriting in business means that one must know how to lay off one's risk and one should not be holding on to dead ducks.  It appears to me that they were engaging in re-insurance of the worst possible type.</P>
    <P>In May last I posed a question in the course of a speech as to what was the position with regard to insurance companies operating here, how they were operating.  I was assured that all was in order since the crisis in the PMPA.  Just over a month ago my colleague, Deputy Flynn, on questions we put down in regard to employers and public liability, asked the Minister what was the position of insurers here, and we were told that everything was satisfactory.  It would appear it was not.  Grave questions fall to be answered by the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. Without casting any slight on any official in any Department &mdash; something I would not dream of doing &mdash; it would appear they did not have the competence <Col N="838" /> to deal with a situation such as that.  To understand the operations one needs to have been working in the business over a long number of years.  Theory is not always healthy.  There are theoretical financial people also who must be subject to questioning.  I prefer to rely on the practical people, those who have been involved, those who have been writing the business, with first-hand knowledge and experience.  I have come to the conclusion that the officials in the Department here and those across the water must be subjected to scrutiny.  Questions must be asked of their control.  For example, did they know what was going on, did they realise the danger or see the signals?  It would appear to me that our Department started to move only with some haste in November last when a certain business magazine and others around this city and elsewhere contended that the ICI was a can of worms.  By heavens, did it not turn out to be some can of worms?</P>
    <P>It seems that after that there were some investigations conducted and that the board of AIB decided to engage new auditors.  Apparently, it was only when these new auditors had carried out investigations both here and in London that the pot began to stir.</P>
    <P>Now there is a backlog of claims.  There are two or three ways in which claims can be settled.  There is the delaying tactic, which is costly, or the tactic of prolonging a case from one court hearing to another in order to put off the evil day and with the intention of maintaining cash flow. That could be a very costly procedure because, for instance, in the case of a not very serious car crash in respect of which a claim was of the order of £1,000 or £2,000, an insurance company, realising their client was at fault, would not see any point in prolonging the issue but would pay out quickly.  This is because the involvement of legal people could result in their costs being much greater than the cost of the claim.  There could have been a pile up in that respect also in regard to the ICI.</P>
    <P>We should like to know how they were dealing with their claims.  I suspect that <Col N="839" /> their claims department is open to much questioning, both in respect of processing claims here and in London.  If what was happening was that claims were being allowed drag on for two or three years, thereby resulting in higher claims ultimately and greater interest being paid, it could have been the cause of a serious situation for the company.  This is where judgment enters into such matters.  It is where one knows what to do, where one makes up his mind quickly in order to avoid a nasty situation.</P>
    <P>The company are now being brought within the ambit of a State organisation but we do not know what the extent of the claims is.  Both the Bill and the Minister's statement are vague because we are not told the kind of claims that must be dealt with in this case.  What claims are in the pipeline, for instance?  People with experience in the insurance business, and there have been such people working in the company for the past three months, must know now what the claim situation is.  What will be the total cost to the Exchequer?</P>
    <P>If, say, the claims amount to a maximum of £120 million, the financial institutions would be well able to cope and there would be no need for the Government to intervene as they have intervened.  The AIB, with the back up of the Central Bank and the other financial institutions, would have been able to cope with the matter.  We are told that the claims amount to £65 million but that the maximum involved will be £120 million, though there is no guarantee of that.  It would be interesting to hear how the initial costs in respect of the claims are being tabulated.  Is this procedure on the basis of the lowest level of claims or on the basis that some claims may not be proceeded with?  One would need to know, too, whether there are claims that have been in the pipeline by way of a stalling operation for the past four or five years &mdash; sleepers, in other words &mdash; or fellows in holes waiting to show their heads.  Their heads will appear now when they know the State is involved.  When the announcement was made in 1983 that <Col N="840" /> AIB were to bid for the takeover of ICI, the financial commentators said that the banks were on to something good.  However, the ICI went on a merry-go-round, especially in London, in regard to underwriting. They took the worst kind of risks because their attitude must have been that, since they had been taken over by AIB, everything would be all right, that they now had a situation similar to a well that would never run dry.</P>
    <P>The AIB cannot merely pass this whole episode to the taxpayers.  The AIB, on acquiring the ICI, had a responsibility to carry out an immediate investigation of the company's affairs, but instead they took a lot for granted.  Perhaps they took the diplomatic way out, but then the mud appeared on the wheel.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to engage in the realm of rumour, but there are rumours.  It seems that in the past 18 months in the re-insurance market in London, ICI were taking very great risks.  For the past few months it has been known that nobody would touch ICI, that their name was mud, but nothing was done to deal with the problems.  Neither can the British Board of Trade wash their hands of this matter, though I suppose their attitude was that since the company were based in Ireland the problems would be dealt with here.  I am sure that when they knew one of our biggest financial institutions was involved their attitude was that that financial institution would meet all the costs.  This is where we return to the question of experience, and in this context I am issuing a warning to the Minister and to everyone involved in monitoring the insurance business that this is a very complex and difficult area.  Anyone engaged in this business would need to know the market extremely well.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Department monitored the returns.  I think it is on a yearly basis, but I am open to correction on that.  They should be monitored on a quarterly basis.  I cast no reflection on any of the officials in the Department, but the people who examine claims must be experienced in that field and know <Col N="841" /> what is going on.  In the accounts of the ICI there was grave under-provision and there was juggling of figures.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this Bill was brought in.  The legislation we passed last year should have been good enough to cover this case.  I have views about banks getting involved in insurance companies and in building societies.  Banking operations are for banks and insurance is for people who have a good knowledge of that business.  I do not think other institutions should get involved in such transactions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will explain to us why he told us in the House a month ago that everything was all right. We were glad to hear that because people outside were saying that things were not good.  The Minister told us of the amounts that may be owed.  We know that in respect of claims the sum involved may be £65 million to a maximum of £120 million. I have some reservations in regard to the figures, but on this side of the House we are not going to dispute what the Minister said and we accept in good faith what he told us.  We were very responsible in regard to the legislation involving the PMPA.  That measure got through the House in a few hours.  We did not like it, as we did not like some other Bills brought in recently, but so be it.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations in regard to the amount put down in respect of claims. The Minister must have some preliminary figures on the claims ratio and how they are calculated.  I should like very much to know how the claims have been calculated.  Even accepting that the amount is at the upper end, namely, £120 million, I consider the Government rushed into this matter with great haste. The total assets of the AIB are £8 billion and we are glad to know that.  They have already written off approximately £84 million.  They have the very profitable life insurance Grobond scheme and if that were disposed of on the public market it should realise between £40 million and £50 million.  If the claims will be only £65 million I do not understand why it was necessary to have created this present <Col N="842" /> unstable situation.  The life insurance business of the ICI could have been disposed of for £40 million and I am going on the lower calculation.  This would mean there would be a gap of only £25 million and I have no doubt our banking institutions could have coped with that with no need for this emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>The delay in bringing in this simple Bill contributed to the unstable market situation.  This Bill is just setting up a company and I want to know why it took ten days to introduce it.  I was a junior Minister in our Government and I have some knowledge of the drafting of Bills. In my opinion this Bill could have been drafted in half a day but I will be kind to the parliamentary draftsman and give him one day or even two days to do it.  I cannot understand the delay that occurred in bringing the Bill before this House.</P>
    <P>People have been talking about politicians and Governments and the way they have run the affairs of the country.  The taxpayers have nailed all politicians to the cross.  The public are watching this matter very closely and they are saying they will not carry the burden for others. There has been very bad management involved in this case and this did not happen overnight.  It was there before the AIB took control of the company in September 1983.  It was suspect in London then and it proved ultimately that it could not run an insurance business in the proper way.  The people here have been burdened with this problem.  However, I want to make it quite clear that Fianna Fáil are not prepared to allow the taxpayers to carry the burden for others who made grave mistakes.</P>
    <P>We should examine the knowledge of directors of insurance companies.  Some directors know nothing of the insurance business.  They get glossy reports and everything in the garden is rosy.  It is only when something happens that they realise they are not covered and they blame accountants and everyone except themselves. The directors are responsible and should know their business.  If I were on an insurance board I would ask questions and would want to know about the re-insurers and the type of liability involved <Col N="843" /> and so on.  The insurance business presents a very hazardous risk and an insurance company should underwrite business in a number of ways so as not to carry the whole risk in order to avoid grave financial losses.</P>
    <P>In relation to the guarantees it seems that in underwriting business in London the Insurance Corporation of Ireland would not underwrite business unless it was guaranteed to the tune of £20 million by Allied Irish Banks.  Allied Irish Banks must have smelled a rat and if they did not they were asleep.  They should have known something was wrong when the company were looking for such guarantees from the bank.  I would be all for getting insurance experts into the Department of Industry and Trade to monitor transactions and to ensure that there is enough reserve capital to meet an emergency.  The ICI reserves were too low to meet an unforeseen liability.  At the end of last week Allied Irish Banks had to put in another £27 million.  That liability did not occur overnight.  They must have known that for some time in advance.  This crisis was built up.  Was it due to the slow processing of claims or was it a stalling operation putting off the evil day?</P>
    <P>This Bill sets up a company.  Allied Irish Banks gave £50 million towards this initially and are to give another £20 million on preferential terms.  However, the economic outlook is so bleak that business people are slow to invest and expand.  Demand on money for expansion is slow so Allied Irish Banks had the money to lend, as they had substantial reserve assets.  Even if it is called a soft loan, they will get interest on it.  In relation to the dividends that the bank will pay its shareholders, if the bank did not pay that dividend the bank would have the right to dispose of its shares.  It would be in the bank's interest to make sure that it was in a sound position.  If the liabilities are as the Minister said the AIB were well able to deal with them and they could also call on the Central Bank to help out in this respect, so there was no need for this crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> We would have handled this crisis in a different way.  We would have called in the Central Bank to deal with the situation. The Minister could not give us the overall costings and he could not say who will carry the financial losses.  The insurance compensation fund is not capable of dealing with this crisis.  If the officials and auditors of the banks informed the Minister about the total liabilities there should not have been need for panic on the eve of St. Patrick's Day and to release this information when everybody was away on the holiday weekend.  That was an undesirable action.  If the maximum deficit on claims outstanding amounts to £120 million &mdash; the minimum is £65 million &mdash; the public will be asking questions. When PMPA accounts were produced at the end of the year the liquidator told us that the total claims outstanding was between £230 million and £235 million although we had been told that the figure would be about £80 million or £100 million gross.  The actual amount was 100 per cent more than the estimated figure. We are all aware that it will take up to ten years to get that company on a sound financial footing.  There will have to be prudent management and everything will have to be scrutinised.</P>
    <P>People outside have been asking me why it is with Allied Irish Banks making a gross profit of £81 million they were not in a position to deal with the problem of ICI whose maximum liability was £120 million.  People are afraid that the figure will be greatly in excess of the estimate but I hope not.  I have grave reservations about what the total liability will be.  My view is that it is not possible to ascertain what the true position is.  When the accounts are published early in May we will have some idea of the total liability but the true position will not emerge until about 18 months time.  All the claims that are in the pipeline or are about to be lodged will show their ugly heads in the meantime.  In 18 months time we will have a better idea of the legal costs and damages sustained.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware the ICI London office was engaged in some of the most precarious types of insurance business. <Col N="845" /> They were in the satellite and marine business and were engaged in other hazardous operations such as bloodstock. They were also involved in Australia.  As far as I can see in the last two years they were on the merry-go-round.  That was dangerous and it is now obvious that it was very costly.</P>
    <P>In the last ten days the Leader of our Party, and our spokesman, Deputy Flynn, acted very responsibly in their comments on this matter.  I am glad that our party kept the line on this and did not do anything that would damage the reputation of our financial institutions. We must bear in mind that the financial institutions carry investments from the general public.  We could have taken short-term political advantage of the position but in the long run it would not have been the correct thing to do in the nation's interest.  It is not the first time we have demonstrated that we have the interests of the nation at heart.  We had those interests at heart when the Bill dealing with the PMPA collapse was introduced.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to forecast what the outcome will be.  If the claims are in excess of the estimated figure the Government should arrange a package with the banks and other financial institutions to deal with the problem.  The taxpayers should not be called upon to pay.  They are not prepared to pay for something that resulted from bad management.  Politicians were criticised at the weekend and some people claimed they were responsible for this collapse.  Many uncharitable things were said about Members and about how we run our affairs.  It is easy to say that the ICI debt should be passed on to the State but I do not agree.</P>
    <P>I hope the figure for claims will not be in excess of £65 million.  If it transpires that it amounts to £120 million the Minister should adopt my suggestion.  Above all he should ensure that the hard pressed motorists are not asked to bear the burden.  We are all aware that employers pay in the region of £800 per employee in insurance cover.  A shake-up is very badly needed in the supervisory system regarding the insurance business which <Col N="846" /> must be monitored very closely.  At present, yearly returns only are monitored and I ask the Minister to ensure that there is monitoring on a quarterly basis so that it is known what is happening from day to day.  There are people available who have good practical experience in underwriting and the Minister could avail of their talents.  I worked with many of them and they ran their company affairs very well.  If we had had an accurate monitoring system, this problem would not have raised its ugly head.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking in very technical detail on this matter because I understand the problems involved.  However, I emphasise that the supervisory system needs radical overhaul and the best people must be brought in.  There should be a quarterly report on every insurance company which would make their position clear.  When heavy risks are involved such as in building and engineering, they can be underwritten with a number of companies to relieve the burden.  There is a question mark over how companies were unloading bad risks and if they are not good at that they will go under.  This is what happened to ICI because of their business operations outside the country. The attitude was that the well would never go dry as far as money was concerned.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents have been in touch with me regarding the possibility of taxation to pay for this.  The Government should initiate a rescue package instead of loading it on to the taxpayer.  Many people are paying £900 per annum to insure their cars to enable them to get to work.  They will resent further taxation and should not be asked to pay more.  If the amount owed is between £65 million and £125 million the financial institutions should be able to work out a suitable package, with the guidance of the Government, to get out of this difficulty brought about by bad management in the ICI over a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I never fail to be intrigued by some of the sentiments I hear occasionally from the opposite side of the House.  Deputy Connolly rightly <Col N="847" /> referred to the resistance of the taxpayer to picking up any tabs for this major, disastrous mistake on somebody's part.</P>
      <P>When I heard him speaking about workers and their justified suspicion, mistrust and contempt for politicians, I remembered an adage which says &ldquo;by their deeds shall you know them&rdquo;.  I respectfully invite Deputy Connolly to examine the record of his party in the EC Parliament when my party sought and supported the introduction of legislation under the Vredeling EC Fourth Directive which would have made the type of information governing the situation in which we find ourselves known to the workers in the company.  It was opposed by the European representatives of Deputy Connolly's party.  He cannot have it both ways.  Ní thig leis an ngobadán an dá thrá a fhreastal.  The Labour Party in Europe were the only party which supported the introduction of that legislation.  There is a massive stalling attempt by the employers' organisations here to stave off the introduction of that legislation.  I am asking the Minister to let us know when it will become law because, if it were, we might not be in our present position.</P>
      <P>There are some basic facts which have to be restated.  We must have stable financial institutions which enjoy the respect and confidence of business and commerce. I do not say that because of undue affection for the financial institutions; my main concern is for the protection of the workers in the factories downstream.  If anything happened to AIB or a similar financial institution in the morning, the shock waves throughout factories, small industries and small investors would have the proportions of a political and economic earthquake.  As a trade union official, I make the point very consciously that the financial institutions must have full stability to protect the employment of our workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that most of the insurance cover for local authority employees and health boards is carried by ICI.  I am very concerned about what is happening at present because as a trade union official, it has always been my experience that <Col N="848" /> nobody ever speaks about a workers' coop until a company is in bits.  Then the workers are expected to pool their money and rescue the co-operative where the management failed.  May I suggest that we are in a similar position here.  ICI apparently went mad.  When we look at some of the cover they provided we ask ourselves how they could have got into this situation.  For example, they provided insurance cover for bloodstock and shuttle satellites.  What has the ordinary punter got to do with shuttle satellites? ICI got involved in areas which only a lunatic would get involved in.  As chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies it is becoming more apparent to me, in view of the Irish Shipping debacle and now ICI, that we are not very good when it comes to away matches.  We can manage our affairs at home but obviously we get into very deep waters abroad.  It is obvious that no competent person in the insurance business would have become involved in some of the areas ICI got involved in.</P>
    <P>That company was incorporated on 25 February 1935.  Its net profits from the nine years from 1975 to 1983 were £24.5 million and it is now estimated that the losses in 1984 alone were £65 million. AIB acquired the company in September 1983 and in January 1984 ICI paid Irish Shipping Limited £9.5 million for their ICI shares, equivalent to 3.66p per share. It is interesting to reflect on who were the directors in Irish Shipping Limited and in ICI.  That warrants investigation.</P>
    <P>This House and the Government find themselves in a very difficult situation. We are trying to help solve a problem but basically we do not know what the problem is or the extent of that problem. We are told by competent people, some of them international commentators, that the amount of liability may be as high as £500 million.  I do not know if that is true, but if the Irish taxpayers is expected to pay for that, everyone in this House knows that the Irish workers &mdash; I am talking about the PAYE and PRSI workers &mdash; will carry this extra and unfair load.  There would be grave repercussions for the financial institutions if anything <Col N="849" /> happened but, to use a homespun analogy, it is like a small farmer whose tractor has only one gear and that is in reverse, and the tractor is stuck against the gable end of the house.  His options are to knock down the house or to abandon the tractor.  We would not wish our financial institutions to be weakened but it has been rightly said that if you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem. We are in a Gilbertian situation. AIB acted quickly once the facts emerged but that is like saying we were trying to get the horse fit when the race has ended.</P>
    <P>When I studied economics we were told that all a bank needed to run its day-to-day affairs was, in old money, 1/11d out of every pound and they could invest the remaining amount, almost 18 shillings or 90p in the pound.  Some people think the Government are a nebulous, amorphous body who pay the money but they have to reach into the pockets of every Irish worker for this money.  I ask the Government to consider what will be the likely performance of this new company, Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta, over the next five years and what the costs to the Exchequer are likely to be?</P>
    <P>In his 1984 budget speech the Minister for Finance outlined the approach to all public investment and laid down the criteria to be applied.  He said that under this approach all public investment must be justified by economic and/or financial appraisals.  In general such appraisals should contain the following elements: a clearly defined set of objectives for the project; a statement of alternatives that would meet the objectives; a statement of the constraints, viz. technological, physical, financial and statutory, that impinge on the project together with a listing of those alternatives which do not fall within the constraints.  In respect of each chosen alternative there should be a list of the benefits and costs expected over the economic life of the projects and underlying assumptions; a quantification of the benefits and costs in cash flows or economic flows as appropriate; a statement of projected cash flows or a cost benefit balance sheet, as appropriate; a calculation of the decision criteria, new <Col N="850" /> present value, cost benefit ratio, internal rate of return, maximum effectiveness at least cost; a test for sensitivity to changes in key variables, identification and, whenever possible, quantification of the distributional effects of the costs and the benefits; an assessment of the payback period where appropriate, and a recommendation as to the preferred alternative. These criteria were set out in the Minister's budget speech.</P>
    <P>AIB may have been attracted by ICI's profit record but, as I said in my contribution on the Irish Shipping debacle, profits in themselves can be meaningless unless the quality of those profits is adequately analysed.  It is no good saying you have empty buildings or you are getting money for assets when you should be generating a profit out of day-to-day revenue.  That shows that a company is healthy.  I admire Allied Irish Banks for their professionalism and expertise but anybody can make a mistake.  It is difficult to understand why they did not have adequate time to carry out a detailed investigation of ICI. They purchased ICI without this detailed investigation presumably because there was a threat of a potential counterbid. Surely it was a basic requirement before purchasing an insurance company of this magnitude to have a report by an actuary on the risk element of the policies of this company.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to expect the taxpayers and the small family businesses to carry these losses, or a proportion of them, by way of an increased tax or premium.  This is not on when, at the same time, AIB propose to pay £40 million in dividends to their shareholders.  I agree that the small investor, the widow or widower who has invested their savings with the AIB, should not be punished, nor should pension fund investors.  I propose that there be a ceiling, with the exception of pension funds, on the payout of dividends and that the balance of the dividend payment fund be allocated towards the losses as a temporary measure.  This would not unduly affect confidence in the bank, <Col N="851" /> because basically it would be an allocation of their profits and would be perceived as a short term measure.  It would not unduly affect substantial investment by shareholders in the long term.</P>
    <P>The acquisition cost of ICI by Allied Irish Banks was £86 million.  Once the problems were disclosed in ICI one would have expected that the options open were, first, to close the company.  Due consideration would have to be given to 25 per cent employers liability and the international repercussions in financial circles.  Secondly, AIB could retain the company and through rationalisation and so on return it to profitability with Government support.  Thirdly, the Government could take over all or part of the ICI operation.  There is a sedulously fostered campaign by vested interests who wish to see jury settlements eliminated for occupational injuries and car accidents.  I am totally opposed to such a proposal.  There is a great deal of exaggeration about the impact of jury settlements in these cases.  My information, from the professionals involved in these settlements, is that only about 1 per cent of all settlements are arrived at by juries.  We must not forget that the Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of settlements for compensation for occupational injuries or whatever.  They are a responsible body.</P>
    <P>Other countries, notably New Zealand, tried a system of direct payment for occupational injuries.  If someone suffered a serious accident during the course of their work the company would pay their wages and any attendant compensation for loss of work, payment of lawyers, medical expenses and so on.  Companies in New Zealand had to abandon that because it was too costly.</P>
    <P>What is happening at present raises a big question mark over other institutions. How many more ICIs, Irish Shipping Companies and PMPAs are there that we do not as yet know about?  It can be said in favour of AIB that if they had not bought ICI &mdash; I understand it cost them £90 million &mdash; and ICI then collapsed, the State would have been expected to <Col N="852" /> pick up the tab plus the £90 million paid out by AIB.  However, without being too cynical, it is very difficult to accept that line of argument.  I would not mind being in a poker game if I knew the AIB were behind me.  Dr. Johnson, the English writer and philosopher, said it was remarkable how a man's attention could be concentrated by the realisation that he was facing execution at 8 a.m.  That might have been the way if ICI had been expected to behave in a more circumspect fashion.</P>
    <P>My party is saying, and have repeatedly said, that there is a grave and urgent need for revised legislation which will protect the taxpayer from the black-guardism &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; that is going on in some of the bigger commercial institutions.  We have seen that happen with regard to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann and Irish Shipping.  They became involved in ventures, unknown to the Minister of the day, which cost the State millions of pounds.  There was a haemorrhage of money without so much as by your leave.  They apparently have a <i>carte blanche.</i> Nobody seems to have any sense of accountability.  There is no regard for the law or the institutions of the law.  To go back to Mahaffy's definition of this country, it must be the biggest lunatic asylum in the world.  People would not be allowed in any other country to get away with what they are doing here.</P>
    <P>Look at some of the people involved and their actions.  By any reasonable, fair, objective standards they should be expected to pay for the cost of their misdeeds. I accept that people will make mistakes.  Everyone does that.  That is what the rubbers are on the ends of pencils for.  What do we do?  I am aware of the constraints of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and the fact that the maximum compensation outlined in that Act is two years' salary for a person who has been unfairly dismissed.  Here, however, the more damage one can do the more compensation one is likely to get.  While the worker is expected to pick up the tab, the AIB will pay out £40 million in dividends. I say to some of the Deputies in this <Col N="853" /> House who were reared far away from the squelch of water in their broken wellington boots that we have people coming into our offices who are expected to live on £32 unemployment assistance per week or we have unmarried mothers.  Yet workers are expected to carry the can for this kind of nonsense.  No other country in the world would put up with that.</P>
    <P>Companies and their directors are able to flout the law at will because they can get away with it.  They are driving around in big cars and living in big houses, having robbed public funds &mdash; not in this case but in other cases.  When they were reported to the police nothing could be done.  They are living like mafia kings and nothing is done.  Yet the Irish worker is expected to pick up the tab.  That is why my party &mdash; no latter day converts to the concept, because we have been promoting this for longer than anyone else and represent the people who are expected to pick up the tab &mdash; proposed at our latest annual conference that immediate action should be taken by the Government to introduce national third party insurance for motorists with a view to relieving the astronomical cost for those on low incomes, especially those who need cars to commute to work.  Cars are no longer a luxury.  The cost of petrol and of a car filters into every aspect of our lives.  The high cost could be reduced by nationalising the major insurance companies to make possible the establishment of a State-owned insurance company.  To relieve the heavy burden of compensation on the insurer, the present procedures should be replaced by an index-linked instalment system of compensating payments with a guarantee of medical care.</P>
    <P>The similarities between the economic negligence of Irish Shipping and ICI are all too obvious.  The PMPA collapsed under similar mismanagement and presumably they could have been lurching on today.  They protested that there was nothing wrong until the Government had to step in and save them.  ICI were prepared to take risks which were recognised as madness in the extreme by responsible <Col N="854" /> people.  We are all expected to pick up the tab.  The Government must not be asked to bail ICI out of their financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>I spoke to members of the Association of Certified and Chartered Accountants in Limerick last Saturday night and they made the same point.  I am not an expert in this field.  I am a very uneducated layman but it seeks to me to be Gilbertian to say that a company who got into difficulties &mdash; we have every sympathy with the company; that has to be said; there is nothing wrong in saying that &mdash; now propose to loan the State £50 million to bail them out of trouble.  That is crazy.  I am aware of the strictures of Telesis which would frown on a hand holding operation.  My own committee on semi-State bodies are against these letters of comfort being sent to companies unless they are very strictly monitored in the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Government should say to the AIB: &ldquo;Have no fear.  There is no question about your stability.  We are behind you. We will cover you fully, but you will pay your own way out of this difficulty.&rdquo;  If the Allied Irish Banks or ICI made £100 million or £1,000 million, apart from the minimum statutory return to the central Exchequer, it would not work its way down to the punter or the ordinary factory worker I am talking about.  The person who pays the piper is entitled to call the tune.  We should tell the company that we are prepared to help them out by way of support but the taxpayer will not be expected to pick up the tab.</P>
    <P>AIB should be prepared to give share capital or the equivalent value in shares to the State if they are putting in money, so that we will know what is going on. This would be part of the road to nationalisation. It would mean they would be creating approximately 20 per cent more shares.  It would lessen the income per shareholder, but the State would collect about £4 million per annum on its shareholding. When I mention the State I am talking about the taxpayer.  As part shareholder in AIB, the State would be in a stronger position to know the financial <Col N="855" /> risks involved and the group would have greater accountability.</P>
    <P>In 1983, AIB took a stronger holding in ICI because they were interested in its most valuable asset, the whole question of life assurance.  Now that end of the business has been hived off, which seems to indicate that ICI may be in more serious financial difficulties than any of us knows about on 27 March 1985.  Some members of the Stock Exchange have made a responsible guess that the final bill will amount to £200 million.  If newspaper reports are accurate the figure could rise to £500 million.</P>
    <P>Already 200 of the 800 workers in ICI are to lose their jobs.  I come back to my starting point.  If the workers in the company had known what the position was and been given the information to which they are entitled this would not have happened.  We see it every day in the Burlingtons and the Ataris.  People invest their working lives in these companies, and investors who do not even know where Ireland is can make a decision and throw hundreds if not thousands of Irish workers out of work.  My shirt almost becomes wet with crocodile tears when I hear some speakers on the other side of the house bleeding for Irish workers. When they had an opportunity in Europe to support legislation which would make companies give the workers real information about the state of the companies, they voted against it.  They objected to it.  They cannot have it both ways.  We have some of the best multinationals in the world operating here. The suggestion is that if there was more information there would be a breach of confidentiality.  Why are Irish workers more suspect in that context than all the other workers throughout Europe?  Confidentiality has been maintained in all cases where there are worker directors.</P>
    <P>There is no point in trying to deal with the surface of the problem.  We must correct the root cause of the problem.  I go into a firm and serve a claim on behalf of a group of workers and the management tell us we are irresponsible, or illogical, or mad and that the company cannot <Col N="856" /> afford to meet the cost.  We ask to see the balance sheet and say if the balance sheet shows the company cannot afford our claim we will accept that.  They draw back and say they cannot show us their balance sheet.  That will go on and on unless something is done about it.  It is only in this House that we can take the necessary steps to prevent a repetition of this and to protect the workers of the company, not the multi-millionaires.  We have Irish multi-millionaires as well as multi-nationals who can get off scot free.</P>

      <P>Deputy Prendergast said some very fine things with which I wholeheartedly agree and he made some very good points and good criticisms of the system which exists and what needs to be done about it.  Obviously Deputy Prendergast is supporting the wrong party.  He will not get any of these things from the Fine Gael Party or the Government he is supporting at the moment.</P>
      <P>He talked about the need to get further information from companies.  As yet we have not got the Company Law Reform Bill.  Will there be anything in that Bill, when it does come before the House, about companies being required to give information of that nature?  As he said, it is here these things can be changed.  I hope Deputy Prendergast will live up to the points he made and try to extract these things from the Government which he is supporting.  That is what it is all about.  There is no point in complaining about what some people did in Europe, although I quite agree with the point he made.  He will be judged on what he does here.  We must all do our best to live up to what we say and try to get it done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating the Second Stage of this extraordinary Bill which is before us now.  The Bill was promised last Thursday. Coming near Thursday, we were informed that it would not be ready until the following Tuesday.  I objected to the further week's delay and was told that it was quite a technical and complex Bill. We assumed that there were going to be <Col N="857" /> some major issues in this Bill that would change something in relation to the financial institutions, banks, insurance companies or other bodies.  Yesterday morning there was still no Bill circulated in this House and when we inquired we were told we would have it in the afternoon. At 3.30 p.m. we were told by the Taoiseach that we would have it in the late afternoon.  The late afternoon means certainly not later than 6 o'clock.  At the time the Taoiseach was saying that in this House the word from the office of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism was that it would not be available until after tea.  As it transpired, it was not available until after 8.30 p.m. and the Taoiseach misled us in the House. Half-eight or a quarter to nine is not the late afternoon.</P>
    <P>What was wrong?  Something strange was going on.  The Bill before us now is certainly not what was being talked about on Thursday of last week.  This Bill could be put together in a couple of hours.  Most of the sections are already available in hundreds of Bills.  Memorandum and articles of association, obligation to furnish balance sheets, directors of companies, obligations of shareholders, payment of dividends, restrictions on issue of shares, they would be in any Bill in regard to the establishment of a company.  There are only one or two sections that would have caused any discussion or problem, but there was some problem.  If you look carefully at the Minister's speech, of which there were only a few copies available when he spoke here, what was being done was the chopping out of pieces &mdash; as you will see from the different typing in some pages.  Hunks were cut out of what he had already prepared and separate little bits put in here and there &mdash; one on page 3, another in the middle and then a separate ending.  Some changes were made at a Cabinet meeting on Monday, most likely.  We do not know as yet whether this was as a result of inability to make major decisions, Cabinet differences and so on.  Definitely, some extraordinary changes were going on over the past couple of days.</P>
    <P>When this crisis first broke just 11 days <Col N="858" /> ago my immediate reaction was the same as it is now.  I was amazed at the suggestion that the Government would use the taxpayers' money to bail out Allied Irish Banks, the flagship of Irish business and finance, our largest company in market capitalisation and certainly our largest bank.  They had run on the rocks and the Minister was preparing to bail them out with the taxpayers' money.  I also made the point that this exploded the myth of the efficient private sector and the inefficient public sector, about which we heard much, at the time of Irish Shipping's collapse, when not one penny of taxpayers' money was put in although the Minister was directly responsible for Irish Shipping.  He is not responsible to either ICI or Allied Irish Banks, but is prepared to put in an unknown sum &mdash; to write a blank cheque for anything from £50 million to, as the man in London estimated, as high as £500 million sterling. We do not know the amount, but the Minister is prepared to bail the company out.</P>
    <P>Everybody was being very responsible in the beginning, for a week.  I find when people are being responsible it means that they are standing by the big boys in some place or other.  They are standing by the banks, the bosses, the landlords. It is irresponsible to stand by people who are being oppressed by these, to stand by workers or anybody who is being used or abused by the operations of these people. I was very glad to see during the course of the week that public reaction was the very same as mine.  Nobody felt that their money should be used to bail out Allied Irish Banks and their operations in ICI. The key issue as far as the majority of people were concerned is that if the Allied Irish Banks' whole operation was a huge success, if the gamble worked with ICI and large profits were made, the taxpayer would never see a penny of it or benefit in any way whatsoever.  When the gamble fails are they supposed to take the loss and bail them out of the financial mess into which they have got themselves? That was the immediate gut feeling of everybody who heard and saw what was going on.  It is the feeling of the <Col N="859" /> majority of the people in this House, on the Government side and on the Opposition side, that they do not want to get involved in this bailing out process.</P>
    <P>The negligence of AIB has been dealt with fairly clearly by everybody who has spoken so far, on both sides of the House. Nobody could justify what they did. Various quotations have been given indicating the problems which existed.  At the time when AIB took over ICI, in their own circular to their shareholders, their balance sheet showed the problem sticking out.  There was a profit all right, but that was as a result of £15 million on investments, whereas there was an actual loss.  At the time when they were taking ICI over, there was an actual loss of £8 million on their insurance business.  If they could not see that they were in trouble with such a loss on the insurance end of their business and a profit on their investment end, one must think that they had some other reason for moving into ICI and bailing out or helping out somebody. There must be something much more behind this than is evident on the surface.  It is nonsense for AIB on television and radio, as in the past week, to say that this was only discovered on 4 March 1985.  Nobody could believe that. Anyone in insurance circles in the London area, or even here, could have told them 18 months or two years ago of the problems and in their own figures circulated to their shareholders it was quite plain that they were in trouble at that time in the insurance end of their business and were not making a profit there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast is right that the whole business comes down to a need for change in company law and for company law reform.  The 1963 Act was based on the UK Act of 1948.  At the time of the 1963 Act that UK Act was hopelessly out of date.  There have been widespread calls for company law reform for a number of years but particularly in the past two years with all the closures, bankruptcies, liquidations, receiverships, the appointment of administrators all of which has become a booming business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> It is a separate area somebody should investigate.  There are all sorts of rumours circulating about the administrator of the PMPA and his costs.  The figures vary nearly as much as the losses about which we are talking in regard to ICI, figures varying from £1 million to £5 million and £6 million as the amount of money the administrator of the PMPA is getting. There are also stories to the effect that he made the situation look worse when he went in, is improving it, having it look better when he pulls out, so that he will have been seen to have done a good job.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for Finance on radio on Saturday last what power he had over the administrator of ICI and could he prevent the administrator from selling off the life section of ICI.  He said he could not, that the administrator had been appointed by the High Court. Therefore the administrator could do practically what he liked.  The administrator had already sold off Credit Finance Bank, a profitable company, and sold it back to AIB.  What a joke.  Now it appears the administrator could have sold off the life section, also a profitable area. What control has one over an administrator? Can they do what they like?  Must they act under the Minister's direction or sanction?  Apparently, no, according to the Minister for Finance; that was not so; he could not have stopped him.  Therefore that is a whole area warranting examination also.</P>
    <P>The AIB said that ICI was not properly supervised.  In this regard the Minister has also been blamed for not having the supervisory division of his Department examine the situation both in AIB and ICI.  In turn, the Minister blames the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain.  The British Department of Trade have no responsibility in this regard.  As I understand it, EC legislation of 1978 makes it clear that the overall responsibility for the operation of a company lies with the member state where the insurer has its head office &mdash; in this case, the Republic of Ireland.  There is no point in the Minister saying that he checked with the Department of Trade in Britain and that they said everything <Col N="861" /> was all right.  They have no responsibility for examining the operations of the branch of the company in London, the head office in Ireland, that is the responsibility of the Government here and there is no point in trying to shift that responsibility. Then AIB endeavour to shift the responsibility on to their auditors, Messrs Ernst and Whinney, and are saying they are taking a court action against them though they have not done so yet.  How often have auditors been sued successfully? Has it ever occurred that an auditor has been sued successfully?  Certainly it does not happen very often because, generally speaking, the auditors play the tune for which the piper calls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning referred briefly to the question of the auditing and accounting end, though he did not go into it in detail. It is becoming clearer to people day by day that auditing and accounting is not a science but a black art.  It is an area warranting public inquiry and investigation in regard to a whole series of companies, including the AIB, ICI, Irish Shipping Limited, PMPA, the whole lot. They can all produce their audited accounts, their balance sheets and so on to order.  But a serious investigation must be carried out into the whole area of auditing and accountancy in relation to company law reform.  We are told it is a new law which is highly complex.  It is 18 months since Deputy Cluskey said he had a Bill just ready.  Now apparently it has been added to.  It will be changed again as a result of this occurrence.  It is not ready yet; it will be ready soon; it will not be ready this year &mdash; and probably not next year before this Government goes out of office.  But it is an absolute essential.</P>
    <P>The role of the Central Bank warrants examination also.  The Central Bank is supposed to be a regulatory authority for the commercial banks.  The failure of the Central Bank to detect any difficulties that AIB were getting into with ICI, whether they should have been allowed to get into ICI at all or not, is evident.  In doing so they failed to act as a watchdog for the public.  I suppose that is not surprising considering that on the board of <Col N="862" /> the Central Bank there are directors from the commercial banks.  The Central Bank is supposed to be the watchdog of the commercial banks.  But on the board of the Central Bank there are directors from Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland and any other bank one cares to mention. Therefore it was not very surprising that the Central Bank agreed with the sale of Credit Finance Bank to AIB &mdash; after all, we are all friends; we are all in the same business, with the same directors on everything.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast was beginning to touch on this generally &mdash; he did not go into names &mdash; but the same directors are serving on everything.  The same people crop up all the time, a small group of people.  In this case it is no harm to name them when we are talking about the directors of ICI.  There is Percy Howard Greer, who was chairman of Irish Shipping Limited for many years and then became chairman of ICI.  Then there was William O'Neill, also chairman of Irish Shipping Limited, after Greer, at the time they collapsed.  He was also a director of ICI.  Greer was also a director of Credit Finance Bank.  Then there was Liam S. Furlong who was a director.  He had been general manager of Irish Shipping Limited and was also a director of Irish Hospitals Trust.  Then there was Jack Hynes as a director of ICI.  He was the man who was involved in NET at the time they got into a lot of trouble with their finances, when the costs of construction of the Marino Point plant escalated to something like £137 million.  Then there was Mr. John Healy Donovan, a director of ICI, also a director of Irish Industrial Gases, of the Royal Trust Bank, of Ryan Hotels, of Banque Nationale de Paris (Ireland) and a director of many other companies.  It is amazing how these people can act as directors of so many companies, that they can handle 12 or 14 different directorships. Of course, there are then the two AIB directors, Michael J. O'Keeffe, also a director of O'Flaherty Holdings, the Rohan Group and BP (Ireland) Limited, and Paddy O'Keeffe.  These two gentlemen had been on the board of ICI since <Col N="863" /> 1981 and could not see any problem. These were no chickens.  They are not any back room boys.  Paddy O'Keeffe was the group chief executive of AIB at the time he was appointed a director of ICI in 1981.  Yet he could not see any problem there.</P>
    <P>These are the people about whom we are speaking.  One must remember that when one talks about banks and insurance companies one is not talking merely about institutions; one is taking about people, all of whom know each other.  If you like, they are all inter-related through their directorships.  They cross over between finance companies and industrial companies.  They all know each other.  They do a turn for each other and take decisions on that basis.  We must ask did AIB's directors take a decision because they were asked &mdash; and this is what they said publicly &mdash; by Irish Shipping Limited: &ldquo;Look, would you come in and take a 25 per cent share of ICI?&rdquo; That means an individual in Irish Shipping Limited asked an individual in AIB and they said: &ldquo;Yes, we will go in.  We will put in 25 per cent for you.&rdquo;  Eventually they found themselves putting more in and taking over ICI, because they knew each other.</P>
    <P>The chairman of AIB, Mr. Niall Crowley, must be mentioned.  He is supposed to be one who knows the financial world, who knows his insurance companies.  He was Chairman of Irish Life for many years.  He is supposed to have a fine accounting brain.  He is supposed to know everything but he walked AIB into this mess.  We must place the responsibility on these various individuals.  I trust that what has happened now will put an end to any talk of privatising Irish Life.  We have been hearing such comment for a number of years.  The Minister for Finance holds 90 per cent of the shareholding in Irish Life but he receives only 2 per cent of the profits or surplus.  Why are Irish Life talking now about the need to privatise the company?  Privatising Irish Life would merely be putting it fully into the hands of the executive who would hold the major share holding and consequently <Col N="864" /> rake off some of the profits.  The company are operating successfully so I trust we will hear no more about privatising them.</P>
    <P>What is happening in the case of ICI is similar to what happened in the PMPA case.  When an insurance company collapse, the Minister concerned has the ultimate responsibility and must move to protect the policy holders and especially the employers' liability policy holders. That being the case, what is the Minister to do about that responsibility now?  The inference from what was said by an insurance expert last evening on television was that another company are in trouble.  This person would not name the company and he was not prepared to discuss the matter after the programme had ended.  If the Minister has ultimate responsibility in respect of insurance companies, has he not the right at least to put someone on the board of these companies and thereby have some input into what is happening in them?  In addition this would provide him with a continual feedback on the activities of the companies.  I am anxious to have the Minister's reaction to this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I had expected the Bill to deal with this new factor whereby an insurance company may act as they wish in the knowledge that in the last resort the Minister will take responsibility for the policy holders. That has been proved in the case of two companies.  What type of legislation will the Minister bring in to cover this factor?  I had expected a Bill that would provide for major changes in our financial structures and institutions but the Minister has failed totally in this respect.</P>
    <P>I can think of at least three options that were open to the Minister.  One was to do as he has done &mdash; to assume responsibility for the huge debts and let AIB off the hook.  Another was to allow the market forces take their course, as is the wish of the private sector.  In other words, allow the company to go to the wall.  That is what happened in the case of Irish Shipping. In that case there was no regard for the workers or their jobs or for the strategic importance to the State of the company.  But the third option was for <Col N="865" /> the Government to bail out the Irish end of the ICI business so long as they could guarantee the employers liability.  It was being said that if the Government did not move fast in this case the State would grind to a halt, that Aer Lingus, for example, would not be able to fly their planes. A lot of that talk was nonsense.  It was an attempt to scare people into doing something they had no wish to do.  However, the Government could guarantee the employers liability in the Irish end of the business but they had no responsibility, either legal or moral, for the London business.  Neither have AIB any legal responsibility for the ICI business though they have a moral responsibility in that regard.  But they were prepared to allow the company go to the wall.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister must bail out the London operations of the company which have nothing to do with helping this economy or Irish workers. The Minister could have confined himself to bailing out the Irish section of the business.  Perhaps he has done so but if he has, there is no evidence of it in the Bill.  In the event of his confining himself to bailing out the Irish section, he should take a stake in the AIB group.  To my surprise, this aspect has been referred to by Deputy Manning.  It would be correct for the Minister to take a stake in AIB in return for bailing them out in respect of something which must be looked after. The Minister should ensure that AIB pay their share by way of giving the Minister a stake in the group.</P>
    <P>Regarding the loans, the Minister referred to AIB making interest free loans available to the Government but unless there is some change I understand that AIB were talking about a low interest loan.  My information is that that low interest loan would be at 9 per cent.  That may be low but it would not be a loss making loan.  On the contrary, with inflation at less than 7 per cent, it is obvious that AIB would make a profit on their loans to the Government, loans in which the Government must engage by reason of bailing out AIB.  In other words, for the mess caused by the group, they will make a profit.  I should like the <Col N="866" /> Minister to clarify the position about the interest charge.  We are not talking about an interest free loan.</P>

      <P>The £50 million will be at a 9 per cent interest rate.  There are 750 jobs involved in this company.  Last Saturday the Minister for Finance assured me that the Government intend preserving ICI as a commercial activity and continuing the company in business.  I would like that to come from the Government or from the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  If the life section and the Guernsey operation are sold off it will look extremely unlikely that it is the intention of the Government to keep ICI in business.  I should like the Minister to guarantee to the House that the Irish section of the business will be maintained and that none of the profitable sections will be sold off.  I understand there are only about 60 or 65 jobs involved in the London operation and perhaps there are others in different parts of the world.  However, the majority are in Ireland and we must have some guarantee from the Minister that these jobs will be protected.</P>
      <P>In regard to the life section, Mr. Aidan Daly specifically said recently that he and the management group are trying to buy out the ICI life section.  He said, &ldquo;I am pleased to say that the administrator has responded favourably to this proposal and negotiations with a large Irish financial institution are in progress.&rdquo;  I hope it is not AIB.  I wonder if that is still the case and if the administrator is still negotiating for the sale of the life section.</P>

    <P>Deputy Prendergast referred to the <Col N="867" /> need for worker participation on the hoard.  It is essential that the Bill should provide for worker participation on the hoard as the best protection against any greedy management executives who may be on the board and who are trying to engage in shady operations.  There is no greater protection in such a case than worker participation on the board.  On a final point, will the Minister say what is the company referred to in the Bill as Gebhard Limited.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Mac Giolla for giving me some time to make my contribution.  The threatened collapse of the ICI on 15 March presented the Government with a choice between some very unpalatable options.  One of the options involved very high risks and conceivably it would have put in motion a chain of events which, if they had gathered momentum, could not be contained. The other real choice involved the Government in a direct and immediate intervention to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.  Both of those options carried risks as well as a price tag.  Therefore, a judgment had to be made as to which was the lesser of two evils, because that is what we are talking about, and which was likely to cause the minimum damage to the overall national interest.</P>
      <P>I should like briefly to examine the first option.  Conceivably the Government could have told AIB to go away and sort out the mess that its subsidiary, ICI, had got into without recourse to any State support.  However, the risks inherent in this otherwise tempting option were simply unacceptable, in my view.  We must bear in mind that AIB had already lost approximately £90 million on the ICI and that that had eroded the equity base of the bank by up to 20 per cent.  The prospect of a further erosion of the same order or more might have undermined not only the stability of the bank but also the financial stability of the State itself.  I do not think that is an exaggeration because</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> AIB have practically one-quarter of the total financial market in the Republic, an enormous proportion for any one individual institution.  If AIB failed or faltered the financial stability of the State would be at risk as would the value of our currency and international confidence in our ability to repay our debts.  There would be a definite threat to overseas investment and industrial investment, at a time when we desperately need both.</P>
    <P>These are but a few of the possible consequences but the greatest risk would be the unpredictable course of events that could neither be anticipated nor easily controlled once they developed their own momentum.  At best such a course would probably lead to a substantial reduction in living standards and services, even higher unemployment and the risk of social disorder.  No responsible Government could contemplate such an outcome and that is why the tempting but high risk option of leaving the bank to its own devices had to be rejected.  It is heartening that that has been broadly accepted throughout the country and certainly in this House.</P>
    <P>That left the only other option which was an immediate and decisive intervention by the Government to secure the stability of the largest financial institution in the land, thus maintaining the financial stability and integrity of the country.  History will record that unquestionably that was the correct decision,</P>
    <P>This debate must focus first and foremost on what is best for the country. People outside this House and Deputies on all sides are angry, shaken, frustrated and dismayed at the events which led the Government taking over the ICI.  Many see it as simply letting the bank off the hook at the expense of the taxpayers. Others find it indefensible that the major financial institution in the country, with all the expertise available to it, should not only have bought a pig in a poke but that it should take so long to discover the fact and that even now the full extent and consequences of that error are not known.  Constructive and in-depth criticism of this disastrous episode is not only desirable but is essential if for no other <Col N="869" /> reason than to ensure that never again do we get into this kind of situation.</P>
    <P>That however is very different from entering upon an orgy of indiscriminate bank bashing.  We have had a good deal of that in recent days.  If this debate is to focus on the national interest we must guard against an erosion of national and international confidence in our financial reputation and against the erosion of confidence in the financial stability of financial institutions, particularly Allied Irish Banks, at this time.  For that reason it is important to set the record straight about the AIB in particular in the face of some very ill-informed comments.</P>
    <P>First, this bank is 99 per cent owned by Irish people.  There are about 26,000 shareholders and most of them are small shareholders with a value on their shareholding in the region of £2,000 or £2,500. They are not big people and they are spread throughout society.  In addition, and equally importantly, 60 per cent of the shares are owned by pension funds made up from the pensions of a large number of people throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  That is the institution about which we are talking, and we should be careful about indiscriminate bashing.  The bank also employs 7,000 to 8,000 people.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of criticism of the unwillingness of banks to provide adequate money for new businesses and of their reluctance to take risks.  Looking at the bad debt charges of a bank like the AIB, it is startling to note that in 1980 the bad debt provision was £7 million.  It increased to £17 million in 1982 and to £31million in 1984.  That suggests that it is a bank not unwilling to take risks.  It may certainly have been involved in some bad business, but it is not fair to say that the banks will not take risks or support small industry.  They cannot support everything; but there is a willingness there to take risks, and the bad debt provision is an indication of that.</P>
    <P>A lot of nonsense is talked about bank profits and dividends.  It is absolutely essential that bank profits be adequate. The Central Bank has said to successive <Col N="870" /> Governments, in their reports over a number of years, that bank profits here are barely adequate to sustain confidence in the banking system.  There is also a lot of misunderstanding about dividends.  I read various reports in the last few days that the bank is proposing to pay out £84 million in dividends.  The bank is anticipating profits of £84 million; but £30 million of that will go in tax, £38 million will be reinvested in the business and the £16 million left will go for dividends, and even that is subject to taxation .These kinds of statements, which in many cases are based on ignorance and in other cases based on mischievousness, do not serve the national interest or help to maintain calm and confidence in this unfortunate disastrous affair.</P>
    <P>The question in the mind of most people is the question of the taxpayers exposure in this whole affair.  That question can only be fully answered when the estimated losses have been quantified. The challenge to the Government is to arrive at a solution which places as much of the burden as possible on those responsible, namely, the AIB, without endangering the stability of the bank.  The Central Bank have advised the Government that the negotiated package represents the maximum that can be prudently borne by the AIB without endangering its stability.  The proportion therefore that can be placed on the general banking and insurance industry will be important, and that still remains to be determined when we know the full cost involved.  It will have to be carefully balanced so as to minimise the burden on the general taxpayer without seriously damaging the banking and insurance sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government's initial reaction on Friday, March 15, has greatly reduced and hopefully eliminated any threat to the stability of the banking system.  That was an important and considerable achievement.  However, the second and longer phase of this operation requires the Government not only to accomplish the best possible outcome for the taxpayer but to be perceived to have done that without undermining the stability of the banking and insurance sector.  That is <Col N="871" /> a fairly formidable challenge, but it can be met if the Government, the AIB and the banking and insurance industry generally realise that they have some common objectives, the most obvious one being to serve the public interest.</P>
    <P>It can be said that a bank is primarily concerned with serving its shareholders interests but that would be a very limited interpretation of its wider purposes.  If the outcome for AIB were to result in an angry backlash from the taxpayer the bank would be sustaining self-inflicted damage.  While the concern of AIB initially was to prevent an erosion of confidence they would be shortsighted if by their subsequent actions they were to alienate the public by seeking to avoid any of the bearable consequences of their own mistakes by transferring the cost to the taxpayer.  There is little point in speculating about how best to achieve the optimum overall result in advance of the establishment of the likely possible cost. By the same token it is dishonest and misleading to attempt to give a categorical assurance that the taxpayer will in no circumstances have to pay.  If we were able to say that &mdash; and I wish we were &mdash; there would have been no crisis in the first place.  That is what we certainly wish to see and must work towards, but at this juncture it must remain an objective rather than a reality.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of possible future losses which may be sustained on business written by the new semi-State company after the takeover date, these losses obviously will fall to be picked up by the Exchequer and the taxpayer.  That brings us face to face with the appalling condition of the general insurance business. My understanding is that last year alone the general insurance industry lost £150 million.  The consensus within that industry and among a large section of the population is that the major contributor to this disastrous situation is the claims award procedure, including the huge legal costs and delays in bringing cases to court.  We are out of step here in that throughout Europe no other country operates this kind of jury system with <Col N="872" /> employers' liability and similar types of insurance.  If this debate brings that problem to the forefront, as it should, we might have achieved something important. We could have the prospect of the worst of all worlds, a semi-State insurance company funded by the taxpayer losing a fortune and charging the taxpayer huge premiums to fund an expensive and inefficient jury awards system. We must eliminate that.</P>
    <P>The Government's initial decision was correct.  It achieved its immediate and crucial objective of protecting the stability of the banking system and the employers' liability insurance cover for a large proportion of the workforce.  The establishment of a semi-State insurance company presents other kinds of challenges: the challenge to protect the taxpayer to the maximum degree possible consistent with maintaining the stability of our financial institutions, the challenge to transform the current chaotic state of our general insurance and the challenge of ensuring that the new semi-State company is efficiently and properly managed and that it does not once again fall to the taxpayer to pick up the tabs for mismanagement.</P>
    <P>This whole debacle has been a serious blow to the business community, to the taxpayer and to every man, woman and child.  The risks were high.  The Government have acted responsibly in their initial actions and they propose to act responsibly in the follow-up.  A great deal of soul searching, criticism and investigation needs to be done, but I support this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil tabled this motion to give some backbone to our negotiators in regard to the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community and becoming participants in the Common Fisheries Policy.  In reiterating Fianna Fáil's support for the Irish fishing industry, I appeal to the Ministers involved in the negotiations to adopt a tough stand.  They should hold out for the maximum derogation period.  It is necessary to do that because our fishing industry is not adequately prepared to meet competition from Spain.  The state of our fleet is pretty appalling.  We have many ageing vessels and some of them are virtually obsolete.  Our processing industry is underdeveloped and the marketing of our fish products leaves a lot to be desired. Will the Minister for Fisheries outline to me details of the decommissioning grant scheme which is available in other EC countries?  I have made a similar request many times in recent years.  Other countries have found that scheme to be of tremendous help in modernising their fleets.  Under it they can sell their vessels to some west African countries or for scrap.  The amount of grant aid given under the scheme is considerable.  Have we made any progress in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our negotiators should be pressing for a substantial development package for our industry.  I am not seeking a derogation for any reason other than to allow time for the development of our industry. The fishermen off the south-west and west coast are as good as fishermen in any <Col N="874" /> part of the world.  They could compete if they had the resources, a modern fleet and the facilities.  A little competition would not be a bad thing for our industry. It is worth pointing out that some years ago mackerel fishing was not very popular here but as a result of competition our fishermen took an interest in that species. It is my hope that when our fleet is modernised our industry will prosper.</P>
    <P>With regard to processing and marketing, it is a scandal that 40 per cent of fish products consumed here are imported.  A total of £23 million worth of fish products were imported last year.  That should not be the case and we should be able to substitute those imports by fish landed by our fishermen and processed and marketed here.  I appeal to the Ministers concerned to insist on getting a package similar to the £300 million package produced for western farmers when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  That package was for the development of disadvantaged farmers.  A similar package should be prepared for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to harbour development works, I must highlight some of the work that is necessary in the south-west region. With an important political event due to take place on 20 June I hope the Minister will announce that work is about to start on Schull pier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this blows well for the fishermen of Cork south-west.  I should like to refer to the boat building section of the industry.  The Minister should direct his attention to the Baltimore boatyard which has been allowed to gather dust and, indeed, many other problems.  Before it closed down there was a tremendous tradition of boat building in that area.  The boatyard gave a lot of work and at its peak between 70 and 80 people were employed.  If we are to modernise, develop and support our <Col N="875" /> fishing industry we certainly need a progressive boat building industry.</P>
      <P>With regard to research and development, I should like to point out that it is 21 years since an important report on that aspect was issued.  The publication of the report followed the visit of the late President Kennedy to Ireland.  With the late Seán Lemass.  he suggested that a committee be established to make recommendations regarding the development of our fishing industry.  It is sad to record that since then very little tangible support has been given to research and development. I suggest that those involved in research should do more of their work on location.  They should inhale some of the sea air around the south and western coasts.  They should get away from the barrels of salt water and sail in some of the choppy waters around the Fastnet Rock and the Dursey Sound.</P>
      <P>The 1964 report also suggested that a fisheries research field station be established at kinsale.  I do not accept the excuse given for the failure to carry out that work, that it is not possible to trace the owner.  The Land Commission is no longer with us to delay this matter any longer.  If we are to have a progressive industry we must have the support of research and development, proper processing and marketing and a modern fleet.  If we are given a minimum derogation period of 20 years our industry will be able to cope with any competition from Spain, Portugal or any other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to divide up my 30 minutes by taking 20 minutes myself and giving five minutes to Minister of State D'Arcy and the remaining five minutes to Deputy Sheehan.  I support the amendment tabled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to this issue. Last night, the Minister indicated the reasons for his amendment and I do not propose to repeat what he said except to reiterate the very basic point that we cannot exclude Spain and Portugal on a <Col N="876" /> permanent basis from any part of Community waters.  Deputy Daly seems to think that we have a right and an obligation to do so but there is a certain amount of tongue in cheek in his statements because Deputy Daly, as a former Minister, attended many Council meetings in Europe and took part in the formulation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  He must know that in relation to member states, certain rights are conferred by membership and that they demand these rights under the Rome Treaty.  It is only through negotiation that derogations are looked for and, if successful, acceded to.  We are now seeking derogations from first day access by Spain into Community waters and those adjacent to our coast.</P>
      <P>In case anybody has the idea that we should be ashamed of the fishing industry or that it is not developing along the lines which we wish to see, perhaps a few figures will indicate what I am talking about.  In 1963, we were catching roughly 26.000 tonnes of fish in this country.  20 years later, in 1983.  we were catching 200,000 tonnes, an increase of 700 per cent.  In money terms the 1963 figure was roughly £1.1 million as against £53 million in 1983.  In export value, this amounted to £85 million.  By any standard or measurement you care to apply, that is progress which is still being maintained despite the many difficulties which beset the industry at present.  In the same period, direct employment in fishing increased to 8,500 and, if you take ancillary employment into account, it brings the figure up to 13,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Joe Walsh is a very practical, reasonable and fair politician.  He stated that all we could hope to gain is the maximum derogation.  He is not insisting on the crazy principle which has been enunciated by some of his colleagues that Spain should never be allowed in, when they know that this is not possible.  I compliment Deputy Walsh on his practical and reasonable stance on this issue. He raised the question of research and development, and in the national plan there is a reference to the production of a white paper on the fishing industry <Col N="877" /> which is now being prepared.  It will outline the framework for our policy attitude to the fishing industry in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In relation to restructuring, he raised the subject of laying up or decommissioning grants which are part of the Common Fisheries Policy structures.  There are restructuring grants and decommissioning grants.  I strongly make the point that we should not concentrate too much on decommissioning grants because the capacity in our fleet is about right to meet the catch opportunities in our waters. While other countries can and do avail of these because of overcapacity in their fleets, we do not suffer from that and we want to increase our catches.  We have the capacity to do this within the existing fleet.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Baltimore boatyard, I assert once again that, in the past, Bord Iascaigh Mhara were involved in the boat building business but I do not think it is a suitable business for a semi-State body and I have advised them that they are never again to get involved in this kind of commercial enterprise.  If the private sector see that there is an opportunity for them to make a profit in such an industry, it is open to them to avail of it and no doubt they will when they are convinced that there is profitability in this kind of enterprise.</P>
    <P>The fisheries chapter relating to the enlargement negotiations has been discussed in this House on more than one occasion.  I have been accused, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs, of allowing a position to obtain where the subject of fisheries was left to the end of the negotiating period.  Anyone who takes an interest in this will know that the reason it was left to the end was that it was such a knotty problem but it is now being discussed at length.  With the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State. I was involved for four days last week at a Foreign Ministers' Council in trying to ensure that the present discussions would result in the most favourable deal possible for this country and our fishermen. These negotiations were postponed from last week and they are starting again tomorrow morning in Brussels.  The <Col N="878" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Minister of State and I will be there to ensure that we hold our line.  Indeed, that line has been held in spite of what has been reported in the press and enunciated by Members of the party opposite.</P>
    <P>We have sought a long period of exclusion by Spanish fishing vessels from the Irish box.  We have also sought restrictions on the numbers of vessels that will eventually have access to the Irish box and other restrictions in relation to quotas and species, and all these demands are in place.  I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out last night that the allegation that a Spanish armada will descend on our coast, throwing 13,500 people out of work.  is nothing short of political hogwash.</P>

I would like to compliment our Naval Service for the work they have been doing in that respect, but, as any fisherman can tell you, despite the success of the Naval Service, a lot of illegal fishing is still going on.  As of now, we are depending for control purposes on our physical presence on the high seas to apprehend vessels that are fishing without licences &mdash; at the moment there are 106 licences operating west of us outside the box, granted not by this Government but by the EC &mdash; vessels which fish species they are not supposed to be fishing, or vessels which are fishing inside the box.  This is illegal at the moment. These vessels are being apprehended and will continue to be apprehended by the Naval Service while they are in breach of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's position on the negotiations was given in this House on 6 and 7 March 1985.  Spain has argued consistently against any exclusion.  They want to be in from day one.  We have said no.  The negotiations taking place are being handled at two levels.  Negotiations are taking place within the ten member state Council on which agreement must be reached before a negotiating position <Col N="880" /> is put to the Spanish negotiators by the Presidency of the Council on behalf of the EC.  It is not the Commission who negotiate in this case but the member states.  The Commission are there in an advisory capacity, giving technical and other advice.  Last Thursday morning at 2 a.m. for the first time the Spaniards agreed to a five year derogation.  Up to that time they wanted entry from day one.  Prior to that the Commission had proposed a seven year derogation period in respect of the Irish box and we have now brought the Council round to a unanimous position that the derogation being put to the Spaniards is ten years.</P>

      <P>I would not say it was appropriate.  The inspectorate will have a right from 1 January 1986 if Spain succeeds in gaining accession by that time and the enlargement is completed, to go into Spanish ports, scrutinise records, demand to know where catches were caught, the volume of catches and so on, a power they do not have now.  We now depend on our physical presence on the high seas.  We do not have the follow-through which we have in respect of other EC member states, but we will have when the enlargement has taken place.</P>
      <P>The North Sea has been mentioned. We have been accused of lying down and following the Danes, French and British to get away from an imposition of Spanish vessels in the North Sea.  This is a total misnomer.  At no time has a word been said by the Spaniards about the North Sea.  They never fished in the North Sea. They are not now seeking that facility and they have no intention in the future of fishing in the North Sea.  The question does not arise.</P>

They put our ten year derogation demand last week to the Spanish negotiators and will be putting it tomorrow at some stage as a Council stance.  If there is any move from that we will not accept it.

      <P>I welcome this debate.  Although the negotiations are at a delicate stage, this debate could be helpful.  While some wild statements were made by the Opposition some good ones were made as well.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry have stated fully the Government's position in relation to the difficult negotiations on Spain's accession to the EC.  I do not propose to repeat what they said but there are a number of points I wish to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the size and effectiveness of the Spanish fleet.  Everyone is concerned at the effect of enlargement because of the size of the Spanish fleet. It was suggested in some quarters that the entire Spanish fleet would head for Irish waters immediately Spain became a member of the EC.  That is not so.  It is the intention of the Government and of other Governments within the EC that the number of Spanish vessels which may fish <Col N="883" /> in Community waters will be severely restricted.  The most recent Presidency compromise which is before the Council would allow only a small fraction of the Spanish fleet to fish at any given time in Community waters.  There will be a quota restriction and strict monitoring controls on Spanish fishing in our waters.  It is important to note that Spanish access will be limited to a number of species and there will be no entitlement to quotas of species such as cod, haddock, whiting, plaice, mackerel and herring which are of particular interest to our fishing fleet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy </NameTxt>
      <P>We must not overlook the fact that Spanish entry has an advantage. It will provide an exceptionally useful outlet for Irish exports.  This point has not been mentioned before.  Fish consumption in Spain is at a high level. Demand cannot be met and has not been met for a number of years by the Spanish fleet.  We have a foothold in the Spanish market for shellfish, salmon and hake. With the removal in due course of the duties and import restrictions the outlook for expanding exports from Ireland is bright.</P>
      <P>There are two sides to this story.  What we must concern ourselves with is how we maximise returns from fishing exports in the interest of the national economy and our fishermen.  This Government have given top priority to securing export markets and the accession of Spain and Portugal re-inforces our determination to secure more and better markets for our fish in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many positive aspects to the industry and we are working to develop them.  We have given BIM a new and dynamic direction in relation to export markets and I am confident they will <Col N="884" /> respond with the kind of market development which will secure the future for our fishermen.  Spain and Portugal will be members of the EC and perhaps the advocates in Fianna Fáil of withdrawal by Ireland from the EC might see in such an action a logical Fianna Fáil solution to the preservation of fishing limits for the future.</P>

Under the proposed package Spanish boats will be excluded from the Irish fishing box for ten years and only a certain number of <Col N="885" /> boats will be allowed to fish in the box from 1996 to 2002.  I ask the Ministers concerned to negotiate the best deal possible and to demand special EC aid for us to build up our fishing fleet to Spanish status, that is to provide our fishermen with trawlers of over 100 feet in length and with 1,000 horsepower engines.  I assure the Opposition that if our fishermen get the opportunity they will meet and beat the Spanish invasion threat.</P>

      <P>It is essential to secure aid from the EC and it could be a very valuable bargaining asset to our Ministers in reaching a final agreement.  The time has come to face reality as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  If our fishermen are given boats which are of the same standard as their Spanish rivals it would allow them to fish from Monday to Friday in the rich fishing grounds within the 200 mile zone and why not Rockall and the North Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind Deputy Walsh that there is a fishery rescue package in lhe form of an interest subsidy scheme of £l.2 million this year, thanks to the Minister for Fisheries. At least it is a step in the right direction.  I was amazed at Deputy Daly's allegation last night that there was a total sellout of the Irish position in the negotiations with Spain and Portugal.  I remind the Deputy that it was a Fianna Fáil Government, in which Deputy Daly had a mighty role to play, that sold the fishing industry down the river 12 years ago in EC negotiations.  Why did Fianna Fáil not stand firm on behalf of the fishermen then?  What steps did they take to keep the Danish, Dutch, French and German trawlers out of our fishing waters?  Why did they capitulate on that occasion and allow fishing boats from those countries to fish in our coastal waters?  Why did Deputy Lenihan, as Minister for Fisheries, in 1977 not pursue the issue of the 200 mile limit and protect the interests of <Col N="886" /> Irish fishermen?  He did not worry if EC boats fished up to the bridge of Athlone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few brief points on Spanish accession to the EC.  No matter what the Government say, Spanish accession poses a massive threat to our fishing industry, an industry which is in its infancy and is not capable of withstanding competition from the Spanish fleet at present.  Our industry needs time and a great amount of financial assistance to make it competitive and to ensure its survival.</P>
      <P>Spain's lishery strength is equal to 70 per cent of the fisheries in the ten EC member countries.  This fishery regime is bound to pose a great threat not only to the industry in Ireland but also to the fishing stock and the fishing rights of the Common Market's maritime nations. Last night we were told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that only 1 per cent of Spain's fishing fleet would be allowed to fish in the Irish box.  That in itself is somewhere in the region of 100 to 175 trawlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="887" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the Irish box.  That is the 200 mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  It will still create terrible problems for us because they will monopolise our fishing.  We have very few large trawlers. The Irish fleet at present consists almost exclusively of in-shore and middle distance trawlers which can rarely stay at sea for more than two or three days.  They could not possibly compete with the more sophisticated trawlers which will be sent here by the Spaniards.  I hope the Government are taking full cognisance of the facts and that they will make money available in a very short time to ensure that we are competitive.  Many of our boats are old and some are obsolete. Unless financial aid is made available by the Government, the threat which is now posed will become a reality.</P>
      <P>It is now clear that large sections of the northern Spanish fleet are openly operating illegally in our waters.  From recent arrests and incidents off our coasts it would seem that those illegal activities are becoming more brazen, possibly in anticipation of Spanish entry to the EC. Even if Ireland, quite rightly, is committed politically to the accession of a democratic Spain, we should be putting maximum pressure on Madrid to guarantee that they will control this pirate fleet.  There is no other word we can use for it.  We need guarantees from the Spanish Government that they will move against trawlers now openly violating Community fishing regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our fishery protection services are excellent, they are still inadequate. We must protect our fishery grounds to the best of our ability.  I do not think we are capable of protecting them at the moment.  The Government would be justified in asking for financial aid from the EC to ensure that our fishery patrol vessels are increased in numbers.  They will have to contend with an ever-increasing number of Spanish boats.  The Minister said we could go to Spanish ports and monitor the amount of fish they catch.  I find that very hard to take.  It is not feasible. At the moment we cannot monitor <Col N="888" /> the illegal fishing in our waters.  Perhaps we will be afforded an opportunity to put observers on Spanish boats.  Unless more vessels are made available for fishery protection, our stocks will be totally depleted.  We need more information, but we also need stricter control.  If we are to have effective controls we need more vessels.</P>
    <P>It was stated here last night that our present patrols were capable of controlling fishing in the Irish box.  I do not think that is true.  That statement was made by a member of the Government but I do not think it can be substantiated.  Our fishing industry is in its infancy.  There are great opportunities in the industry for expansion especially on the processing side.  I hope that in the very near future more finance will be made available and more opportunities afforded to industrialists to go into this very lucrative business. There would be job opportunities for many people if this line were pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a remark made by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, about political opportunism on this side of the House. We in Fianna Fáil are the people who initiated a debate on the negotiations taking place with Spain and Portugal on their proposed accession to the EC.  We have been realistic about this at all times. There has been no cover up on this side of the House.  The Government have never made us aware at any time of what was happening or been prepared to meet with the industry, speak with them and get their opinions.  They were prepared to tell the industry some weeks ago that our fishermen were catching too many mackerel off the west coast of Ireland and were to reduce the amount of catches, otherwise the quota would be filled before the end of March.  Then we would not be good Europeans and would be flouting the regulations.  There is no problem when the Spaniards are flouting the regulations, as they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer now to a remark which will go down in history as far as our fishermen are concerned.  The Minister, Deputy D'Arcy, was asked by me in this House <Col N="889" /> to try to correct the imbalance of the mackerel quota between the UK and here.  He is on record in this House as saying that it was pointless looking for an increase of mackerel quotas when we could not sell the mackerel we have.  If we have a Minister of State such as that, he is the first man whose resignation I am calling for tonight.  However, I shall be calling for more resignations before my contribution is finished.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I stated in this House, when we initiated this debate, that the proposed enlargement of the EC will have disastrous effects on our fishing industry.  The Basque fishing fleet, 1 per cent or whatever it may be, will have a serious effect and imperil our whole fishing industry.  It will jeopardise the future of 13,000 jobs in the poorer parts of this country.</P>
    <P>This industry has a potential which can only be developed if the Government secure a realistic deal during the on-going negotiations with the Council of Ministers. We require a reasonable transitional period to allow the industry to reach the required state of development. Only then will we be able to compete with the major fishing industries, including the Spaniards.</P>
    <P>At this juncture I should like to congratulate the fishing industry on its performance &mdash; the fishermen, processors and all those involved in the ancillary industries &mdash; for having done a tremendous job during very trying times.  We are now being prevented from continuing to do this by the action of the Government who are completely out of touch with reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fishermen were prevented by lack of a Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs says that if we accept Spanish entry into the EC we must accept that they have a right to fish up to 12 miles off our coast after the proposed 10 years.  I ask the House and the Minister whether the Treaty of Rome considers exceptional cases.  When we joined the European Community the protocol on <Col N="890" /> Ireland, annexed at the time to that Treaty which we signed indicated that the fundamental objectives of the European Community included the steady improvement of living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the member states and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and eliminating the backwardness of less favoured regions.  It was stated that it was in the common interest that these objectives be attained by Ireland. At this time we are not having that opportunity.  The industry will take a retrogade step as a result of the negotiations taking place.  The morale in the industry was never lower &mdash; and this is before the negotiations are completed.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that the Spaniards can never be trusted at any time.  They have flouted the law time and time again and a typical example of that is the &ldquo;Sonia&rdquo; affair.  Over the last three years, 85 Spanish vessels have been apprehended within our waters.  In 1983, fines totalling £1.3 million were imposed. These are the people whom we are going to welcome into our waters.  £1.3 million is a small cost for fishing within those waters.  All the Spanish boats pay into an insurance pool and the fines are paid out of that.  When a boat is being apprehended by our naval vessels, this gives a greater opportunity to the other boats to fish while that naval vessel is tied up ashore.  In addition, the Spanish Government are aware of this and are contributing to the insurance pool to help their fishermen flout the law and fish illegally within our waters.  The Spanish are being offered in excess of £20 million to phase down their fleet, we are told, but the fact is that this sum, and more, is being given to modernise the fleet, to adapt and refurbish it and come to fish off the west coast of Ireland, the most prolific fishing grounds in the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If necessary, we must invoke the powers of veto.  There can be no question of abandoning the principles of veto.  This is the only guarantee that we have to fully protect our interests.  The fishing industry <Col N="891" /> is a vitally important element of the economic and social life of the west and of all our coastal regions.  Despite what one of the national papers said last Sunday, the industry is vital to the national economy and that of our poorer regions.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the number of licences and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs said last night that these would be in two figures.  I take it that is under 100.  I put it to the Minister that under the base list in areas 5b, 6, 7 and 8, 150 boats will be licensed to fish.  In the second list there will be in excess of 100 boats with the right to fish there. The Minister must remember that these licences are related to the horse power of each boat.  The horse power in this case is 700 and if the horse power is reduced, then the number of boats can be increased to fish in these waters.  They can fish at any time and that means that up to 250 boats can come in.  The Minister tells us not to get excited about the Spanish armada, but what constitutes an armada if 250 boats do not?</P>
      <P>We have been told time and time again that no quota species will be affected, that the Spaniards will not touch our mackerel, herring or any other quota species fish.  Who believes the Spaniards? They will fish our mackerel and our herring and the other quota type species. With the prospect of the mackerel and herring stocks becoming depleted, we now should be developing our fishing of whiting and horse mackerel, but the Spaniards have been in a position to fish those types long before us.  They have a quota for these and will have a quota for hake, monkfish, megrim, prawns, white pollock.  We are being out-manoeuvred in Brussels.  We require sufficient time and must ensure that at no time in the future can the Spaniards fish inside the 50 mile limit.  It would have a detrimental effect on our industry.</P>

    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry are not here at present, but I put it that they are completely abandoning our fishermen.  There has been doom and gloom throughout the fishing industry during the last couple of weeks.  Our fishermen are prepared to <Col N="893" /> invest in boats in excess of 130 feet and as large as 200 feet to mix in with the Spaniards, but without any grant aid from the State or from Europe it is not possible. I do not see any effort on the part of our Government to obtain grant aid for boats in excess of 130 ft.  The owners of these two boats of 200 ft. will not be given licences by the Government in order to fish and mix with the Spaniards. That is the type of attitude prevailing. Ten million pounds are being made available by private enterprise here.  If this were some foreigner coming in here he would not be treated in this manner by the present Government and Ministers. This is the case throughout all ports, from Burtonport to Killybegs, to Greencastle, throughout the west coast, along the south and east coasts, we can hear the death knell in the distance, the bells ringing as far as they are concerned.  Let no Minister or Deputy from the Government side of the House tell us that this is a good deal as far as the fishermen are concerned.  The Government have abandoned them, leaving them in mid ocean, out in the Atlantic, without even being prepared to throw them a lifebelt.</P>
    <P>A rescue package was introduced some weeks ago to help owners of boats in difficulties.  Indeed An Bord lascaigh Mhara are not yet aware of the finer points of that package.  Certainly the overall percentage of boats able to avail of this package will be very small.  I put it to the Minister that the amount of money the Government are making available for this rescue package is in the region of £70,000 only and not £3 million as he is endeavouring to suggest.</P>

      <P>The original demand was for 20 years and that has yet to be contradicted in this House, and there was to be no access within the Irish box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole future of the industry is at risk.  Even at this eleventh hour the Government should categorically state <Col N="894" /> that the Spanish demands or indeed the compromise of the chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Andreotti is not acceptable to us.  The question should be let go to the Summit and, if it is not agreed there, then let us wait, let the Spaniards wait for a further period after 1 January 1986 if we are to protect the interests of our fishermen.  The Government have an obligation and a duty to protect the interests of our fishermen hut they are selling them down the river.</P>
    <P>This is the second sell out.  They did it some time ago when they could not obtain a reasonable quota.  I contend that the people who are negotiating on our behalf in Europe are not capable, are being out-manoeuvred by Mr. Moran, the Spanish Foreign Minister.  We must ensure cast iron protection for our fishing stocks.  We cannot yield on the 20 year transitional period, with no entry into the box, if our fledgling fleet is to develop.  It is at present on its knees.  I have every confidence in the fishermen, in the industry, in the processors that we will get off our knees, that we shall compete with the best if we receive the assistance and support of the Government.  In the past the Spaniards have shown scant regard for the future of our industry.  We have been out-manoeuvred by them time and time again.  They are much tougher negotiators.  I put it to the Minister present this evening that in the middle of the negotiations, Mr. Moran did not leave Brussels and head for Madrid but our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Fisheries &mdash; when the negotiations were at their height &mdash; did what no good captain does, abandoned the ship.  They flew back to Dublin leaving the negotiations in the hands of a junior Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe.  Let them contradict that.  They were the laughing stock of Europe that evening when they left, ran from it all, leaving the sinking ship which no captain would ever do.  Let that be contradicted.</P>

      <P>Let us adopt the stance of the Spaniards in their clear, determined follow-through, in stark contrast to the foggy attitude of this Government. As a member of this party said at the time, during our period of the Presidency, all we did was to cobble together an agreement to placate the other members. We had a lever at that time but we did not use it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer again to this famous 1 per cent which, in terms of percentages, sounds relatively small, it being contended that we have absolutely nothing to worry about &mdash; the 175 boats which I maintain will be 250 boats, or in excess of that figure, coming into these waters. Then the Minister of State has the audacity of perhaps innocence to tell us that we have a large market in Spain, that there is tremendous potential there.  The only potential there is in Spain is to sell a few cray fish in the north of Spain. If the Minister believes that these boats come and catch our fish to sell them to some other country, not exploiting the so called markets in Spain, then he is not capable of holding his present position.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the absence of Labour members of the present Government who profess at all times to want to protect our national resources.  This was an opportunity for them to stand up and be counted.  It is ironic that in this House this evening, last evening and every other evening there was no Labour member sufficiently interested to come in.  I believe they are embarrassed and ashamed of the deal being done at present, that they do not want to be involved or seen in here.  It is time they stood up and protected the interests of the ordinary fisherman and the 13,000 people employed in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give an indication of the potential of the industry I should say that in 1978 landings amounted to 76,000 tonnes, which increased in 1983 to 200,000 <Col N="896" /> tonnes.  Our exports increased between 1978 to 1982 by 215 per cent and employment in the industry between 1976 and 1983 increased by 35 per cent.  There is a natural progression there and, with the proper agreement, that figure of 13,000 could be doubled with added value on shore.  There are many people with projects at present in the pipeline which I believe they will abandon.  There are many people who are prepared to add value to the fish being landed here.  It has been suggested we should have done this long ago.  After all the industry is only in its infancy.  These people should be given the full support and co-operation of the Government.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the size of the Spanish fleet, which is greater than the total Community fleet.  The fact that they have come in here illegally points to the fact that when they can come in legally, there will be no way in which we will be able to protect our coast line.  We are not in a position to do so at present and we will not be in a position to do so then with the area that will have to be covered.  At no time have we been told that more money will be provided for protection vessels.  We shall have to depend on the same protection vessels.  There is no question of us receiving £26,000 which is being made available to the Spaniards.  There is no possibility of that being made available to our fishing industry to update, refurbish and grant aid the purchase of larger boats.</P>
    <P>I do not despair this evening because this motion could be carried by the House.  Four Deputies of this House sent a telegram to the Minister last week, Deputies McGinley, Kenny, Coogan and Begley, saying: &ldquo;Stand firm against the demands of the Spaniards to fish in Irish waters&rdquo;, four members from the Minister's own party urging him to stand firm against the Spaniards, perhaps hoping that the rest of us would not hear it. Deputy McGinley, a colleague from my constituency whom I shall respect after I see him voting this evening, said sa sreang-scéal go gcuirfidh na Spáinnigh deireadh le tionscal na n-iascairí &mdash;&ldquo;stand <Col N="897" /> fim against the Spaniards because they will put an end to our industry&rdquo;.  I say to those people this evening: be sincere, look after the interests of your constituents whom you represent and they will look after you.  Not only are we talking about the 13,000 people on the east coast but we are talking also about their friends and relations throughout the country. However, this deal may be sufficient to bring down the Government.  The various Ministers will hang their heads in shame every time they look out on the Atlantic and realise they have sold out the fishing industry, though this is not the first time they have done so.</P>

We congratulate them on how successful they have been so far in those negotiations. We referred to the outrageous demands of the Spanish Government in seeking immediate access to Irish waters on their accession to the Community.  We are not disappointed.  I am sure if Deputy Sheehan had been in Dublin on the morning the telegram was sent, he would have signed it also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us here realise the potential threat posed by the Spaniards to our fishing industry.  I use the word &ldquo;potential&rdquo; advisedly because the negotiations being conducted by the <Col N="898" /> Ministers will avoid a catastrophe.  The Spaniards have a fishing fleet that is bigger than the combined fishing fleets of the existing EC countries.  Consequently, they are in a position to cause immense damage to our industry.  However, we must accept that sooner or later both Spain and Portugal will accede to the Community.  That is a political reality.  I cannot see the EC developing further.  I do not visualise any extra finance being made available.  The Germans are on record as saying that they will not contribute any extra moneys to the Community until the question of the accession of Spain and Portugal is dealt with.  Within the next year or earlier both of these countries will be members of the Community, but we must fight against their demand for immediate access to our fishing waters.  Deputy Gallagher says that our case should be treated as exceptional. The fact that Spain is not being granted immediate access to our waters is proof that we are being treated exceptionally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that during negotiations agreement will be reached whereby the Irish fishing industry will be given time to develop.  When the Spaniards realised that immediate access would not be granted they were prepared to accept a five or seven year transition period, but now a ten year period is being talked of.  If we use those ten years prudently and invest adequately in our fishing industry, we will have an industry that will be sufficient to protect our interest. I would demand also that there be a severe limitation on the number of boats allowed enter our waters after the transition period and, most important, that there be stringent controls on the number of Spanish vessels allowed in.  Deputy Gallagher said there was no consultation with the Opposition on the question of Spanish accession.  I would point out to the Deputy that before Christmas the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC discussed Spanish accession and no doubt there were Fianna Fáil <Col N="899" /> members present at that meeting.  The Minister and his Minister of State have been very active in pursuing new markets for mackerel abroad, especially in Africa. Only last year 20,000 tonnes of mackerel were stored in Donegal but there is very little stored there now.</P>

      <P>The Government must accept that there is very genuine concern in regard to the future of our fishing industry.  This is not merely the view of people on this side of the House.  It is the view, not only of Deputies in this party who represent constituencies in which fishing is a major activity, but of the representatives of the fishermen and of their organisation.  They realise that this is a particularly delicate and tricky time for them.  They realise that their livelihoods are at stake.  Their concern must be accepted by every Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been very limited discussion in the House of the problem for our fishing industry that will result from the accession of Spain and Portugal, but Spain in particular, to full membership of the Community.  One would have thought that plenty of Government time would have been given in the House for discussion of such a problem but for some strange reason which is confusing to say the least, the Government have refused to give any Government time for a discussion of this important topic, I am chairman of the all party Dáil Committee who examine EC secondary legislation. Deputy Manning is vice-chairman of that committee while some of those people sitting in these benches are members of the committee.  The committee had a worthwhile discussion on this topic.  We produced a unanimous report and unanimously we requested Government time for discussion of the subject in the House but we were refused that request.  Whatever limited debate has taken place on this matter, a matter that affects the livelihood of 13,500 people, it took place only as a result of the efforts of our <Col N="900" /> spokesman, Deputy Daly, who raised the matter during Private Members' Business, and of others who, through hard work by way of parliamentary question, succeeded in having the matter raised now and again.  This is not good enough. This Parliament has an important part to play if it is to be representative of the people.  Unfortunately, there was no Government initiative in having a debate begun.  Of course, there is a very heavy and grave responsibility on this Government, and in particular on the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to protect our fishing industry. There are many good reasons for this, not the least of which is the question of the livelihood of the 13,500 people engaged in the industry.  I regret that our Government allowed this serious matter to be pushed to the end of the queue, to be left until the final moment for decision. This was a major tactical error on their part.  Now we find ourselves under extreme pressure on many fronts, from other member countries with other interests who are trying to force the pace so as to finalise negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  A major error was made by the Government, and especially by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by the Minister for Fisheries who was advising him, in allowing the fisheries question to be left until the end of the day.  On one occasion here during Question Time my party leader and I tried to elicit a definite assurance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that all negotiations on this serious matter would be concluded before Spain would be allowed accede to full membership of the Community but even then the Minister refused to give any such assurance.  Even at this late stage, I say to the Minister and the House that we must not allow the threat of the West German Government to withhold the increase in VAT and in own resources to force our hand at the cost of the welfare of our fishing industry.  Naturally they <Col N="901" /> have not the same interest in fishing as we have.  They do not depend on it to the same degree as we depend on it and it is not going to cause any major economic upheaval in West Germany if our fishing industry collapses.</P>
      <P>Of course there is another reason why that pressure is coming from West Germany. It is because there are outside influences coming to the surface within the EC.  The EC is an economic alliance, not a military alliance.  I am talking about the influences coming from NATO.</P>
      <P>We know that a short time ago Spain became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation which is a military alliance.  The Minister suggested to me that there were other pressures on Spain. Of course there are internal political problems in Spain regarding whether Spain should continue to be a full member of NATO.  That is the political problem that Prime Minister Gonzales is facing because in the run-up to the election he made certain statements that now he probably wishes he had not made.  It is important to West Germany from a political point of view that Spain should stay in NATO, so much so that now, irrespective of the consequences to us of Spain's membership of the EC, they are prepared to put pressure on us.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister that on every occasion when we had the opportunity in this House in the past 18 months we warned of the pressure that would come as a result of the club of NATO and its importance to our colleagues in the EC which I stress once again is an economic alliance and not a military alliance.  That is unfair pressure on us and it was not helpful to our cause recently when the Prime Minister said that if Spain's accession to the EC were slowed down much longer he would not be able to deliver on keeping Spain as a full member of NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not need the contribution last night from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on what is involved for us as a nation with regard to full membership of the EC.  We fully appreciate and understand what is involved.  This party when they were in Government, against part of <Col N="902" /> the present Government and in particular the Labour Party, in the early seventies, were involved in very successful negotiations regarding our accession to the EC. We fully understand the principles of membership and our obligations.  We support fully in principle the development of the EC for the obvious, simple and selfish reason that it is vital to our existence that the Community should go from strength to strength.  We want to improve it but we also say that the present state of our fishing industry must be considered as it is at the present time.  All of us accept that our fishing industry has a long way to go before its full potential is reached.  We accept that heavy financial investment has to be made if it is to survive and to develop.  Now is the time for the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be present at the negotiating table in the EC.  They should ensure that we get all the aids available for the development of our fishing industry if we are to withstand the pressures that will come on us when Spain becomes a full member of the EC.  Now is the time to do that, not afterwards.  If we look for help afterwards the strength of our bargaining position will have diminished greatly.  We have not had any assurances that our fishing industry will get the necessary financial commitment if we are to withstand such pressures.</P>
    <P>Spain has a fleet of 17,500 fishing boats, a colossal fleet.  We know that much of the fleet requires heavy investment to bring it up to the necessary standard to be effective.  Is it not obvious that with Spain's accession to the EC it will be a major drain on whatever resources are available for the development of their fleet and at our cost?</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Blanchardstown (Dublin) Hospital.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair I should like to share my time with Deputy Lenihan.  There is general concern in the Blanchardstown area about the fact that there has not been any progress about building the hospital promised by the Minister's predecessors. Already the population of the catchment area is 112,000 and it is expected that in the Blanchardstown area, without going into north county Dublin and south Meath, that there will be 100,000 people by 1990.  It is obvious that there is a need for this hospital.  Since 1979 there has been a big increase in the volume of work carried out in the existing hospital.  If one looks at attendances at the casualty department there one will see that there has been an increase from 12,500 in 1979 to 30,000 in 1984.  Similarly, outpatient attendances have increased from 17,000 in 1979 to 35,000 in 1984.  Due to the shortage of time for this debate I will not go into further statistics.  However, I must express concern that the accident and emergency unit set up in 1982 has not been properly funded by the Department; in fact, the hospital last year had a deficit of over £500,000.  I had a question down to the Minister today and it is obvious from the answer that there was no special allocation to the hospital for the accident and emergency department and that the hospital are obliged to fund that department out of their general allocation.  When one considers that this hospital was built originally to accommodate tuberculosis patients and then changed into an acute medical hospital to serve the area but did not get the funding to ensure that it could operate as a general <Col N="909" /> hospital, it is easy to see the difficulties it is facing in trying to provide the accident and emergency service.</P>
      <P>Last year a 40 bedded unit was closed in the hospital and will remain closed for this year.  This is an indication of the effects of the cutbacks on Blanchardstown Hospital.  We appeal to the Minister to allocate sufficient funding to ensure that the hospital will continue to operate as a proper general hospital for the people in Blanchardstown and to proceed with the building of the new hospital to cater for the needs of the existing population of 112,000 and for the massive increase in population which is expected in the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to concentrate on one aspect within the limited time available to me, the failure on the part of the Minister to proceed with the appointment of a design team to carry out the development plan which is necessary to turn this hospital into a general, all purpose one, fully servicing the north western part of Dublin city and the part of County Meath adjacent to it.  It should function as one of the six major hospitals in the greater Dublin area as originally planned by the Minister for Health in the Government to which I was glad to belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of faith and an inability or incapacity to proceed with legitimate planning.  I appreciate the straitened financial circumstances in which the Minister finds himself but he seems to take pleasure in inposing these financial stringencies.  Units have been closed down, the hospital is running on a very thin personnel base and the accident and emergency units are working on a shoestring.  However, the important aspect to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the question of not proceeding with the legitimate planning of the major hospital to which he committed himself.  He wrote to me on 6 March 1984, over a year ago, stating specifically that the next stage in the development of the hospital would be the appointment of a team to prepare such a plan.  We want the immediate appointment of a design <Col N="910" /> team composed of essential, professional and medical expertise, to carry out the necessary design work so that when the financial situation improves &mdash; I am optimistic enough to think that it will under a Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; the Government of the day will be in a position to proceed with the implementation of the construction required on foot of the recommendations of the design team. I appreciate that planning takes time but it does not cost very much money and every month's delay in the appointment of the design team is a delay of a month in the commencement of the construction of a major hospital.  If the Minister is going to proceed with the major hospital development, now is the time to engage in the comparatively inexpensive exercise of appointing a design team whose work will take about three years.  If he does this, he will be giving an indication of his bona fides in this matter.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Blanchardstown area arranged a public meeting and I would have thought that they would have shown more imagination coming up to local elections than by stirring up this matter.  The meeting took place last Thursday in Coolmine and literature circulated contained a heading &ldquo;Save Blanchardstown Hospital&rdquo;.  The impression was given and I know that many people in the area thought that the hospital was going to close.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state categorically that there is no truth in that allegation.  In the Department's current revenue accounts I have provided nearly £10 million to run the hospital in 1985.  I condemn the Deputies opposite for causing needless anxiety among the population served by this hospital by these unfounded allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the proposed development of the hospital.  The James Connolly Memorial hospital is designated as one of six major hospitals for the <Col N="911" /> Dublin area and my Department are actively involved with the board of management. A very good friend of mine, Councillor Paddy Hickey, is a Fianna Fáil chairman, but he should have shown more discretion than getting embroiled in that kind of local party political play.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering the capital allocation for the years 1985-1987 when the project can proceed to the next stage of planning of the complete redevelopment of the hospital in accordance with the planning brief which has been prepared. Pending that, I made moneys available to the hospital.  I think I am the first Minister for Health in the past ten years to have done so.  I made £150,000 available immediately last year for the extension of the accident and emergency and pathology departments.  I visited the hospital and it is a very good one but the accident and emergency and pathology departments need development.  To date we have spent £137,000 on development; the extension is nearly completed and the pathology department will open very shortly.</P>

      <P>The schemes envisage, as far as is practicable, the faithful restoration of the houses both internally and externally together with the replacement or renewal of floors, eradication of rot, replacement of roofs, repair or replacement in Georgian style of such items as stairs, ceilings and fireplaces and the installation of modern appropriate services to provide good office accommodation.  The commissioners are not in a position at present to indicate a precise timescale for the proposed schemes of works.

    <P>1.  General</P>
    <P>Oberstown Youth Centre is an amalgamation of the former Scoil Ard Mhuire and Trinity House School.  It is registered as a reformatory school under the 1908 Children Act and its purpose is to discharge certain responsibilities of the Minister for Education under the 1908 Children Act.  It has accommodation for up to 100 boys in both open and closed settings.  The closed section can accommodate a group of 30 particularly difficult boys in the age range 12-16 on admission. The open section can accommodate up to 70 boys in the same age range with less severe problems.  A continuous programme of care, education and training is provided on the campus.  The primary objective of the programme is to prevent further damage to the boys and to enable them to adjust to themselves and to the requirements of society.  To achieve this objective varying periods of intensive care will be provided, in the course of which they will live in easily manageable groups where supportive relationships with adults can be developed. <Col N="790" /> This care will be orientated towards the child's return to his own community, with an increased sense of responsibility and of consideration for others.  A range of specialised facilities in care, education, training and recreation are provided to achieve these aims.  These facilities are viewed not as separate entities but as integral parts of a total living treatment situation which grow into each other in a natural way.  Boys will be referred to the centre by the Courts and, in certain cases, to the open section by the Health Boards.  No boy, properly referred by the Courts, can be refused admission, provided accommodation is available, except with the express authority of the Minister for Education.</P>

    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX.</P>
    <P>The Duties of Director <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Board of Management.</P>
    <P>(i)  Under the 1908 Children Act the Board of Management acts as &ldquo;managers&rdquo;. The Director for the time being will assume all the duties and responsibilities of resident manager under the Children Act, with the exception that the right to refuse any child properly referred is reserved to the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The Director will ensure that the decisions of the Board are implemented. In this connection the decisions of the former Board of Trinity House School stand unless or until they are amended <Col N="797" /> by the Board of the Oberstown Youth Centre.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The Director will ensure that the Rules and Regulations of the Department of Education are observed.  He will ensure that all members of staff and particularly senior members of staff are fulfilling their duties in accordance with their job specifications.</P>
    <P>(iv)  He will ensure that at all times a high standard of child care practice obtains in the centre and that no child's rights are infringed.</P>
    <P>(v)  The Director will ensure that in the event of an absconding, unapproved absence, or other untoward eventuality the child's parents or guardians are informed as a matter of urgency.  Where an infringement of the law is involved he will see to it that the competent Garda authorities are informed.</P>
    <P>(vi)  The Director, under the authority of the Board of Management, has operational responsibility for the day-to-day running of the Centre.  It will be a matter for his professional judgement to decide the programme of each boy, in consultation with the other professional staff of the centre and consultant staff.  He will ensure unrestricted access to all parts of the Centre by the Department's Child Care Adviser and will make available to him any information required on any boy.</P>
    <P>(vii)  The Director's reporting relationship with the Board of Management will be through the Chairperson or, in his absence, through his nominated deputy. On matters concerning individual children the Director will be empowered to make whatever outside contacts are necessary for the working of the school. He will ensure however that in matters of policy neither he nor any of his staff will make any statements which have not previously been approved by the Board of Management.  When an individual member of the Board of Management visits the school in the capacity of representing the Board, the Director will <Col N="798" /> ensure that such Board member has unrestricted access to all parts of the Centre for the purposes of the visit.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Notwithstanding paragraph (vii) above, the Director will furnish any particular information to any official of the Special Education Section of the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the circumstances in which the Oblate Order withdrew from the management of Scoil Ard Mhuire, Lusk, and the arrangements which (a) she and (b) the Board of Management of the school, made for the continued management of the school.</P>

      <P>On 4 October 1983 the Provincial of the Oblate Order informed the Minister of State at the Department of Education that it was the intention of the order to withdraw from the management of the school within 12 months.  The Department made inquiries to ascertain whether any other religious order wished or were in a position to replace the Oblates and were informed by the Education Secretariate of the Diocese of Dublin that no other religious order was available to replace the Oblates.</P>
      <P>As Scoil Ard Mhuire and Trinity House were both reformatory schools situated on the same campus the Minister for Education decided that in order to provide a continuum of care, education and training across the campus, the schools should be amalgamated under the name of Oberstown Youth Centre and be managed by one board of management and one director.  The Oblate Order withdrew their services on 31 August 1984, the two separate boards of management for the schools resigned and the new board of management became effective from 1 September 1984.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason the post of resident manager or director of Scoil Ard Mhuire was not advertised when it became vacant following the withdrawal <Col N="799" /> of the Oblate Order in accordance with practice throughout the public service; and the functions exercised variously, (a) by herself and (b) by the Board of Management of the school, in filling the post.</P>

      <P>Following the withdrawal of the Oblate Order from the management of Scoil Ard Mhuire, Lusk, it was decided to amalgamate Scoil Ard Mhuire and Trinity House school to form the Oberstown Youth Centre.  The positions of director of Scoil Ard Mhuire and director of Trinity House school were suppressed and the former director of Trinity House school became the director of the Oberstown Youth Centre.  There was therefore no need to advertise for the position of director of Scoil Ard Mhuire as that position no longer existed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two certified reformatory schools: Scoil Ard Mhuire, Lusk, and Trinity House School, Lusk.  Scoil Ard <Col N="808" /> Mhuire is an &ldquo;open&rdquo; school.  The containment of the boys is dependent on the supervision of the staff (care staff and teachers) and the co-operation of the boys themselves.</P>
      <P>Trinity House is a &ldquo;secure&rdquo; school. Security is provided in the structure of the building as well as in the number of staff responsible for the supervision of the boys.  In both Scoil Ard Mhuire and Trinity House boys are placed on a carefully planned programme of rehabilitation which is structured to meet the individual needs of each boy.  It focuses especially on identifying the positive aspects of each boy's behaviour and builds on strengths.  A number of models of treatment are used depending on the response of each boy.  The general aim is to improve each boy's self image and to reintegrate him into society as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The operation of Trinity House is carefully monitored by the Board of Management on behalf of the Minister.  The staff of the school includes a full time psychologist, part of whose duties is to research into the efficacy of the programme.  As the school did not become fully operational until the latter half of 1983 insufficient data is available as yet to evaluate the results achieved compared with other institutions.</P>

      <P>My Department on the recommendations of the Commissioners of Public Works on 16 January 1985 sanctioned a grant towards the cost of providing new toilets in Tiernaboul national school, Killarney, County Kerry.  The proposal involved remodelling an existing surplus classroom.  The school authorities did not proceed with this work and have since <Col N="809" /> proposed an alternative scheme of outdoor toilets with the object of retaining the classroom in question to meet increases which they believe will occur in pupil enrolments.  My Department's local inspector has been asked as a matter of urgency to investigate the position and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
