      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is concerned about the serious effects of the abolition of the rescue package scheme which will result in many farmers going out of business and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the present situation with regard to an extension of the rescue package, given that at least 3,000 farmers have serious financial problems which in many <Col N="750" /> cases have been exacerbated by the super-levy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.  The reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty ended on 1 April 1985; 1 May 1985 in the case of borrowings from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I am at present considering the position of those participants in the scheme who may not have achieved viability.</P>
      <P>Up to 31 December 1984, 6,277 applicants for the scheme had been accepted in principle by the lending institutions, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.  Of these 5,418 have been granted interest relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In view of the fact that something in the region of £11 million of the previous allocation is not spent, could the Minister of State indicate if it will be made available towards the new scheme, if any, that will be provided by the Minister in due course?  Further, will he indicate to the House now what the indications are from the financial institutions with regard to the continuation of this scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is mainly by way of tax credits, so that sum of money is not just sitting there.  We have had discussions with the banks standing committee on the whole business of renewing the scheme which were generally favourable, but at this stage I am not in a position to disclose anything further to the House because the Minister is having further discussions with the banks standing committee and then with the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been generally accepted that this has been a worthwhile scheme.  As it ended on 31 March and it is now 14 May, is time for consideration not over?  Why not make a decision on the continuation particularly when the banks are favourably disposed towards its continuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Are small farmers who have found themselves in a serious financial situation to be left forgotten by the Minister?  The three year rescue package has ceased.  Are these farmers now to sit back and wait until the Minister makes a decision?  Has he any intention of assisting them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>When the scheme was first introduced it was estimated that it would benefit up to 10,000 farmers to the tune of £51 million over three years of which some £37 million would be contributed by the Exchequer.  As it happened, only 6,200 farmers were expected to qualify and that would be about £20 million from the Exchequer.  At present about 50 per cent of participants can be made viable without further assistance and about 15 per cent of participants are unlikely to recover viability even if the scheme is extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me point out to the Minister of State that some of these farmers, who have complied with the plans put before them by the agriculture advisers and have worked very hard to maintain the schedule set down, through no fault of their own find themselves in serious financial difficulties.  Is the Minister of State saying now that no further assistance is to be given to these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing of the sort. I said that the Minister is currently looking at the position and will be having <Col N="752" /> discussions with his Cabinet colleagues in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister feel that these negotiations will be concluded, or will the farmers have to wait another 12 months before any decision is made?  These farmers cannot wait another one month or two months.  They want an immediate decision from the Minister as to what is going to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has indicated he has had discussions with various bodies, financial and otherwise and that of the 6,177 applicants only 50 per cent have now been established as viable.  What does he propose to do about the remaining 50 per cent?  Like other Members I am very concerned about the time the Minister is taking to make up his mind.  Would he tell the people who are depending on the continuation on this rescue package clearly, unequivocally and unambiguously when he proposes to reintroduce this scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the system which exists in his Department for reviewing public expenditure programmes administered by his Department to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of such programmes with a view to determining from the point of view of public policy whether such programmes could be carried out more effectively or whether they answer the needs such programmes were originally intended to serve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Ensuring that expenditure programmes are implemented as <Col N="754" /> effectively and efficiently as possible is a normal and ongoing responsibility of management within my Department.  In addition, policy appraisal using formal techniques of cost-effectiveness analysis and investment appraisal is undertaken by specialist staff, and this work is collated for an annual internal review.  Also the preparation of the annual &ldquo;Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes&rdquo; in which my Department participate, provides a framework for the monitoring of expenditure on a programme basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any special changes taken place in the Department since, say, 1980 or 1981 to review public expenditure programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there have been changes.  We have the services of analysts who are gradutes with a two-year training programme run by the Department of Finance working in the economic unit of the Department.  The Department also have access to the services of trainee analysts attached to the Department of Finance.  These specialist staff have completed many studies and individual schemes and programmes which have been used in the general policy development and line management work of my Department.  These studies frequently but not exclusively, use quantitative evaluation techniques, such as cost benefit analysis and cost effectiveness analysis of investment.  Basically, they are looking at schemes like the farm modernisation scheme, the animal health scheme, the drainage schemes, and so on, and considering their cost effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>When were these analysts introduced into the Department?  In respect of, for example, the scheme for the eradication of bovine diseases, which this year it is estimated will cost £31 million, were the changes the result of analysis carried out by these analysts?  That scheme has been in existence for over 20 years and has resulted in a very great deal of public money being badly spent.  Did <Col N="755" /> the analysts recommend changes in that scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In 1983 an interdepartmental committee were established to examine all aspects of the problem of dog control and to make recommendations.  This committee comprised of representatives from the five Government Departments with an involvement in dog control &mdash; the Departments of Agriculture, Finance, Environment, Health and Justice.  The Government have recently considered the committee's report and have approved their recommendations.  In brief these are that: (i) statutory responsibility for dog control be entrusted to local authorities; (ii) receipts £5 per dog, from the dog licence fee be made available to the local authorities to finance their dog control functions, (iii) the responsibilities of dog owners be updated, with appropriately higher penalties fixed for breaches of the law, and (iv) the existing provisions relating to shooting of dogs found worrying livestock on farms be strengthened.</P>
      <P>I have been charged with the preparation of legislation to give effect to these recommendations and my aim is to introduce this legislation at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the news the Minister has given us of the decision being taken by the Government but when does he envisage having the legislation ready to come before the House?  This is most important to ensure that we will not have a decline in sheep numbers in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been personally involved in this area since 1973.  My view is that this legislation is urgently needed and if I had my way it would be before <Col N="757" /> the House as soon as possible, but I am not the person who has to make the final decision on this.  First the Minister has to prepare the legislation and then it goes to the Office of the Attorney General. With a lot of goodwill we could look forward having this legislation in the fall, in other words, hopefully before next year's lambing season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a decision has been taken by the Government to introduce this legislation and we will prepare it as quickly as possible.  It is envisaged that it will be totally in the hands of county managers and county councils.  That type of devolution would be very useful because our Department would find it difficult to get involved in areas like Dublin city where dogs create many problems by fouling footpaths and so on. It is obviously a job for the city and county authorities who will collect the fees, appoint dog wardens, erect pounds and have good liaison with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will make a statement with regard to a speech made recently by the Minister of State at his Department on the occasion of the annual dinner of the Irish Agricultural Advisers Organisation, that efforts to accelerate growth in agricultural output must concentrate on that segment of the farming population which has real development potential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reassure the Deputy in that regard.  There will be no neglect of any other category of farmer. Emphasis was placed on the middle band of farmers because of representations made by the IFA, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the National Board of Science and Technology and the four year plan for agriculture.  These people are involved in fairly hefty expenditure and they need comprehensive technical advice which the specialised service in ACOT will be able to provide. I attended a meeting of the directors of ACOT recently and it was emphasised that we should not neglect the people who are not in that category.  For instance &mdash; this may come as a surprise &mdash; 75 per cent of the middle band of clients have less than 100 acres and under 60 livestock units.  It is clear, therefore, that average farmers are included in the middle band.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that because of the complete withdrawal of grant aid over the last two years for the low category of farmers, there is <Col N="760" /> a concentration on the one third of the farmers in the higher bracket?  Does the Minister also agree that a farmer, irrespective of the size of his farm, who works to a plan and keeps accounts is entitled to the maximum support and assistance to develop his holding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>When the new farm modernisation scheme is in operation, it will probably be more liberal in regard to that type of farmer.  However, I reiterate that size is not the deciding factor when it comes to development.  For instance, if someone goes in for intensive horticulture, we could be talking about five acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>ACOT have identified about 63,000 farmers who received priority for advisory attention because of their development potential and their enthusiasm to advance.  As I said already, ACOT have stated quite clearly that they will continue to provide farmers outside the priority category with a service appropriate to their needs.  In addition, those farmers can participate in ACOT's <Col N="761" /> educational programmes by way of lectures, demonstrations, clinics and farm visits as required.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister clarify whether a directive has issued from his Department to ACOT to concentrate on the farmers with the high development levels, those at almost full development potential?  What is his attitude and that of his ministerial colleagues and the officials in his Department to the other 100,000 farmers or so who need almost full time advice in order to bring them up to a reasonable level of development?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote the Government's statement on the matter. The Government believe that efforts to accelerate growth in agricultural output must concentrate on that segment of the farming population which has real development potential.</P>
      <P>ACOT, therefore, is being asked to concentrate its advisory services on those farmers who have the resources and the motivation to achieve such development. The reorganisation and restructuring of the advisory services with a new emphasis on client enterprise advisers organised on a local district basis will provide the best framework within which assistance can be provided to those with the greatest potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was the sort of reply I expected.  It is the type of reply which Ministers for Agriculture have given down through the years.  Have the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department thought out any new policies for developing other new products in farming?  Are they relying on the next thing to come from the EC before deciding what they will do?  It is not enough for the Minister to say it is up to farmers to decide what they will do if the Minister is not giving them help, training, advice, encouragement, or incentives to do something else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>We are there at all times to give advice and that is as far as we can go.  Farmers will decide to do their own thing.  They have been quite successful at that.  We can still go a long way down the road with regard to beef production and cereals.  We are not self-sufficient in cereals. Much can be done with regard to milling wheat.  We are working with ACOT.  Deputies who went to the Spring Show will have seen what is happening with regard to sheep production, with special emphasis on the French market where the scope is.  We have farm modernisation grants for sheep wintering accommodation, for housing for pigs, for the storage of potatoes and horticultural produce.  On a day to day basis we are looking at every possible line of production to see how it can be improved and expanded.</P>

New projects take a certain amount of time.  We cannot jump into something overnight and hope to make a success of it.  We must look at the market place and see whether we can compete in it, and take it from there.  The Deputy can be assured that we are looking at every possible line of activity.</P>

      <P>Price is a factor but it is not everything.  As a grower of cereals let me assure the Deputy that yields are much more important than price.  Properly managed cereals can be very lucrative. I do not accept that we cannot grow more cereals.  We should be growing more cereals.  The same applies to horticultural produce.  One of the snags is that we have a small market place.  There is the danger that if you advise everybody to go headlong into any type of farm produce you may flood the market and <Col N="764" /> ruin the livelihoods of people already producing in that area.  Recently I was very pleased to help a group of people who are hoping to export fresh horticultural produce to the British Midlands.</P>

      <P>We have pig production and poultry production.  Some people in Deputy Walsh's constituency would not agree with me and have not done so in the past, but one of the problems about small farm enterprise is that they have not been very successful.  Poultry egg production and pig production have developed into very big farmyard enterprises. Mushroom production in Deputy Leonard's area has been highly successful.  We do not want everybody to jump into mushroom production and put all Deputy Leonard's farmers out of production.  We have a limited number of people on the glasshouse side of the production.  We have helped them with grants.</P>

      <P>We are looking at flax <Col N="765" /> very seriously.  I hope we will have a small commercial operation in 1986.  There is a demand for the product.  Far too often in the past we were inclined to start in the field and hope to be able to sell.  We should find out what people are buying and produce that.  I hope I am spearheading a number of different ideas.  Some will succeed and some will fail.  It is worth giving them a run.  We are doing that with quite a few projects.  I am not saying they will all be successful.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the very small market we have.  He mentioned mushrooms and said that if everybody produces mushrooms they will put others out of business, and so on.  Is the Minister considering that the EC market is merely for beef, dairy products and cereals, the other products being solely for the domestic market? Surely he will recall that when joining the Community we were told that there was being opened up to us a market of 250 million people.  Does the Minister accept that that market is open to all products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I accept that and I trust that I have not given any impression to the contrary.  The difficulties being experienced in some areas by people engaged in horticulture is that the markets are monopolised already by huge multinationals and that presents a problem of access to any such market. Regarding mushrooms, for instance, Deputy Leonard's people are eminently successful in gaining access to the UK and Scottish markets.  Our own small plant, Midleton Food Products, now have access to the UK market because of involvement with a small UK group but I realise that this is a difficult area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Veterinary inspection at slaughterhouses catering for the home market only is the responsibility of local authorities. On the other hand, factories which supply meat for export come under the direct veterinary supervision of my Department. These factories must conform to standards laid down in national legislation and in EC legislation for intra-Community trade and must also meet standards required by importing countries outside the Community.  These could be more rigorous than some of the EC standards.  One thinks of the US, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Control of premises producing meat solely for the home market and the transport of such meat are matters for the veterinary inspectors employed by the local authorities and the health inspectors employed by the regional health boards. In many of these local slaughterhouses standards of inspection and hygiene are high.  Nevertheless, the absence of uniformity in standards has been a cause of concern to me.  In this regard the <Col N="767" /> Government have decided to introduce legislation to apply standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughtering premises which will be on a par with the standards applying at export premises. It has also been decided that responsibility for the new arrangements will rest with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>My Department are at present examining this whole question with a view to the preparation of the necessary legislation to provide for standards of hygiene and veterinary control at all slaughtering premises, including those slaughtering pigs. Because many of the existing enactments in this area are old and complicated, the preparation of comprehensive amending legislation is a highly complex operation. However, I intend to have the new proposals before the Oireachtas as early as possible.  I hope to have the Bill before the House in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the standard in some of the abattoirs is very high but he did not put the counterpoint.  Would he accept that the standard in the majority of slaughterhouses is very low?  A survey carried out about six months ago indicated that only about one in five of these premises reached the required standard.  Would the Minister agree that in perhaps almost half the total number of counties, there is no abattoirs of acceptable standard and, consequently, does he appreciate the urgency of the new legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the urgency of the new legislation and that is why we are introducing it.  I might add for the information of the House that there are 800 slaughtering premises under local authority control and that ten of the counties concerned employ 23 whole time veterinary inspectors while the majority employ only part time officers. There is fairly general dissatisfaction with standards.</P>

Is there not a real urgency, then, not only in terms of the home market but of exports also, to have matters rectified?  We have lost very valuable markets in the pigmeat industry, an area that is so important to our economy.</P>

One of the difficulties that is likely to arise, following the enactment of the new legislation, will be in relation to finding new locations for premises if a large number of the existing ones have to close.  No one likes to have a slaughterhouse within miles of where they live.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that as the hardship fund operates, one would have to dispose of almost one's complete herd before being able to avail of the fund?  Up to now one would qualify on the basis of 20 per cent of a herd having to be disposed of.  Last week an instance was brought to my attention of a farmer who has been informed that he does not qualify for money from the fund though 31 animals out of a herd of 64 had to be disposed of.  That represented about 47 per cent of his herd.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>These questions were asked in the context of the 1984 round of testing.  Because of the reduced provision for disease eradication in that year, testing of herds for both TB and brucellosis was conducted on a selective basis.  A testing strategy was devised which combined the monitoring of the disease situation in the national herd with intensified testing of herds in areas of high disease prevalence.</P>
      <P>The Government's national plan 1985-87 provides for a full round of testing for both TB and brucellosis in each of the three years covered by the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last Thursday I was commenting on some questions raised by members of the Opposition in relation to the amendments proposed in the Bill regarding the scheme.  I think subject to correction, that I mentioned that the Bill dealing with unit trusts had been circulated and that we hoped to have it on the Order Paper next week. As I said, that will allow the funds to carry out advertising and I expect that will give added impetus to activity under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the designated funds themselves, in reply to some questions <Col N="864" /> from the other side of the House I wish to point out there is no lower limit on amounts that may be invested in designated investment funds but the funds themselves, for their own internal administrative reasons, may put a lower limit on amounts going in.  However, that is a matter for the funds themselves.  They are not constrained to act in that way by anything in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised a question in relation to the period of retention of investments.  He thought it was too long and he considered investors should be able to cash in their investments in qualifying companies after two years.  He suggested that we should encourage investors to buy and sell shares in those companies.  On both points I would have fairly serious reservations.  The scheme is intended to get the necessary seed finance into qualifying companies.  We do not want to have a situation where the funds could flow out of a company again fairly readily.  In essence we want the equity to be locked into the company for as long as it takes the company to get into a position in which it can successfully begin trading and make progress in its chosen niche in the market.  It was with that in mind that the provisions of the 1984 Finance Act were framed.</P>
    <P>If there is a situation in which a company can itself raise money on the stock market or on the unlisted securities market, by definition, that is not the kind of company we have in mind in this scheme here.  As I said both last year and this year, the scheme was targeted at the provision of finance for companies which would not otherwise be able to raise the kind of capital they require.  Companies that can get a quotation on the unlisted securities market and, of course, even more, companies that are quoted in the normal way on the stock exchange have another avenue by which they can raise funds, have other means of gaining access to equity and, therefore, would not need the benefit of this scheme.  Whatever is the situation with which we are dealing, whatever the position of companies applying for this, we must recognise that <Col N="865" /> the supply of venture capital is not unlimited. To the extent that a scheme such as this would be broadened, the inevitable effect of doing so beyond the kinds of limits we sought in the 1984 Finance Act would direct funds away from the companies that need this kind of equity most towards those which have other means of raising funds.  Therefore a broadening of the scheme would go directly counter to its objective which I think I can fairly say is shared by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy O'Kennedy who spoke of the alleged difficulty that advisers to companies and to potential investors have in working their way through what he chooses to call the gobbledygook of the provisions of the 1984 Act.  That is a grand word to use if one wants to have a go at a scheme like this.  Deputy O'Kennedy is probably fairly familiar with the provisions of the 1984 Finance Act.  If one examines them very closely&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one will very quickly find that in any particular case one would not have to go through all of the provisions because not all of them would apply in any given case.  Therefore, it is a little disingenuous to pretend that in each and every case the investor or his advisers would have to go in detail, line by line, through the provisions of that Act.</P>
      <P>I think I have a great deal more appreciation and respect for the ability of investment advisers and accountants than Deputy O'Kennedy appears to have.  It seems to me that, once one has been through it once, then there is no great difficulty in going through it again, applying the provisions or assessing their impact on any specific investment proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the length of the provisions of the 1984 Act in itself presents an obstacle.  There is ample evidence of the fact that accountants and investment advisers of one kind or another can fairly quickly familiarise <Col N="866" /> themselves with far more complex legislation, indeed seem fairly quickly to familiarise themselves with the whole <i>corpus</i> of the given year's Finance Act, finding their way through it very readily.</P>

      <P>They are, of course, making money out of it.  They are in business to provide a service and if they can get people to pay for it, the best of luck to them.  I am not impressed by arguments that contend that it takes a lot of time, money and so on to find one's way through these provisions.  That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have quite an amount of work facing us on this Finance Bill over the next few days.  If I cannot succeed in persuading the Minister on any one issue then I do not intend to repeat the arguments made.  If the Minister's mind is made up then we had better proceed to other issues.</P>
      <P>Before leaving this one, let me note the difference between the position of the Minister and Government and ourselves. Arising from what the Minister has said &mdash; and I want to make this very clear &mdash; there is a very sharp difference between the Government approach to venture capital and the Fianna Fáil approach. What the Minister said in the House today demonstrates that fairly clearly. Among other things the Minister has said that the purpose of this scheme is to ensure that equity capital will be locked into the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in response to the case I made to reduce the retention period so as to encourage investors to participate in this new scheme.  If the Minister genuinely believes that one will encourage investors by locking their equity capital into companies for a fixed period, as he demonstrates in this Bill, then he is ignoring the reality of those <Col N="867" /> interested in equity participation.  They are not interested in having their money locked into any scheme without being able to release it except on terms determined by the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister or his officials.  They are interested in seeking a tax break &mdash; that is what it is &mdash; for investment in industry or services that badly need it.  It is time we generated that climate here, as it has been generated elsewhere.  Clearly what we need is a new climate for investment and participation in equity particularly through a venture capital scheme.  The Minister, in introducing it, has not the courage or the imagination really to promote venture capital in the way that its real potential would be realised.  If it is locked in, that is a guarantee that nobody has ever opened the door in the first instance in order that it may be locked in, in the final analysis.</P>
      <P>The Minister demonstrated also, in the course of the Second Stage debate &mdash; here again there is a dramatic and sharp difference between the Government and Fianna Fáil on this issue &mdash; that he is not concerned with those who are not in the risk area.  He made that clear in his Second Stage speech.  According to the Minister this is not to be used by groups who can find other sources of funding.  Is the Minister not aware that the biggest problem confronting native industry at present is in raising equity capital participation through investment?  As has been demonstrated in the last two years in particular, unfortunately the vast bulk of them have had to have recourse to borrowings through the banks.  The cost of funding such borrowings has brought a very considerable number of them to their knees.  The Minister does not have to look any further than the agencies of Government &mdash; Fóir Teoranta, the Industrial Credit Company, the IDA, even the most informal and casual consultations with the banks, never mind the Dun and Bradstreet growing list of liquidations, to discover that the major problem confronting the domestic sector is accumulating and providing the necessary capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Last year when this was announced I thought that this was a way out.  I thought that for once we would be wholeheartedly agreeing with the Government in this measure because the promotion of venture capital is necessary, as I have demonstrated and is being done elsewhere.  It is occurring in the United States, Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany, where even trade unionists are venture capitalists.  They have a real stake in the success of the economy.  I thought we were going to merge into that reality but instead the heavy hand of bureaucracy has been laid on it and the Minister, in the cold detached way of his which does not seem to be related to the reality and need outside, is again imposing many conditions.  It is fine to say that if one reads through the 26 pages issued last year it will all become simple at the end of the day.  Has one the time to read it closely?</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wishes to misrepresent me in that way she is free to do so.  What I said was that a potential investor was not interested in having to read through 26 pages of a Finance Act that has so many qualifications, limitations and restrictions, before knowing whether he should place his £500 or £1,000.  An investor wants to know if the scheme encourages investment in venture capital.  He would be able to make a measured judgment on the fund being promoted.  He would use his business judgment to see if there would be a profit for him in the venture and a means of making a major contribution to the much needed equity in Irish native industry.  If those signals are clearly there such an investor will get going but if they are not &mdash; they were not last year and are not now &mdash; he will not invest.  I made that point to illustrate the sharp difference between the Government and Fianna Fáil on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who knows, whether it is international or domestic capital, the <Col N="870" /> basis on which investment capital is channelled will be aware that the one thing one does not do is to tell people that if they invest they will be locked in.  A way out must be provided.  It is my belief that Deputies Bruton and Yates, and others, share that view.  I should like to comment on what I see as unnecessary limitations. The limitation to the manufacturing sector and to what one might call Shannon-type services, and the computer service area generally, raises a sharp distinction between the approach of the Government and Fianna Fáil.  The construction industry have publicly pleaded to be included in this programme.  We have supported that plea.  In fact, I was in advance of them last year when, on behalf of my party, I made that plea in the course of the debate.  The construction industry meets the criteria set by the Minister in terms of a risk venture because, obviously, it is in a depressed state and represents a great risk for those involved.  In that case it should be used as an incentive to invest.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that most major construction companies are not investing here?  Smaller companies do not have the funds to invest because of VAT and other restrictions imposed by the Government. The consequence is that they are short of capital.  If one checks with bank managers one will realise that construction companies are in a state of total depression. They cannot meet charges on their borrowings. If we want to lift them out of this we should look at that area.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector, hopefully and belatedly, will get a boost this year.  If it does not we will be the only economy in western Europe that will not get a boost. It is worth investing in that industry.</P>

      <P>The extraordinary <Col N="871" /> thing that has happened in the tourism industry is that at a time when all the advantages should be in our favour because of the depreciation of our currency against the dollar, for which we are paying dearly in other directions through the Minister's ill-advised borrowing programme, we have not been compensated by a huge growth of tourists from the US.  I accept that this year there are encouraging signs of an increase over last year's figure.  There would need to be.  I must put on record that even the ethnic Irish-American community have not been coming here but have been overflying to France, Italy and other European countries.  I met them last year in Europe. Last year, and the previous year, we erected the barriers.  Deputy Owen may choose to smile at that news.</P>

      <P>On two occasions I paid two official visits to Europe.  On the first occasion I went to address the University Institute in Florence and on the second occasion I travelled to Brussels. Even in Brussels, which is not noted as a tourist trap, Irish-Americans were there in greater numbers than in Ireland. The remainder of my holidays were spent in Connemara, as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential is great this year but if we want to give a real boost to tourism, to provide the facilities that are necessary to reach our full potential, from the Hook in Wexford to the North-west of Donegal, we can do it.  As Seán Lemass saw some years ago, it is time for a new signal and new optimism.  There are very few things we can turn to now except our own resources and tourism is one of them. However, the Minister refuses to include tourism in this area.  I do not see why he <Col N="872" /> does that.  He has said that it would be all too broad and if we broaden it it would go towards a conclusion directly counter to the intention.  I would have thought that the Minister in introducing the scheme last year had hoped to make a whopping great success of it and the broader it became the happier he would be.  He does not seem to have made up his mind on that.  The result is that, like last year, we will be surrounded by limitations, qualifications, restrictions, ifs, buts and whatever.  At the end of the year the result will not be much better than it was last year.  The Minister will not be able to say that the scheme will qualify only for tax breaks from early January.</P>
    <P>It appears that I am speaking for the record because I do not think I will persuade the Minister to change his mind.  I wish I could.  If I managed to persuade him to change it would be as much in his interest and in the interest of the economy.  If the Minister has decided that that is it there is little point in going further about the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy does not seem to be getting the message that there is a fairly specific aim to this scheme, with which he agrees.  But before getting on to that I will repeat for the benefit of the House the remarks I made at the beginning of our discussion on this amendment.  What has been brought about so far, bearing in mind that the tax relief came into operation only for applications made after 1 January this year, is that we have two investment funds designated.  Ten companies have applied for authorisation to issue certificates to subscribers where the amount of investment is around £1½ million; 20 companies have applied for outline approval for investment and at the last count there were 32 cases where inquiries were made about various aspects of the scheme.  If Deputy O'Kennedy is worried about advice being made available to people to bring them through the terms of the scheme, the Revenue Commissioners provide a full advisory service to anybody who wishes to have any provision of the scheme clarified.  Quite a number of <Col N="873" /> people now involved in qualifying investments have taken that advice and used that facility being made available by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy does not like the idea of investors being locked in for a period.  This is where the difference emerges and it is a difference of emphasis rather than anything else.  I am concerned principally with developing the productive capacity of the companies and with developing their capacity to employ people.  Deputy O'Kennedy puts the accent more on the investor.  A very revealing remark that he made was that investors want a tax break for investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not misrepresent me.  It is too serious for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy O'Kennedy gets excited, I appreciate that point but the emphasis in drawing up the scheme had to be on getting the funds into companies where it will improve the productive capacity of the companies and increase employment.  In any scheme like this a balance must be struck between the interests of the investor and the interests of the company in which investment is taking place.  The balance we struck in the scheme in last year's Finance Act was in favour of the company where the investment was taking place.  That is appropriate, and it does not take away from the fact that I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy's contention that we must have regard for the situation of the investor. We have produced a very attractive scheme for the investor.  If an investor in the 60 per cent tax band subscribes £10,000 in a company, the tax relief is £6,000 so the investor is getting a £10,000 investment for £4,000.  That is a perfectly adequate response to the concern of the investor.  Deputy O'Kennedy does not like the idea of capital being locked in and he referred to firms who have difficulty in raising equity and are obliged to borrow funds for their development.  I can understand Deputy O'Kennedy's concern but for a company, there is not all that much <Col N="874" /> difference between borrowed funds and venture capital that comes in for a short period of a couple of years and is then withdrawn.  The company is no further ahead.  The scheme had to strike a balance between the interests of the investor and the interests of the company.  One could conclude that if anything, we struck the balance in favour of the company while bearing in mind that the tax relief for the investor is a worthwhile relief.</P>
      <P>It is not true as Deputy O'Kennedy has alleged that I am not concerned about the position of companies that are not in the risk area or who do not come within the terms of the scheme.  They have other means of raising capital that are not available to the kinds of companies we have in mind whether they are new companies or expansions of other companies.  They have other avenues of access to funds.  If they were brought under the scope of the scheme they are more likely to suck off a large proportion of the funds available than the new companies or the expansions of companies that we have provided for in this Bill.  At the end of the day the argument boils down to the really important objective of the scheme which is to get new activity going.  The most effective way to ensure that available capital, stimulated by the tax break provided for, goes into the area we want most developed is through this scheme implemented in last year's Act with the modifications provided for in the amendment we are now discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest what the Minister put forward as being my opinion is taken to be my opinion, I would make it clear that it is not and that I am well capable of expressing my opinion.  The Minister put it too neatly when he said that I was concerned only for the investor and that he is concerned for employment. That is not true.  It is because this scheme is concerned with the investment provisions and regulations that I addressed myself to the investment aspect.  I hope I demonstrated to the Minister that the only real interest, at the end of the day, is the generation of employment.  To create <Col N="875" /> employment we must generate investment. The level of investment over the last ten years but particularly over the last three or four years has been dropping drastically.  The only way to guarantee even the maintenance of employment, not to speak about generating new employment is to create a new atmosphere of investment.  That has been accepted by economists and businessmen over the last two years.  What we lack is an investment climate, without which the jobs will not follow.  I assure the Minister that I am at least as concerned if not more concerned about employment than the Minister.  Our respective records will show whose opinion was more correct having regard to the employment trends for 1984 and 1985.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to work on the basis that venture capital, if it was to be freely negotiable and exchanged, would leave the potential promoter in the same position as if he had borowed from the bank.  It is usually the case, the Minister said, that when venture capital is withdrawn it leaves the promoter perhaps in a worse position than if he had borrowed his funds from the bank.  I am not talking about a situation where it is withdrawn completely.  I want to see it being a matter of marketable, negotiable, commercial activity where people will buy and sell the shares that follow here. It is unreal on the Minister's part to say that if it is not locked in it will be pulled out completely.  Create a market for venture capital so that those who may not have gone in on the first day can get into that market on the next day.  If the Minister does not accept my view I must abide by that, but I adhere to it strongly.</P>
      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Minister.  We tend to pick on words and then to represent the words used for our own purposes, but when the Minister says that the other companies have other means of raising capital from the kind of scheme he has in mind here I begin to question what kind of companies the Minister is thinking of.  Is he thinking of only those who can get finance from no other source at all?</P>

      <P>Is he thinking of those whose risk activities are of such dimension that a normal prudent investor would not want to know about them?  Must they be that way before they will be considered for this scheme?  I am glad it is not so because the Minister has tended to convey the impression that these sections are concerned only with companies who are really at risk, really short of capital and can get it from nowhere else.  Normal bona fide trading companies who could do with an extra injection of venture capital in which people would like to participate do not seem to be included at least in the Minister's mind even if they are included in the scheme.  If they are included, why the restrictions?  Before you can qualify for this scheme must you prove that you are on your last legs, that you can get it from no other souce except at a high rate from the bank?  If that is not his intention, then I still do not see why the restrictions and qualifications are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a major problem of venture capital in this country or, as it is commonly called, vulture capital.  The Belfield report, as it came to be called, was leaked in relation to the problems of many small companies.  Their biggest problem was that they were under-capitalised and overdependent on loan capital for raising finances.  Therefore these interest charges strangled them. The State's response to that has been firstly through the establishment of the NEA who have a role in venture capital but over the years that role has seemed very limited.  It seems to be totally zoning in on high technology projects and does not meet the venture capital needs.  When the Minister introduced this expansion of business development scheme last year it was welcomed but I think there was general misapprehension because many people in industry said that the scheme was not working or was not getting off the ground during 1984 when the operative date was 1 January this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> I welcome the Minister's amendments here because they deal with some of the major complaints that have issued.  The previous clause relating to families provided for limitations on the qualifying companies who could reap the benefits of these types of investments and relatives of the investor would not avail of it.  I understand that brothers and sisters will now be eligible for it and I welcome this provision.  Recently a gentleman contacted me.  His brother had a company which qualifies for export sales relief and that man will benefit by this.  However, I hope the Minister will clarify the operational date of this.  Was it the beginning of this tax year or 1 January this year? Parents of sons and daughters do not benefit from this.  Consider the liability that can arise in relation to capital acquisitions tax when transfers without any appreciation of wealth take place within a family.  In the normal course of handing on a family business from father to son surely it would be reasonable when, as is the case, the younger generation have ideas for expanding the business that they could avail of this also, given the £25,000 per annum limit.</P>
    <P>Another objective of these amendments is to deal with the administrative expenses that the managers of these designated funds have.  Apparently there has been some caution about some of these trustee designated funds that the expenses would not be sufficient to allow them to be really interested in this and thus ensure that we would get the best type of expertise.  The amendments do not state what the percentage of the expenses would be.  I see that a deed of trust would be arranged between the investor and the designated fund manager. Is this envisaged to be 3 per cent, 8 per cent, or what sort of figure are we talking about?  Deputy O'Kennedy and the Minister seemed to be at issue over the question of these funds being locked in.  Deputy O'Kennedy in his last intervention seemed to be having an each way bet on this.  He said that he did not want the investor not to have the flexibility to pull the funds out but at the same time he was not suggesting that the company <Col N="878" /> who were having these funds invested in the company would lose out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>More important is the company. After all, the investors are doing this because they are getting a mighty tax break on it, up to 60p in the £ perhaps. The purpose of this whole scheme is not to give attractive investment opportunities to compete with gilts or whatever. The point of it is to get equity into companies who otherwise cannot get it in. Knowing something about a number of small companies, I suggest that three years is the minimum period for which they would want these funds.  If they have a programme of financing either in the start up or the expansion phase and if there is a withdrawal of equity, then the rug is pulled from under them.  I am not saying that Deputy O'Kennedy suggests that that would happen, but it would create great nervousness among these small companies who would be reaping the benefit of these types of investments. Three years is a very short time in financial planning for a small business, given that equity is cheaper than loan financing in many respects and that these share-holdings will have no preferential status. It is pure risk equity.  I suggest that three years be a minimum because if equity was pulled out in less than three years there <Col N="879" /> would be no point in going to the bank and you could only call for the receiver or the liquidator.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy on one point regarding tourism.  Recently the Joint Committee on Small Businesses carried out a detailed examination of the tourism sector.  No case overall can be made for tourism for this scheme but a case can be made for hotels.  I ask the Minister that in future years when these designated funds are up and running he will look again at this.  We have section 84 loans, ICC loans, AIB moneys and so on and it seems that the hotel sector has lost out.  Something like 60 hotels have closed over the last several years and there have been rationalisation programmes in others.  It is estimated in the annual Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley report on the hotel sector that the rate of return on capital invested in hotels is down to 1.4 per cent.  This is a vicious circle because if the profits are not there, there is not the capacity to reinvest, then standards drop and bed occupancy drops and order books decline.  We must remember that hotels mostly attract the tourists with a lot of money to spend and have a greater proportion of overseas revenue through tourism.  If one of the qualifying conditions for manufacturing industry is an export related factor, one could equally argue a long term case for hotels.  I would like to see the Minister, in years to come, travelling that road.</P>

      <P>I do not think I will have to depend on Deputy O'Kennedy.  I am glad the Minister has recognised the special needs of research and development. We are behind in this area.  We are greatly dependent on multinationals for research and development.  As a percentage of gross national product we spend something like 1.2 per cent on research and development.  This is an appallingly <Col N="880" /> low figure because many of our European competitors spend at least five times that amount.  I hope we will eventually move in the direction of the Small Business Institute of Research in the United States where they have very complex and sophisticated techniques for assisting universities and research institutions with technological problems in the work place. I am glad this is being considered, especially in the start-up period, allowing the necessary two year time span for the company to get started.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister given any consideration to the stock exchange and their damning failure to develop small business stocks?  It might be possible to use a scheme like this to bring this about.</P>
      <P>To date, all small companies are totally dependent on the banking sector for capital and steps like this are moving towards the venture capital area for equity.  However, there is a specific need for small businesses to be able to raise money on the stock exchange through the punter or the financial institutions, pension funds and so on.  In the Government's discussions with the stock exchange, would they seek to introduce equities or small business stock for a particular segment of the market and in order to encourage investors, would they consider some form of tax relief in that area?</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for removing some of the red tape restrictions on this scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Yates in welcoming the relaxation of this scheme. <Col N="881" /> It is great to see a Minister come back into this House to relax the provisions of a scheme which he introduced earlier and finds that people have not been using a scheme which was designed in good faith, for nefarious purposes.  We might not like the fact that it was a bit restrictive last year, but the Minister is relaxing it this year and it has not been exploited in such a way which will damage the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the brother and sister provision, but why is it necessary to retain the restriction that a person cannot become connected with a company within a five year period? A logical way of approaching venture capital is to have people who would be bringing managerial expertise, experience, contacts and so on to the company and not just money.  I do not fully understand why it is necessary to prevent someone becoming closely connected with the company as time goes on.  The 1984 Bill restricts that area.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that because that is an area which could be relaxed without causing damage to the scheme.</P>
      <P>The relaxation in respect of research and development is welcome.  The Minister has extended the start-up date from two to three years if 80 per cent of the money is going to research and development. As Deputy Yates said, this is a big weakness in some of our companies because it takes time for a company to evolve an idea to start-up date and there are funding needs at an early stage.  I would almost question whether there is any need for a year's restriction to be put on it because people are hardly likely to invest funds in research and development unless they hope to see a company at the end of it.  I cannot see that allowing them even four years, as in this case, would do any great damage.  If the plan flops they will lose their money.  Therefore I do not think the extension would be damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to look at the possibility <Col N="882" /> of a scheme such as this applying to services other than those which have the 10 per cent designated manufacturing rate. There are a number of smaller scale services which are, perhaps, equally valuable to the economy and certainly valuable in the sense of providing employment.  The old argument as to why manufacturing was singled out was that it was the productive base and that once you expanded the productive base other things could build on top of it, and that gave it its primacy.  But there are many services other than the international traded services that could be regarded in a similar light.  It would be logical for the Minister to look at scheduling in-services year by year that could also qualify.  The tourist industry is obviously one that directly earns foreign exchange but there are other services which might equally have that attraction.</P>
    <P>I understand the present legislation bars the possibility of converting a loan into equity where a relative has put up loan capital at low interest to his son, brother or sister to get a business going. I realise this would probably bring in an element of retrospection and that people would be qualifying for this relief even though they invested prior to the date, but he could look at the fact that some relatives might have put money in quite recently and set a date beyond which they would not permit this.  The investors who might be setting up a relatively small scheme seem to go for loan capital first and I wonder if it would be possible to allow such a conversion or would the possible abuses offset the value of such a concession?</P>

      <P>As far as the extension of the class of person is concerned, as raised by Deputy Yates, the provisions of this amendment extend the availability of this facility to husbands, wives, ancestors, lineal descendants and brothers and sisters of those who are running the company, so it covers the family members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to management expenses, we have removed any restriction on charges that may be made by a designated fund.  The 1984 Act placed limitations on <Col N="883" /> charges made on the way into the fund and on the way out but did not make any specification as to the level of day to day management charges.  The effect of the amendment we are now discussing is to remove those two stipulations in regard to the level of charges, which means that there is now no legal requirement or specification as to the level of charges.  However, where a fund is making a charge&mdash; and funds will always make charges &mdash; we require that that should be specified in the agreement entered into with the investor so that the investor knows when he puts his money into a designated fund just what he is getting into in terms of the charges made on his money on the way in, on the administration and on any interest or dividend that may be due to him from the fund.  There is no specification, however, of the level of charges once this amendment is made.</P>
    <P>In relation to companies which benefit from this scheme then going to the market, I must point out, as I did last year, that, given the kind of company we have in mind, it seems that one of the first moves a company of that type would make if it were going for a quotation would be to participate in the unlisted securities market.  There is already a provision in the rules governing that market that a company should be trading for three years before they can participate. As I said when bringing in this scheme last year, that seems to fit in reasonably well.  To put it the other way round, the scheme fits in reasonably well with that particular requirement.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the situation in relation to hotels is quite as Deputy Yates outlined.  Specifically, hotels and the tourist business generally are not completely cut out of any of the schemes he mentioned.  There is a capital scheme for tourism development with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar.  However, we are not discussing that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of the possible conversion of loan capital to equity and the fact that many small businesses go in the first instance for loan capital rather than equity.  The latter, of <Col N="884" /> course, is the case and has been the case up to now because there did not seem to be a proper vehicle available for the attraction of equity into smaller companies. This scheme is a means whereby I hope we will be able to ensure that there is a flow of equity capital into smaller companies.  If this scheme is used to the extent available we should see a movement of smaller companies away from loan capital and into equity capital of this nature.</P>
    <P>However, this problem has been identified fairly clearly in recent years.  It is not simply a matter of making an equity vehicle available to small companies. There is also the problem of preparedness among the owners of small companies to accept equity capital from outside.  That should be less of a problem now with this scheme since we have allowed relatives into it.  Nevertheless, there is some evidence that the owners of small Irish companies appear to be over reluctant to have their ownership of the company diluted by having equity participation from outside. I think there would be agreement on all sides of the House that, to the extent that we can do it, we should encourage people to move away from that line of thinking, understandable though it is.</P>
    <P>On the specific question of the conversion of loan capital to equity, I wish Deputy Bruton to understand that I would not like to be drawn too far into an analysis of what the mechanisms might be.  I am sure he can see a way in which the result he desired could be brought about and I do not want to go into it in detail here.  For the moment, the less said about it the better.  We have made the adjustments to the scheme which were necessary and I will not go any further than that.</P>
    <P>On the question of allowing investors to sell the shares that they take up in a company in a shorter period than is provided for in the Bill, we would then have to provide, following Deputy O'Kennedy's suggestion, that the relief available on the investment would in some way be transferred to the second buyer.  That would require, logically, the <Col N="885" /> withdrawal of the relief from the first buyer and a qualification of the second buyer for further relief.  The provisions needed to give effect to that would probably be even more counter-productive and more worthy of the description of gobbledygook than anything contained in the 1984 Act.  I do not see that it would be particularly productive for companies. If people want to become investors it is far better for the companies involved to be first time investors in an expansion of a company or in a new company of the kind for which we have provided rather than using up their investing capabilities by simply stepping into the shoes of people who have already invested.  Basically, we are talking about the expansion of the pool of investment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised the question of when the access to benefit begins for family members.  The amendment simply provides that the relevant sections of the 1984 Act should be amended by the additions in the amendment before us.  This would mean that anybody who is now thinking of investing would become eligible to apply for the relief.  Strictly speaking it applies from 6 April.  Since there is now an extension of the period, anybody getting involved from here on in those categories would qualify for the relief straight away on qualifying investments. That should take care of Deputy Yates' concern which I understand would allow an expansion of the investment pool.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his answers to the various points raised.  I am glad to hear about the family situations. He asked me to reflect further on the capital schemes which are available for hotels.  As far as I can remember, the AIB Finance for the hotel sector in 1983 was something around £5 million. Through Bord Fáilte there has been a substantial erosion of the capital grants schemes.  Now only shower units or bathrooms are catered for.  Since the time when there was a decorating and development scheme, the position has got substantially worse as regards State funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that there would be difficulties <Col N="886" /> in widening the scope of the scheme.  One point has to be borne in mind.  Surely there should be some form of priority for capital intensive sectors which by their nature have a capital problem and require venture capital.  There are precedents in other countries for doing this for hotels which have in excess of 50 per cent overseas revenue.  There are various different mechanisms for narrowing it down to an export emphasis.  The Minister also mentioned the mis-match between the investor and the small business fund.  I strongly endorse that.  If a company has a really good idea the banks or the designated funds want 51 per cent, but the company does not want to give them anything.  If it is a middling to bad idea, it is <i>vice versa</i>.  The company is prepared to give away 51 per cent but the banks do not want to know.  A mechanism could be established at local level so that we could have local investment in local businesses.</P>
    <P>On the question of the administrative expenses the Minister explained fully the way the change in the operating expenses works.  I understand there is no control. Is it envisaged that there would be a rule of thumb as regards what would be reasonable expenses in this regard?  I know they will be established in a deed of trust but, from the investor's point of view, the attractiveness of the designated funds would very according to the administrative expenses.  Obviously it will not operate on a cartel basis and there will be competition between the designated funds.  I wonder should the rate of expenses they can draw be subject to some form of scrutiny.  There is a balance to be drawn between the rights of the investors and the needs of the administrators of the funds in regard to the work that will have to be done to seek out suitable ventures, suitable enterprises and suitable companies and the expenses they will have to incur.  I should like to see that done.</P>
    <P>On the question of research and development and the NEA, does the Minister envisage that a time will come when, if the State has a venture capital organisation, the general public should have a right to invest?  I lost the gist of what the <Col N="887" /> Minister was saying.  Do I take it that there is nothing in the Act to say that loans cannot be converted into equity under the present arrangement?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask one or two questions.  Like my two colleagues I also welcome the improvements the Minister is introducing in section 13.  Contrary to the impression Deputy O'Kennedy would like to give, I think everyone in the House welcomed the introduction of this scheme in last year's Finance Bill. It behoves us to welcome any improvements that can be made.  The wisdom of crawling before we ran is now seen.  The Minister is learning from the English experience and the implementation of the scheme in the past year.</P>
      <P>I welcome the widening of the scope to include relatives.  I want the Minister's assurance that he is satisfied that this will not lead to evasion of taxation.  Can he assure the House that the administration of this element will be tightly controlled? When the Government have shown their commitment to closing off as many loopholes as possible, we must ensure that, in widening the scope to include relatives, we do not introduce a new avoidance area.  I am sure the Minister can re-assure me on that point and that this will not happen.</P>
      <P>This is a necessary amendment.  As a country we have not got a great sort of attractiveness for venture capital.  At the start of the scheme the people most likely to invest money in a small business getting off the ground are probably relatives and people close to the person running the business.  They would have more confidence in the person than somebody from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the improvement of the scheme will encourage our universities and third level colleges to look at how we can encourage research and development based businesses.  Generally speaking, all the research and development work in Ireland is carried on in subsidiaries of large American companies.  I hope that, with the availability of this venture capital scheme, we will spread out and try <Col N="888" /> to have more research and development type businesses available for people to invest in.  People have money which they would like to invest in Ireland for Irish production.  I hope the universities and the third level colleges will inform themselves on the availability of this venture capital scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fact that there is now no limit on what can be charged by fund managers, I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about the range of charges he thinks might be made.  An open-ended opportunity for fund managers could be a stumbling block.  People might be discouraged.  I realise that the amendment refers to ones specified in the deed of trust.  Obviously there will be a good deal of competition to encourage investment of venture money.  It would be desirable that some expected ceiling should at least be known so that potential investors would not decide at the end to pull out.

If we were to follow his logic, he is giving out about what the Minister has not done and what improvements he has not brought in.  I wonder is he saying it would be better if we did not have the scheme at all unless it was absolutely ideal, and unless we did all the things he says need to be done. Perhaps some time in the next century he <Col N="889" /> will have the opportunity of making these changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is an effort to make the scheme as workable as possible.  There is no point pretending that following the introduction of a scheme all the necessary elements for the creation of a climate that encourages investment will simply fall into place. People need time to overcome the barrier of investing in this kind of venture.  We need the motivated entrepreneurs who are prepared to take the risk and what we are talking of is a gamble.  Therefore, we must create a climate that would encourage people to invest in the scheme. First, of course, we must find people who have money to invest.  There has been a growth in the number of private companies prepared to manage venture capital programmes and time is needed for them, too, to gain the experience required.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and others also referred to one area that is giving rise for concern.  This is the whole area of the manner of exiting after the five year period.  There is the question of exit from the scheme, regardless of whether the project works.  If the Minister has not referred to this point already perhaps he will elucidate for us.  The scheme will work if given a chance and if it is not knocked too often by people who should know better.  If Deputy O'Kennedy were Minister at this time, he would be likely to be introducing this type of scheme and one could only hope that he would be as enlightened as is our Minister in terms of amending the scheme and in having the courage to say that faults had come to light which must be rectified.</P>

      <P>Deputies Yates and Owen raised questions as to the level of fees to be charged.  Last year I took the view that there was a case for providing for a certain minimal level of prescription and of protection of investors but the weight of the opinions that have been expressed to me since then, both in the House and elsewhere, has been to the effect that on the whole there has been a need for this. No rule of thumb will be specified for the level of charges.  We will allow the market to fix a level of charges.  It will be a case of <i>caveat emptor</i> but we would expect the buyer in this case to be enlightened enough to shop around as between different funds.  I hope they will have a wider range of choice in relation to funds than is the case now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked if we might ever have a State venture capital organisation. The implied question to follow that is whether in that case it would fit in with the scheme we are discussing.  I am tempted to take the easy way out and say that the sort of scheme the Deputy has in mind is not included either in the Bill or in the amendment but suffice it to say that for the moment the question is hypothetical.  The provision here is for a limited term and we shall have to consider the situation when that term has expired and assess the matter at that point.</P>
      <P>In relation to the participation of relatives, I am concerned to ensure that the scheme would not become a means of tax avoidance.  Where a relative is also an employee of the company, the provisions of the 1984 Act for countering tax avoidance schemes and abuse would apply.  In particular I mention section 21 of the Act.</P>

      <P>One can think of much better reasons for becoming a parent, for instance, than qualifying for tax relief.  Both Deputies Bruton and Owen referred to the matter of the conversion of loans.  There is provision in the Act whereby the capacity that people might have for converting loans into equity is limited.  One of the reasons for this is that we do not wish to bring about a situation in which creditors of a company could convert their loans into equity in order to be given a tax break in the event of a company failing and in which case the Exchequer would have to bear part of the cost that the people concerned otherwise would have to bear.  That would not be a legitimate use of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment because it closes off a loophole but an opportunity is being missed to deal with a glaring anomaly in the area of income derived from the services of stallions. The income from thoroughbred stallions, such as racers owned by Robert Sangster and the sheiks &mdash; and the best of good luck to them, because I am not a begrudger &mdash; is free of income tax.  That is part of the attraction in bringing these stallions here.  I understand that the purpose of this ministerial amendment is to <Col N="893" /> tighten up so that stallions abroad could not benefit.  An anomaly, however, arises.  I am particularly puzzled by the reference to &ldquo;part owner of a stallion&rdquo; which occurs on line one of subsection (2) and also further down.</P>
      <P>Some of my constituents who have a long tradition in the horsebreeding industry and represent the backbone of that industry have draught Irish mares and breed them to thoroughbred stallions, thus producing the half-bred or threequarter-bred.  These horses are used for show jumping and hunting and form a very substantial part of our horse export industry.  One of my constituents who has a few mares has leased a stallion from Bord na gCapall.  That lease goes back many years because it was originally taken out with the Department of Agriculture. In putting forward a case for tightening up, surely it is anomalous that someone who has leased a stallion for very many years should be treated differently from someone who owns a stallion. Bord na gCapall are the State horse board.  They are trying their best, on a limited and further curtailed budget, to promote our horse industry, especially with regard to half-bred horses.  They are continually up against different pressures of grant schemes and so on and premiums which must be withdrawn.  Surely it would be cost-effective, instead of giving that board the extra money which they seek, to change the Finance Act so that people who have stallions leased from Bord na gCapall which are thoroughbreds of the highest quality should be treated exactly the same as Robert Sangster is treated?  To look at it from an equity point of view, my constituents who are operating small time to farmers' mares and only charging perhaps a £400 or £100 stallion fee are more deserving than those charging £100,000 or for whom a nomination costs $½ million.  How is it that the existing Act is interpreted in such a way that these people cannot avail of exemption from income tax on their stallion income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as the specific wording in this Bill is &ldquo;part owner&rdquo; surely that term <Col N="894" /> is wide enough to cover the point of leasehold interest, as in the case of my constituent? With regard to this constituent, the Revenue Commissioners have gone back ten years and withdrawn all exemption allowances.  He has other forms of income, employs an accountant and is paying income tax and on his tax assessment form for this year was written &ldquo;allowance withdrawn&rdquo; for the first time. Perhaps I am mistaken and this has nothing to do with the Department of Finance or with this House.  Perhaps it is a new interpretation which the Revenue Commissioners have taken of a certain Act.  I suspect, going on various communications which I have had with them, that their interpretation is legally binding.  I do not wish to be difficult about this matter but perhaps on this Stage or Report Stage the Minister might consider those who are doing a lot for our horse industry which is export-orientated and who have not a large income and see that they be treated equitably.  There is a confused idea that the half-bred or the thoroughbred is the reason for the problem, but that is not the problem.  We are talking here about thoroughbred stallions which have been leased.  If it cannot be done this year, I hope that in future years the Department of Finance will get together with Bord na gCapall and the Revenue Commissioners to examine this matter to see if small farmers providing a service to farmers with one mare are given the same tax exemptions as the Robert Sangsters, the Maktoun family and the many sheiks and Arabian princes.</P>

      <P>The case to which Deputy Yates referred concerns stallions that are leased from Bord na gCapall.  The original provision governing this release is section 18 (2) of the Finance Act, 1969.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Yates and to the House, in case there is any misunderstanding, that the relief does not apply solely in the case of nominations which cost £100,000.  It can apply to cases where the nomination fee is very considerably less than that.  However, it applies where the person who is carrying on the trade is the owner of the stallion. It does not apply, and is not available, to the breeder in circumstances in which he is not the owner.  There are good reasons for so providing.</P>
      <P>I am bound to say that if there is a feeling that we should have a different type of treatment in relation to the cases which Deputy Yates has mentioned, it is more a problem for policy in relation to Bord na gCapall than a matter of tax law. The original relief, as I say, dates back to 1969.  It applies to persons who are the owners of stallions and use those to generate stud fees.  If the owner is Bord na gCapall, then this relief would not apply in the case of the breeder.  Nor would the reference in the amendment we have made to the section to part owners cover that because a leasholder could not be regarded as a part owner. The reference to part owner has been inserted both in relation to stallions and mares.  As the House knows, there are many cases where there are a number of partners either in stallions or in mares. We have inserted the reference to part owner because the common case is that a breeder here is not the exclusive owner of a stallion but is a part owner with a number of other breeders.  The same can apply to mares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the specific case mentioned by Deputy Yates, I do not think I am betraying any secrets when I say the Deputy has mentioned this case to me before now.  I am not sure exactly what is involved with regard to the inspection <Col N="897" /> of records going back for ten years.  Perhaps a relief was given in the mistaken belief that the person in question was the owner of stallions but if it now appears he was not then, of course, the liability would fall to be reviewed.  However, that is more properly a matter that could be dealt with bilaterally rather than in this Chamber.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to get into this discussion.  Our party do not have any strong feelings on the matter one way or the other and this is reflected in the fact that we have no amendments down.  However, I dislike the fact that here an excellent case was put forward by Deputy Yates but the Minister has done everything but answer the points put forward by the Deputy.  I agree with the Minister that legally a lessee cannot be characterised as a part owner but for the purpose of the point made by Deputy Yates I cannot see why a lessee should be distinguished either from an owner on the one hand or a part owner on the other hand.  It seems if there is some good economic or social reason for giving this relief, a case could be made for extending it as suggested by Deputy Yates.  I have not heard the Minister explain why there is a distinction between owners and breeders in this context.  I should like to hear the reason.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, I have spoken to him on this matter on many occasions and perhaps it was unreasonable of me to bring it up on the floor of the House.  The Minister said that it was Bord na gCapall who were at fault.  I took up this matter with them but they were totally unaware of the situation.  I was quite horrified at that but I realise that is not the fault or the business of the Minister.  However, it seems there is a gross lack of communication or there is misunderstanding in the Department of Finance in respect of our horse breeding policy.  I realise that in County Kildare there are some very important elements of our high quality racing industry but in Wexford perhaps we are in a more disadvantaged and poorer region than the sunny climes of Kildare.  I hope that the Department will iron out the problem which may not require legislative change.</P>
      <P>I accept completely the point made by the Minister about a part owner being a part of a syndicate.  I also accept the point about the allowance being withdrawn, that it could have been an administrative error, but I would point out that my constituent knows of other people who are leasing and who have not been affected in this way.  These people are no longer leasing.  The whole area seems to be one utter mess and perhaps the Department will take up the matter with Bord na gCapall and the Department of Agriculture and sort it out as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the general principle involved and the extension introduced by the Minister to cater for some new educational establishments. Some of them have come into existence fairly recently and others have acquired a considerable degree of importance in recent years.  The original scheme was contained in the 1973 Finance Act.  It must be understood that a grant on its own to one of these institutions will not allow tax relief to the person making the grant.  The section states that it must be:</P>
      <P>for the purpose of enabling the university or the approved body to undertake research in, or engage in the teaching of, approved subjects.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act of 1973 and the Minister's amendment in this case sets out the approved subjects as follows: (a) industrial relations, (b) marketing or (c) any other subject which is approved for the purposes of this section by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to know from the Minister if he <Col N="900" /> or his predecessors have approved any other subjects that would entitle a taxpayer to tax relief for the purpose of this section?  What is the mechanism whereby the Minister approves extra subjects to come into this category?  Where can a list of such subjects be found?  Does he not think there are other subjects, particularly in the technological area, which it would be worth bringing into the operation of the section?  Why is the tax relief in this section and in the relevant section in the 1973 Act confined to people who carry on a trade or profession?  Why is the PAYE person excluded from the operation of the scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The approved subjects as specified in the legislation are industrial relations, marketing or any other subject that may be approved by the Minister for Finance.  Grants in relation to a number of other subjects have been approved since 1973.  I will give the Deputy a list. They are business policy, engineering, social science research, psychiatry, adult and community education, business law, environmental studies, architecture, Irish history, biotechnology, transportation, electronic engineering, business studies and corporate planning.  Those are the ones that have been approved since 1973 under the provisions of the 1973 legislation.</P>
      <P>The reason that the provision applies only to persons carrying on a trade or profession is that at the time it seemed that this was a source from which particular courses in third level institutions might be supported because of a professional interest in the development of those subjects or skills in our third level institutions. It is intended as a means by which the business community, first of all, can identify a course for which there is a need and, second, assist in its promotion.</P>

      <P>The original proposal of the Minister in the budget for taxing building societies was at a rate of 85 per cent of the standard rate which I understand to be 29.75 per cent.  In this section the Minister has reduced that to 80 per cent of the standard rate, representing taxation of 28 per cent.  I presume the Minister's idea in this is to attempt to keep mortgage rates down by reducing the amount of tax take from the building societies.  The Minister should have adhered to his original decision of 85 per cent.  If he looks at the records of building societies he will see that they have had ample funds from which to increase their take &mdash; in other words, the take of the directors has been away in advance, in fact double, the rate of inflation in the past year and the year before.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have looked at that area before he reduced the tax take because, even with a tax take of 85 per cent of the standard rate, there would be no argument for increasing the mortgage rate.  The Minister should say to the building societies also that if they are worried about the tax rate and if they are prepared to give the Minister access to their records &mdash; I understand they have not agreed to this &mdash; so that he could get an accurate view of the approporiate rate, this would be the appropriate way in which to approach them.  If they contend that the tax is too high it is up to them to prove it.  Total access to their revenue and profits and the relevant amount taken by directors would all constitute relevant information for the Minister before deciding on what should be the appropriate rate.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the original budget proposals were adjusted following discussions which the Minister for the Environment and I had with the Building Societies' Association aimed at producing a formula which would keep to a minimum the increase in mortgage rates which the building societies said they required in order to maintain what they would regard as an adequate level of interest rate payable on their deposits. <Col N="904" /> The measures now provided for produce the same additional tax yield as I have provided for in my budget statement.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fees and emoluments paid by building societies which is a matter that should have been taken into consideration in relation to tax.  For example, the Irish Permanent Building Society, under &ldquo;Management Expenses&rdquo; have directors' emoluments down under fees &mdash; 1983, £75,700; 1984, £89,000, an increase of 18 per cent.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Other Emoluments&rdquo; there appear the figures of £233,037 in 1983 and £282,015 in 1984, an increase of 21 per cent.  Figures for the First National Building Society are somewhat similar, showing a 13 per cent increase in directors' fees from £45,000 to £51,000 and a 20 per cent increase in &ldquo;Other Emoluments&rdquo; from £115,000 to £137,000.  These figures are being taken from reports of the building societies in question.  On page 10 of the Educational Building Society's report there is shown a 10 per cent increase in directors' fees from £52,000 to £58,800, and a 20 per cent increase from £102,000 to £123,000 in emoluments of executive directors.</P>
      <P>The Government issued guidelines in regard to pay in the public and private sectors.  The Minister should have looked at the pay of directors themselves in fees and emoluments, showing an 18 per cent, 13 per cent, 21 per cent and 20 per cent increase, way above the relevant increases given in either the public or private sector employment area.  The Minister should have asked why, if profits are so low, they were unable to pay the standard rate of tax without increasing the burden on householders and yet were able to give such large increases to their directors in fees and other emoluments. Does the Minister not consider that to be the relevant approach?</P>

      <P>I am opposed to this section.  This provision seeks to give new tax relief to landlords who already have gained considerably from their tenants in the last few years with the end of the Rent Restrictions Act, a huge increase in rents and a subsidy from the Exchequer.  In other words, the taxpayer is subsidising landlords where people are unable to pay what is described as fair rent.  Landlords are supposed to be in the classic position of depending on market forces.  They decide whether to go into the business of being landlords or not having considered what the market will give.  However, in Ireland we have gone to the other extreme by subsidising landlords to stay in the business.  The amount they look for in rent is beyond what people are able to pay with the result that the taxpayer is asked to pay the balance to the landlord.</P>
      <P>Instead of tackling that extraordinary position that landlords have been put in &mdash; there was a condition that landlords would refurbish and maintain their housing stock &mdash; we are giving them further benefits.  The Minister, if he confers with the Minister for the Environment on this issue, will find that landlords are not adhering to the condition.  If any Member maintains they are I will bring him to an estate where landlords have not put one nail in the house since rents were increased from £2.50 to £25 or £30 per week.  Landlords in that area have not kept their part of the bargain.  However, we are giving them further tax relief on refurbishment of substandard buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> Landlords who refuse to carry out their part of the bargain contained in legislation, or court decisions announced when the Rent Restrictions Act was abolished, are getting further tax concessions.  A bargain was made that landlords would maintain the buildings, the roofs and walls, but they did not do so.  The buildings are deteriorating.  The Minister for Finance, recognising the deterioration in the housing stock, is now giving landlords extra tax relief on refurbishment as well as subsidising landlords with taxpayers' money on rent.  It appears that if landlords do what the courts have ordered them to do they will get special tax relief. This amounts to another enormous burden being imposed on taxpayers to pay off landlords who are already ripping off tenants and taxpayers and not looking after their housing stock.</P>
    <P>The provision will only benefit private landlords.  Private flats, multiple residential accommodation and so on are included.  The Minister has been badly advised on this issue.  The Minister for the Environment may be worried about the deterioration in the housing stock, but he should have insisted on landlords doing what the courts instructed them to do when imposing new rents on tenants. Landlords have refused to carry out the wishes of the courts.  Instead of asking the Minister for Finance to give further tax relief to landlords to encourage them to look after houses at the expense of the taxpayer, the Minister for the Environment should have insisted on them complying with the wishes of the courts.  The Minister should insist on the Department of the Environment enforcing existing regulations rather than giving tax relief to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We pointed out in the national plan that there would be a further extension of the scope of application of the tax incentive for the construction of rented residential accommodation provided for in section 23 of the Finance <Col N="907" /> Act, 1981.  We are giving effect to that in sections 20 and 21.  The measures arise from the consideration, particularly in Dublin's inner city and in other towns, that there is a need for an incentive to encourage the rehabilitation of substantial numbers of substandard dwellings which, I am advised, might not otherwise be properly refurbished or rehabilitated. The measures in sections 20 and 21 are assigned to encourage an increase in the housing stock and an improvement in the quality.</P>
      <P>The two measures will cover expenditure on work carried out in the two years beginning 1 April 1985.  The scope of the measure is designed to ensure rehabilitation of buildings that were getting into bad condition.  It is one of the requirements in order to qualify for the relief that the refurbished buildings must meet all requirements, particularly those relating to the size and standard of accommodation available as set out in section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern of Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to the obligation, whether moral or legal, on owners of property to maintain that property in reasonable order, but that is a separate problem from the one being addressed in the Bill.  These sections are designed to encourage an expansion and improvement of the stock.  The concerns about maintenance of existing stock while legitimate &mdash; I do not argue with that &mdash; are not matters that would fall to be covered in the context of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the section. While the concern expressed by Deputy Mac Giolla is reasonable I must point out to him that it is covered in landlord and tenant legislation.  The rights of the tenant, which are of considerable concern, and the balancing right or obligation of the landlord are covered in other legislation.  The provision under discussion deals with refurbishing substandard buildings and, in particular, the provision of multiple residential additional accommodation. For some time residential accommodation in the centre of our <Col N="908" /> cities, Dublin, Limerick and Cork, and in some of our towns, has been allowed to fall into decay.  Old streets have lost their character.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is worth while. The alternative would be to allow a continuing of the trend of ribbon development, expanding towns far from the centre and providing services such as water and sewerage that would be very costly.  For that reason I welcome this provision.  One is always concerned that tax incentives such as this should not be abused by profiteers.  Having regard to the conditions attaching to section 20, abuses will be unlikely.  A number of conditions are set out in section 23 of the 1981 Act.  I am glad also that to qualify for relief in this case the expenditure must be certified by the Minister for the Environment to have been necessary to ensure suitability as a dwelling of any residential unit in the building.  While I understand Deputy Mac Giolla's concern in respect of tenant's rights, this is a different matter and if it does anything to improve the character of old decrepit buildings, it is worth while.  Obviously this provision will have to be monitored closely but we support it.</P>

      <P>This is not a different matter.  It relates specifically to this section.  I would like to correct the impression I might have given that I was speaking of all landlords or anybody with anything to do with residential property. Some landlords look after their property and comply with their legal obligation to do so.  It is a legal and not a moral <Col N="909" /> obligation under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act.  Some landlords do not comply with that Act.  Landlords will avail of these tax reliefs and incentives. At the moment it appears that a landlord can get tax relief to refurbish a property under this scheme while at the same time allowing another property fall into decay, a property which he can refurbish in ten or 15 years time availing of this tax incentive.  This does not really solve the problem.  I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that it is important to give some incentives to develop areas which are decaying but the Minister should ensure that any property owner who is not fulfilling his obligations under existing legislation should not be allowed tax relief under this section for other property. Some landlords are taking what they can get from tenants without maintaining the houses.  The main purpose of this provision is to ensure that the housing stock is maintained or improved.  I agree with that, but we should not give further tax relief to people who have proved themselves not to be maintaining their property.  Such people will be the first to avail of the tax incentive for refurbishment and development of property while allowing other property to go into decay. The Minister should ensure that that cannot happen.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Mac Giolla's concern.  Perhaps there is not a regulation in this Bill to ensure that people who allow property to fall into decay cannot avail of a tax incentive years later to refurbish it.  To avoid such a situation developing it might be possible to extend the certificate to be given by the Minister for the Environment not just to the suitability of the premises but to the suitability of the applicant.  If by his previous conduct in relation to property management an applicant has proved himself unfit to qualify, he should not qualify for this relief.  It is something that should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy O'Kennedy.  I welcome this extension of <Col N="910" /> tax relief.  However, I note that the section is confined in the same way as section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981 as amended. Section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981 was an excellent and very imaginative section which was welcomed on all sides.  We cannot get away from the fact that the effectiveness of section 23 was very much reduced by section 29 of the Finance Act, 1983 which confined the expenditure which a person could claim to expenditure on the one building to which the outlay was attributable.  It was recognised that that was extremely restrictive.  It took the good out of section 23 to a large extent.  This relief will be similarly restrictive and it will be just as lacking in effectiveness as was section 23 following the Finance Act, 1983.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;relevant expenditure&rdquo; is needlessly restrictive.  The expenditure which is allowable when it has been incurred in relation to the conversion of a building into various units which can be let is confined to expenditure which is directly attributable to those units and any expenditure incurred in any part of a building which is not a house at the time the operation is completed is not allowable.  That is needlessly restrictive if we want to encourage people to convert buildings to let them.  There may be many other aspects of the building which need to be converted for the purpose of letting but would not be a house when the job was completed.  It is unreasonable that that sort of expenditure is excluded.</P>

      <P>The problem to which Deputy Mac Giolla refers really concerns the application of other legislation.  While there may be connections between the two, it is better to treat it in that way as a separate problem rather than mix it up <Col N="911" /> with this.  Another reason for doing that is that the purpose of these provisions here &mdash; Deputy O'Dea has just referred to one element of it &mdash; is to provide for a limited period tax relief against the rental income arising from the premises in question, and application of these sections is limited in time.  I am not inclined to favour Deputy O'Dea's expansion of the scope of that relief, firstly, because the kind of landlords to which Deputy Mac Giolla refers would be getting tax relief against rental income in relation to premises that they were allowing to deteriorate anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, I do not believe that it is appropriate that simply because a person carries out refurbishment or conversion work on one building he should be able to claim the cost of doing that work against all of his rental income on other buildings, including income from other buildings on which he has not carried out any work and on which perhaps he does not need to carry out any work.  To sum up on the first part of the argument, I cannot see a way in which we could use tax law to ensure the suitability of applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Kennedy says, it requires a look at the means that we have to ensure that other legislative provisions are applied properly.  I would hesitate to limit the scope of this or to make it dependent on a further examination of all of the activities of a person involved.  Obviously, there is a need for refurbishment or conversion of buildings in order to provide extra accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question raised by Deputy O'Dea goes back to the original form of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981.  We had this discussion last year.  I do not accept that section 29 of the Finance Act, <Col N="912" /> 1983, was what stopped the volume of activity taking place in relation to the building of new residential units.  A far more important factor was that the level of demand had simply tailed off for a variety of reasons.  I say as I said on that occasion that I cannot see the justification for allowing a write-off against tax of the capital cost of constructing one building against the rental income from a number of other totally unconnected buildings. The relevant expenditure falls to be relieved against rental income from the refurbished building.  We are talking here about residential units.  If a building includes both residential units and non-residential units, relevant expenditure in that case would be determined by the apportionment of the expenditure over the residential units as against the non-residential units.  The relevant apportionment would be made and relief would be limited to the amount of relevant expenditure on the residential units.  The object of these sections is to increase the amount and quality of residential accommodation. We are not particularly concerned with increasing either the amount or quality of, for example, retail outlet accommodation, offices or anything else of that kind.</P>

I am sure the Minister will agree &mdash; he has not denied it &mdash; that once this Finance Bill is passed it does not matter whether you are a good or bad landlord, whether you have or have not maintained your property, you will still qualify under these tax provisions if you are in the business.  As the Minister has said, tax law is not the appropriate medium to provide against that, but he has not shown what is the appropriate medium.  Can he speak to the Minister for the Environment?  Is there a way to ensure, through other legislation or through ministerial directions or orders, qualification certificates or whatever, that this does not happen?  Does the Minister think that, possibly, through discussions with some other Ministers, they can ensure that that does not happen?  He has not answered that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue the same argument again so I will make the point in connection with the amendment that was ruled out of order. Suggestions of tax on derelict sites have been discussed for a number of years now and to the best of my knowledge this may well be in the Programme for Government. It has been discussed at both local authority and Government levels, at Labour Party conferences and, I am sure, at other party conferences also.  It has been regarded as something which can be of importance in assuring that derelict sites are developed by imposing a progressive taxation system on derelict sites. Some local authorities are discussing it in the context of local authority finance and new local authority charges.  It has been discussed in Dublin City Council as a possible way of raising local finance if the Minister is not interested in it.  In the context of section 21 of this Bill and the development of derelict property and sites the question of a derelict sites tax will be of enormous importance apart from the revenue it would bring in.  Perhaps the Minister should discuss this also with the Minister for the Environment who at present is working on legislation in connection with local authority finance.  It would add to the Minister's provisions here if there was also a penalty on dereliction, and the idea of a derelict site tax is to have a penalty on derelict property.  Perhaps the Minister for the Environment has this in mind in his local government finance provisions, but the Minister here should discuss that with him because it would be even more <Col N="915" /> important to have a penalty than to have an incentive.  The Minister is working on the incentive carrot end of it.  As we said in the case of the Private Rented Dwellings Act, the Minister for the Environment should have used the stick a little more, and in this case the stick is a tax on derelict sites.</P>

On amendment 42, even if it is out of order, I want to tell Deputy Mac Giolla that I will take a note of what he said but I want to point out that most of what would commonly be regarded as derelict sites are owned by local authorities.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy Mac Giolla is opposing section 21, unless he has changed his mind.  That section gives relief for refurbishment work carried out in the course of conversions to which section 24 of the Finance Act, 1981 applies, as modified by the Finance Act, 1983.  It clarifies and somewhat extends the definition of the costs that are covered by those provisions.  It is a measure which is designed to facilitate or encourage the provision of extra accommodation and provides for relief in relation to the conversion into multiple dwellings of buildings that were either previously not dwellings at all or might have been single dwellings.</P>

I would like to be able to welcome the abolition of the provision <i>in toto</i> but in so far as that is not being done, I am glad to welcome this provision, which is a step in the right direction.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that this is having a discriminatory effect between the domestic industry and the multinationals who have a variety of means of avoiding the application of this tax.</P>

      <P>We have discussed this matter on many occasions and I do not think the Opposition or any other commentators inside or outside this House, have produced an argument that fundamentally attacks the principle of advance corporation tax.  The intention of the provision in relation to advance corporation tax is to ensure that a net tax credit is not paid where no tax will finally be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the fact that the provision of advance corporation tax could give rise to difficulties for a number of firms and for that reason we have not applied the full rate.  It has been applied at 50 per cent of the normal rate since it was first introduced in the Finance Act, 1983.  I propose to continue an extension of that transitional arrangement to distributions made on or before 31 December 1985, the same logic as applied in 1983 and in 1984.  I am providing for an extension of what is a relief from the provisions of full advance corporation tax for this year <Col N="917" /> because, at this point, the situation justifies it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the increase in excise duty on hydrocarbons and petroleum products.  The Minister for Finance and the Government, have, in our opinion, increased the level of excise duty in recent years on those products to the point that the motor industry and the private car owner are no longer able to sustain the burden.  When the Government came into office the excise duty content on the gallon of petroleum products was 85.7p.  By January 1984 they had increased the element to 108.1p and this Bill now proposes to increase it still further by £1.78.  When I do my conversions I find that since this Government came into office we are talking about a 50 per cent increase in the excise duty element in the price of the gallon of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, and this has been demonstrated through returns in respect of petroleum products and beer, that the level of excise duty has clearly given rise to diminishing returns in petroleum products particularly.  The extraordinary consequence is that for an increasing level <Col N="918" /> of excise duty we are getting a diminishing return of revenue.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the excise duty yield on petroleum products was £275 million.  This in effect decreased substantially in 1984 when the gross yield was only £282 million, a nominal increase of £7 million.  It represents at least a 5 per cent reduction in real terms on the 1983 revenue and, despite this huge increase in excise duty &mdash; or, more accurately, because of it &mdash; the revenue yield in real terms in 1983-84 dropped dramatically.  We are concerned that the impact of this latest increase and the appreciation of the dollar will have a most disastrous effect on trade in general. The motor trade dramatically demonstrate to the Minister the impact of this on their business.  This is particularly so in the Border regions which have been decimated by this imposition and there are a number of untended garages and petrol pumps within a 20 mile radius of the Border.  There are two Deputies present who, from experience, can testify that this is so.  This must be a source of concern and the reason is that the huge difference in the price of petrol across the Border is a major attraction to people within a 20 mile radius and further, to purchase their petrol there.  I have asked traders on both sides of the Border what they think of the Government in this respect and many garage owners across the Border regard the Minister as the hero of the hour, the day, the month and the year.  As one passes through Deputy Conlon's area to Bundoran, a little petrol station there is doing a roaring trade and you will travel a long way down South before you find a petrol station doing any trade.  It is time that we looked at the impact of this on the business section, especially in the Border regions.  From the figures I have given it is obvious that there is also an impact on revenue because the employment loss in these labour intensive areas is having a very damaging effect on the whole social and economic climate in these regions.</P>
    <P>We have made constant appeals in regard to this matter.  In 1983, 1984 and at various stages in between, I appealed to the Minister to review his attitude on <Col N="919" /> excise duties and VAT levels.  I should also like to make an appeal in regard to beer but there is no mechanism open to me to do this because the Minister is not increasing the level of excise duty on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister has chosen to ignore our appeals over the last two years in regard to the motor trade and he seems determined in his strange, stubborn way to heap on further levels of excise duty.  For some reason, he is not taking note of the drop in revenue yield and I do not understand this particularly as the example in relation to spirits proved our point.  The other consequence is that the revenue must come from somewhere and if there are diminishing returns in revenue in certain selected VAT areas what happens next?  The level of allowances or reduction of income tax cannot be allowed and the PAYE taxpayer will be further penalised to offset the loss of excise duty because of a shortsighted and disastrous series of decisions over the last few years.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable potential for tourism this year because of the strength of the dollar.  We are trying to encourage employment in that sector and in the trade services generally, but Government actions are having the opposite effect.  I do not suppose the Minister will change his mind at this stage but I wish to state our position and to assure the Minister that we will be as good as our word when we change places.  We will be looking at it on that basis because the evidence is conclusive.</P>

      <P>This section imposes a sizeable increase on the price of petrol. It weighs very heavily on the motoring public in general but even more so on the people in my constituency which is within 25 to 30 miles of the Border.  While I agree that revenue must come from somewhere, I appeal to the Minister to give special attention to the Border area. For a number of years now, petrol has been cheaper in Northern Ireland but recently the disparity has escalated and the difference at present is about 75 pence per gallon.</P>
      <P>Every Saturday, people go up to Northern Ireland for their weekly fill of petrol and while they are there, they also buy their groceries.  Thanks to the reduction in VAT, at present there is not a great difference in the price of many goods but, unfortunately, the habit has developed and cheaper petrol is the root cause.  All this revenue is being lost and a number of petrol filling stations in my constituency have closed.  Some are staying open hoping that there will be better days.  A friend of mine has a petrol filling station on the outskirts of Monaghan town and up to a few years ago his weekly sales were in the region of 6,500 gallons per week but he is now selling only 1,000 gallons per week.</P>

      <P>My friend is just hanging on at present and the Minister should do something for people with filling stations within a 30 mile radius of the Border.  It has been said in some areas that we would be creating a second Border.  I do not think that is so.  Some system could be devised &mdash; and it would be self-financing &mdash; whereby a filling station on the Border would get a rebate of 60p a gallon.  That rebate could be reduced by 2p per gallon per mile within a radius of 30 miles.  The further back you were from the Border the more you would pay for your petrol. I live within ten miles of Monaghan town. It would not pay me to travel to Monaghan town to save 20p a gallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I have here certified figures from one petrol company operating in the Border area.  I will give the name of the company to the Minister afterwards.  From 1981 to 1984 their percentage sales dropped by 49.3 per cent.  Having examined stations located on a line drawn between Buncrana, Letterkenny, Donegal, Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Sligo, Cavan, Carrickmacross, and Dundalk the following statistics emerged.  From 1981 to 1984 the company's sales dropped from 14 million litres to seven million litres.  During that time 20 of their outlets closed.  That is only one petrol company.  I understand that on every gallon of petrol sold in the Republic, between excise duty and VAT the Revenue get £1.80.  If we could increase our sales by 50 per cent within that 30 mile radius, we would recoup what we would lose by the reduction of 60p per gallon.  The scheme would be self-financing.</P>
    <P>This would save the livelihood of small grocers and petrol salesmen in the area. If those people were making a profit, they would also be paying income tax which is being lost to the Revenue.  My friends across the Border in South Armagh, South Tyrone and South Fermanagh would not like to hear me say what I have just said.  I represent people who have to make a livelihood.  They have been hit very hard over the past number of years. I appeal to the Minister to introduce some such scheme.  This is not beyond the capabilities of the people who work in Revenue. Apparently they do not want to hear about it.  They do not want the trouble.  The Minister should introduce a scheme which would give relief to the petrol sales people within a 30 mile radius of the Border.  I appreciate that revenue must be got in and that a big reduction in the price of petrol across the country would cost millions of pounds.</P>

      <P>The Government's policies have had devastating consequences on the Border economy.  That is very obvious this evening having heard such a spirited attack on these policies from a Government backbencher.  When the Government took office the traffic was coming to the Republic to shop at weekends.  There was a good deal of traffic from across the Border into towns on this side of the Border.  In their first month in office the price of petrol went up on three different occasions, a total increase of 35p per gallon.  The result was that motorists in the Border constituences started to go across the Border to buy their petrol.  They took their wives and families with them and did their shopping on the other side of the Border.  People living further afield thought they were missing something.</P>
      <P>The price variation is not that great in the ordinary range of household goods. As many as 150 buses left this city to go to Newry to do their shopping in the weeks before Christmas.  This was a result of a decision by the Minister and the Government to create a price gap in the price of petrol which made it attractive for motorists on this side of the Border to cross the Border to buy their petrol. In my own town of Carrickmacross two petrol stations closed down and in the neighbouring town of Castleblayney ten miles away three petrol stations closed down in the past ten years.  In Armagh there is a new petrol filling station with six fast filling pumps.  There is always a queue of cars.  I saw as many as 20 cars on the main Dundalk-Monaghan road waiting for petrol.  All this is a result of a lack of knowledge and insight on the part of the Government due to the fact that there is not a Minister from a Border constituency at the Cabinet table.  This is the first time in the history of the State that this has been the case.</P>

      <P>If there was a Minister <Col N="923" /> from a Border constituency at the Cabinet table this section would not be in the Bill.  The excise duty on petrol would have been reduced.  I have not got the slightest doubt about that.  If any Minister had any knowledge of the Border areas, there would have been a reduction in the price of petrol.</P>

      <P>It is estimated by the traders in the Border counties that £200 million of revenue is lost to the State as a result of the decision by the Government to keep increasing the excise duty on petrol.  Apart from the revenue lost because people are buying petrol on the other side of the Border, other goods are bought there too with a consequent loss of VAT and other taxes to this State.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Taoiseach on budget day.  He seemed to believe that sometimes they had it good on this side of the Border and sometimes they had it good on the other side of the Border.  He wondered what they were worrying about if things were not so good now on this side of the Border because they were good in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister can check the record of the House and see what the Taoiseach said.  There is a possibility of the price of petrol coming down by 10p a gallon this year following the OPEC conference in Geneva.  The Taoiseach said that if people are paying the same price for petrol at the end of this year as they were at the beginning of the year, they will have nothing to complain about. In other words, people are not entitled to benefit from a reduction in the price of petrol as the result of a decision by the OPEC countries.  I support my colleague Deputy O'Kennedy.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the Border counties and do something to ensure that their economy will not be destroyed totally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support our spokesman and Deputy Conlon and Deputy O'Hanlon in a strong plea to the Minister with regard to excise duties and VAT in the Border area.  I know the Minister will argue that he has to get his money.  I notice that there is a gap of £886 million between receipts and issues.  That is not the whole picture.  It relates only to a four month period; and, taking into consideration the various dates for receipts and issues changing during the 12 month period, the picture may be different. Nevertheless, the matter is serious.  The speakers who have contributed this evening have contended that if the Minister took some action in regard to the excise duty and VAT on petrol and also on beer he would be gaining money rather than losing money.</P>
      <P>Filling stations have been closing.  I mentioned here previously that I had to leave my constituency and cross the Border in the Blacklion area because the two filling stations in my area had closed. Admittedly, Blacklion and Belcoo are twins towns but it became impossible for the stations on this side of the Border to survive.  If I needed enough petrol to enable me to drive home from the other side of the Border, I would buy the minimum amount, perhaps £1's worth.  I am not claiming any virtue for this but I argue that whatever salary is disbursed for me comes out of our funds and not out of the funds of Her Majesty.  I argue this point with constituents also but it is a counsel of perfection so far as they are concerned. They argue that they are being hard pressed because of other taxes and so on and so they buy their petrol in the Six Counties.  As other Deputies have mentioned, when these people are on the other side of the Border they make other purchases also, though in some cases they may pay more than they would pay in the Republic.  However, sometimes they think they are getting more value for their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchasing of beer in the Six Counties by people from this side of the Border had got out of hand.  The Department issued some instruction in this regard. Apparently some people were under the <Col N="925" /> impression that they could import legally up to 200 cans of Harp at a time but when this sort of purchasing was becoming something of a scandal, some instruction issued from the Minister's office.  Considering that the amount in respect of excise is about £365 million for the four month period of this year compared with a sum of £349 million this time last year and taking inflation into account, the Minister can see that he is losing out. Even the VAT has increased by about £30 million for this period and that is not satisfactory, taking inflation into account also.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulty for the Minister in finding a solution.  Deputy Conlon's suggestion is not a bad one and ought to be considered.  Perhaps the Department could devise some sort of sliding scale which would result at least in saving the businesses and the livelihoods of a considerable number of people along the Border.  This matter has been thrashed out time and again and I shall not delay the House further on it except to ask the Minister to abandon his stonewalling and ask his officials to consider the matter. Then, if there is found to be a real problem they could exercise their considerable ability in finding some way of alleviating matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be persuaded by the fact that with the exception of my fellow Tipperary man, Deputy Mac Giolla, and myself, he is confronted with the united team of the Deputies from Cavan-Monaghan on this issue. That speaks for itself.  In other words, with the exception of those of us who have to be here, namely, the Minister, Deputy Mac Giolla and myself, all the other Members represent that constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speakers in expressing the hope that even at this stage the Minister will take some action to alleviate the problems being experienced by traders in the Border area.  Consistently in the months following the 1983 budget we reminded the Minister of the damage that was being <Col N="926" /> done to the whole trading structure of the Border regions by way of the impositions at that time.  However, the Minister allowed matters to continue, though he has brought about some revision in terms of VAT.</P>
      <P>A very serious situation was allowed to develop in so far as this issue is concerned. A Deputy from the Government side &mdash; I think it was Deputy Mitchell &mdash; suggested that the Government devise some measures to offset this total imbalance in terms of trading within a close radius of the Border.  The trading structures along the Border, be they shops or filling stations, were established as a result of very hard work and in times of much difficulty.  It is sad now that so many of these businesses have to close.  Only on Tuesday last I had occasion to travel via Dundalk and in the little village of Milltown, which is just about three miles north of the town, I noticed a closed sign on a filling station.  The real black spot in the area is Clones.  In their report the EC Social and Economic Committee accepted, following their visit to the area, that the Border region was the most severely disadvantaged of any country in the Community.  That committee pinpointed Clones for special attention.  This town has suffered seriously in terms of trade.  The Government and their agencies should be doing something to alleviate the problem in Clones.  The closure of a factory there was a big blow to the town but there are a number of cluster units which could be put into production so as to alleviate the problem in some small way.</P>
      <P>Following the 1983 budget, chambers of commerce and groups of traders made their way to Dublin to point out to the Government the problems that were being created for traders in the Border region.  Since then we have been receiving some information by way of figures at Question Time but one wonders how accurate these figures are.  My guess is that the damage is much more serious than the figures suggest.  One must take inflation into account also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Defence attended a political meeting in Cootehill <Col N="927" /> he was pressured by the Press and by Fine Gael representatives regarding the damage that had been done to the area by Government measures.  The Minister replied that there would be difficulty in taking action to rectify the situation because any such action would be unconstitutional. Apparently there was nothing unconstitutional about the measures introduced by the Minister for Finance in 1983 which are still in force.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, said that it would be unconstitutional to do anything for that area that was not being done for other areas.  It showed that there was not a realisation of the disadvantages under which the Border area operated or the serious impact of Government action over the previous two years.</P>

      <P>I take it that we are on section 28.  That is a section which has, with respect, very little to do with political meetings attended by any Ministers anywhere outside this House.  Section 28 confirms a financial resolution passed by this House on budget day.  It confirms a decision that has already been made in this House.  I wish to point that out to the Deputies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty whatsoever. Anybody can see that.  However, they have been due to quite a number of factors, including the fact that we are still dealing with the effects of the recession. There are a number of other marginal factors, such as the changeover to diesel to some extent and the changeover to auto-LPG to some extent and loss of sales across the Border.  I do not accept the suggestion that has been made by the Opposition for quite some time past that a reduction in the rate of duty on hydrocarbon oils would be self-financing.  We have discussed that matter on a number of occasions in the House.  The immediate effect of a reduction in hydrocarbon duty would be a reduction in revenue.</P>

The essential point that I make, and made repeatedly in the past, to suggestions of this kind is that this takes time.  Although I do not intend to go into it in detail, it would take time and the reduction would have to be judged to bring about the effect on consumption.  The Opposition have not made that case, nor have they indicated how they would deal with the situation that would arise in the interim when revenue would inevitably be below the levels provided for in the budget arithmetic.</P>

      <P>It would take time for the revenue to recover.  The Deputies opposite have not said what they would do in the meantime, or do without, in terms of expenditure in order to get over that situation.  They have pointed to the example in the reduction in excise duties on spirits.  As I have pointed out time and time again, that reduction was followed, in the first instance, by a reduction in revenue and I expect that it will take some time for the volume of sales to increase to the point where the revenue loss will be replaced.  There are no two ways about it &mdash; and Deputy O'Kennedy can shake his head all he likes &mdash; that would be the effect and one would have to deal with that immediate effect and recover the revenue from somewhere else, no doubt from an area that Deputy O'Kennedy or some of the other Deputies, be they from the Border counties or anywhere else, would not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Conlon has suggested a graded rebate on the duty, depending on the proximity of petrol stations to the Border.  The Deputy knows that I have previously looked at that suggestion. There are several difficulties with it. First, excise duty is charged on petrol on delivery from a central depot.  The application of a differential rate of taxation on deliveries or a rebate scheme depending on where the petrol station was located would be extremely difficult to administer.  In fact, it would be, in my <Col N="932" /> view, unworkable.  Also, it would be very readily abused.  Once the petrol leaves the depot, who is to know where it is actually going to?  For those reasons, having examined the suggestion made to me previously by Deputy Conlon, I regret that it is not one that we could implement with any expectation that it would have the result that would be expected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come to the facts again.  The Minister has deliberately chosen to ignore the case that we make.  That is based on the actual revenue returns in respect of petroleum products.  I do not propose to repeat them again.  I gave the figures.  They demonstrate what the Minister has now belatedly been forced to acknowledge, that there has been a considerable fall-off in consumption as a consequence of the increase in the excise duties.  At least it is some progress that the Minister has been forced to acknowledge <Col N="933" /> the reality which has been demonstrated by all the colleagues of the Ceann Comhairle from the Border counties in terms of the number of petrol stations that are closed, of derelict sites on this side and buoyant activity on the other side.  Those facts have not been refuted. Secondly, if consumption has fallen revenue will also fall&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The revenue is not increasing.  I have given the figures.  If the Minister is going to tell me that £282 million in 1984 is the equivalent in real terms of £275 million in 1983, he had better go somewhere else.</P>

      <P>It is not equivalent; it is very much less.  If the Minister is trying to show us it is equivalent he is demonstrating even more than I thought he would that he is not able to come to grips with the complexity of the office he holds.  He has developed a new concept of time for revenue to recover.  It did not take any time for the revenue to collapse when one considers the differential in the price.</P>

      <P>The time lag notion is a convenient piece of jargon to get over the fact that he is not prepared to recognise his own mistakes.  The Minister made the case that here we are asking for a reduction of excise duty.  We are not, although I believe we could demonstrate that with a reduction there would be greater revenue.  We are asking the Minister to refuse to confirm in this legislation an increase in excise duty on hydrocarbons and petroleum products.  We are asking him to leave the matter as it was.  In the time since he came to office the level of excise duty on petroleum products has increased by 50 per cent and the number of traders in the Border region who are engaged in the petrol trade must have decreased by the same number.  The amount of revenue accruing from excise duty on petrol is nowhere near what it would have been had the Minister left it as it was.  I regret we have not convinced the Minister.  I can assure Deputy Conlon we have won the argument but I know we will lose the vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion in the name of our Chief Whip:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to withdraw the document <i>Building on Reality</i> and to put forward, in its place, realistic plans to protect existing employment, create new jobs and alleviate social deprivation.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Building on Reality</i> is a discredited document.  It never did represent a coherent or a worth-while economic strategy. The inadequacies of the document were pointed out at the time of its publication and in particular, its failure to put forward any policies to solve our major economic problems, mass unemployment and high taxation.  Even if all its projections were fulfilled, we were not going to be any better off in 1987 than we were last autumn, slightly worse in fact.  To that extent, it was basically unacceptable to us.  However, as time passes, it is becoming increasingly obvious &mdash; even to its authors &mdash; that even the limited objectives of the document will not be met.  Whatever basis of political support might have been claimed for it has been finally debunked by the Labour Party Conference in Cork.  It no longer has any semblance of political credibility and should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me, for the benefit of Labour Deputies in this House in particular, recall that their party in Cork condemned <i>Building on Reality</i>, especially the sections <Col N="938" /> relating to public sector pay, jobs and transport reorganisation.  The following motion was passed at that conference:</P>
    <P>Conference, therefore, rejects the proposals of the National Plan which are contrary to the existing policies and traditional principles of the Labour Party and directs our Members in the Dáil and in Government to withdraw their support for these anti-working class measures.</P>
    <P>That is a very specific direction from a party conference in very clear and trenchant terms.  I am inviting Labour Deputies to respond to the wishes of their party conference at large and vote for this motion.  I want to emphasise &mdash; and this is an important aspect of our debate this evening &mdash; that all we are seeking in this motion is to change Government economic policy and to have the document which is the basis of present policies withdrawn in order to enable that change of policy to take place.  That is surely not an impossible political demand.</P>
    <P>It is now generally acknowledged on all sides that the Government's economic policy, to the extent that they still have one, has failed; that it is only making things worse.  We have an appalling level of mass unemployment and, at the same time, a financial situation which continues to deteriorate steadily.  The burden of taxation and service charges has become absolutely crippling.  Families are struggling to make ends meet.  The fabric and cohesion of community life has deteriorated, as we suffer a major outbreak of crime and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has risen by well over 50,000 since this Government took office. Even at 226,000 unemployed there is no sign that the rising trend has yet been halted, let alone reversed.  Any diminution in the figures on the live register is, of course, nothing more than a reflection of a rising tide of emigration.  Qualified observers in Britain believe emigration is running at 30,000 a year to Britain alone in addition to the United States.  The <Col N="939" /> real level of unemployment is also being masked by training and other schemes.</P>
    <P>Redundancies are continuing to rise. They have increased from 26,000 in 1982 to over 31,000 in 1984.  The index of employment in the building and construction sector has been almost halved since mid-1981, and the fall has been accelerating again since November last.</P>
    <P>The latest ESRI quarterly states bluntly that &ldquo;A major contribution factor to the employment problem is the depressed condition of the construction sector&rdquo;. Last year housing output fell below 25,000 for the first time since 1977.  <i>Building on Reality</i> stated on page 21 in relation to the building industry, that &ldquo;overall growth should resume early in the period of the plan&rdquo; and forecast that employment would rise slightly between 1984 and 1987.  Since the document appeared in October employment in building and construction has fallen by 9 per cent.  The disastrous decision to raise VAT on new houses by 5 per cent in this year's budget will have further aggravated the adverse trend.</P>
    <P>Despite our efforts in the Finance Bill, it looks as if the Government will persist with this ruinous proposal to increase VAT on building and construction, to 10 per cent.  The Central Bank in their recent annual report contradict the assertion in <i>Building on Reality</i> that &ldquo;the decline in output is starting to level off&rdquo;, when it predicts that output will, in fact, decline by a further 4½ per cent this year, practically the same as the 5 per cent decline in 1984.  At that rate of progress the levelling off process will not finish till the mid-1990s.  The Government's attitude to the building industry is a good example of what was referred to in Cork as &ldquo;anti-working class measures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i> claimed that unemployment would peak at 220,000 in December 1984.  In fact it reached 234,000, and even seasonally adjusted it was 228,500 in February of this year. The ESRI state in their current quarterly review &ldquo;the outlook for employment remains bleak.  Although there could be <Col N="940" /> some increase in the number of jobs in the course of 1985, the annual average of numbers at work is unlikely to be higher than in 1984, while the rise in the labour force will maintain the upward trend of unemployment during the year&rdquo;.  That is a calm, factual statement by the ESRI. Surely that brutal assessment alone is sufficient justification for our motion. Surely, it should inspire any Deputy who has some concern for the future of employees to vote for our motion and for this document to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The deflationary policies of the Government have been totally counter-productive in so far as rectifying the public finances is concerned.  The financial objectives of <i>Building on Reality</i> are already way off target.  Not only does all talk of phasing out the current budget deficit by 1987 now seem irrelevant, but even the very high deficit projected for this year will be exceeded.  I challenge the Minister to contradict that statement. Unless some action is taken either on the expenditure or on the tax side, the unprecedentedly high budget deficit of £1,134 million will be exceeded this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i> has a target deficit of 5 per cent of GNP by 1987.  In a <i>Sunday Tribune</i> interview on 12 May 1985, the Minister for Labour clearly indicated that he no longer believed in any such target. The whole thing has become unreal.  All the projections in that document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, in so far as they refer to budgetary policy and current budget deficits are no longer realistic.</P>
    <P>Already the Government have had to strain their arithmetic in the most dubious manner in an effort to make the budget appear consistent with <i>Building on Reality</i>.  As the months pass, it is increasingly clear that the arithmetic will not stand up.  Unsubstantiated figures were put in for savings on pay, for non-pay savings and for revenue buoyancy.</P>
    <P>Even with the benefit of all this manipulation the Minister for Finance brought forward a budget with the highest ever planned deficit, which on the estimates of the Central Bank amounts to 8 per cent of GNP.  At the beginning of May <Col N="941" /> this year the current budget deficit is estimated to be running at £800 million, or almost two-thirds of the deficit budgeted for the year as a whole.  Five months into 1985 income tax receipts are still running behind their 1984 levels instead of the 8.5 per cent increase projected in the budget. There is no sign of buoyancy in indirect tax revenue.  Debt service charges are running at 26 per cent ahead of last year's level instead of the 16 per cent budgeted for.  The Minister is on record as saying that he will not allow budget targets to be overrun.  If he does not, this must inevitably mean another budget this year which, if it is to be effective, cannot be later than July.  Experience shows that there is no point in bringing in a supplementary budget after July.  Certainly, by the time the Dáil returns after the summer recess it will be far too late to correct any serious discrepancies in the budget.</P>
    <P>Are we to have this new supplementary budget the moment the local election polls are closed?  In the debate we are asking the Government to be honest with the public.  There is now fairly general agreement that this supplementary budget, or some change in the budgetary situation, must be implemented.  The Government's credibility is at stake in this matter.</P>
    <P>The continuing large current budget deficits will, of course, have to be carried by borrowing.  This type of borrowing produces no return which would help to repay it.  It has been generally accepted for many years that borrowing should be mainly for productive capital investment yielding a reasonable rate of return. Instead, the Government have been steadily squeezing capital investment, which has borne the main brunt of adjustment in the public finances.</P>
    <P>In the two and a quarter years since the Government took office the national debt has grown by two-thirds from £11½ billion to over £19 billion by 31 March, while the foreign debt has increased from just over £5 billion to £8½ billion in the same period.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the words of one <Col N="942" /> of their own economist mentors, have thrown in the towel on the public finances.  They have completely failed to achieve progress in relation to their own stated financial objective.</P>
    <P>The policies pursued by the Coalition over two and a half years have gone a long way towards wrecking this economy. They have locked us into a downward spiral, with jobs lost, services cut, taxes raised, each having a depressing, accumulative effect on the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is imperative that this spiral be reversed.  At the moment young people are leaving without proper preparation for emigration and our social problems are transferred to other countries. This scandal is not being publicly acknowledged, nor is it being admitted how large a phenomenon it is.  The official statistics are quite obviously hopelessly inaccurate, but no one in Government seems to be interested in obtaining a more accurate picture.  The Government are making claims about impending economic recovery that are devoid of reality. Indeed, whatever international recovery there is, is largely passing us by.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to public service pay was supposed to be a basic element of <i>Building on Reality.</i> £108 million gross had to be provided over and above the figure that, according to the Government's document, &ldquo;could not be exceeded&rdquo;.  Is there any evidence that the Government will be able to adhere to their stated policy in the next pay round either?</P>
      <P>In respect of unemployment, the public finances and pay, all key elements in <i>Building on Reality,</i> the document has already failed, and there is little or no chance of the principal targets being met. That, in my view is a good and sufficient reason why it should at this stage be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in addition there are specific aspects of the document that are totally unacceptable to us and to the general body of the Labour Party.  <i>Building on <Col N="943" /> Reality</i> relies heavily on the system of water charges being imposed by local authorities.  No matter what contortions and deceptions the Labour Minister for the Environment engages in coming up to the local elections, the fact is that <i>Building on Reality</i> requires increased local charges not reduced ones.  Pages 137 and 138 state that the current level of funding from Central Government is:</P>
    <P>... considered to be too high and cannot be sustained... The allocations decided on by Government will provide for only modest increases in this grant over the period of the Plan ... Local authorities will be expected to meet any financial difficulties which may arise by a combination of better management of available resources, and the public generation of local sources of revenue.</P>
    <P>That is clear and specific.  The document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> clearly stipulates that local authorities must finance their needs in the period of the document out of local charges.  That is one of the reasons why we want the document withdrawn.  Those local charges have been shown to be unjust, inequitable and unacceptable to the general public. Labour Party members can now demonstrate their rejection of the system of water charges by voting for our motion. The withdrawal of the document will include withdrawal of that whole emphasis in the future on water charges by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The 1984 Government Estimates provided only a 3 per cent increase in the grant for local authorities.  It is clear from the leaked NESC study that the Government are contemplating the full-scale reintroduction of local rates both on private houses and on agricultural land.  The Government's intentions in this matter must be made clear to the voters in the local elections.  The people are entitled to know before they go to the polls what the Government are going to do in this area.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have the Minister for the Environment trying to confuse <Col N="944" /> the issue as far as water charges are concerned. Then we have the leaked report which indicates that there will be a new type of tax, in fact, the reintroduction of local rates on all kinds of property.  The Government are trying to go into the local election campaign confusing the public.  On the one hand they have imposed the water charges &mdash;<i>Building on Reality</i> insists that local authorities finance themselves through water charges &mdash; while on the other hand the Minister for the Environment is trying to shuffle from one foot to the other indicating that he is half-hearted about them and that maybe people should not pay them.  On top of that we have a new proposal.  The Government should be honest with the people and come forth clearly and state what their policy is in this area.  Our policy is clear.  As soon as we are returned to office we will repeal the legislation which imposes these water charges.  That is a specific and clear statement by us.</P>
    <P>In the document the clear hostility and antagonism of the new Right to the public sector generally manifests itself.  Since its publication, the public service has been subjected to consistent attack, often to an unreasonable and unreasoned extent by the Minister for the Public Service who has been unbalanced in his comments. Some of his strictures about our public servants should be withdrawn along with the document.  Semi-State companies are in a state of siege.  In some cases they have been callously liquidated; in others they have been privatised and in others, like Bord Telecom, they have been and are being deprived of the money needed for investment.  There is an all-out attack being made on the public sector in many of its different aspects.  That philosophy is inherent in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>If Labour Deputies are sincere in their commitment to the public sector and to semi-State companies and their operations they will have no hesitation about voting for our motion and calling for the withdrawal of <i>Building on Reality</i> in which this anti-public sector philosophy is clearly enshrined.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the public sector is a <Col N="945" /> totally different one.  We believe that all the commercial semi-State companies, and local authorities should act as development corporations.  It has always been our philosophy that an important role of our semi-State bodies is to act as generators of employment, that they have the important mission in our rather under-developed economy of providing employment opportunities as well as discharging their public sector responsibilities, that they should be development and employment minded.  That is the opposite to the philosophy enshrined in <i>Building on Reality</i> and also to the policy which is being steadily implemented by the Government since they assumed office. Practically no semi-State company can regard themselves as secure.  There is a clear hostility and antagonism in the minds of a number of these Fine Gael Ministers to the whole concept of semi-State economic activity.  The message with regard to semi-State companies in the document we are seeking to have withdrawn is clear; reduced investment, therefore reduced employment.  There is no emphasis whatever in this document on any positive role for the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i> promises a complete abolition of food subsidies.  That surely is not Labour Party policy.  Today too many people have their backs to the wall, social deprivation and hardship are too real and widespread, too many families are in need for that proposal to be proceeded with, yet it is there in <i>Building on Reality</i> firm and specific.  That is another reason why we want it withdrawn and why we seek Labour Deputies to support us in this motion.  We believe that, whatever about food subsidies in normal times, certainly the present is not the time to set about dismantling this protection of the poorer and weaker sections of our community.  If for no other reason, I believe that we are perfectly entitled to seek the support of the Labour Party and their Deputies in this House on the ground of the proposal in these appallingly difficult circumstances, with so many families seriously deprived and <Col N="946" /> suffering hardship, to go ahead with the abolition of food subsidies altogether.</P>
    <P>There is by now ample and abundant proof in terms of both broad strategy and specific detail that <i>Building on Reality</i> was inadequate and unsuitable to begin with and has been shown increasingly to be disastrous in practice.  Incidentally, was there ever a document more seriously misnamed than that document <i>Building on Reality</i> when you think first of all of the unreal projections in the document itself and the way in which the entire document has been underlined and made irrelevant by developments?  That will go down in economic history as one of the great misnomers of all time.  It is time the document was withdrawn and quietly forgotten.  The Government should recognise reality, withdraw the document and put in its place, as our motion demands, realistic plans to protect existing employment, create new jobs and alleviate social deprivation. Missing entirely from the Government's document is any attempt to give a forward thrust to the economy to help us to get out of this inflationary spiral in which we find ourselves, to start some movement forward, to offer some incentive. The withdrawal of this document, now that it is clearly discredited, would be some indication, some recognition by the Government of the reality of our situation. It would be some indication that they recognise that the present situation can only keep on getting worse, that they are adjusting everything downwards.</P>
    <P>The greatest single statistical manifestation of the failure of their policies is in the falling off of income tax revenue this year.  The significance of that falling off in revenue in those figures has not yet been fully grasped.  I want to make it clear that it is not just that the income tax returns are falling off but exactly the same pattern is manifesting itself in the 1 per cent employment levy.  That shows and proves that it is the body of income that is diminishing.  It is not any income tax anomalies.  It is not arising from changes in tax bands or otherwise.  It is simply that the amount of income in our community which is taxable is falling <Col N="947" /> because both sets of figures show the same pattern.  Surely that indicates that the policies being pursued at present, these harsh, rigorous, monetarist policies are wrong and that the whole economy is being depressed to the point where incomes are now no longer able even at these exceptionally high rates to produce the return in the revenue that is expected of them.  Apart from the very serious implications that this fall in income tax revenue and employment levy returns has from the point of view of the budget deficit, it is a clear signal that the economy is being depressed beyond the point of recovery.  Unless there is a turn around we cannot get out of our present difficult situation.  I say seriously to the Minister and to his advisers that if the lesson of those decreasing income tax returns is not learned I despair for our future in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we have on many occasions outlined what we believe must be done, or undone as the case may be, in order to launch national economic recovery.  We must increase the productive potential of our economy, exploit new technology and develop more fully our natural resources.  There is no sign anywhere either in the document which we are seeking to have withdrawn or in the Government's implementation of the policies outlined in that document of any appreciation whatever of the need for development and particularly to develop our natural resources.  The current high levels of taxation must be reduced if any economic progress is to be made.  If this is done in the right strategic places it can be achieved without major loss of revenue.  The decreasing returns from income tax almost make that case for us. It is proved now that increasing the rates is bringing diminishing returns.  Therefore, surely <i>ipso facto</i> to decrease the rates limitedly and prudently in certain areas must have the effect of increasing our returns.</P>
    <P>Investment, especially related to the building industry, must be stimulated. We believe that a reasonable sum &mdash; our figure is £200 million but we are not prepared to go to the scaffold for it &mdash;<Col N="948" /> invested now, immediately, as can be done, in the building and construction industry would pay immediate and beneficial returns and would make an impact, maybe not a big one to begin with, on employment.  One thing about the building and construction industry is that the employment content is direct and immediate. It is not like some other forms of investment which would take a long time to filter through the system and give employment.  Investment in the building and construction industry has two great advantages.  First, it has practically no implications for the balance of payments. Practically everything involved in the building and construction industry for a certain type of contract at any rate can be supplied internally.  Second, the impact on employment is immediate and direct.</P>
    <P>It just does not make sense to anybody on this side of the House that instead of putting some level of investment into the building and construction industry the Government are moving in the opposite direction and placing a penal tax on it to depress an already depressed industry. We on this side of the House have always maintained as a rule of thumb that if the building and construction industry is doing well the economy is doing well.  I offer that lesson sincerely to this Government and particularly to the Labour Party Members who should have the interest of the building and construction industry at heart.  I have no doubt that if they put to the Labour Party Conference, which has just concluded, a specific motion to invest £100 million, £200 million or some figure of that order, in the building industry it would have been passed immediately, and with acclamation, except by some people on the platform.</P>
    <P>Prudent taxation reductions, an increase in investment, financed by prudent and limited borrowing will help, in our view, to turn this economy round. We believe this is the only way to turn the economy round.  I think I have said enough to argue that the present policies are keeping the economy going down and down in one vicious spiral and that there must be some new input to reverse that <Col N="949" /> spiral, to turn things round, to face us in the opposite direction and to give some hope and confidence to people throughout the community.</P>
    <P>We believe that, if there are carefully selected, prudent tax reductions and equally prudent investment financed by borrowing, they will generate growth and will give us the resources to reduce our deficit and repay our debts.  The way we are going there is no hope of doing that.  We will only go further and further downhill and the ever decreasing level of economic activity will ensure decreasing tax returns, no matter how high the rates, more borrowing and a continuing accentuation of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>We believe we must attract and develop high technology industries and create the right environment for industrial development, which we had for a number of years.  That is our main complaint against this document and the philosophy it enshrines.  It gives no acknowledgement to the need to undertake developmental types of activity as well as corrective ones.  Particular sectors of our economy can be activated fairly quickly to provide employment if a specific sector by sector approach is adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>Our natural resources must be developed. There is need for development in agriculture.  That is one of the serious mistakes this Government have made, cutting back and reducing investment in agriculture.  We believe if there is a right approach to our horticulture, forestry and marine resources, it can start providing us with necessary levels of employment.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, indicated how this Government are pursuing mistaken policies as regards offshore oil development and the possibility of further gas finds.  Why cannot this Government get on with extending the natural gas grid?  We are all agreed there is plenty of gas in the Kinsale field and the time to use it is now because the economy is depressed.  This is a natural resource with which it would be perfectly legitimate to be slightly profligate to get the economy moving again.  Everybody believes there <Col N="950" /> is more gas out there and that it is only a question of time until we find further gas resources.  Why cannot the Government immediately extend the gas grid to larger urban centres?</P>

They are not succeeding even by their own standards.  If their overall objective is to secure some improvement in our public finances, they are not doing that.  They are inflicting hardship and deprivation on large sections of our community.  They are stifling economic development and activity, but at the same time they are not doing anything for the public finances because, as I have shown, borrowing, both internal and foreign, under this Minister for Finance is running at a higher level than ever before.</P>
      <P>Accept this motion.  Take away this document which is no longer realistic or relevant.  Pass this motion.  If the House does that, the Government will be giving a very clear indication to a very depressed and dispirited Irish public and Irish business community that they are prepared to go back to the drawing board and produce a new plan which would have some necessary developmental element to help to meet the needs of this economy and of our people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann reaffirms its approval of the measures contained in the National Plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> This is the fourth occasion that Dáil Éireann has debated the national plan since its publication last October: on each previous occasion the plan was endorsed by the House.  During each of those debates the Government were confronted with contradictory calls and prescriptions which ignored the essential reality of the budgetary constraints.  We have been treated to the same kind of thing this evening. We were told that we had not gone far enough in eliminating the current budget deficit and that Exchequer borrowing was not being reduced quickly enough.  At the same time, we were criticised for cutting Exchequer expenditure too severely, for not reducing taxation and for not spending more money to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Those statements can only be described as ambiguous.  In sharp contrast to those ambiguous statements the national plan is, first and foremost, a realistic plan. I would like to remind the House of some of the features of that plan and how it was drawn up.  One of the earliest decisions made was that we would keep the overall burden of taxation at about present level of 36½ per cent of GNP between now and the end of 1987.  The next important decision was that we took a realistic view of what it would be prudent and possible to borrow over the period of the plan. We have taken as hard a view as we can of that, bearing in mind, first, our obvious development needs and, second, the degree to which it is prudent to finance expenditure by borrowing, both foreign and internal.</P>
    <P>Members of this House would have to agree that once you have made decisions on the levels of taxation and the level of borrowing you have made decisions on the total amount of resources that will be available over the period.  Once you have made decisions on the total amount of resources available over the period, the next set of decisions required consists of the allocation of priorities between different areas of expenditure both current and capital.  That is what this national plan consist of.  That is how it was put together.  We first made the decision to <Col N="952" /> set the limits of the resources that would be available and then we set out in a systematic way to allocate those resources.</P>
    <P>The plan recognises the limitations on Government action in tackling the serious problems facing the country.  It sets out clearly and unambiguously a consistent and achievable set of medium term policies.  Its primary objective is to increase employment and to halt and reverse the upward trend in unemployment. The plan faces up squarely and honestly, without the ambiguity that has characterised the Opposition since it was published, to the urgent need to maintain the jobs of those already in work, to find increasing numbers of new job opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and for those entering the labour force for the first time.</P>
    <P>In addressing the unemployment problem, the plan also faces up honestly to the seriously imbalances in the public finances.  A typical stance of some of the plan's critics is that there should be no reduction in the level of services provided by the State while at the same time advocating that the the level of capital expenditure should be increased dramatically. Such a stance is completely untenable. The inescapable fact is that the level of public expenditure, current and capital, is constrained by what we as a nation are prepared to finance through taxation and sustainable borrowing.  No set of precriptions or criticisms which fail to take account of that can be valid or worth listening to.  Most people, including Deputies on the opposite side of the House, agree that the overall burden of taxation should not be increased.  There is also general agreement that the relative extent of our reliance on borrowing must be reduced if the debt service burden - now pre-empting one-third of all tax revenues - is not to rise further.  It follows therefore that the growth in public expenditure must be curtailed.  The commitment in the plan to stabilise the tax burden and the specific allocations for current and capital expenditure reflects the realities of the public finance constraints.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> The Government have already made progress in getting discretionary current spending under control.  Non-capital supply services expenditure has fallen, albeit rather slowly, as a percentage of GNP since 1983; but this progress has been obscured by the rising burden of debt service payments.  Government current spending has come in within budget in each of the last three years and we have set ourselves the objective of reducing current expenditure by the equivalent of a further two percentage points of GNP by 1987.  To have attempted to go beyond this might have facilitated an increase in capital expenditure, as advocated by some of the plan's critics, but where would they have made the cuts in current expenditure?</P>
    <P>That question is never asked by the critics, but I will ask it.  Do they envisage substantial cuts in social welfare services? Would they reduce the strength of the Garda?  If they decided that they did not want to make cuts in current expenditure, where would they make room on the capital side for extra expenditure?  Would they be prepared to cut the budget of the IDA or the very substancial element of public capital programme expenditure on building and construction?  These questions are never answered by the Opposition or by critics, who have failed miserably to take account of the fact that the constraints about which they speak must be fully taken into account in charting any set of fiscal, economic or social development policies.  The targets for current expenditure set out by the Government are realistic and achievable but they will require firm discipline and the implementation of the economy measures spelt out in the plan.  Many of the most vocal opponents of the plan seem to have a totally uncritical approach to public capital investment and are prepared to expand capital expenditure regardless of whether returns justify it. The Government are not prepared to follow that path.</P>
    <P>The returns from public sector investment over the years have been inadequate and have increased rather than reduced the burden of debt service on <Col N="954" /> taxpayers.  What we are prepared to do &mdash; and the plan makes this clear &mdash; is to increase those areas of capital expenditure which will achieve a return to the taxpayer.  The allegation by Deputy Haughey that the Government are anti public sector is nothing more than a caricature and the kind of bogeyman politics in which he has been indulging for quite a few weeks now.  Deputy Haughey's claim that we are anti public sector takes no account of the measures which we have taken to improve the planning of capital expenditure in the public sector.</P>

The implementation of that planning process by the Government is designed to help the public sector to make the maximum contribution to the economy.

Exchequer capital expenditure under the public capital programme will be increased by about £230 million by 1987 compared with 1984 and our objective is to ensure that the bulk of this additional Exchequer investment will contribute towards improving the productive capacity of the economy with its attendant beneficial effects on employment.  Non-Exchequer investment will reduce by some £200 million by 1987 compared with 1984, reflecting in the main the completion of the ESB's investment in additional generating capacity and completion of the intensive stage of telecommunications investment by Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <P>I have been lonely for him over the past few days.  In some, the national plan seeks to strike a fair balance between the employment needs of the economy and the need to reduce the imbalance in the public finances over the period to 1987.  It seeks to identify the resources available and to allocate them in a rational and efficient manner.  No criticism of the plan which does not identify where other resources would be made available, or how they would be made available, is valid.  No such criticism can stand up because it has no base.  It would have been easy to bring out a more attractive document setting out Utopian targets based on hope rather than on realistic expectations.  The Opposition know all about that.  That is precisely what the Opposition did in October 1982 in the now infamous document known as <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> I am not surprised that the Fianna Fáil Opposition should be proposing that we move away from the plan we published.  They know all about moving away from plans.  A month after they had brought out that plan, they moved away from it and disclaimed all knowledge of it.  They spent quite some time disclaiming any memory of the fact that one of the many things proposed in that plan was the introduction of charges for local services.  We do not hear about that when criticisms are being made of the Government's plan.  At least we have the guts to stick with what we put forward.  We do not run away from it a month or so after it is published. This Government have taken an honest and realistic look at the situation which faces us.</P>

      <P>We have set achievable targets consistent with the likely availability of resources.  Important measures to implement the Government's programme were provided for in the 1985 budget.  They include a radical restructuring of the income tax code which reduced the number of tax bands and eliminated many of the distortions and disincentives to enterprise which had existed.  In addition the VAT system was rationalised and simplified.</P>
      <P>The number of VAT rates was limited to three and the rate of tax was reduced on many of the items which had been the subject of concern because of diversion of trade across the Border.  The general budgetary aggregates for expenditure, revenue and borrowing are consistent with the overall plan policy.</P>

      <P>At the time of publication, the national plan objectives were dismissed by some critics as unrealistic and unattainable.  Again at budget time the Government were accused of unreasonable optimism with regard to the prospects for recovery this year.  However, <Col N="958" /> I can say that the emerging economic outlook for 1985 is well in line with what we set out in the national plan:</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  Strong economic growth is again likely this year following a real increase of over 3½ per cent in national output in 1984, the highest since 1978. The annual rate of inflation at mid-February 1985 had fallen to 6.2 per cent, the lowest in seven years.  The average for the year as a whole is not expected to exceed 6 per cent &mdash; I expect it to be lower than that &mdash; a lower inflation rate then we have seen in 15 years and only about one third of the rate we endured as recently as 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The current deficit in the balance of payments was cut to about 5 per cent of national output in 1984 compared to almost 15 per cent in 1981. Further progress is expected this year. The climate for expansion is more favourable now than at any stage over the past few years.  International prospects are, from the latest assessments, relatively favourable and in line with the assumptions underlying the national plan.  The further easing of international inflation and the more favourable movement in our exchange rate augur well for the pattern of prices in the medium-term.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards unemployment, the increase in the live register for 1984 as a whole, while still disturbingly large at over 17,000, was the lowest for five years.  More significant, perhaps, was the fact that the underlying trend, as reflected in the deseasonalised figures, actually turned down in three months <Col N="959" /> during 1984, for the first time since 1979. This relative improvement, I am pleased to say, has been maintained into 1985. The figures for the past few months are encouraging.  By April, the number of persons on the live register was down by some 6,000 on the early part of this year and, even discounting the favourable seasonal influence, there was a reduction of 1,600 compared with February.  As a result, the year-on-year increase in the register at end-April was the lowest since July 1980.</P>
      <P>The prospects for employment are better now than for some considerable time and this optimism is reflected in the recent assessments published by both the Central Bank and the ESRI.  The bank, in its recent Bulletin, expects total employment to increase during 1985, while in the latest Quarterly Economic Commentary from the ESRI, an employment increase almost sufficient to cater for the forecast growth in the labour force is projected over the next year or so. Both institutions are also predicting an increase in employment in the manufacturing sector during the current year and, in that connection, the most recent figures indicate that, in response to the stabilisation of our competitive position and the strong recovery in output, the decline in manufacturing employment slowed further.  The fall in 1984 was little over half that recorded in each of the two previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the welcome easing in the employment situation, the reality as shown in the plan is that increases in traditional jobs in industry and services will be insufficient to meet the growth in the labour force over the next few years. The plan gave a strong commitment to help the long-term unemployed.  The Government recognised that special measures have to be taken to assist people who have experienced long periods of unemployment and who find it difficult to regain their place in what is a very competitive labour market.  If their motivation suffers or the skills which they <Col N="960" /> may have are lost, it will clearly be difficult for them to take up present or future employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The plan increases the provision for existing schemes for the unemployed, both over and under 25 years of age, and the recently published Estimates gave effect to this.  In order to give particular help to the older, longer-term unemployed person, the Government decided to establish a new social employment scheme, giving part time work on community based projects to people out of work for a year or more.  In addition, AnCO were asked to set up a new &ldquo;alternance&rdquo; scheme which would provide periods of training and practical work experience.  The Minister for Labour has already announced the establishment of the social employment scheme.  The initial reaction has been promising. The first projects are now operating and many other organisations are planning to take the opportunity to employ people under the social employment scheme.</P>
    <P>Over the period of the plan, I am satisfied that these new schemes will make a major contribution towards giving real help to the unemployed.  These programmes, in conjunction with the existing training and work experience schemes, will benefit the participants by bringing them back into the world of work and ensuring that there is a real return to the community.</P>
    <P>The motion put forward by the Opposition calls for measures to alleviate social deprivation.  The Government's arrangements to provide the less well-off in the community with better training facilities is a key component in its strategy to alleviate social deprivation.  Another essential element of the Government's efforts in this area is a developed income-maintenance policy.  Our income maintenance system affords basic protection for those with earning potential but who, for one reason or another, are not currently employed.  Of course, it also affords financial protection for those who are no longer in the labour force.  For example, the old age contributory pension in July next will be the equivalent of 30 per cent <Col N="961" /> of average industrial earnings or 49 per cent where there is a dependent spouse. In after-tax terms, the percentages are considerably higher.  In addition, many ex-employees have supplementary occupational pensions, which supplement the State pension.</P>
    <P>Listening to critics of the Government one might overlook the significant real increases in social welfare payments in recent years.  Between 1977 and 1984, for example, short-term weekly benefits increased in real terms by about 20 per cent and by double this in the case of long-term beneficiaries.  Regarding long-term rates of benefit, the last two budgets provided for increases totalling 20 per cent in respect of the two-year period from mid-1983 to mid-1985, while inflation during this period is unlikely now to exceed 15 per cent.  The Government are providing for a further increase from July next of 6 per cent in short term rates and of 6½ per cent in long term rates of benefit.  These figures speak for themselves and indicate clearly that we are honouring our commitment to keep long term rates of benefit ahead of the cost of living and to keep short term rates at least in line with the rates for work.</P>
    <P>There are two further elements of Government social policy that merit comment. A key element of the Government's income maintenance strategy is to provide more adequately for the children of less well-off families. This is why we have decided, as set out in the plan, to introduce a new, enhanced, child benefit scheme in favour of the less well-off family.  This selectivity will be achieved by treating the child benefit as assessable income for income tax purposes. Furthermore, as an earnest of our commitment to alleviating poverty, legislation has been introduced to establish a Combat Poverty Agency to examine the causes and extent of poverty in our society and to recommend ways of alleviating it.</P>

      <P>At the end of the day increases in national wealth and living <Col N="962" /> standards, as well as in sustainable employment, depend on our ability to produce goods and services which can be sold in a competitive international environment.  We cannot simply award ourselves higher incomes and living standards without regard to that basic fact. This is why the plan puts considerable emphasis on improvements in competitiveness and on wage cost competitiveness as a key requirement for the achievement of this objective. Accordingly, one of the aims of the plan is that average increases in pay in Ireland should not exceed those in competitor countries.  Within that parameter, the plan outlines the need for pay negotiations to have regard to the ability of individual firms to pay and to the likely impact of pay settlements on employment. Put another way, a realistic approach to pay increases must have primary regard to the ability of individual firms to trade effectively on international markets and to the need to preserve and expand employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay objective of the plan must be seen in the context of declines in wage cost competitiveness in recent years.  In the five-year period between 1979 and 1984, for example, the increase in hourly earnings in manufacturing industry in Ireland was more than 25 per cent greater than that in our main competitors in national currency terms.  Even after taking account of exchange rate changes the increase in Irish earnings was still some 4 per cent faster than in those of our competitors.  This loss in wage cost competitiveness has contributed to the significant decline in manufacturing employment in recent years, as well as to <Col N="963" /> a deterioration in the climate for new employment creation.</P>
    <P>I wish to dwell for a moment on the question of employment creation.  Our manufacturing sector has made enormous strides even in the past two years, in difficult times, in gaining market share abroad.  The growth in the volume of our exports has been faster than the growth in the markets to which we export.</P>

      <P>Having heard the Minister, one realises that he is even more removed and remote from the people than one would have imagined.  The same can be said for the Government as a whole.  Perhaps in terms of his political peace of mind, the Minister is lucky though eventually he will have to face reality and when that day comes he will not be able to build on the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this lengthy contribution the Minister trotted out the same political jargon that he used here two and a half years ago. Government is about economic management. It is about deciding the lifestyle and the standard of living the people enjoy.  Can the Minister justifiably and credibly say that the country has benefited since the return to office of the present administration?  The Minister is an intelligent man.  He cannot believe that we have benefited in the past two and a half years.  Can he believe either that the academic exercise in which he has indulged in the past half hour will be accepted by the people as a credible response from a senior Government Minister in dealing with the country's <Col N="964" /> very serious economic problems?  The Minister has gone through an exercise of pretending to defend a plan which he knows, as we all know, is a total failure. Would it not be far more credible for him to admit that the Government's initial projections were wrong, that their plans, well intentioned though they may have been, will not succeed in terms of the economic development of the nation? These plans have gone entirely astray.  It is necessary, half way through the lifespan of the Government, that is, if they intend continuing in office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Government are serious about continuing in office they owe it to the people and the House to redraw and reformulate a plan which will at least commence tackling the economic problems which the Minister admits exist, a plan which will commence tackling and not contributing to these problems over whatever length of time is left to this Government.  It is a shame that the Government did not avail of the opportunity provided for them by the leader of our party and this party generally to review what I was going to call a plan, the document called <i>Building on Reality</i>.  We could then have assessed the plan objectively, recognised its total failure and together put forward a salvage plan which this country needs and needs badly at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise to support the motion which has been tabled by Fianna Fáil, not for the purpose of highlighting the many failures of this Government since they came to office; as I already said, the evidence of those failures is tragically demonstrated right across our economy.  Many of them, although not all, were clearly identified by our leader in his opening contribution to this debate here this evening.  In a similar professional manner, the Minister <Col N="965" /> for Finance sidestepped all the points raised by Deputy Haughey which are relevant and important to the future development of this country.</P>
    <P>I am not contributing to this debate for the purpose of political point scoring. The situation is now far too serious for that approach.  It was a pity that the Minister, instead of pointing the finger of accusation at this side of the House, did not face up to the many relevant headings brought to his notice by Deputy Haughey.  The Minister knows that he sidestepped the important issues raised. He knows better than most that those issues are the most relevant as far as the development of this economy and our planning for the future are concerned.</P>
    <P>As a party, we tabled this motion because we believe that it is in the national interest at this time that we call on the Government to abandon this document which cannot now be described in any way as a plan and which, if pursued, would do further irreparable damage to our economy.  It must be said that it was never regarded by Fianna Fáil as a credible plan and time is now proving, as in so many other instances, that our verdict and our judgment on it when it was first introduced were correct.  Neither was it considered to be a credible or an authentic document by many independent economic and political commentators.  There are also very many serious thinking people, ordinary citizens, who cast grave doubts on its authenticity when it was first introduced.  Unfortunately, they are now the victims and are experiencing the worst effects of the provisions of this socalled plan.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that credible commentators at the time of its introduction thought that the plan perhaps had some little thing to offer and that even they are now changing their minds in relation to where it will lead our economy and our people.  Day after day, week after week, month after month, when we read articles by the various economic commentators, political correspondents and people who comment generally on the performance of Governments, we see they are beginning to realise also that <Col N="966" /> this plan will not and cannot achieve the objectives which the Government told our people it would achieve.  This failure and the proposals contained in the plan and the misleading statements in it are nothing new to this Government.  They came to Government following the last general election on a whole wide-ranging series of promises which they told the people they would implement if they were returned to office.  Fair enough, a small minority of the people, the floating vote, took them at their word and decided that they would give an alternative Government a chance.  They believed that what they were told on the platform would be fulfilled by the Government when they came to office.  Those people are sadly disillusioned now.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself knows that not only are the floating, marginal voters disillusioned, but many sound, solvent and credible supporters of his own party are also disillusioned.  It is arrogant for him to stand boldly before us and pretend that the plan was still being pursued and would still achieve the objectives which the Government stated it would achieve. It is nothing short of misleading to suggest that.  They misled the people before the general election by the introduction of the plan and they are still continuing in this House deliberately to hoodwink the people into believing that, somehow or other, that plan will achieve the stated objectives.</P>
    <P>Everybody in Government, from the Taoiseach down, still refers to this plan as their blueprint for economic development. The reality is that the plan and specific aspects of it have long since been abandoned by individual members of the Cabinet in the interests of political expediency. I would not disagree with and can understand the reason for some Ministers wishing to distance themselves from some of the proposals contained in that document.  I am very concerned that the conflicting decisions taken by individual Ministers for their own perhaps selfish political reasons are not based on some sustainable economic or political criterion. Once Ministers decide to go their own way, as is happening now, and make <Col N="967" /> their own individual political statements, the whole credibility of Government is undermined and the team effort and the unity of purpose are gone.  That is what is happening in this House at present. Ministers are departing from certain unattractive aspects of the plan in the interest of political expediency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  With the permission of the Chair I should like to share my time with Deputy Noonan.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because of the recent trend in the dairy industry of flouting the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, and in particular in respect of section 32.  That section states as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may by order make regulations for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(a) requiring that the calculation of the price to be paid for all milk and cream supplied to any premises to which the regulations apply shall be made on the basis of the percentage of butter-fat or other prescribed constituent contained in the milk or cream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adherence to that section is nothing more or less than what I am demanding. I regard the trend of payment on a flat rate basis as a retrograde step because it pays no attention to the content of solids <Col N="968" /> in the milk which, at the end of the day, is the only portion of the milk that matters.</P>
    <P>The present situation has no regard for the improvement of breeding programmes or the management of dairy herds.  There is no incentive for the farmer to improve his breed or to feed cattle at a higher level of intake.  It is most inappropriate now to allow this flat rate system to continue because of the constraints of the super-levy.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing about the problems of the super-levy for the past 12 months and tonight the Minister is trying to recover some lost ground in Brussels. With the constraints of the super-levy and the threshold beyond which we cannot go it would be appropriate to avail of the increase we are allowed on the constituents of milk.  We are allowed an annual increase of 0.06 per cent in butter-fat and an unlimited increase in protein.  If there is a constraint on volume, why not go for an increase in constituents?  However, the Department say they are not interested in the solids content of milk, that they are not interested in enforcing the Act.  Illegal practices are allowed to occur, namely, payment by volume. When a farmer takes the white liquid to the creamery or to the co-op he will be paid the same price as the farmer who takes the same volume of milk but containing a much higher fat and a higher protein percentage.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister of State should be present in the House tonight because he has promoted the testing and recording of milk at farmer level through the milk records co-op.  Now, an increasing number of the more efficient farmers are getting a print-out not alone of the yield and volume of milk but also of the fat, protein and solids.  One section of the Department are encouraging farmers to produce milk with a high solids content and it is incomprehensible to find another section of the Department allowing the co-operatives to pay for milk on a flat rate basis, taking no account of solids.</P>
    <P>The flat rate price is unfair to the farmer who is working hard to improve his dairy herd and the constituents in the <Col N="969" /> milk he is supplying.  It is also unfair to the processors.  They are told every day they should diversify from traditional products and get into the higher revenue, more sophisticated products.  Products such as cream liqueurs have been trotted out as an example of the way the industry should go.  How can the industry go in that direction if the Department who are responsible for implementing the regulations are allowing those regulations to be flouted in regard to the payment for milk? Surely it is in the interests of processing plants and co-operatives to get milk that contains the highest possible levels of fat, protein and lactose.  I am asking not only for this section of the Act to be implemented but I am also asking the Minister to make an order or a regulation extending the payments system to protein or lactose so that the entire solids in milk will be covered.</P>
    <P>No doubt the excuse will be given that a review body in the Department are looking into the matter and that the whole question is being considered. Those old excuses are no good.  It is about time we gave up considering matters and having review bodies.  All those excuses have run out.  We are in the EC.  We are competing with countries such as The Netherlands and Denmark who are showing us the way.  They are paying their farmers 104 per cent of the target price for milk but, on the other hand, we are paying on average only 85 per cent to our farmers.  The major reason for our small price to the farming community is the low butter-fat, protein and lactose content in milk.</P>
    <P>In the price negotiations in recent years the level of protein is weighted as more important than butter-fat.  We have here an opportunity to increase the incomes of farmers by availing of the increases allowed on butter-fat and protein, thus allowing them to compete with the other dairying industries in the Community.  I am calling on the Minister to enforce the Act and, as a matter of urgency, he should extend the section to cover payment in respect of protein and lactose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad to have the opportunity of supporting Deputy J. Walsh.  One could say that the time is now overdue to consider again the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, with particular reference to section 32.  It is important to repeat what Deputy Walsh has stated.  The purpose of that section of that Act is to pay for milk on the basis of butter-fat content and other prescribed constituents.  It is clear that the provisions of this section are daily being flouted and that the Minister and his Department are allowing this illegal situation to continue and develop.  Surely that section of that Act should either be enforced or repealed. The current situation is ridiculous and nothing short of a farce.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and his Department are interested in building up a strong, well bred dairying herd here, then butter fat and protein testing is imperative.  The farmer should be paid on the solid contents of his milk, including protein, butter fat and lactose.  I say protein also deliberately because we should be moving in that direction.  I am glad to note that some dairy co-operatives are already paying on protein content of milk in addition to the butter fat content.</P>
      <P>It might be as well to remind the Minister that there is before the House at present a Bill for the control of bulls for breeding, whose purpose is to improve and maintain the quality of Irish cattle. In the absence of proper butter fat and protein testing how can the AI stations and other people carrying out progeny testing ensure that the best breeds are provided?  The Department should enforce standards to ensure that the quality of our dairy cattle is of the best.  If this trend continues the quality of our dairy breeds will be adversely affected; there is no doubt about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear time and time again of the importance of agriculture to our economy, that it accounts for upwards of one-third of our total exports.  The time is long overdue to take a long hard look at the situation developing with regard to our dairy produce.  As Deputy J. Walsh rightly pointed out, we are now being asked by the consumer to diversify <Col N="971" /> into other areas of production.  Yet an illegal situation is allowed by the Department to obtain under which the provisions of the 1924 Dairy Produce Act are being flouted.  I know the Minister will advance all sorts of excuses but I contend that where there is the will there is the way.  As a man of integrity, of considerable knowledge in this area, I am sure the Minister of State will see the injustice of the situation and that he will take the necessary action immediately before any further damage is done.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of the dairying industry to our economy it is essential that overall national interests be considered. In this instance I fear they are not being considered or safeguarded.  We are mainly an exporting country.  Therefore, in regard to not alone the dairy sector but the whole cattle industry it is essential that the standard of our breeding stock be maintained and the only way this can be done is through a proper system of testing of solids in milk.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate that the law is being broken daily and, for some reason unknown to all of us, the Department appear to be taking no action.  I know that the penalties are totally out of date, not in keeping with present day trends. The time is well overdue for action to be taken to update the law.  Surely it is not that complicated to introduce legislation ensuring that the necessary penalties for breaches of the provisions of the Act are in keeping with present day costs. I hope as a result of this motion that the Minister will extend the provisions of the 1924 Dairy Produce Act to allow for modern, automated methods of testing of milk for butter fat, protein and lactose. Therefore we appeal to the Minister to do something immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for two very sincere contributions.  I certainly approve of that type of contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this speech on the Estimates for Agriculture on Friday last the Minister himself pointed out that the Dairy Produce <Col N="972" /> Act, 1924, was in need of updating, that a special group had already been set up in the Department to review the position in consultation with representatives of the Irish Dairy Council &mdash; a body representative of the various interests in the dairying industry &mdash; and the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>Any change in the basis for the calculation of the price to be paid for milk and cream supplied to registered creameries will be one element of the package.  It is intended also to introduce a number of other technological and production provisions, in the revised legislation, to take account of the changes which have take place in the dairy industry over the past 60 years and the varying demands.  We are aware that some milk purchasers are not complying with the present legislation. I certainly would not condone that type of activity.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, the penalties of £10 and £20 are a joke and are not effective.  I agree that the legislation must be updated to ensure that the interests of the dairy sector are properly safeguarded.  I will do my utmost to ensure that the legislation is expedited.</P>
    <P>One must not overlook the position of the producers in this regard.  They must bear in mind their own particular requirements and their trading arrangements with their co-operatives.  Farmer's representatives have a role to play and it is in their interests to ensure that payment is based on proper standards and that the price paid is related to the appropriate level of protein or butter fat content.  As things stand at the moment the legislation does not help much in preventing the application of a flat rate price and consequently we must amend it and bring the penalties up to a more realistic level if we are to ensure better prices for protein and butter fat content.</P>
    <P>Under the super-levy quota system testing for butter fat to establish individual and purchaser average fat levels will be mandatory and penalties for non-compliance with this requirement will be pitched at a more realistic level than those at present prescribed in the 1924 Dairy Produce Act. <Col N="973" /> In relation to the quality of our herds, I appreciate the points made.  The people in the business of producing milk, with the guidance of their co-op managers, have been producing the type of cow needed for the product eminently well.  I do not see any dramatic change in that area.  For instance, in the liquid milk area one might have thought that we would be going for more gallons long ago.  The <Col N="974" /> extraordinary thing was that the people supplying liquid milk produced some of the best quality milk.  I agree with the Deputies and I give a commitment here that the updating of the legislation will be a matter of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement to which the Deputy refers.  What is important in the case of Whitegate is the extra cost to the national economy, if any, arising from its operation.  In 1984 the apparent gross <Col N="778" /> extra cost was $9.4 million but this must be adjusted to allow for the storage factor.  When allowance is made for the value to the economy of the financing cost of strategic stocks held at Whitegate, which would have to be held whether the refinery was operating or not, then the real net cost in 1984 was not significant. This is without taking any account of the strategic and security considerations involved.  It is assumed for the purpose of the calculations to arrive at $9.4 million that if Whitegate was not operating, the products would be replaced at the average prices of imports.  At present Whitegate petrol is, in fact, cheaper than the estimated average price of imports.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann to evaluate proposals for the supply of natural gas to particular consumers or areas.  The extension of supply to population centres such as those mentioned by the Deputy which do not have an existing supply of town gas will be considered in due course but it would not be realistic to assume a likelihood of supply for some considerable time.  I must emphasise that commercially viable markets as well as proximity to the main trunk pipelines are major factors in determining whether or not it would be economic to supply natural gas to a particular area.</P>

      <P>In August 1984 the Government authorised me in my capacity as Leader of the House to propose to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges detailed measures for the broadcasting, in edited form, of Dáil, Seanad and Oireachtas committee debates.  In October 1984 the Dáil CPP approved the broadcasting proposals and established a sub-committee which was later joined by a sub-committee of the Seanad CPP to deal with <Col N="780" /> technical aspects of implementation of broadcasting such as the use of ambience microphones, equipment requirements, cue commentary, etc.</P>
      <P>A difficulty emerged in relation to accommodation for RTE for an Oireachtas broadcasting studio in that accommodation was not available within Leinster House.  This difficulty has now been resolved by the allocation of accommodation in No. 28 Molesworth Street to RTE.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, RTE have been working on a detailed equipment specification, seeking quotations, etc.  The preparation and equipping of the accommodation are being progressed by the Office of Public Works and RTE in detailed consultation with each other.</P>
      <P>In relation to a date for the commencement of broadcasting, every effort is being made by the parties concerned to initiate the project before the summer recess this year.  It may be, however, that due to the work involved in the renovation and adaptation of the accommodation, the installation of communication cables, and the equipping of the studio, the summer recess may precede slightly our readiness to commence broadcasting. In that event, broadcasting should begin immediately after the summer recess.</P>

      <P>The question of further <Col N="789" /> designations of rivers and lakes under the EC Freshwater Fish Directive (78/659/EEC) is kept under review by my Department in consultation with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. The question of including the Lakes of Killarney will be considered when additional designations are being made.</P>
      <P>The recent completion of work on the Killarney sewerage treatment works at an estimated cost of £2.1 million should considerably improve the water quality of the lakes.  The treatment plant is one of the most modern in the country.  It will provide adequate capacity for the expanding population of Killarney and rectify the problem of overloading that has occurred in recent years, thereby reducing the organic load and producing a better standard of effluent.  As the waste water from the town contains a relatively high concentration of phosphorus, provision has been made for its removal by precipitation and this should make a significant contribution towards arresting advancement of eutrophication in the lakes.</P>
      <P>Additional protection of the lakes will be provided by the Fossa Road sewer which is at present under construction. This will intercept various sewage discharges, and will direct them to the treatment works, thus removing a number of potential sources of pollution.</P>

      <P>The conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension require a person (i) to have entered into insurance before reaching a prescribed age, (ii) to have reckonable contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment and (iii) to have a yearly <Col N="805" /> average of at least 20 reckonable contributions, paid or credited, from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The employment of the first of the persons concerned ceased to be insurable in March 1953.  He did not again become insurable until 1 April 1974, as a result of the abolition of the remuneration limit for insurance purposes on the earnings of non-manual employees which operated prior to that date.  He had a total of 313 reckonable contributions in the relevant average test period which was from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1980 in his case. This is equal to a yearly average of only 11 and he does not, therefore, quality for the pension.</P>
      <P>The employment of the second person concerned ceased to be insurable in the 1949-50 contribution year before the coming into operation (in January 1953) of the Social Welfare Acts.  He, also, did not become insurable again until 1 April 1974.  He had, however, already reached the prescribed age for condition (i), age 60 in his case, before this date so that this entry into insurance under the Social Welfare Acts could not be regarded as satisfying that condition.  Taking his pre-1953 insurance into account in order to satisfy that condition his yearly average for condition (iii) then falls to be calculated over the period from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1977.  He had a total of only 255 contributions in this period including pre-entry credits for the period from 1 January 1973 to 31 March 1974. This gives a yearly average of only ten contributions so he, also, does not qualify for the pension.</P>

      <P>As conveyed to the Deputy <Col N="830" /> in reply to a question asked by him in October 1983, the claim of the person concerned to a deserted wife's payment was disallowed for the reasons that her husband had not of his own volition left her and she had not made reasonable efforts within the means available to her to prevail on him to support her and her children.  This decision was upheld by an appeals officer following an oral hearing of her case in June 1983.  Her case was again submitted to the appeals officer, upon receipt of representations from the Deputy on behalf of the claimant, for further consideration.  The appeals officer decided that the representations did not contain any new evidence which would warrant a revision of his decision.  The decision of an appeals officer is final in the absence of fresh facts or new evidence.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 12 May 1983 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an occupational accident on that date. Pending the completion of investigations arising from the accident he was awarded disability benefit on an interim basis from <Col N="841" /> 13 May and all benefit due was paid in respect of the period to 30 August 1983.</P>
      <P>Benefit was then discontinued following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was not then incapable of work.  The decision was upheld on appeal by an appeals officer. Following investigations injury benefit was allowed and injury benefit over and above the disability benefit paid has been issued.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit from 19 July 1984 and all benefit due, including pay-related benefit, was paid to 16 January 1985, the end of the maximum 26 week injury benefit period.</P>
      <P>From that date payment of disability benefit would normally have been made but according to the Department's records the person concerned did not have any contributions paid or credited on his behalf in the 1983-84 contribution year which governed his entitlement to benefit at that stage.</P>
      <P>It has now been established that he has a full contribution record for that year and all arrears of disability and pay-related benefit have now been issued.</P>
      <P>He also claimed disablement benefit and was provisionally assessed as 70 per cent disabled in respect of the period from 18 January 1985 to 10 October 1985. Disablement pension accordingly was awarded and all benefit due to date has been paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was employed on a part time basis from 6 April 1983 and her employer deducted PRSI contributions at the Class A rate in respect of this employment.  She was in receipt of unemployment benefit from 31 January 1983 in respect of the days she did not work and exhausted her entitlement of 312 days on 7 December 1984.</P>
      <P>Before her future entitlement could be decided a question arose as to the correct rate of PRSI contribution applicable to her part time employment since 6 April 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevant regulations relating to part time employment provide that where such employment is for less than 18 hours a week and the person is not mainly dependent for his or her livelihood on the remuneration received therefrom, the employment is insurable <Col N="843" /> at the Class J rate of contribution.  This contribution provides cover for occupational injury benefits only.</P>
    <P>A deciding officer held that the person concerned was not mainly dependent on the earnings from her part time employment and decided that the employment was therefore insurable at the Class J rate of contribution up to 6 February 1985, the date up to which the decision was sought.  She was advised of this decision on 18 April 1985 and also of her right of appeal.  She has not so far exercised this right.  She has also been advised that she can apply for a refund of the excess contributions paid on her behalf during the period from 6 April 1983 to 6 February 1985.</P>
    <P>Since 6 February 1985, the person concerned has worked for at least 18 hours each week in which she was employed (with the exception of one week) and a Class A contribution has been paid for these weeks.  However, she cannot requalify for unemployment benefit in the current benefit year (January 1985 to December 1985) because the contributions paid in the contribution year which now governs her entitlement to benefit, that is 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 were, in accordance with the deciding officer's decision, properly payable at the Class J rate of contribution and are not reckonable for payment of unemployment benefit.  The contributions at the Class A rate which are being paid in the current contribution year will not count towards satisfying the relevant contribution conditions for benefit until the benefit year which starts on 5 January 1987.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 15 December 1984 but his entitlement could not be determined until inquiries had been made to establish that his employment during the governing contribution period was insurable at a class of contribution which provided cover against unemployment.  These inquiries were recently completed and payment of unemployment benefit was allowed at the maximum weekly rate of £96.55 being the appropriate rate for a married man with four child dependants.  All arrears of unemployment benefit due amounting to £1,094.25 issued to him on 19 April 1985.</P>
      <P>He is at present employed on two days a week and he proves unemployment for the other four days and is in receipt of £64.40 unemployment benefit weekly for these days.  Further weekly payments of this amount will continue to be made as they fall due.  He has insufficient earnings in the relevant income tax year to qualify for payment of pay-related benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">

      <P>EC Regulations lay down that inspections under the ewe premium scheme must take place within 100 days of the closing day fixed by a member state for accepting applications under that scheme.  The closing day of 15 March was fixed by my Department in consultation with the IFA national sheep committee so as to allow inspections to start from 18 March onward.  An extension of the closing date at this late stage would invalidate these arrangements and would mean that flocks inspected between 18 March and an extended date would have to be inspected again.  Because of the disproportionate cost involved in reinspections and also <Col N="846" /> bearing in mind that the closing date of 15 March was advertised twice in the national, local and farming press and that application forms were posted by the Department to all previous applicants, an extension of the closing date could not now be justified to facilitate the very small percentage of flockowners who failed to observe the published dateline.</P>

I understand from the Commissioners of Public Works that they will shortly be in a position to furnish to my Department their recommendations on the sketch plans submitted to them by the school authorities, and I am asking the commissioners to expedite the matter as much as possible. It is not possible to say at this stage when the new school is likely to be completed.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning of the proposed new secondary school for girls in Swords has reached the stage where my Department awaits the submission of amended working drawings by the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also recently approved the provision of another post primary school, for boys and girls, in Swords, under the control of the County Dublin Vocational <Col N="851" /> Education Committee.  The school will open in short term accommodation in September 1985.  Architectural planning of the new permanent school building will be initiated as soon as possible.  I am satisfied that there will be sufficient post primary accommodation in Swords to cater for all pupils in the area seeking places next September.</P>
    <P>There are no plans for the provision of a post primary school in the Portrane/Donabate area in the immediate future as pupil numbers would not warrant it.</P>

      <P>The payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is primarily a matter for the employer concerned.  On payment of the lump sum, the employer can then apply to my Department for a rebate of 60 per cent of the statutory amount.  The Department has not yet received a formal claim for payment of a rebate to this employer in respect of a statutory redundancy lump sum to the employee concerned.</P>
      <P>If the employee has not received a lump sum payment, he should apply in writing to the employer.  If the employer does not pay but issues him with a redundancy certificate, the employee can apply to my Department for payment from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  If the employer does not pay the lump sum and fails to issue a redundancy certificate, the employee can submit an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to establish his entitlement.  I am writing to the Deputy advising him in more detail of the procedures to be followed by the worker in claiming a redundancy lump sum and by the employer in claiming a rebate.</P>

      <P>It is open to a trade union of workers and to individual employers to complain to the Labour Court that an employer is not complying with the terms of a registered employment agreement.  The court will investigate the complaint and if it is well founded, direct the employer to comply. It is an offence for an employer not to carry out a Labour Court order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A relatively small number of complaints have been received by the court since the registration of the agreement in 1984.  Two cases are likely to go forward to formal court hearings.  In the other <Col N="856" /> cases, either the employers complained about have complied with the terms of the agreement or the complaints have not been well founded.</P>
    <P>The general inspectorate of my Department investigates any complaints by individual workers that an employer is in breach of the agreement.  To date, five such complaints have been received and investigated.  In two of these cases, underpayments have been rectified; in one, there were no breaches of the agreement; in another, the firm had ceased operation and in the fifth, the firm has been advised of the agreement and asked to comply.</P>
