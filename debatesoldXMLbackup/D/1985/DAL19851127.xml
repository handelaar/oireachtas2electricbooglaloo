      <P>I thank the House for giving me permission to conclude on behalf of my Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien.  I know we all wish him well and hope he will have a speedy return to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank those Deputies who contributed to the debate for the welcome they have given the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill, though, in itself a somewhat limited measure, has given Deputies an opportunity of discussing in a broader way the Housing Finance Agency's loan scheme and how its operation has benefited house <Col N="241" /> purchasers.  The scheme continues to prove popular with persons with modest incomes who, by reason of the income-related repayment scheme and low deposit, can aspire to owning their own house.  The measures proposed in this Bill are necessary to ensure that the agency continue to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>The most significant provision of the Bill is that of increasing the limit on borrowings of the agency from £200 million to £500 million.  The limit, as I explained in the opening debate, must be applied to the normal value of the agency's borrowing and not to a somewhat lower figure.  In fact, £16 million of the proceeds to the agency are stock issues.  This distinction lends some urgency to having the Bill enacted as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Some of the contributions during the debate ranged over the housing area in a wider sense than that comprehended by this Bill.  The House will have an opportunity in the near future of having a full discussion on many aspects of housing when we come to deal with the more extensive Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, recently presented by me.  No doubt, many of the views and sentiments expressed in the course of the debate on the present Bill will be heard again and I shall be responding to them in detail at that stage.  I shall conclude, therefore, by thanking Deputies for their support for the present measure, the enactment of which will enable the Housing Finance Agency to continue to help persons of modest means to achieve the worthwhile goal of owning their own home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The understanding was that it was quite unusual for a substitute to be put in in the middle of a reply to the Second Stage of a Bill and I could have been ruled out of order had I not got the permission of the House.  By agreement it was decided that I should make a very brief reply in order to allow me pass on my thanks to Deputies who had contributed to the Bill and who had been helpful on Second Stage and to allow me to indicate that we have another Bill, a Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, to which the various points raised in relation to the building and construction industry are more appropriate. I hope we will debate that Bill in the House before the recess and we will have an opportunity then to deal with the points made by Deputy Molloy and other speakers at greater length, rather than be interrupted and told now that it is not pertinent to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we raised many points on Second Stage which would be more relevant to the housing Bill which has been circulated.  It would be helpful if the Minister could reply to those on that occasion, but other points relating strictly to the provisions of this Bill were made.  If the Minister is not able to reply because of what happened I accept it, but in my experience both Ministers sit in the one Department and if the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, had prepared his reply to the debate and was unable to be here to deliver it, surely it would have been possible for the Minister to have delivered that reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill if it is operated in the right spirit.  I hope it will not be regarded by some people as a soft touch like some of the semi-State agencies such as Údarás na Gaeltachta. Údarás na Gaeltachta went into some of the companies involved first as an associate company and got a grant and the associate company got into trouble and more money had to be given and eventually that company was wound up.</P>
      <P>How can the Minister be sure that the NDC will not compete with the IDA, SFADCo and Údarás na Gaeltachta? Who in the Department will monitor a possible conflict of interests?  If a conflict emerges, what machinery is in the Bill to enable the Minister to say &ldquo;halt&rdquo;?  Secondly, who will audit the companies set up by the NDC?  Is it the Comptroller and Auditor General?  If it is, I would ask the Minister to think again.  The Minister must be aware that there are subsidiary companies in the semi-State sector which have not been audited since 1981.</P>

      <P>That is most reassuring. That is vital to the credibility of the NDC. There are many fields open to the NDC and when the Bill is in operation I hope they will concentrate mainly on natural resources, that they will stimulate local initiative so that one does not have to have a foreign accent, a flashy car and a <Col N="245" /> black attache case with several airline labels attached to it before one gets a grant.  There is a feeling about certain State agencies at the moment that one has to be in that position to get a grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is impartial and the Deputy should withdraw that remark. However, one can expect anything from Deputy Molloy.  He comes from a part of the country where anything goes.  I was speaking about the common belief in rural Ireland regarding native industry. County development teams are supposed to be in charge of small industries but the amount of refusals that they are sending to local enterprises is unbelievable and that is why I say that there is a common belief that the IDA frown on local initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the National Development Corporation will stimulate a new awareness in the fishing industry, tourism, agriculture and forestry.  Does the Minister realise that the fishing industry is stagnant and that the agency responsible has repossessed 25 trawlers in the last 12 <Col N="246" /> months?  If the NDC are to be worthwhile they should encourage fishermen to concentrate on fish processing.  It is ridiculous that there are factory ships anchored 70 miles out and that some of our fishermen would prefer to give their catch to the foreign trawler factory ship rather than to the local fish merchant.  There must be a reason for that.  Some local fish merchants have got rich overnight.  I know some are doing a good job but there are a couple of fly-by-nights also.  I hope that the NDC will go into the market-place in the different ports, encourage the fishermen to form co-operatives and give more money to the genuine enterpreneur who has a good fish processing factory.</P>
    <P>The NDC have a glorious opportunity to develop and promote tourism.  I have no hesitation in saying that Bord Fáilte are doing a great job in difficult circumstances. They have to subsidise too many lame ducks and to compete against international agencies who have unlimited resources.  Tourism will be the biggest industry in the nineties.  Are we ready for it?  The NDC can play a very positive role in this regard.  From forecasts, in the nineties there will be a four day week, early retirement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The NDC have a glorious opportunity to monitor and motivate the different agencies, preferably on a county basis.  The regional tourist agencies would not exist but for the fact that they are heavily subsidised by Bord Fáilte.  I can see the NDC playing a positive role in stimulating local initiative.  I will have to diverge to develop my point.  In my county there are several tourist organisations or promotional agencies in different towns and parishes.  They may be dealing with the Ballybunion Bachelor <Col N="247" /> Festival, the Tralee Festival, Dingle tourism, south-west Kerry, Killarney tourism and Tralee tourism and are all competing against one another.  If all those groups formed a company it would be to the benefit of all and the NDC could provide the money and monitor it on a county basis.</P>
      <P>I can also see a positive role for the NDC in regard to travel to and from this country.  In the south-west there has been no ferry from Cork to Swansea for the past two years.  Moves are now afoot in Pembroke County Council in Britain, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation, Killarney Urban Council, Kerry County Council and Tralee Urban Council to form a company to charter a ferry from Pembroke to Cork and <i>vice versa.</i> The NDC could ask those various interests to form a company to get that ferry moving.  Under this Bill we could have a debate on fisheries, tourism, farming and forestry.  I wish the Bill well and I will have a lot more to say on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend a welcome to the Bill in general but I want to sound a note of caution.  There may be conflicting views in the House and in the country at large as to what the National Development Corporation propose to do.  In some quarters they are seen as a panacea corporation which will pick up the tab for any sector which may run into difficulties whereby the State could intervene, shore it up and let it continue indefinitely to provide employment at any cost.  I do not believe that that is the intention of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NDC are a constructive, extra tier which will help to monitor the areas where an involvement by them or a similar body could be beneficial.  Unlike other speakers, I believe that the competition which the NDC will provide could be beneficial in the sense that it will sharpen the other State agencies in the job promoting area and put them under a certain amount of pressure.  I have often said in the past that the State agencies involved <Col N="248" /> in the job promotion areas do not respond nearly as quickly as one would like.  Form personal experience in dealing with constituents I think too great an onus is placed on the applicant or the person proposing a project to follow it up.  There is not a fast enough response or follow-up on the part of the existing State agencies.  Perhaps the NDC will be able to galvanise those agencies into greater activity.  I am not reflecting my own views here: I am merely relaying the views of people I represent and I know that these views have been stated by Members on all sides.</P>
    <P>The motivating factor in business and enterprise has always been and must now be profit-making.  The blessing of any agency, whether it be the NDC, the IDA or ICC, will not improve things unless the enterprise in question is viable in its own right.  The NDC will have to be discerning and discriminating in the way they go about their business.  They will have to be certain that, wherever they become involved, the national coffers are protected in the sense that taxpayers' money will not be spent wildly or lavishly on something that is not likely to succeed. However, I accept there are many areas in which one would expect the NDC to become involved.  I do not believe the NDC will resolve our major problem overnight &mdash; I refer to the problem of unemployment.  They will contribute to a resolution of that problem but they cannot resolve it immediately.</P>
    <P>I referred to the competition that might be created among existing agencies.  We know that some agencies have not responded as quickly as they should have but I hope the intervention of the NDC will improve that response.  I hope the NDC will not operate at the same speed as some of the existing organisations.  The underlying factor is the importance of competition.  State agencies should compete, without overlapping, in the field of job creation and the promotion of commercial enterprise.  They should try to ensure that the money of the State is spent in a worthwhile fashion.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill well and I hope that all the positive elements are realised.  I hope <Col N="249" /> in a few years time people will not get the impression that the State has a crock of gold to provide money for any madcap scheme or lame duck industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my concern at the proposals in the Bill. It is absolutely unnecessary to establish an organisation such as the NDC here.  It is well know that this is the result of the political marriage between the Labour Party on the left and Fine Gael on the right.  It is part of the bargain that was struck, that the NDC would be established to satisfy the Labour element in the Government.</P>
      <P>I am afraid there is a tendency here to create many organisations in the belief that they will solve our problems.  The tragedy of unemployment which is affecting our country so seriously at present could be more readily tackled if the Government sought to create the environment for investment.  This would allow the market place to operate successfully, with rewards given for endeavour and, as the previous speaker pointed out, it would allow profits to be made. The market place would respond adequately and the result would be an increase in employment.  This would remove one of the greatest blots on the economy, where so many of our people have no opportunity to work and have no hope of obtaining work in the foreseeable future.  As a result, a huge number of our young people are in despair of ever getting an opportunity to work and to settle down in their own country.  As a consequence of this there has been a massive increase in emigration.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that were the Government to introduce an attractive tax regime to ease the massive burden of personal taxation and to remove the disincentives built into the present system, it would bring much better results than could be achieved through the establishment of yet another State organisation.  That organisation will try to deal in an artificial way with the problems that confront the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the NDC well but I do not see that they will have any great success.  We <Col N="250" /> are fidding around with the problem. The Government have failed to realise that the problem has to do with the climate here, where there is a massive disincentive to people to invest money in worthwhile projects because there is no return and where personal taxation levels are so high that there is a disincentive to work.  We are forcing a brain drain out of the country because of the structure of the personal income tax system.  It is very difficult to hold on to the highly qualified personnel.  The motivators and innovators are leaving the country because there are no rewards here for them.  I do not believe another layer of bureaucracy under the guise of the NDC will solve our difficulties.  Until the Government and the country face up to these problems and until the Government implement policies that will create the right environment, I do not think we will have any great success.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to have to say these words.  When we bring forward legislation to achieve the results all of us wish for, at least that legislation should have built into it the ingredients for success. That has not happened in this case.  It is a political sop to keep the Labour element quiet.  It is something they can point out to their supporters as their achievement. Socialism in this area in unnecessary.  It is excessive.  For the continuation of this Government we are being asked to pay a heavy price.  An organisation of this kind will not result in the establishment of enterprises that will operate successfully and provide employment.  I hope I am proved wrong but I have no faith whatever in the success of the NDC.  Its very birth was for the wrong reasons.  It was forced on the country as a sweetener to keep the Labour Party in this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to reply to the remarks of Deputy Durkan.  He said that, while the NDC should be active in seeking new opportunities for investment that would not otherwise be found, he was very concerned to ensure that the national coffers <Col N="251" /> would be protected, that the taxpayers' money would be invested only in a manner that would ensure it would earn a return for the taxpayers.  I assure Deputy Durkan that the terms of the Bill were devised very carefully in order to achieve the objectives he has in mind.</P>
      <P>By putting the NDC on a statutory basis we are ensuring that they will be controlled adequately.  The predecessor body, the NEA, were established by the party opposite to do the same work, to a considerable extent, but that agency were established as a private company and therefore were not subject in the same fashion to Oireachtas control, or to the same safeguards <i>vis-á-vis</i> the taxpayers. That will obtain here under this Bill because the NDC are being established by statute and are responsible, accordingly, to the Oireachtas on a basis agreed by the Oireachtas.  That is a major step forward and will ensure taxpayer protection which was not present in the case of the NEA.</P>
      <P>Deputy Begley was concerned to ensure that the NDC will not compete with other State agencies.  I assure him that both in the terms of the Bill and in the intentions of the Government as set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy &mdash; and in my introductory speech &mdash; it is provided quite clearly that the NDC will not compete with, rather will they complement and co-operate with, other agencies.  They will be different from the IDA.  As I will elaborate on later, the NDC will be concerned solely with investing equity in companies with a view to getting returns and creating jobs, whereas the IDA are concerned exclusively with giving grants &mdash; two entirely separate activities which may have the same objectives in mind but which will employ different means.  There is no question, therefore, of competition between the two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Industry three years ago I have initiated procedures to ensure that when State agencies have similar objectives they will operate by different means and that there will be no overlapping.  We have required <Col N="252" /> State agencies to enter into clear operating agreements with other agencies.  For instance, the IDA and the Irish Export Board, with my agreement and at my suggestion, entered into a formal agreement setting out in detail what one agency will do and what the other will do.  There is no question of competition or overlapping.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the IDA will enter into an operating agreement will all other relevant State agencies to establish clearly what are the responsibilities of one and the other.  I expect this corporation to enter into an operating agreement with the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the Irish Export Board and the agricultural agencies to ensure that in their export promotion and investment capacities the corporation will work in conjunction and in a complementary way with other agencies, so that there will not be overlapping or competition with the other agencies.  I hope that will satisfy Deputy Begley and others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy, who is no longer here to hear my reply, was somewhat concerned that the corporation might be unnecessary.  This, of course, is a very contradictory attitude for a Deputy of his party to adopt.  They introduced the NEA, some of whose functions are being taken over by the NDC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>But not all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Fianna Fáil regarded that agency as necessary, and how they can object to the NDC, which will be carrying out some of the functions of the agency on a statutory basis, I do not know.  I cannot understand the attitude of the Opposition in that respect.  Deputy Molloy trotted out the old chestnut of the corporation being in some sense a politically motivated organisation reflecting disagreement between the parties forming the Government.  I should like to remind the House that the establishment of the NDC has been not only the policy of Labour but of Fine Gael for a number of years.  I was responsible for drafting the Fine Gael policy document <i>Jobs in the 80s,</i> which formed part of the Fine <Col N="253" /> Gael platform in the 1982 general election. That document contained a clear commitment by Fine Gael to the establishment of a national development corporation. The Labour Party document also contained such a commitment, so there is no disagreement whatever between the parties in Government and never has been in regard to the need to establish a body such as this on a sound statutory basis, responsible to the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy suggested that this agency are superfluous.  I reject that totally. From the very beginning, in drafting the terms for the NDC I have been concerned, as have my Cabinet colleagues, to ensure that the corporation will be integrated fully into the total industrial promotion fabric of the State.  The corporation proposal was published as a chapter of the Government's statement in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
      <P>In regard to functions, the NDA are being assigned responsibility for investment in the overall Government economic strategy.  The corporation will be responsible for investing equity in various activities.  They are being given a specific role for the promotion of the food industry. It has long been the view of people commenting on the Irish food industry that lack of equity handicapped the Irish food production industry after initial losses.  The industry was handicapped by initial output, by marketing and by a knowledge of it.  Obviously, equity was necessary to enable people to wait long enough to achieve market acceptability. This was recognised by the Government and by the NESC report.</P>
      <P>The Government, taking those reports, decided that the specific responsibility for remedying that lack of equity investment in the food industry should be assigned to the NDC thereby putting the corporation clearly in the centre so far as the achievement of a very important objective of overall Government industrial policy was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same can be said of the recommendation that an initiative should be taken by the Government to establish what are known as shell companies to <Col N="254" /> undertake common functions for a number of small enterprises which, for instance, wish to become involved in exports and investing, for example, in a company set up by a number of companies producing similar products to market jointly the product of that wider number of firms whose resources individually would not be sufficient to enable them to undertake overseas marketing. The need for this development has long been pointed to by analysts in the area of industrial policy.  It was called for in the Telesis report and in the report of the NESC.  In the White Paper on industrial policy the Government decided to assign the sole responsibility for investing capital in the establishment of such marketing companies to the NDC.  Again, that indicates that the corporation are being given, not a marginal role, but a central role in the achievement of one of the clearly accepted objectives of Government policy.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Opposition believe also that we need to have a body who are prepared to invest equity in joint marketing companies set up between a number of small industries.  The Opposition must agree, too, with the need for a company who will be prepared to put equity into certain long-term development of new food products so as to enable those products gradually to gain acceptability in the market.  If the party opposite agree that we should have a body prepared to invest equity in marketing companies and that we should have a body prepared to invest what one might refer to as patient money in the development of certain new food products, why are they opposing the establishment of the NDC?  The corporation are intended to perform a function which the Opposition in their more reflective moments must agree is necessary.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is common cause in this House that we need an agency who will be prepared to invest equity in the development of new products and processes emerging from our universities and higher level institutions.  There is a tremendous resource available to us in the higher education institutes.  In Trinity College, in UCD, in Cork and Galway <Col N="255" /> universities and in the National Institutes of Higher Education as well as in other institutions, there are highly talented people who are engaged not only in teaching but also in research in the engineering field, in the food science field and in similar disciplines.  As part of their academic work they are developing ideas that could be turned into products to create jobs if those products could be sold profitably to consumers here and overseas.  What we have lacked in the past has been an institution that would be able to bring those ideas from the concept stage through the product development stage into the marketing stage. Unfortunately, private enterprise, concerned very often as it is with survival, does not have sufficient resources to become involved in partnerships on a sufficient scale with the universities.</P>
    <P>Clearly what is needed to capitalise on the intellectual resources available in our universities is an outside body who will come in with equity and invest it in the development of a particular product, who will say: &ldquo;We know that the product is not ready at the stage of coming from the university to be sold to the consumer.  It needs more refinement, some test marketing and so forth.  That will take two or three years and you need money to enable the product to be developed.  We are prepared to give you the money on condition that, when the product is sold, we will have a share in the profits we expect you to make.&rdquo;  I am confident that the Opposition, too, would agree that we need a body who would be prepared to invest equity of this kind in the development of commercial products and of the intellectual resources that exist in our higher institutes of education.  This is precisely the role the corporation are being given under section 10 (1) (i) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Opposition agree that something of this nature should be done. If they do not agree, I can tell them that the NESC who represent employers and trade unions do agree and I can tell Fianna Fáil, too, that the OECD who recently conducted a study of innovation policy in Ireland advocated very strongly <Col N="256" /> that what we need, if we are to achieve our maximum job creation potential, is to invest in developing products from the intellectual resources that exist in our universities and higher institutes of education.</P>
    <P>Why are the party opposite opposing the NDC?  Are they opposed to a Government agency being involved in investing equity with a view to making a profit, as a result of the development of the up to now unexploited ideas in our universities and which could create jobs which we would not create otherwise? Are the Opposition telling us seriously that they are opposed to this activity?  If they are not opposed to it, I call on them to justify to the public their opposition to the establishment of the NDC.  If Fianna Fáil believe in the development of our food industry and in joint marketing between small companies in order to achieve the full potential of the many good products we have, but which cannot now be sold adequately overseas, and if they believe in the development of the intellectual resources of our universities, why are they opposing the establishment of the corporation?  Why are they not only opposing it but saying that, if by some increasingly doubtful mischance they are returned to office, they would reverse the action of the Oireachtas in establishing this corporation?</P>
    <P>Nothing they have said in this debate has given us any inkling as to the motivation for their opposition to this development. No contribution from the benches opposite has included a serious or reasoned criticism of the establishment of the NDC or of the objectives the corporation will be setting out to achieve. Yet in the absence of such argument and even within hours of the Bill being published, the Opposition announced that not only would they oppose the establishment of the NDC but that they would abolish it should they be returned to office.  That does not indicate that the party opposite think very deeply or carefully about the policy stances they adopt. It would suggest that they invent policy, not even on the back of an envelope but on the back of a postage stamp, at high <Col N="257" /> speed and that they are prepared to change policy at equally high speed if they find that it is becoming somewhat unpopular.</P>
    <P>We have seen in another instance to which I will not refer because it is not directly relevant to this debate, evidence that the party opposite are prepared not only to advocate policy but to climb down on policy as soon as it becomes obvious they have backed the wrong horse.  This attitude of political opportunism rather than serious thought about the national needs is what lies behind the otherwise inexplicable attitude of the Opposition in opposing the idea of having a National Development Corporation which is, in many respects, no more than putting statutory reform on the National Enterprise Agency and giving it a wider, clearer and more extensive mandate.</P>

      <P>I have not been surprised that Deputies on the opposite side of this House have chosen to reject the provisions of this Bill out of hand.  What does surprise me, however, is the paucity of their arguments against it.  In the first instance, Opposition Deputies have, throughout this debate, referred to this legislation as being intended to be a panacea for all the economic ills facing this country at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is intended to be anything but a panacea, and most certainly it has never been promoted by the Government as being such.  The National Development Corporation should, as I stated in my opening speech, be seen as an integral part &mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;part&rdquo;&mdash; of the Government's overall package to tackle the unemployment problem and to stimulate a greater level of investment in the traded sectors of our economy.  The potential contribution of the NDC is enormous but it could not, and should <Col N="258" /> not, stand alone with the full responsibility for ensuring our future industrial prosperity.  It is grossly misleading for opposition speakers to suggest that the NDC is intended to cure the problem of unemployment of its own accord; it is only part of that cure &mdash; but an important part.</P>
      <P>The declining uniformity and the boring lack of originality in the individual contributions of Members on the opposite side of the House has been most notable.  It is as if they all sat down around a table &mdash; I will not venture to suggest whose table &mdash; and decided what they were going to say, and then proceeded like auditors to trot out the same arguments, one speaker after another, in the manner of a broken record which continually repeats itself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to bore the House by repeating, in abbreviated form, the Opposition's arguments.  In the first instance, they suggest that the NDC will be just another layer of bureaucracy and will be able to achieve nothing that is not already within the ambit of existing State agencies.  They claim that the functions of the corporation will overlap unnecessarily with those of the IDA in particular and of other State industrial promotion agencies in general.</P>
      <P>I should not have to repeat to the House that the principal function of the NDC will be to take an equity stake in industry by investing in suitable projects with a capability for providing sustainable and viable employment opportunities. They will not be empowered to make grants available to industry as the IDA are, and their power to give loans will be limited to the extent necessary to complement their overall effort and may be exercised only in the specific circumstances set out in the Bill.  This clearly indicates that the NDC will function differently from the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA have, of course, taken minority equity stakes in industry in a small <Col N="259" /> number of cases where this was necessary in the past to formulate an overall package of aid to a particular project.  We should not forget, however, that the IDA's principal statutory function is to contribute to the industrial promotion effort by means of providing grant aid to industry.  I will not deny either, that the Industrial Credit Company have also from time to time taken equity stakes in industry but they are primarily a State banking institution and their taking of equity stakes is largely incidental to their banking activities.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta is a State rescue agency which has an investment perspective which would be very different from that of the proposed National Development Corporation.  It is my intention that the NDC will draw up detailed operating agreements with the agencies mentioned above so as to rule out any overlap.  It will be necessary in these agreements, and in particular in the one with Fóir Teoranta, to elaborate the principle clearly, that the NDC will not be involved in industrial rescue of any kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating raised the question of a possible overlap between the NDC and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The IIRS is a technical consultancy agency whose function is to promote improvements in the technological capacity and quality of Irish industry.  It only provides financial assistance in respect of the costs of patenting new inventions, otherwise it does not provide finance to industry.  On average, it has dealt with six new inventions each year at a cost to the institute of £50,000 a year. Thus, its remit is substantially different from the proposed NDC and there is no scope for overlap, as Deputy Keating seemed to fear.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been one of the principal cornerstones of our evolving industrial policy down through the years and it would be gratuitously insulting to suggest that this Government, by establishing the NDC, want to institute another agency to usurp that Authority's functions.  As I have made repeatedly clear, the NDC and the IDA, while pursuing similar <Col N="260" /> objectives, will be doing so by radically different means.  What we are proposing in the NDC is the establishment of a State investment agency, whose primary method of operation will be substantially different from that of any other State industrial promotion agency, other than the National Enterprise Agency which it is intended to replace.  Venture capital, in which the NDC are involved, is a very specialised area of industrial financing.  It requires specialised and particular skills and expertise in order to be successful. A true venture capitalist must be prepared to take risks and to recognise that some of his investments are going to fail. Furthermore, a venture capitalist is not interested in making investments in order to provide a steady, slow dividend income over the years.  His primary aim is to invest in business which will yield substantial capital gains.</P>
    <P>All of these factors contribute to an investment perspective which is unique to the venture capital business, and quite different, for example, from the investment perspective of a pension fund which is looking for a flow of income rather than capital gains.  The main banking institutions, not only in Ireland but abroad, have recognised this and have established their venture capital activities within institutions which are totally separate to and divorced from their principal banking business.  Likewise institutional investors such as the pension funds and life assurance companies have never involved themselves directly in venture capital activities.  Their participation in this particular area of investment is by way of shareholding in the private sector venture capital agencies where, by investing in a range of investments, they achieve the type of steady income they are looking for rather than backing a particular winner in the business world.</P>
    <P>In setting up the National Development Corporation therefore, the State is providing for a separate institution in the venture capital area on the basis of a tried, tested and proven precedent in the private sector.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I explained why <Col N="261" /> the Government are replacing the existing National Enterprise Agency with the National Development Corporation.  The National Enterprise Agency has performed a very valuable function over the last two years.  However it has been inhibited by the fact that it was established, by a Fianna Fáil Government, as a private limited company, with only a nominal share capital, and no specific statutory remit.  The areas of activity in which the NEA might get involved have never been set out in legislation.  This has produced a large degree of uncertainty with regard to the agency's operations and in order to redress this problem this Government are establishing a National Development Corporation which has been our policy objective since 1981.</P>
    <P>We are placing a statutory obligation on the corporation to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State; we are providing it with an authorised share capital of £300 million.  We are also setting down in section 10 of this Bill the principal areas of activity in which the NDC can become involved.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion implicit in the Opposition's argument that this Government are attempting at a stroke to do away with the National Enterprise Agency and ignore the work that it has done to date.  This is not the case.  The agency, its investments, its assets and its liabilities will be subsumed into the National Development Corporation.  In this way, the work of the agency to date will be built upon by the corporation and its role and chances of success greatly enhanced by the provision of a proper capital base and an adequate statutory framework clearly setting out its objectives and methods of operation.</P>
    <P>Indeed Deputies on the opposite side of the House might be interested to hear what the Chairman of the NEA has had to say about the proposal to set up the National Development Corporation.  In the current issue of the NEA's Newsletter, &ldquo;Venture News&rdquo;, he states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The National Enterprise Agency <Col N="262" /> welcomes the publication of the Bill to establish its successor, the National Development Corporation.  The Bill confirms the Government's intention regarding the important role of public venture capital.  The legislation as proposed will ensure the availability of adequate capital to the Corporation, freeing it from the financial constraints and uncertainity under which the Agency has been operating.</P>
    <P>&mdash;operating under terms established by the party opposite.  The Chairman continues:</P>
    <P>The Agency has already gained wide experience as a State venture capital body and this experience will be of considerable benefit in planning the expanded role of the new Corporation.</P>
    <P>This public expression of support for this legislation by the NEA clearly demonstrates that the agency's feelings on the matter are considerably at variance with the attitudes expressed by Deputies on the opposite side of the House who have sought to defend its continued existence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons and Deputy Reynolds, as well as many of their colleagues, have criticised the Government for stifling and choking the National Enterprise Agency and starving it of funds so that it could not adequately perform its investment role.  I would remind the Deputies on the opposite side of the House that under this Government the agency was actively encouraged to identify and make suitable investments.  Furthermore, it was provided with adequate resources to perform this role.  In the last two years it has made some 20 equity investments, committed £2 million of public capital to these projects helped in the creation of some 150 jobs with a potential for much more.  I would further remind the Deputies that under a Fianna Fáil Government nothing was done other than to give the agency its name.  Not one person was recruited and not one investment was made.  We can hardly be accused of choking and stifling the activities of the agency when the party opposite have had such a dismal record in regard to that body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="263" /> Referring back for a moment to the question of possible overlap with other agencies, Deputy Lenihan suggested that there was substantial evidence of the ability of existing State bodies to do the job now being proposed for the NDC. He cited Aer Lingus, who have engaged extensively in the provision of training facilities to foreign airlines, and the ESB, who have engaged in foreign consultancy. Praiseworthy and all as such activities are, the contribution to the creation of employment for our young workforce is limited to particular areas.</P>
    <P>These bodies are concerned, in the case of Aer Lingus with running an air service and in the case of the ESB with running an electricity service.  How Deputy Lenihan could suggest that an electricity body could be the means of investing venture capital in the overall range of industrial activity in the country is quite difficult to understand.  It suggests rather limited analysis of the role of public venture capital on the part of Deputy Lenihan before he made his contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Séamus Brennan have questioned the need for a State investment agency such as the National Development Corporation in the first place.  They doubt its potential to succeed and referred to the existence of similar State investment agencies in other European countries and stated that, with the possible exception of Sweden, such agencies have been dismal failures.  Perhaps the Deputies have never heard of the MIP equity fund which has operated as a very successful State investment agency in Holland and on which this National Development Corporation is largely based.  Perhaps Deputies who decry the whole notion of public venture capital are also not aware that the UK State investment company, the British Technology Group, have made a number of significant and successful investments, and have continued under a Conservative Government.</P>
    <P>It is very strange that from the vantage point of Opposition, Deputies opposite should question the whole idea of having a public venture capital body when their <Col N="264" /> own party, in Government, established the National Enterprise Agency.  It is certainly a contradiction in the attitude of those Deputies.  Perhaps as spokesman for the area Deputy Lyons might take Deputy Reynolds aside and ask him if he was actually speaking for Fianna Fáil in what he said.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies on the opposite side alluded to the success of the NEA. Indeed, Deputy Reynolds alluded to the success of the NEA and then in the same speech went on to say that we did not need a public venture capital body at all. How he could praise the NEA which is a public venture capital body and then say we do not need one is a logical feat that is surprising even in somebody of the known dexterity of Deputy Reynolds.</P>

      <P>Much criticism has been made of this Bill in so far as it provides only for an authorised share capital of the corporation.  Deputies have asked for details of the Government's commitment to the NDC in terms of how much Exchequer funding is actually to be provided by way of issued share capital.  Deputies will be all too aware that it would be impossible for me to give any indication of this at this stage.  That is something to be dealt with in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance it is essential that the level of funding to the NDC remains at all times within the discretion of the Government.  The amount of issued share capital provided to the corporation will <Col N="265" /> depend among other things on the performance of the organisation in fulfilling its primary role of creating employment in the State.  As I said in my opening speech, if the corporation in its initial years is successful, the flow of funds can be increased.  If it is not performing successfully, the flow of funds can be restricted to push it towards the development of a more judicious investment portfolio. Had this Bill provided for an issued, as distinct from an authorised, share capital of £300 million, then we would have rightly been accused of being foolhardy and lacking in consideration for the taxpayer from whom all Exchequer funding is originally sourced.  One has to accept that the NDC must, if they are to be worth while at all, make a rate of return which will be in excess of the rate of interest paid by the taxpayer on the money borrowed to finance them.  That is an extremely important consideration. Any money received by the NDC for investment from the State will not be free money.  It will be money borrowed by the taxpayer upon which the taxpayer will have to pay the interest and it must be a requirement of the NDC that they make a return which is in excess of the amount paid by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In taking up share capital in the corporation the Government will have regard to the investment commitments of the board and the number of projects in which they are likely to become involved. This procedure will involve the allocation of a specific sum of money in the Public Capital Programme.  The Public Capital Programme is published annually and so Deputies will be kept fully aware on an ongoing basis of the Government's commitment to the NDC.  However, Deputies will be all too well aware that until such time as the Public Capital Programme is published I am in no position to indicate the level of funding which will be available to the corporation in any particular year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that the public should be allowed to buy shares in the corporation while retaining control of the corporation within the State sector. This suggestion was made also by the <Col N="266" /> OECD in their report on innovation policy in Ireland.  It does not, however, seem to me that this would be a practical proposition from the outset.  The investing public would be averse to putting money into the corporation until such time as they have established a proven and profitable track record.  If the Government were to decide at some time in the future that this was a practical and desirable development, then a simple amendment to this legislation could permit it.</P>
    <P>Deputies Brennan and Connolly suggested that the NDC would become a millstone around the neck of the taxpayer because all successful investments would be sold off and the lame ducks would be retained in order to be propped up by the corporation.  This shows a lack of understanding as to what the corporation is all about.  In the first instance there is nothing wrong with the corporation selling off their successful investments. This is the way any venture capital agency works in the real world at the moment. Where investments have proved successful and are no longer in need of the support of the National Development Corporation in the form of additional equity, the disposal of the investment will involve an immediate and useful cash gain to the corporation.  The project concerned will have built up a viable level of employment which will be sustained and expanded on exactly the same commercial grounds, no matter who owns it, whether it be the NDC or those to whom it is sold.  On the other hand, by disposing of the investments, future profits will be brought forward and capitalised in the cash sale price, thereby making new funds immediately available to the corporation which can be reinvested in further projects providing new employment opportunities.  This is what we refer to as the concept of the revolving investment fund for employment.  It means that the corporation will not be a static body with an ageing portfolio of time consuming investments, nor a constant drain on the public purse, but a truly developmental body with a constantly renewable source of funds, and in later years a high <Col N="267" /> degree of independence of the Exchequer in the funding of their new operations as a result of what they will have available to them from within their own resources in the revolving fund for employment.</P>
    <P>As to what becomes of the less successful investments, commercial prudence will also apply.  It would make no sense to retain loss makers just because the taxpayer is the nominal owner of the lossmaker.  One must apply strict commercial criteria to deciding what is successful and what is not.  Any venture capitalist will tell you that investments which limp along create the greatest headache for a commercial organisation. They are a drain not only on money, but, more importantly, on the time of highly talented executives who ought to be employed in the most creative way possible. Such investments may have to be sold without profit, or even at a loss, in order to avoid a continuing drain or even greater losses.</P>
    <P>NDC companies will be eligible for aid from State sources in the same way as other commercial companies.  This will include aid from the IDA, CTT and Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I have repeated time and time again that the corporation are not designed to be a rescue agency and will not be required to prop up their own failures at continuing cost to the Exchequer.  Therefore, contrary to Deputy Connolly's contention that the corporation would be under pressure to hold on to the losers, the opposite will in fact be the case.  The corporation cannot be allowed to become bogged down in the administration and management of unsuccessful or pedestrian investments.  If they were to do so they would soon become deflected from their primary developmental and job creation role and would be in direct contravention with this legislation which this House, we hope, will have passed.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech on this debate I referred to the key role which the corporation would have in the natural resources sector and, in particular, in assisting in underpinning the development of long term contracts between producers and <Col N="268" /> processors.  Deputy Keating asked if the use of the term &ldquo;underpinning&rdquo; might mean the giving of grants.  I can assure him that it will not.  Indeed, it is my intention to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify beyond doubt the Government's intention that the corporation will not be empowered to give grants and I trust that this will generally clarify their investment powers.  In so far as Deputy Keating's query is concerned, let me further clarify that it was not my intention to suggest that the corporation, in developing such long term contracts, should apply anything less than the stringent commercial criteria that will apply to all their other investments.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that it was implicit in my opening speech that there would be no failures, that the NDC would take no risks and that they would in fact have a totally timid approach to investment in industry.  In the same tone Deputy Flynn ridiculed the wording of the legislation which says that the corporation should invest only in projects which are &ldquo;profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient&rdquo;.  He suggested that the word &ldquo;capable&rdquo; was nothing more than a loophole or a way out for the corporation should some investments subsequently prove to be unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Well, again there is an inconsistency in the line of thought in these two arguments from the party opposite.  Deputy Flynn is right to suggest that the legislation is being couched very deliberately and in very precise terms and for a reason.  The NDC cannot, any more than any other investor, predict with confidence what projects will succeed and what projects will fail and, of course, there will be failures.  Of course, they have to make a judgment in the matter and will do so, but they cannot predict in the sense that they can guarantee that any of their investments will turn out to be profitable. Every investment which the NDC make will constitute a risk.  There are no certain winners and the NDC certainly will have no monopoly of wisdom in this regard. What the NDC will look for, however, is a judicious spread of investments which <Col N="269" /> will enable that risk to be minimised. This is the feature of any venture capital operation.  The normal profile of investment of any venture capital agency suggests that out of every ten investments made no more than two or three will be hugely successful, another two or three will be moderately successful although not spectacularly so, while the remainder of the ten investments will fail, but we should not be afraid of that failure.  There has been a traditional stigma in this country attached to the notion of failure.  It is necessary, however, to ensure that the NDC are not forced by back door political or ministerial pressure to persist in investments which are obviously a failure just because they are in somebody's constituency. This is one reason why the NDC &mdash; established by law &mdash; are preferable to the NEA &mdash; a creation of the Minister.  Their statutory status will require the board of the NDC to resist political pressure &mdash; other than formalised and open policy directives made under the appropriate section of the legislation with the full knowledge of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn had some fixation with the NDC as being a panacea for all our ills.  He asked why it was being suggested that the NDC would invest only in winners. As I stated earlier, the NDC is not and was never intended to be a panacea. Nor is it stated anywhere in this legislation or in my speech that the NDC will only pick winners.</P>
    <P>He further suggested that there was not a word in the Bill about investment in innovation, which is a crucial factor in determining our future industrial prosperity.  I would refer Deputy Flynn to section 10 (1) (i) which empowers the corporation, &ldquo;to establish, promote and assist any enterprise engaged in the exploitation of research carried out in a University or third level educational institute, the Innovation Centre, the National Microelectronics Application Centre, the Invention Service of the IIRS or similar bodies in the State.&rdquo;  If this is not a sufficiently direct reference to <Col N="270" /> innovation let Deputy Flynn suggest a better one.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that the NDC would be empowered to depart from normal commercial criteria in deciding on an appropriate risk-reward ratio for its investments.  He suggested that, as Minister, I would have power under section 31 of the Bill to direct the NDC to do anything I desire it to do.  This is not true.  I would refer the Deputy to section 31 of the Bill which states that directives must be general in nature, must not involve day to day operations of the corporation and may not relate to any particular investment with which the corporation is or may be concerned.  Furthermore, directives under section 31 are required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas or else they carry no force in law.  Therefore, no directive can be issued to the corporation without the full knowledge of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating asked for clarification as to what constituted a policy directive, when it might be given and to what extent it might impinge upon the normal commercial criteria applied by the corporation in respect of their investments.  Let me clarify the situation.  Under section 31 a policy directive may only be issued in relation to all or any of the objects of the corporation specified in the memorandum of association of the corporation. These objects are enshrined in section 10 of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A policy directive may not &mdash; and I want to underline this &mdash; purport to alter or amend those objects as this could only be done by amending legislation.  Similarly, a directive may not purport to alter or amend the general commercial duty of the corporation as set out in section 13 of this Bill.  It is a somewhat hypothetical matter to try to predict at this stage what form directives might take but, for example, the Government might, as part of general industrial policy, require the corporation to actively seek out suitable investment opportunities in the small industry sector or perhaps to actively seek out suitable tourism related projects rather than waiting for such to come knocking on their door.  Clearly directives <Col N="271" /> of this nature would not, should not and indeed could not require the corporation to divert from their normal commercial assessment procedure in deciding on such investments.</P>
    <P>I think that this also answers Deputy Richard Bruton's concern that the NDC might, by means of policy directives, be subverted from their commercial brief towards a social or political brief.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn, as well as Deputy Brennan and others, also suggested that the legislation provided for too much political interference in the activities of the corporation.  They criticised the limits on investment expenditure set down in section 15 of the Bill.  I would remind these Deputies that the upper limit of £2,500,000 above which Government approval must be sought, and which we are now setting up for the National Development Corporation, is the same as that which has applied for years past under successive Governments, including Fianna Fáil Governments, to the activities of the Industrial Development Authority.  If the Deputies are so opposed to such a limit why did they not act to change it long ago in the case of the IDA? The lower limit of £1 million above which ministerial approval is required is a most judicious and prudent provision in the case of an entirely new State body and assists in ensuring the widest possible spread of investments.</P>
    <P>It is not a bad idea for any corporation of this kind to have to get some outside body to look at some of its larger investments. The very process of preparing a proposal for submission to the Department will force the corporation, and its executives, to tease out on paper certain problems that might otherwise, perhaps, be allowed to slip their minds.  The second opinion process by the submission to the Minister and/or Government will probably ensure that the investment procedures within the NDC, even for the small investments to which these requirements will not apply, will be more rigorous and more formalised than they would be in the absence of such a provision in <Col N="272" /> the Bill.  That is another good reason for having such a requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating asked if these limits, or indeed the limit of 30 per cent on loans, were arbitrarily set.  In the case of the limits about which I have just been speaking, they are arbitrary only in the sense that they have been related to the limit which exists in the case of the IDA. In the case of the loans limit, it must be remembered that the NDC is not primarily a loan giving agency.  However, the giving of loans is a feature of the venture capital business and applies in cases where a prudent mix of equity and loans is desirable or in the best interests of a particular project.</P>
    <P>The 30 per cent limit is based on the best advice available to me.  A limit is necessary to ensure that the NDC does not become deflected from its primary role as a provider of equity capital. Deputy Barnes asked if the power to give one loan and one loan only was unnecessarily restrictive.  I emphasise again that the NDC is not intended to be a loan agency and if it could give second, third and fourth loans to a project in which it had initially invested, it would become a sort of a rescue-banking agency rather than an investment agency.  Loans will be available to projects supported by the NDC from other commercial sources whose specific remit will be mainly that of giving a loan.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is useful that if an NDC project need loan capital they can go to somebody else for the loan.  Again, that will be a means of getting a second opinion on the project from, for instance, a bank that may be lending the money. The NDC may be prepared to put up some of the equity, but some money has to be raised by loan and, therefore, a bank will be looking to ensure that it gets its money back and will have a further examination of the project to ensure it is viable and capable of repaying the loan. This will also ensure that a profit return is available to the NDC as investor.  That mutuality of interest exists in analysing projects between an external bank and the NDC.  It is a good reason for forcing <Col N="273" /> NDC projects to look for loan capital elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn and Deputy Brennan criticised the level of discretionary expenditure allowed to the NDC in respect of office equipment and so on.  The limit set is £250,000.  It was suggested that this would not even buy a good computer for the NDC.  Well let me point out to Deputies who must be a little out of date that it would be a pretty big computer that would be purchased for £250,000. Furthermore, and to answer Deputy Barnes' question on the subject, this limit is an annual limit and it applies in respect of any single item only.  It is not aggregated over all purchases.  It would be a substantial amount of office space that could be leased for £250,000 per annum.  This limit is a vital ingredient of protection to the taxpayer to ensure that the administrative budget of the NDC is not gratuitously wasted.</P>
    <P>Might I also correct the impression given by Deputy Seamus Brennan who suggested that the corporation would be empowered to spend £250,000 over and above the maximum administrative grant-in-aid of £2 million which the Government are empowered to give under section 21 of the Bill?  The limit of £250,000 applies in respect of expenditure of that grant-in-aid, whatever it might be, and is not an addition to it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, let me point out that the legislation provides that this administrative grant-in-aid may be provided annually for the first five years of the corporation's existence only.  The intention is that the corporation should have become self-financing as far as their administration expenses are concerned by the end of that time.</P>
    <P>I would like also to correct another false impression given by Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Foley who suggested that the corporation would have a vital gap in their armour because they were not being empowered to invest in tourism related projects.  I would draw the attention of the Deputies to section 10 (1) (d) which empowers the corporation to invest in any enterprise which is &ldquo;being established or has been established to <Col N="274" /> cater for tourists&rdquo;.  Again I am afraid this is a case of Deputies not having read the Bill.</P>
    <P>May I invite the Deputies opposite to say if they are opposed to a corporation being set up to put equity into the development of tourism related projects?  Do they think that our tourism industry is sufficiently developed and that there is no room for money to be put into developing new recreational facilities for tourists in this country from public sources on a profit-oriented basis?  If the Deputies agree that there is a need for equity investment in tourism, why on earth are they opposing the National Development Corporation?  Why are they not only opposing it, but saying that they would repeal it in the unlikely event that they ever came back to office?  It appears to me that they do not care whether our tourism industry is developed in this fashion, if they can be so crass as to suggest that they would reverse this decision of the House to establish a National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating asked for clarification of what I meant by saying that the corporation would fill an important gap in terms of State financial aid to the tourist industry. My concern is that, as I said in my opening speech, the development of tourist related facilities such as hotels and related activities often requires significant capital investment and that the seasonality of return does not always make it initially a sufficiently attractive proposition for the private sector acting on its own.  The NDC's ability to become involved in joint ventures in this area will therefore be an important means of encouraging the involvement of the private sector in developing and expanding our tourism infrastructure and helping the private sector investors to take a sufficiently long term view of certain projects.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy told the House that the United States experience was that the major growth in employment happened in the services sector.  He criticised the legislation accordingly for restricting the NDC's investment role to manufacturing industry.  Again we have a case of a Deputy opposite who did not <Col N="275" /> read the Bill, just as their party leader did not read it before he said that he was going to repeal it.</P>
    <P>The definition of enterprise contained in section 2 of the Bill does not restrict the NDC's role in this way and it will be empowered to invest in suitable projects in the services sector.  It will do so on a strictly commercial basis.  It is my intention, however, that the NDC should concentrate wholly on the traded sector of the economy where the main competition will come from companies operating from other countries.  Its aim will be to develop new markets and to strengthen existing Irish firms by prudent equity investment.  The NDC's overall perspective in assessing investments will be the potential of that investment to contribute to the employment effort.</P>
    <P>The statutory obligation imposed on the corporation is to contribute to the creation of the maximum amount of viable and sustainable employment in the State.  The NDC, therefore, should not be investing in areas such as retailing, where the jobs created will only be at the expense of other jobs already in existence. The task of ensuring that the National Development Corporation do not become involved in competition in a limited market with existing operators is something that might well be formulated in a directive issued to the corporation under the appropriate section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have suggested that the board of the corporation will be political hacks and that the whole exercise will constitute no more than the proverbial jobs for the boys.  Well, the final figuration of the board has not yet been settled so I am not at liberty to disclose anything in this regard to the House at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Likewise the board and staff of the corporation would be required to have a commitment to, and belief in, what they are doing.  It is a fallacy to suggest that a venture capital agency of the type which operates successfully in the private sector cannot operate successfully within the public sector.  The experience and business expertise of the staff employed by the National Development Corporation will prove, in the fullness of time, that it can.</P>
      <P>Many speakers in the course of this debate, including Deputy Reynolds, and Deputy Richard Bruton expressed concern at the imposition of standard DPS procedures in determining the remuneration of the Chief Executive of the NDC. I must say that I agree entirely with the concerns expressed by the Deputies in this regard.  I have always recognised that the success of the corporation lies in the recruitment of directors, a chief executive and other staff of the highest possible calibre.  I agree that, in order to attract such people, we must be in a position to offer them an appropriate salary.  Deputies may rest assured that the Government intend to recruit a person fully qualified and competent for the job.  The fact remains that the actual salary rate, terms and conditions of this appointment are matters for determination between myself and the Minister for the Public Service.  The NDC, however, did not exist when the review body examined the remuneration of the chief executives and clearly the appropriate level of remuneration for the NDC post will have to be considered in the light of the particular requirements of that position.  This will, I trust, ease the concern of all Deputies who raised this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to take the opportunity to mention two points of detail raised by Deputies in regard to the Bill and which I have not covered so far in my contribution.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald asked why AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency are not included in the schedule of State-sponsored bodies in <Col N="277" /> the Bill.  In reply, I would like to acknowledge that the Deputy has a valid point. These bodies should be included and this omission will be rectified by means of an amendment introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution, Deputy Keating commented on the competence of my Department to oversee the operation of the NDC.  His comments apparently were based on a recent appearance by officials of my Department before the public expenditure committee, when the issue of cost per job created was raised.  It would appear that some members of the committee formed the opinion, and perhaps Deputy Keating would be among these, that the Department had not got a figure for cost per job, but my understanding is that my Department indicated in reply to the Deputies' questions that the basis for calculating cost per job figures varied and that it would be inappropriate to give cost per job figures until the Management Committee on Industrial Policy had agreed a uniform basis for computing cost per job.  I expect the Management Committee on Industrial Policy to agree such a basis shortly and I will return to this aspect in the course of the discussions in the House on the Industrial Development Bill.</P>
    <P>I must, therefore, reject Deputy Keating's suggestions that because my Department declined to give a figure for cost per job to the public expenditure committee they are not competent to monitor the performance of agencies under their control.  I should mention also that Irish Shipping, one of the agencies referred to by the Deputy in this context, did not come under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the worse for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, I am at a loss to know how the public expenditure committee could have formed an opinion on the adequacy of the Department's supervisory role in relation to insurance companies.  I am not aware that the committee have yet addressed this aspect of <Col N="278" /> my Department's activities at all in their examination.</P>
      <P>Let me say that, from my experience in working in this Department over a cumulative period of five years, two years as Parliamentary Secretary and three years now as Minister, I have the utmost confidence in the ability of the officials in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  I completely reject any criticisms addressed to them by Deputy Keating.  If there are deficiencies they are, by law, my responsibility and I am answerable for them.  There is no question of officials being made responsible for any deficiencies in that regard. Furthermore, it is my experience that the officials concerned not only have a high level of ability but are prepared to work &mdash; and this applies particularly to senior officials for whom there are no overtime payments &mdash; right through the night in certain cases, certainly up to very late hours, in the public interest for no additional award out of a sense of service and duty, making their talents freely and for no additional reward available to the Minister of the day in the performance of his tasks.  I have the greatest confidence in all the officials concerned.  I regret that Deputy Keating is not in the House to hear what I have to say in reply to what I would regard as a somewhat ill-judged criticism he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

      <P>In listening to the arguments put forward against the corporation in the course of this debate it occurred to me that I had read or seen something similar before.  I listened to the Leader of the Opposition, speaking outside of this House, describe the corporation as a white elephant.  I listened to him committing a Fianna Fáil Government to terminating their existence at the first chance they got.  It occurred to me &mdash; although I am not perhaps old enough to remember this firsthand &mdash; that this is not altogether new.  I was right.  I should like to take the House back to a debate which took place in this House in 1949, <Col N="279" /> when I was two years of age, when the Government of the day were proposing legislation to establish the Industrial Development Authority.  The late Seán Lemass, much referred to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The late Séan Lemass said of the proposal to establish the Industrial Development Authority, and I quote:</P>
      <P>...supporters of popular race horses frequently proclaim their merits by asserting their capacity to win dragging a cart.  Irish industry is being asked now to show its merit by winning the race for increased productivity dragging a cart, a cart without wheels.</P>
      <P>The cart without wheels referred to by Deputy Lemass was the Industrial Development Authority.  He added, and I quote again:</P>
      <P>...to the extent that the work [of the Industrial Development Authority] is necessary, it has been done in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the same old argument as we are hearing from the opposite side in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> Later in the same debate Deputy Lemass stated, and I quote again:</P>
    <P>...my opposition and the opposition of Deputies on this side of the House to the whole idea [of the Industrial Development Authority] in this Bill is fundamental and at the earliest possible occasion we will terminate it.</P>
    <P>That is the record of the Opposition, in Opposition, talking about the Industrial Development Authority.  No sooner were they returned to office than they enthusiastically embraced the proposal of the then Inter-Party Government to establish an Industrial Authority and, in office, they continued to sustain it and give it additional resources.</P>

      <P>I am quite confident that the party opposite will, in the same manner as St. Paul, fall off the horse in so far as their attitude to the National Development Corporation is concerned. In turn, they will see the light.  However, in this case they will be seeing the light from Opposition because they will still be in Opposition five and ten years hence as long as they continue to pursue the present policy line in which they are interested. But in five or ten years' time they will see the wisdom of this House in establishing a National Development Corporation. And, from the vantage point of Opposition, they will at last see that they were wrong in opposing the establishment of the National Development Corporation, that they were wrong in suggesting that if they were &mdash; as they will not be &mdash; returned to office they would do away with it.  I am afraid I have to say, in listening to this debate, that the attitude of the Opposition has been entirely of a piece with their attitude in regard to practically all legislative ideas brought forward by this Government. Their idea is that, whatever it is, before it is published or read, it should be opposed and reversed.  The Irish public demonstrated in a recent opinion poll that they <Col N="281" /> clearly see this attitude, this knee-jerk opposition, for what it is worth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth nothing.  It is a barren and destructive attitude of a party that have no policy and no ideas of where they are going.  It is a barren and destructive attitude which has not resulted in the publication of a single policy document except on one subject &mdash; marine affairs.  If as a party which is symbolically enough, itself quite at sea &mdash; at least it has a policy on marine affairs.  I would suggest that they come back to earth, to the real problems facing this country rather than addressing themselves to the type of negative, destructive, carping criticism we heard from the Opposition leader last evening and from Deputy Lyons in his contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They should come back to earth.  If they have something to say about the nations problems, let them put forward constructive proposals.  If they are good proposals the Government will be quite happy to adopt them and, if they are bad proposals, the Government will be quite happy to debate them with them in an objective and friendly way.  But as long as the Opposition persist in condemning everything and advocating nothing constructive, there will be no real function performed in this House.  This House can fulfil its full mandate only with the co-operation of the Opposition and the Government.  If the Government put forward proposals in this House, if those proposals are to be properly debated, that must be done on the basis of alternative proposals put forward by the Opposition. In this debate and in every debate <Col N="282" /> we have heard in this House over the last two or three years there have been no constructive proposals emanating from the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have no doubt that that is where they will remain for a number of years and that gradually, from the relative ease of the Opposition benches, they will be able to see that they are wrong in this debate and that the National Development Corporation will prove to be the success that they so greatly doubt it will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for my inability to be present yesterday as I was <Col N="286" /> in Brussels on Departmental business. The Minister for Defence had already started to reply to the debate and I do not propose to go over the points with which he has already dealt.  I propose to take up the remaining points which have not yet been answered and to make general concluding remarks.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the question raised by Deputy Wilson in relation to the provision of car parks by the DTA.  He suggested that the DTA should provide these car parks or license charities to do so in order to have a native car park provider. It would be surprising if private enterpreneurs did not explore any possibilities there are in this regard.  It is not envisaged that the DTA would incur capital expenditure on providing car parks, etc.  It is questionable whether the Exchequer should be involved in such provision as it would have to be if the DTA had to rely on it for funds.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton suggested that the Bill should be amended to require the sanction of the DTA before major expenditure on roads, rail, etc. gets the go ahead.  That is not necessary as it will be for the Government to decide, in the context of the national plan, the public capital programme, etc., on the total resources to be made available for such expenditure and on the specific major expenditure having regard to the expert advice tendered to Government by the DTA under section 21 of the Bill about priority in public expenditure in these matters.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies commented on arrangements for future Dublin transport funding.  The Government saw no reason for channelling Exchequer moneys via the DTA to CIE and local authorities instead of the present arrangement.  The Government will continue to decide on the quantum and content of transport infrastructure expenditure in order to secure the best value for money and will decide both issues in the light of the recommendations of the DTA, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also criticised the lack of close involvement of CIE in the planning process under the planning Acts. He felt that the Bill did not remedy the <Col N="287" /> situation for Dublin.  The DTA will have a major input in the planning process, as sections 24 and 25 provide, in relation to transport aspects and traffic management. The DTA will have an expert overview of transport and traffic needs for the Dublin area and will, no doubt, press their case with vigour in the appropriate quarters.  The DTA will have the clear statutory power to do so, a vital power which CIE and the non-statutory Dublin Transportation Task Force lack.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies commented on the provision in the Bill for local authority representation on the board of the Dublin Transport Authority.  Some asked about the qualifications of the local authority representatives for membership of the DTA Board.  The Government decided to have four local authority members on the board of the Authority to link up with the Dublin local government system.  As I explained in my opening speech on 12 June, all the members of the Authority will be required to have appropriate experience and expertise in transport or other relevant matters.  Paragraph (3) of Article 2 of the Schedule to the Bill requires that.</P>
    <P>The four local authority representatives to be nominated by the local authorities will have to have appropriate experience and expertise in transport or other relevant matters and the nominating authorities will have to bear that in mind when making their nominations. The board will have a maximum of 12 members and the members will be appointed by the Minister for Communications under the Bill when enacted. Pending the establishment of the new administrative counties of Dublin-Belgard and Dublin-Fingal, Dublin County Council will be asked in due course to nominate two suitable members representing the new administrative areas.  Dublin Corporation and the new administrative county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will each have one member on the DTA Board and they will be asked to nominate one suitable member in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked if the Minister <Col N="288" /> for Communications had indicated to CIE financial or other limits on how the transport needs of Tallaght might be met. There is no question of applying financial or other preconditions to consideration of the transport needs of Tallaght and other development areas west of Dublin city.  Joint consideration between CIE and the Department of Communications at official level has not produced a satisfactory answer and the matter of transport provision for Tallaght and other developing areas is at present being re-examined within CIE.  As indicated by me in my opening speech on Second Stage, the Dublin Transport Authority will be required to give priority consideration to the question of what public transport services are to be provided for Tallaght, Clondalkin and other developing areas to the west of Dublin city and whether such services should be provided by rail, road or busway.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked whether his draft Bill would only have required Government involvement in relation to the proposed statutory Dublin Transport Plan in so far as there was need to settle any disputes arising between the Dublin Transport Authority and local authorities. It is clear that, irrespective of his intentions, Deputy Wilson's 1982 legislative proposals would have required considerable Government involvement in the settlement of the statutory Dublin Transport Plan.  His proposals specifically required Government approval of the draft plan prepared by the Dublin Transport Authority before it could bind local authorities and enabled the Government to make such modifications as they saw fit to the draft plan when giving their approval in the light of the report of the public inquiry which had to be held in relation to the draft plan and of the recommendations of the Ministers concerned in the matter.  Furthermore, the Deputy's proposals provided that, when the plan had been approved by the Government, the local authorities would have been obliged to bring their development plans under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts into conformity with the Dublin Transport <Col N="289" /> Plan.  The whole process would obviously have required considerable Government action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly and others stressed the need to improve the quality of life of Dublin as our capital city and I fully endorse this plea.  One of the essential objectives of a good transport and traffic management policy for Dublin is to allow the business, social and cultural life of the city to be restored and animated. That objective underlies the Bill.  Deputies Kelly, De Rossa, Flaherty and Taylor commented on section 29 of the Bill.  This is an enabling provision for the Authority to license others beside CIE to provide bus services.  The Minister for Communications has that power at present.  Obviously the Authority would have to consider carefully the exercise of such power to ensure that adequate passenger road services would continue to be provided throughout the Dublin area.  Section 29 (2) requires the Authority to do so.  That is what the phrase &ldquo;have regard to the public interest regarding the provision of passenger road services...&rdquo; means.  It would be outside a bus service licensing system to attempt to prescribe conditions of pay or work for employees of operators as Deputy De Rossa suggested. Normal bargaining &mdash; apart from general worker legislation &mdash; is there to deal with that.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kelly and Doyle spoke about the functional area of the Authority.  The Authority's functional area is basically the area within the County Dublin boundary, as per section 10 (1).  Of course much of the traffic in Dublin begins outside the county, for example, in Counties Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Section 10 (2) allows for extension by ministerial order of the functional area of the Authority as needs arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Doyle and Deputy Briscoe commented on poor enforcement of parking controls in the Dublin area.  It is accepted that the present position is unsatisfactory and that special concerted efforts are required to remedy the situation. As I said when opening the debate, while the Garda will continue to be responsible for traffic law enforcement, <Col N="290" /> the traffic wardens have a major function in enforcing parking controls.</P>
    <P>The proposed transfer of the traffic wardens to the DTA is designed to give their work a more effective and professional basis as well as providing scope for career advancement which is lacking at present.  The non-statutory Dublin Transportation Task Force &mdash; comprising representatives of the Garda, local authorities and the Departments concerned &mdash; continues to work for improvements in the enforcement of traffic and parking controls and with some success. Greater effort by all concerned is, of course, required as the Deputies have suggested.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe suggested that the question of wheelclamping illegally parked vehicles should be examined. This would involve putting a device on the wheel of the vehicle to stop it from being moved and the device would only be removed after a fee had been paid and the device unlocked by a garda or other authorised officer.  As there is no statutory provision for this at present, the question of making such provision is being actively pursued in the Departments concerned.  If an appropriate provision can be devised for this Bill the intention would be to have it considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, wheelclamping on the spot would not be appropriate in all cases of illegal parking, particularly where the illegally parked vehicle was a danger or obstruction to traffic or pedestrians.  Removal of the illegally parked vehicle would be appropriate in such circumstances.  As the law stands, illegally parked vehicles may be removed by the gardaí to special compounds and kept there until such time as the release fee is paid.  Greater use of these powers would obviously increase their deterrent effects and reduce illegal parking.  Section 34 of the Bill transfers to the Dublin Transport Authority the by-law making power of the Minister for the Environment for these matters in so far as the Authority's functional area is concerned.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have specific powers <Col N="291" /> under the Litter Act, 1982, to deal with the removal, storage and disposal of abandoned vehicles wherever they may be.  Greater use of these powers would also benefit traffic management and Deputies who are members of local authorities should pursue this with their respective local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to answer the individual points raised by Deputies in the debate.  I thank them for their contributions which I much appreciate.  As I said, legislation on the Dublin Transport Authority has been on the stocks for some time.  The Bill which was in draft form when I came to office was cumbersome and top heavy and probably would <Col N="292" /> not have effected any material improvement in Dublin's traffic.  Nevertheless the plan was a good one, and what we are seeking to do here is to meet all the aspirations in the Bill prepared by Deputy Wilson, but at the same time to remove the huge bureaucracy element in it which would triplicate staffing.  We have tried to make this a lean State animal which will help the Dublin transport problem without costing the taxpayer a fortune.  I will look for the remaining Stages here and in the other House quickly so that we will be able to set about resolving the traffic chaos that has beset Dublin for so long.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on the last occasion I was speaking about the experience of free ports in the UK and in other places also. The reality is that this development has not proved very successful in the UK.  Of the six free ports there, only the one at Liverpool has had any measure of success. I trust that we do not follow the same formula as that followed in the UK because that formula appears to be too rigid and not achieving the desired objective.</P>
      <P>I understand that an association of free ports were established recently in the UK but that already they are petitioning the Government there to make significant changes in the legislation, to take the emphasis off policing the ports and to provide for a more developmental role for them.  We should learn from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is evidence that in various parts of the world free ports are successful. In the Dominican Republic, for instance, where there is a very liberal free port policy, there are four free zones and between them they have attracted 130 American companies, employing 30,000 people.  Therefore, it is possible for a free <Col N="295" /> port to be a dynamic job creating centre of effort.  While we must be conscious of the national interest primarily as opposed to the local interest, it should be remembered that the original proposal arose from the Government task force.  The people involved in the task force recognised a particularly bad unemployment black spot and put forward a number of proposals including the free port proposal. The purpose was to give some stimulus and advantage to the Cork region because of the very serious unemployment problem there.</P>
    <P>It can be said fairly, as in the words of the Cork City Manager this week, that while the haemorrhage in that regard has been stopped, the patient is not better. Nobody can be complacent about unemployment in the Cork region.  I urge the Minister to look carefully at the experience in the United Kingdom which was not a success and at the experience in other countries where the concept has been more successful.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in the EC context we are constrained by regulations and we cannot have a free for all in this free port scheme.  I also recognise that we must look to the national interest and not drain activity from other areas, because that is not the purpose of the free port scheme. The real purpose is to generate new activity.  In seeking to generate new industrial activity and job creation projects we will have to be very open about the kind of legislation we need and not be too restrictive about customs and other regulations.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill and the orders and regulations which are provided for, but which are not yet known in detail, will be very important.  In his speech the Minister said that even now, before the Bill is passed, his officials are drafting orders and regulations.  I hope that indicates a sense of urgency.  He also mentioned the form of management of a free port in the concept of public or private or a combination of both.  It appears the harbour commissioners have been given the green light to test the market, to seek proposals from private interests and the <Col N="296" /> result of this exercise will be very interesting.</P>
    <P>It is important to get the dynamism of the private sector involved with the expertise of the Cork Harbour Commissioners. The Minister is retaining the right to make this an entirely public or entirely private venture but since the harbour commissioners have such an important part to play in Ringaskiddy, they should get together with the private sector to develop a good free port scheme.  At the end of the day the free port must become a positive dynamic stimulus to economic activity and the real test will be to see how soon the 30 acres will need to be extended.  It is the hope of all Deputies from the region that the 30 acres will be too small at a very early date.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the comments made by Deputy Lyons.  I did not intend to get into this area but as he raised these points I will reply to them. He broadened the debate to launch an attack on the lack of Government commitment to Cork.  That flies in the face of the facts.  There is no doubt that Cork has been an unemployment black spot for a number of years and we have suffered enormous job losses as a result of the closure of a number of major industries and the reduction of the labour force in many other industries.  The fact that we are in difficulty is not the same as saying that the Government did nothing and do not care.  I do not know what any Government could do to overcome this problem that this Government have not already tried to do.  This week the city manager said that the haemorrhage of unemployment appears to have been stopped, that the patient is far from better but the condition has been stabilised.</P>
    <P>A number of indicators suggest that we are beginning to overcome the problem. That is partly as a result of deliberate effort by the Government to put major investment and infrastructure into Cork. The city is being rebuilt &mdash; the quay walls, bridges and roads, and Ringaskiddy got a continuing investment programme from both Governments.  Through the decentralisation <Col N="297" /> of the small industries board, the IDA have been very dynamic, with a combination of IDA know how and local involvement, in starting up a number of small companies.  More recently, there has been a new Government package which includes a designation of a major area in the centre of the city for special treatment, to encourage developers to get involved in urban renewal programmes, office and shopping developments and so on.  That is a positive commitment.</P>
    <P>The housing programme has been maintained at a high level as has the building of schools in and around the city particularly in the expanding areas.  The Government have pushed ahead with the inquiry as regards the lower river crossing, which directly affects what will happen at Ringaskiddy both in relation to the free port and industrial development generally.  The Government have shown considerable commitment to Irish Steel and the Minister, Deputy John Bruton, won important concessions which hopefully will enable Irish Steel to survive and to develop in a very difficult climate.  The refinery is now viable.  NET appear to have been turned round, even though they are facing a difficult pricing situation.</P>
    <P>It would be untrue to accept the notion that Cork's troubles are the result of a lack of Government commitment.  I believe the worst of the troubles are over. That is part of Government strategy and now this free port is coming on-stream. We should not exaggerate its importance because it is not the panacea which some people have claimed, but it is another link in a developing chain which will, I hope, restore and renew Cork.</P>
    <P>As all Cork Deputies have done, I welcome the introduction of this legislation and plead with the Minister to recognise all the factors involved.  This free port was intended to give an advantage to a disadvantaged area, disadvantaged in the sense of the levels of unemployment.  The Minister should not lack courage to give this measure teeth, to give the free port a certain amount of freedom and to look at the British <Col N="298" /> experience which has not worked.  He should not tie us up as happened in the case of the British free ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the emphasis in the Anglo-Irish Agreement on the need to re-establish devolved government in Northern Ireland, he will now publicly urge the SDLP to take its seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985 states that it is the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government that responsibility in respect of certain matters should be devolved within Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community; and that the Irish Government support that policy.  The agreement also states that both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.  The question of whether the SDLP should enter the present Assembly, or any future Assembly, is a matter for that party for whose independence, integrity and judgment I have the greatest respect.  It would not be appropriate for me to take the action suggested by the Deputy.  I would, however, draw his attention to the relevant remarks by Mr. John Hume on devolved executive power in the course of his speech in the British House of Commons yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that a poll taken in 1984 showed that a majority of both communities &mdash;<Col N="299" /> 89 per cent of Protestants and 53 per cent Catholics &mdash; were in favour of the SDLP's going into the Assembly?  They did not think it was likely that they would go in, but nevertheless that was the position. Does the Taoiseach now accept that the Assembly would be the forum for dialogue about the devolution to which he refers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the implication of the question, which would seem to be an expression of a judgment that the SDLP should have gone into the Assembly.  That is a matter for that party to decide in their own judgment, which they have exercised with great skill and wisdom over the years.  I would not go along with any suggestion or implication that we, members of the parties in this House, or this House, should attempt to tell them what to do in a matter which is so very much one for their own judgment.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the Assembly which exists in Northern Ireland would be a suitable forum for dialogue in relation to the devolved government to which both Governments and the SDLP have agreed in the Anglo-Irish Agreement?

      <P>The question is in relation to the need to re-establish devolved government in Northern Ireland, which is agreed on by both Governments in the document and, as the Taoiseach said, by the SDLP in John Hume's statement.  I am asking the Taoiseach if it would be his opinion, in view of the enormous Unionist backlash and the need to make some effort to defuse this situation, that the Assembly would be a suitable forum for bringing all the parties together for a discussion on devolved government.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite a serious matter, as I am sure are all matters which come up here.  This seems to be particularly serious and the supplementary seems to seek to open up a debate on the suitability or otherwise of the Assembly.  That is certainly not covered in the question.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No, there is no proposal to introduce legislation within the next six months.  The difficulties are obvious if one thinks about it.  They are in the areas of definition and legitimate and illegitimate use of recording devices.  For example, what does one do with somebody who records a telephone conversation in order to have a record of it?  How does one cope with a journalist who interviews one on the phone and records the interview for legitimate purposes?  What does one do with the whole area of privacy and the privacy of conversations, public conversations, public statements and private conversations? That leads one inevitably into the area of the privacy of one's movements. What does one do about photographs being taken?  Are we to restrict photographs to situations where permission is granted?  It is enormously complex.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Question No. 3 and Questions Nos. 62 and 63 which are for written reply together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1979 is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Statistics supplied to me by the Garda show that the number of breaches of the Acts detected in 1983 was 239 and <Col N="306" /> in 1984 it was 816.  The figure in 1985 up to the end of August was 441.  In the enforcement of the law under the Acts in recent years the Garda have had to take cognisance of court cases in relation to gaming machines.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court delivered a judgment on 19 November 1985 upholding the constitutionality of section 14 of the 1956 Act which sets out the stake and prize limits for gaming machines.  Following that decision the position in relation to gaming machines is under consideration by the Garda.</P>
    <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 23 October recorded in the 1985 Official Report Volume 361, Column 45, the Government, as announced on 17 October 1985 have decided that proposals to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 should be prepared. Before I put any specific proposals to Government I will give very careful consideration to the arguments for and against each proposal.  I will, accordingly, consider any representations made to me or views expressed concerning any proposed amendment of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated in his reply, the Supreme Court decision has been given since the question was tabled.  What is the position now in regard to those who hold a licence under the Act but who are deemed to be in contravention because these machines are designed to pay out an amount which has been deemed to be in contravention of the Act?  Is the Minister aware that many of these premises have closed down since the Supreme Court decision, that 4,700 people are employed in these licensed premises and that the Exchequer benefits from them to the extent of £35 million by way of VAT and machine tax revenue? In view of the fact that such a large amount of money is accruing to the State and so many people are employed in this industry, will the Minister give a clear statement as to what the proprietors of these premises are to do now to comply with the law?  As he will be aware, many of them have closed, not wishing to be in contravention of the law.  My purpose in <Col N="307" /> putting down the question originally was to ensure that the law was complied with. As is clear from the Minister's reply, a very large number of prosecutions have been brought, so obviously the law was not being complied with and the Minister is aware of the anomalies that exist.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I was not aware that premises had closed down but if the Deputy says that I accept what he says.  The Garda are now examining the situation in the light of the Supreme Court decision.  The Government have already made a decision that in preparing the legislation for the National Lottery the Gaming and Lotteries Act will have to be amended.  There is a decision, therefore, to amend that Act already.  I am telling the House that I am prepared to look at proposals to amend other sections of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, including the one which would raise the stakes and raise the prize money for gaming machines.  However, I am not in a position to give a categoric statement on the exact legal position at present.  It is being examined in the light of the Supreme Court decision.  <i>Prima facie</i> it would seem to me that people operating with higher stakes or higher prize money than allowed in the 1956 Act are outside the law and that it would need an amendment to bring them back in if the practice of gaming machines and so on is to continue as it has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that several of them have closed down.  This has put employment in jeopardy. The House is anxious that the law be updated in a reasonable way.  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that prosecutions will not be undertaken until the new Bill is published in the Dáil?  Will <Col N="308" /> he give an assurance that that Bill will be brought forward as quickly as possible?</P>

If people are in breach of the law it is a matter for the Garda to enforce the law.  I will give no such assurance to the House.  On the other hand, the Government have already announced that it is their intention to set up a National Lottery as quickly as possible.  It is a matter of priority with the Government that the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, be amended.  I am telling the House that I am prepared to consider further amendments to that Act, including the precise one the Deputy has in mind.  I am open to submissions from people in the industry or any Deputy or Senator, including Deputy Molloy, on the precise changes required.</P>

I am not aware of any difficulty but I will bring the Deputy's views to the attention of the public relations section of the Garda Síochána who are responsible. Schemes have been set up in corporation and council estates.  As a matter of fact, one of the more successful pilot schemes was set up in a corporation estate in Dublin.  There is not a policy to confine the scheme to private housing estates.  It is a matter for the local people in co-operation with the Garda to set it up in their communities.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Prison records indicate that, up to last December, four offenders in prisons committed suicide.  As regards the current year, the position is that in the absence of a formal finding by an inquest, it would not be appropriate for me to classify a death in a prison either as being or as not being suicide.  Inquests have yet to be held in three cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Offenders whose behaviour suggests that they have psychiatric problems or that they might make an attempt at committing suicide are referred to consultant psychiatrists who visit regularly and, if the psychiatrist considers it necessary, they are transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, for the necessary treatment.</P>
    <P>No matter what measures are taken it is not possible to completely prevent suicides occurring if the persons concerned are determined and are able to conceal their intentions from the supervising staff.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, when one compares the very small number of suicides in our prisons over the past ten years with the throughput of over 30,000 prisoners in the same period, the precautions taken are generally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The total number of deaths in Garda custody over the past ten years was 25, details of which are set out in the following tabular statement which will be circulated with the Official Report.  The total number of deaths is given because it is not clear from the coroners' verdicts how many cases involved suicide.  The table includes details of the coroner's verdict in each case.</P>
    <P>The Garda Code contains detailed instructions on the treatment and supervision of persons in Garda custody including their safety and well-being.  While the instructions appear to be fully adequate, they are reviewed from time to time, and particularly if any untoward incident occurs, to see whether any improvements can be made.</P>

      <P>Is there a study of the figures available?  Has a study been carried out of the deaths that have been declared as suicide or those which the authorities, whatever about the reports of coroners, suspect were suicide from the circumstances involved?  Has there been any study to try to find common <Col N="315" /> links between the cases involved and, if so, have such studies resulted in the altering of the methods of dealing with prisoners either in Garda custody or in our prisons?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Up to the beginning of this year, there were four suicides in a ten-year period in the prisons.  The number is too small to establish the kind of pattern that the Deputy seems to suggest.  I am not aware of any studies that have been carried out to establish links on a causatory basis.  As I said, regarding the question of deaths in Garda custody it is not clear whether or not deaths are suicide in certain cases and it is quite clear in other cases that there are natural causes.  Again, I am not aware of any study that has been carried out.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House much longer on this.  While the official figures, which I accept, are given as four, the Minister would be aware that coroners are reluctant to return verdicts of suicide in very many cases.  Would the Minister initiate some kind of study in relation to the deaths which have occurred in our prisons and in Garda custody, to establish what steps might be taken by way of altering regulations or providing methods of identifying persons who might be at risk?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I shall consider the situation and the suggestion. There is a very low number of suicides in our prisons as compared with, for example, 151 in English and Welsh prisons and 26 in Scottish prisons in the same period, even allowing for the difference in population.  The figures show that our record in this compares favourably. The figures for the countries I have mentioned do not include deaths classified as non-natural.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Oral Questions Nos. 7, 17, 27 and 30 and Priority Question No. 33 together.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to my reply to Question No. 37 of 23 October where I dealt generally with drug addiction in prisons and outlined the facilities available to the prison &mdash; Official Report, columns 38 to 40 of that date.  Since then, as Deputies will be aware, two people died tragically in Mountjoy Prison, one from an apparently self-administered overdose of illicit drugs and the other by hanging.  As I am sure will be appreciated, an inquest must be held in both cases and I would not therefore regard it as appropriate for me to comment publicly on issues to be determined at the inquests.  In addition, the circumstances in which the prisoner was found hanged are the subject of an internal inquiry which is not yet completed.</P>
      <P>Since my reply of 23 October last was given, two developments have taken place in relation to drugs.  First, the Minister for Health and I have discussed the possible use of an almost completed new unit at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, as a centre for conducting &ldquo;screening&rdquo; medical tests on newly committed prisoners who are thought to be in need of screening for conditions such as hepatitis, AIDS, etc.  I understand that the Department of the Health will now be discussing the position with the Eastern Health Board. I hope to be in a position to make a joint statement with the Minister for Health on this matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second development is the appearance in the prisons of drug addicted prisoners who have been proven to have come in contact with the AIDS virus. One such prisoner in Mountjoy who was due for release on 26 November was released from custody on the day on which notification of the presence of AIDS antibodies in his blood was received, on condition that he attend for appropriate medical monitoring of his condition.  The other person is still in <Col N="319" /> custody in St. Patrick's Institution but is now segregated from the main body of offenders in the institution.  Guidelines drawn up some time ago by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health have been issued for dealing with this offender.</P>
    <P>The presence of prisoners who have been in contact with the AIDS virus is, obviously, a most unwelcome development for the prision system but was not unexpected, given the experience of other prison systems throughout the world.  As I have said this problem has been encountered in other prison systems. In the near future, officers of my Department will travel abroad to see at first hand how the problem has been coped with and to learn from the experience of others.  Because of the understandable fears expressed by prison staff in view of the exceptional nature of this problem, representatives of the Prison Officers' Association will be included in the official party.</P>
    <P>On the question of the prevention of drugs being brought illegally into prisons, I think it is important that there be a recognition of the great difficulty faced by prison authorities in trying to ensure that drugs are not smuggled into prison. Many members of this House would, I have no doubt, protest if there were to be any question of introducing the kind of regime that would be needed to achieve a very high degree of security in that respect and complete success would, in any event, be unattainable.  Arrangements are, however, being made to instal cameras in the visiting rooms at Mountjoy in order to enhance the security of those rooms.</P>
    <P>While stressing the virtual impossibility of excluding drugs altogether, I would like to emphasise that recent speculation on the level of illegal drug use in the prisons and on the number of prisoners considered to be serious drug addicts, as distinct from those who may have had experience of drug taking before committal, seriously overstates the problem. <Col N="320" /> Specifically, there is no basis for suggestions that 30 per cent of the prison population are either drug addicts or regular drug abusers.  That percentage represents the number of prisoners who have themselves said that they took drugs at some stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of allegations that some prison officers are involved in trafficking with prisoners in drugs, the position is that such allegations have been made from time to time but to date no evidence has been forthcoming which would warrant any action being taken in relation to any officer.  In fairness to the general body of officers, I should also stress that the suggestions that there has been trafficking relate only to a tiny minority and even then, as I have said, have not been substantiated.  But if any Deputy has any evidence of such criminal activity on the part of any officer, I would request that it be made available so that it can be investigated by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods raises two other points &mdash; treatment for hepatitis and alcoholism. In the case of hepatitis, this is obviously a matter for the medical staff of the prisons who arrange for specialised consultation where they deem it necessary. I should say that prison medical staff have been conscious for many years of the dangers to health posed by those with hepatitis who are, in the main, drug abusers. On treatment for alcoholism I would refer the Deputies to the various annual reports on prisons, copies of which are available in the Library, and which contain a fair amount of material on this subject.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make the point that a prison system cannot possibly offer some ready to hand cure for the various problems presented by prisoners suffering from the effects of drugs.  Most, if not all, of those drug abusers will have previously received treatment in some hospital or centre before being committed to prison.  So the situation is one where it must be recognised that, in most cases arising in the prisons, previous treatment was not successful in weaning the person from the addiction despite the <Col N="321" /> best efforts of the people running those programmes.</P>
    <P>I need not emphasise the obvious fact that this comment is not a criticism of those people who are doing such dedicated and excellent work on behalf of the community, but it is only right to say that likewise there is no lack of will within the prison system to help drug addicts.  It must, however, be recognised that problems such as drug addiction within a prison are a reflection of what is happening in the wider community and it is not realistic to expect that the solution to drug abusers' problems can be found simply by some special action taken in a prison environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, in particular to Question No. 7, could he clarify if it is envisaged that the new unit in Dundrum will be used purely for testing, or if it will provide some sort of treatment centre?  If the latter is the case, how many persons will it be able to accommodate in providing treatment for drug addiction within the prison system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The position at the moment is that I have had discussions with the Minister for Health. Discussions are going on between our respective officials and I understand that the Department of Health will now be discussing the position with the Eastern Health Board.  It is envisaged in the first instance that the facilities there could be used for screening for such conditions as hepatitis or AIDS.  Also it would be possible to provide treatment for approximately 30 to 31 in single room accommodation in the centre which is almost completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has taken in one of the priority questions in this reply so I have no alternative but to ask supplementaries now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise I would stay out <Col N="322" /> of it and come back later.  Is the Minister aware that in this very month 20 out of 26 inmates of the women's prison in Mountjoy were alleged to be on drug-related charges &mdash; this was in a report by a journalist which appeared very recently &mdash; and that normally the number is at least one third?  Is the Minister aware also that a survey of drug abusers in the Dublin committal prisons in September 1981 showed that of 22 drug abusers in Mountjoy two only had served any sentence prior to taking drugs, that is, 9 per cent only had served any sentence prior to taking drugs?  Furthermore, this survey showed that 70 per cent were convicted of larceny from houses and cars, muggings and bag snatches in order to get money for drugs, and that 8,000 people had come to the notice of the gardaí because of involvement in drugs?  Does the Minister not agree, therefore, that one of the best ways of dealing with drugs and of slashing these crime rates is to deal with the people who are found to be offenders in that area?  Would he agree that he has here an opportunity to deal with the drugs situation, quite severely cutting the crime rates, if he can make good progress with offenders who come to the attention of the Garda?  In the replies given so far I did not notice any particularly marked plan to deal with that situation.  It is a very important subject, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of the statistics referred to by the Deputy as regards the women's prison.  I doubt that they are accurate but I will get the accurate figure and communicate separately with the Deputy on it.  With regard to the other study to which the Deputy referred, we all know that drug addiction leads to involvement in crime in quite a number of cases.  But the Deputy is also aware that it is very difficult, once one is addicted, to break <Col N="323" /> the addiction habit.  It requires extraordinarily high levels of self-motivation.</P>
      <P>The point I am making in my answer is that many people who go to prison and are addicted have already undergone treatment in hospitals and drug centres outside and, despite the best efforts of the staff on these programmes, they have not succeeded in breaking the addiction habit.  Therefore, I am saying that it is very difficult, but that is not to say that it is not important, that it is not a serious problem, or that I am not committed to taking every step to help individual prisoners who are suffering from addiction in our prison system.  In a previous reply to Deputy Hyland I outlined the steps I intend to take and one can add the steps I have indicated today to that programme.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that <Col N="324" /> parents, wives and families of offenders who have been committed to Mountjoy, feel they have a right to be protected while they are in care there?  Second, is the Minister aware that public representatives have been approached &mdash; I for one have been approached &mdash; when people are transferred to Cork prison because, to date, Cork has been relatively drug free, or from problems which I understand are now creeping in there?  Parents and families have a right to expect that prisoners would be safe in the care of the Minister.  Would the Minister not accept that fact and try to ensure that that request is respected?  When they are taken out of the drug environment outside and put into a secure situation, surely the families have a right to expect they would be free from drugs?</P>

Certainly I am committed to doing that.

For example, it is policy not to mix people who are on remand with people who have been sentenced.  Neither is it policy to mix first-time offenders with people who repeatedly offend.  If one were to take all drug offenders and put them in one particular area, first of all there is serious doubt about whether that would achieve anything &mdash; it might make things worse <Col N="325" />&mdash; in terms of having all drug offenders together but, second, it cuts straight across other equally valid policies about the treatment of offenders.</P>

We must have a regime under which relatives and friends can visit.  There is a conflict between a regime under which one can freely visit and a regime under which things cannot be passed, especially things as small as drugs.  Obviously large quantities of drugs can be transmitted in very small packages in terms of embracing, kissing, that kind of inter-personal relationship.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy has asked whether I will be introducing amending legislation.  Under section 46 of the 1962 Act legislation is not required because coroners have discretion already.  If, as the Deputy seems to indicate, they are not aware of the discretion which they have, I will make sure that they are made aware by circularising all coroners pointing out the discretionary powers they have under the Act.</P>

In the years since 1980 the overall volume of work in each year has been above the 1980 figure.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the present strength of the Garda force; where he plans to get the additional manpower which he has committed the Government to provide for extra Border security; and how he plans to provide the number required to adequately police cities and major crime areas throughout the country and to meet the neighbourhood watch requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The strength of the Garda Síochána on 31 October 1985 was 11,349.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detailed deployment of Garda <Col N="335" /> manpower is a matter for the Garda authorities having regard to their assessment of needs, overall resources and demands on Garda services.  The Garda authorities have informed me that additional gardaí have been allocated to Border divisions by the redeployment of manpower from other divisions on a temporary basis.  They are keeping the policing needs of other areas, particularly cities and areas where the incidence of crime is high, under constant review and appropriate measures, including the provision of extra funds for overtime, have been taken to ensure an adequate Garda presence in all areas.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my replies to Question No. 82 on 10 July 1985 and Question No. 729 on 2 May 1984, it is not the practice to allocate a specific proportion of Garda resources to the neighbourhood watch scheme which is essentially a network of public-spirited people who observe what is going on in their own neighbourhood and report suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the dramatic increases in burglaries, particularly in the Dublin metropolitan area, and that they increased in private houses from 6,991 in 1980 to 12,073 in 1984?  Is <Col N="336" /> he also aware that detection rates have fallen from 41 per cent to 24.4 per cent? In view of this and of the dramatic increase in household insurance which has doubled during this period, could the Minister give a guarantee that extra gardaí will be provided where they are needed, especially coming up to Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Certainly there has been an increase in the incidence of burglary over the past six years.  However, the community watch scheme is particularly useful in combating burglaries and resources will be made available to different communities by the Garda to ensure that these schemes work efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the seriousness of the problem?  Perhaps the Garda can do no more because of the system and the Minister should address that problem.  The numbers of convictions in relation to burglaries in private houses over the period to which I referred earlier increased from 1,133 to 1,300. That is a fairly small increase but the number of recorded detections is not very high.  Is the system not functioning?  I appreciate that the neighbourhood watch scheme might work, but there is a need for a new approach because of the size of the problem.  Is the Minister further aware that there is great danger now to anybody lodging money and quite often banks have notices to the effect that they are closed due to a raid?  Does the Minister agree that this is a frightening development and that there is community acceptance of a new level of crime?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy is slipping into his old habit of hyperbole to make his point.  Obviously there is a problem in regard to burglaries but I do not think the solution lies solely <Col N="337" /> in the area of detection.  Prevention is the best method along with neighbourhood watch and other preventative measures which the individual householder could take.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have shown that the Minister is not aware of what is happening. He is making nice statements but he is removed from the reality of muggings, protection rackets and companies having to increase security.  He should change gear in relation to this problem and look again at the organisation of the Garda in dealing with the problem.  Figures show that, while crime is increasing, the numbers convicted are not increasing at the same rate.  Does the system need a rethink?  I am not being facetious and I can show the Minister any night on the northside of Dublin the serious problems which exist.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will appreciate, the enforcement of the law, including the law relating to the misuse of drugs, is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána.  From the information available to me I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána fully appreciate the serious nature of the drug problem and are fully committed to dealing with it.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that the strength of the Drug Squad, which has been augmented substantially in the recent past, is adequate having regard to the fact that (a) all members of the force have responsibility in the prevention of drug abuse as part of their general duties and (b) a total of 2,325 members, representative of all Garda divisions, have undergone an advanced training programme on drugs investigation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the policy of complementing the efforts of the Drug Squad by the involvement of all members of the force is proving effective as a substantial number of detections are being made by non-Drug Squad members.  I am informed, for example, that 68 per cent of drug seizures in 1983 were made by uniform and detective personnel, other than Drugs Squad and in 1984, seizures by this group constituted 70.4 per cent.</P>
      <P>While legislation in relation to the misuse of drugs is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Health, the Deputy will be aware that the law in relation to drug abuse was updated and the penalties for the more serious drug offences were substantially increased &mdash; including the provision of life sentences for drug trafficking &mdash; in the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that in recent times his approach has been somewhat complacent in relation to drugs?

      <P>When I get answers like that the Chair will realise why I have to ask more questions.  I have no alternative but to pursue the Minister.  I am asking him to get up from his seat and to get active in tackling drugs.  I believe he is complacent.  I am asking him to root out every drug pusher, not just the major ones who were taken from the scene in the past few years.  I ask him to pursue actively every drug pusher and to make sure that the other agencies are co-operating. I was very disappointed when he did not seem to be co-ordinating information regarding drugs coming into ports.  If he is concerned about the supply of drugs he should have that information at his fingertips.  This arose in an earlier question. Will he give us an undertaking that he will leave no hiding place here for drug pushers, that he will continue with the effort put in by his predecessor and himself in the past few years to ensure that drug pushers are removed from the scene?</P>

He was very complacent and he allowed the problem to reach epidemic proportions in 1980 with the result that when we came to power we had to take radical action.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am <Col N="341" /> informed by the Garda authorities that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of recorded attacks on the elderly in comparison with last year and they attribute this in substantial part to a combination of community measures and Garda measures.

      <P>As regards the coming months, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in conjuction with community alert projects organised by Muintir na Tíre, each divisional officer drew up plans to meet the needs of his own division and steps were taken recently at the approach of the darker evenings to have those plans reviewed and brought up-to-date, as might be necessary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of the great public anxiety and concern following the attempted break-out at Portlaoise prison on Sunday morning last and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have already indicated in public statements on Sunday last a broad outline of what occurred at Portlaoise prison last Sunday when an attempted escape from the prison failed.</P>
      <P>While the single most important fact is that the attempt failed it is, as I have already indicated publicly, deeply disturbing that prisoners were able to get from the main cell block of the prison as far as the main gate of the prison using duplicate keys.  In the past the prisoners have used explosives and so on during escape attempts but this is the first occasion on which prisoners have used keys in this fashion or have had firearms in their possession.</P>
      <P>The circumstances are under investigation by both the gardaí and the prison authorities and the House can be assured that every effort will be made to bring to justice those involved in this incident.</P>
      <P>I have already publicly commended the security services at the prison for the manner in which they reacted to this incident and I would now like to say that the foresight demonstrated by those responsible for security at the prison is illustrated by the replacement early last year of a wooden gate by a steel gate which led to the failure of this escape bid.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I understand that RTE in the course of a purported reconstruction of the escape bid broadcast on Monday evening last, said that the prisoners could have taken keys from an officer and opened the gate which they attempted to blow up.  If that were true there would indeed be cause for public anxiety but it is not the case as the gate in question required two keys to be opened simultaneously from either side of the gate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the principal feature of <Col N="343" /> this incident was the failure of the escape attempt and I am confident that the prisoners, even if they had succeeded in blowing the gate, would have been dealt with by the Army because the Army, alerted by the general alarm, were by the time the prisoners reached the main gate deployed outside the gate in anticipation of the prisoners succeeding in breaching the gate.  This aspect of the incident demonstrates again the degree of planning and thought given to all sorts of possibilities by those in charge of security.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that a number of investigations have commenced and that criminal proceedings may ensure if the Director of Public Prosecutions so directs and I am, therefore, somewhat inhibited in what responses or information I can reveal to the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is what is being investigated at the moment. However, I think it would have been more appropriate if the Deputy had asked how duplicate keys came to be in the hands of prisoners who attempted to escape last Sunday morning.  That is why the gardaí are now in Portlaoise prison carrying out a very serious investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the availability of duplicate keys is also a matter of serious concern but he must accept that the presence of firearms and explosives put the lives of the prison officers at serious risk.  Is the Minister aware that the confidence of prison officers and their wives and families has been seriously undermined by what took place last Sunday?  What plans has he in mind to endeavour to restore the confidence that has been undermined in men who are doing a totally dedicated job on <Col N="344" /> behalf of the nation?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Of course I am concerned about it and an investigation is proceeding and will continue into the matters raised by the Deputy.  The danger of the contraband in the prison is dealt with in three ways. First of all, the prison staff act to prevent it being introduced to the prison.  Second, they act to find it by means of search of prisoners and cells if contraband is in the prisons.  Third, the vigilance of the staff and the security of the prison come into effect if contraband such as that linked with this case is used which has not been found in either of the preliminary steps. On this occasion there was failure to prevent the contraband entering, there was failure to find it in the prison, but the security measures taken to prevent escape succeeded admirably.</P>

      <P>How often in the past has there been a review of security in Portlaoise?  I have been looking into the position in prisons outside Ireland.  For example, how often have the locks in the prison been changed so that the possibility of duplicating keys would be minimised? If there is not a regular change of locks in prisons it is very easy for people to produce duplicate keys.  How often have locks been changed in the prison to avoid duplication?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general welcome in the House for this Bill and, of course, a particular welcome for it by Members from Cork city and county. That is only natural because they have been privileged through the nomination of Ringaskiddy for development as a free port.  Other Members, including me, give a welcome to the Bill which we would have wished to be broader and wider in its application so that other suitable locations would have been looked at for nomination as free ports.  We have been told that other locations may follow in due course, that this is an enabling Bill. That shows that the Government are embarking on this without a proper detailed study of other locations throughout the country which might be more suitable than Ringaskiddy, about whose nomination I remain to be convinced. Members of Fine Gael, particularly Deputy Avril Doyle, expressed the same feeling.</P>
      <P>The idea of a free port is not a new one, and we know that even in mediaeval Europe, in the Hanseatic League, free ports were established for <i>entrepôt</i> trade in northern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a proud boast of the Fianna Fáil Party that the first customs free port in the world was established by a Fianna Fáil Minister, the late Seán Lemass, at <Col N="366" /> Shannon Airport on the banks of the Shannon estuary.  The debate on the Second Stage of the Customs Free Airport Bill of 1947 still makes extremely interesting reading.  Indeed the prophets of the day, including the former Leader of the Fine Gael Party, James Dillion, must surely regret his contribution to that debate, i.e., he foretold then that Rineanna, as Shannon was known at the time, would have nothing but rabbits running wild there.  Regrettably, he did not see the possibility of the development which has taken place there since, and no doubt the further development which can still take place.</P>
    <P>There are more than 400 free ports throughout the world at present, and it is believed that about 20 per cent of world trade takes place through them.  Most of this growth in trade through free ports is taking place in less developed and developing economies where they have been a spectacular success.  There are free ports in Taiwan which provide more than 70,000 jobs; there are three in Malaysia with 22,000 jobs, two in South Korea with 120,000 jobs; and one in Mexico with 70,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>I recently visited Taiwan and there I met the Vice-Minister for Trade who told me he got the concept of the free port in Taiwan at Shannon Airport while having discussions with Brendan O'Regan and his colleagues of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in 1963, and now 23 years later we are thinking of embarking on similar activities ourselves.</P>
    <P>It can be said that the most successful free port in the world is in Miami in the United States which is the biggest privately owned venture in the world. The most important aspect is, of course, its location because it can deal with the United States, Central and Southern America and Europe.  It is in a unique position, geographically speaking, for this kind of development and it has the added attraction of a very large cargo airport beside the port, the port itself being the third largest container terminal on the east coast of the United States. It is, of course, an extremely powerful international financial centre and is <Col N="367" /> acknowledged as the most successful free port in the world.  There are lessons to be learned from it.  The decision to site the free port there was based on strictly commercial and not political considerations.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to learn on how to establish successful free ports here by examining the operation in Miami and some of the more successful free ports in other parts of the world.  I understand our neighbours, the Scots, brought a director of Miami free port to advise them on how to develop a free port in Prestwick in Scotland.  This should not go unnoticed. We should be prepared to contact as many people as we possibly can who are extremely knowledgable in this area to advise us.</P>
    <P>At the outset, we should be clear in our minds that the purpose of a free port is to stimulate economic activity and add employment in the region.  The very fact that a port is established in a particular area means that a range of benefits is conferred on businesses setting up in such ports.</P>
    <P>The financial benefits will derive from deferred liabilities for customs duties and VAT.  In the case of customs duties the Bill provides that the non-European Community goods imported into a free port will become liable for customs duty only if and when they are subsequently placed on the Community market.  Goods originating in the European Community, of course, are in free circulation and are not subject to customs duties on arrival in the State in any event.  The benefit of this concession to the cash flow of a business will depend, of course, on the nature and extent of that business.  An indication of the degree of potential benefit is that the average rate of custom duty is of the order of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, in his introductory remarks, did advise that there are no proposals in this Bill for VAT reliefs but that they would be the subject of separate regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT pact.  I understand that the main thrust of the regulations will be as follows: first, a business operating within a free port <Col N="368" /> would be able to import, without payment of VAT, materials, machinery and so on for use in the free port in connection with processing or manufacturing there. Secondly, VAT would be charged at the zero rate on goods supplied within the free port.  Thirdly, goods entering the rest of the State from the free port would come under the internal VAT system if the subject of a sale, which would normally be the case, and would not then incur import VAT.</P>
    <P>I understand that under these arrangements finished consumer goods would not quality for relief from VAT on importation into a free port nor in general would any other goods imported for re-sale. Relief would apply to all materials components, plant or machinery imported for use by a manufacturing or processing concern within a free port.</P>
    <P>We are advised that this is the correct approach, since as I have said already the purpose of the concessions is to stimulate economic activity and therefore employment within the free port and not simply to divert normal trade from elsewhere in the State.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that a free port will also afford some less tangible but nonetheless real and valuable advantages apart from the financial benefits I have already mentioned.  Advantages such as a concentration of facilities and infrastructure leading to economies of scale, a more secure environment, simplification of customs procedures and documentation, which of course would be extremely attractive to small firms and firms which might not otherwise become involved in re-export trade.</P>
    <P>It is well that we remember at this stage that we have economic stagnation in many parts of the State.  There is a very great obligation on the Government and all State agencies to ensure that this new venture of free ports succeeds.</P>
    <P>We have the highest unemployment ever and all efforts to defeat that problem to date have failed.  Time is running out on us and we have an opportunity, however limited, under the Free Ports Bill, to try to make another effort and perhaps <Col N="369" /> more serious this time, if we are to provide for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Free ports can be successful but we must have the right mix.  We must provide first class world standard services and we must remember that anything but first class services will not succeed.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has already designated six areas where they hope to establish successful free ports.  These are: Belfast, Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff, Prestwick and Southampton.  The British Government, while giving every encouragement for their success, have given also an ultimatum that the ports should develop within a five year period. Reports to date indicate that Liverpool and, in particular, Southampton, are the most successful.  There is of course a lesson to be learned from this too in that, from the start it is obvious that Southampton and Liverpool enjoyed natural advantages over the other centres.  This is a most important point and one that should be at the forefront of all our thinking in this area.</P>
    <P>Naturally, political decisions play a major part in designating areas for development as free ports but I warn the House that we cannot afford to ignore the basic essentials which are required for the success of a free port.</P>
    <P>It has been reported that the development of the free ports in the UK has been slow.  There have been criticisms of the customs regime to the effect that it is too rigid.  From the beginning we should remember that all free ports are subject to the criteria set out in the EC directives. We must remember that to a large extent a free port is a free zone within a larger customs zone, in this case, the EC.</P>
    <P>Again I strongly advise that we must be prepared to learn from the experience of the UK and that we should not think that simply by designating Ringaskiddy or the Shannon estuary or anywhere else as a location for a free port, the venture will be an instant success.  That is something we should remember also from the beginning.  A free port can succeed only if the right mix is present, if it is attractive to the investor and if there is proper, <Col N="370" /> effective and vigorous marketing by the operators of the ports.</P>
    <P>In his opening address the Minister of State said that he was introducing this enabling legislation at this time while the options for arrangements regarding development and management of the only designated area so far are being investigated.  The Minister assured the House that he would proceed with the enactment of a Bill to make as quickly as possible the necessary orders and regulations to bring into being a free port at Ringaskiddy.  There is a great need for a free port there.  There is colossal unemployment in the area but that is the case, too, in many other areas.  A new deep water berth is being provided at Ringaskiddy at a cost of almost £10 million. The cost is being met by way of a State grant.  When that berth is completed &mdash; I understand it will be completed next year &mdash; it will be capable of accommodating vessels of up to 60,000 tons dead weight. It is obvious, therefore, that we will not have any worthwhile development in a free port area at Ringaskiddy for a considerable time.  Undoubtedly, Ringaskiddy would be in a position to compete with Southampton, Liverpool and other places but in the meantime all commercial interests anxious to become involved in free port operations will go to places other than Ringaskiddy because the port there will not be ready.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that there should be undertaken as a matter of urgency a comprehensive study of all the locations within the State where it might be possible to provide free port facilities. This should have been done before now. The result of such studies should be made public with public discussion on them taking place as a matter of urgency.  If moneys from the Exchequer are to be spent on such developments, the public and their representatives must have all the facts before them before these decisions are made.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary with its 96 kilometres of sheltered waters and a deep water channel for vessels up to 200,000 tons dead weight is a must for immediate development as a free port.  There would <Col N="371" /> be no need to spend millions of pounds there to provide berthing facilities for ships.  The facilities are there already unlike the case of Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>The Shannon estuary has outstanding advantages, not alone from a national point of view but from a European context as well.  The estuary's unique maritime capability provides opportunities almost without equal in Europe and it has the capacity, with minimal dredging to handle bulk cargo vessels of 400,000 ton dead weight.  I understand there are only three other sheltered harbours in Europe which can accommodate vessels of this size &mdash; Rotterdam, Le Havre and the Clyde.  The Shannon estuary has the advantage in that it is not affected by congested or shallow approaches as most of the major traditional ports of north-west Europe are.  There is no shortage of land and labour on both sides of the estuary from Loop Head and Kerry Head inland.</P>
    <P>The European Economic Community recently sponsored a study for the regional development organisation in the area and that study shows that there are three industrial sites at Moyne Point, Colman's Point, Renaland Point on the Clare side of the estuary and on the County Kerry side prime industrial sites for immediate development between Tarbert-Ardmore Point, Asdee, Ballylongford and Dale and of course in County Limerick, all the requirements for a successful free port can be found in the Foynes/Foynes Island, Aughinish and Deele estuary areas.  It should be remembered that planning approval has already been given for an oil refinery near Tarbert Ballylongford where carriers of up to 400,000 tonnes dead weight could be accommodated.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that water supply and energy are two important factors to be considered in the establishment of a free port and up to 90,000 cubic metres, 20 million gallons of water per day, can be made available at present to meet this demand.  There is a 610 mega watt of electrical generating capacity in the Shannon Estuary at Tarbert Island <Col N="372" /> and this capacity will be increased to 1,500 mega watts when Moneypoint power station is fully on stream, which I understand, will be in a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>I feel it necessary to say, not just for the sake of the record but to advise the Government, that infrastructure development is planned to keep pace with industrial growth.  Detailed planning studies are available on industrial location, dredging, water resources, assimilative capacity for effluent, power supplies, road networks, housing, environmental and socioeconomic aspects.  All the key information is at hand to enable interested industrialists to arrive at speedy conclusions.  The Shannon Estuary has witnessed considerable trade expansion in recent times and since 1984 the volume of goods moved through the estuary has increased from 1.5 million tonnes to over 3 million tonnes.</P>
    <P>Foynes Island jetty can accommodate tankers of 600,000 tonnes deadweight for the importation of fuel oil.  Foynes Harbour, a natural harbour with three berths, having depths alongside at low water of 11.3 metres, can accommodate vessels of 35,000 tonnes deadweight and, of course, has all the advantages of a harbour which is highly developed.  This harbour has a rail head with a rail spur and at present more than 700 people are employed there.  This is the biggest and deepest harbour on the west coast.  It has all the advantages of a highly developed harbour and is a worthwhile attraction.</P>
    <P>We have a jetty at Moneypoint, County Clare, which can provide accommodation, as it did recently, for ships up to 150,000 tonnes deadweight.  This natural facility already exists.  A ship of 150,000 tonnes deadweight can berth within 20 feet of the shore.  A number of Members of this Parliament saw that only a couple of weeks ago when they visited Moneypoint.  These natural advantages are already there and yet this Government are spending £10 million providing a jetty at Ringaskiddy which will only accommodate ships half that size.  Good luck to Ringaskiddy.  May they get their free port and may it be a success, but I <Col N="373" /> want to point out that we have this natural facility with twice that capacity staring the Government in the face and yet they are not prepared to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I mention these points to assure the Government that all the requirements for a proper healthy mix for the development of a successful free port are immediately available on the Shannon Estuary and, of course, in addition we have Shannon International Airport sitting on the northern shore of the estuary.  The Manpower offices in the environs of the estuary, which has a population of approximately 370,000 people, say that many young, skilled and well educated workers are available.</P>
    <P>Before lunch Deputy Coveney mentioned that Cork was a disaster area from an employment point of view.  That is a fair admission from a senior Government backbencher, but there are many other such disaster areas throughout the country. In reply to a recent parliamentary question to the Taoiseach I was told that, in my own city and county of Limerick, there are 13,500 people out of work.  I understand that in County Clare there are about 6,000 people out of work; in North Tipperary about 3,500 people out of work; in south-east and south Tipperary about 4,611 people out of work; and in County Kerry about 10,000 or 11,000 out of work.  What could be more disastrous than that?</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister to go ahead with the establishment of a free port in Ringaskiddy because obviously he has strong political backing for it, and it is being designated under this enabling Bill.  I will support the establishment of a free port in Ringaskiddy but the Minister should not throw the Shannon Estuary to the winds simply because he does not have the political muscle to do anything about it.  We have the proper mix in the Shannon Estuary for the development of a successful free port.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;Do not turn your back on it.  Let the Shannon Estuary be developed in the same way as Ringaskiddy because experience shows that free port developments which did not have the right mix did not succeed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are taking off a lot of the tourism business into that region. I hope the advent of the Bill will result in a continuation of the industrial redevelopment of the Cork region and will act as a catalyst for the industrial renaissance of the whole south-west region.  It is just one of the catalysts, but an important one.  A number of previous speakers expressed serious reservations about the free port concept and the performance of the Government in relation to the Cork region.  I will be dealing with some of these later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons's condemnation and criticism of successive Coalition Governments and his allegation that they were indifferent to the Cork region is, to say the least, inaccurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be dealing with that <Col N="375" /> later.  The legislation will help the development of the Cork region but it would be inaccurate for anybody to pretend that this is an answer to all our economic ills and it would be unfair to the people looking for jobs in the south-west region. This is an enabling Bill.  I know that Members from all parts of the country are seeking facilities similar to the free port being established in Ringaskiddy. The decision to set up a free port in the Cork region became essential when similar facilities were set up at Southampton, Cardiff, Liverpool, Birmingham and Prestwick because it made the British mainland very attractive to industrialists from the Far East who were looking for a toehold on the mainland of Europe.  If we did not set up a similar facility our competitiveness in relation to Britain would be seriously diminished. We had no choice but to set up a free port area.  It was up to the Government to decide on the best place to set it up. Legislation in this area will only be successful if the appropriate location is selected. The choice of Ringaskiddy is correct because it has the appropriate infrastructue and the necessary financial back-up. There is a lot of goodwill towards the setting up of this duty free port in the Cork region.</P>
      <P>I will not repeat what was said in other contributions in relation to the the infrastructure there.  The cases put by previous speakers support the statement that Ringaskiddy is the correct location.  Ringaskiddy is almost the first landfall of Europe, coming from the west.  In relation to Deputy Collins's suggestion in relation to the Shannon estuary, the fact that it is on the west coast and far away from mainland Europe is a major consideration against that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 400 free ports throughout the world and in most cases they have increased jobs but the experience in Britain, as previous speakers outlined, has been quite different.  Deputy Collins mentioned the thousands of jobs created in Taiwan, in Miami and in other areas while Britain has failed, probably because of the numbers set up at the one <Col N="376" /> time and because of other restrictions which I hope will not exist in Ringaskiddy. The advantage of using the free port in Ringaskiddy will include deferred liability for customs duty and VAT.  The VAT regulations will have to be dealt with by a separate regulation to be introduced by the Minister for Finance.  The other advantages will be a simplification of customs procedures and documentation. These factors will be very attractive to industrialists.  I hope the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners use the EC legislation in the best possible way so that the Ringaskiddy area will benefit to its maximum potential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle in her contribution said that a free port has never successfully revitalised a depressed area when that area was chosen strictly on a political basis.  Ringaskiddy was selected partly on a political basis but mainly in a strict commercial sense.  It is the most suitable area for the setting up of a free port, since we have a deep water berth and a car ferry terminal there as well as the other services mentioned by speakers.  Ringaskiddy also has the advantage of having over 1,000 acres under IDA ownership which should attract industries to the region.  About £47 million has already been spent in the area in providing services. Unfortunately, the amounts of investment to date in Ringaskiddy has not brought the anticipated returns.  The response by foreign industrialists and the lack of success so far by the IDA are disappointing.  I know that we are going through bad times and cannot attract industries like those we attracted in the sixties and seventies but still the response to date has been disappointing.  I do not criticise the IDA, as I know they are working in difficult conditions and against increased competition from bodies like the Scottish Development Board and the Welsh Development Board.  We have not seen the rush of industries which we were led to believe would come years ago.</P>
    <P>I reject Deputy Lyons's point that Ringaskiddy was selected for purely political reasons.  Ringaskiddy was chosen for its location and infrastructure.  The recent Government decision to go ahead with <Col N="377" /> the deep water berth is only the latest of a series of decisions which have brought about enormous investments since the commencement of the Cork harbour development plan under a previous Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives the Minister power to establish limits for the free port. I hope that the 30 acres mentioned in the Bill will prove to be totally inadequate and will have to be increased several times in the years to come.  Section 3 gives the Minister power to designate individuals to control the free port area and grant licences for the carrying out of businesses there.  The Minister for Finance will have to draft separate regulations in relation to the financial implications of the free port.  The free port will not be the answer to all the economic ills of the region but it will definitely result in the encouragement of further growth and it will be another step in the industrial revolution that has taken place in Cork, after the closure of many of our traditional industries in recent times.  These industries have not closed through the fault of any Government, as suggested by Deputy Lyons in a previous contribution, but simply because they suffered from the opening up of trade through the Anglo-Irish free trade area agreement and the reduction of trading barriers brought about by our membership of the EC.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote a passage from Professor Leonard Wrigley's article in the <i>Allied Irish Bank Review</i> for November 1985 under the heading &ldquo;Cork: Lessons From a Long History&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From Cork's long history, the most striking fact is that the city, when part of a world market, has never been world class at everything; has never competed in every market segment; but has specialised on its comparative advantage &mdash; a magnificent deepwater harbour and an abundant hinterland &mdash; and this specialisation brought prosperity. This is no small thing, for it involves skills and institutions and equipment, as well as the harbour and <Col N="378" /> hinterland, all in detailed and harmonious relationship with the imperatives of the competitive marketplace.  From another view, Cork's economic thrust down the centuries has been largely determined by the size of the market open to it.  As the market expanded, and competition for the market share intensified, Cork responded by greater specialisation on those segments for which it had a comparative advantage in relation to cities in other nations. Correspondingly, when the market shortly contracted &mdash; because of tariff walls being built &mdash; Cork gave up its specialist thrust to become a jack-of-all-trades, an industrial handyman, for the Irish market.  In that light, Cork's present troubles spring immediately from the hundred-fold increase in market size almost, though not quite, from the moment of Ireland's EEC entry in 1973.  Against world-class standards, the decimation of Cork's old tariff-protected industrial framework was inevitable; the idea that a city of just 140,00 population could contain a whole mass of internationally competitive industries was unrealistic. </P>
    <P>I would not agree with every part of that passage, but it bears out some of the problems of Cork.  As I said, the mainstay of the economy in Cork at one stage was a small number of very big, traditional, labour-intensive plants, and the collapse of these older industries dealt the city a very bad blow.  Cork and its region have suffered because of our entry into the EC, but our entry into the EC is a factor that we can now take advantage of to the full if we set about it in the correct way, in other words through correct industrial policy and planning.  I see the opening of the free port in the Cork region as one of the first steps in our fight back in the industrial revitalisation that is now taking place.</P>
    <P>I would like to set out the background to the introduction of this Free Ports Bill. Over the past six years an average of 1,000 first time jobs have been created yearly in the technology industry in the Cork region.  Just ten years ago seven <Col N="379" /> firms accounted for 34 per cent of the manufacturing employment in the city, and no less than 60 per cent of manufacturing employment was accounted for by 25 firms.  These were in the traditional areas of car assembly, tyre manufacture, shipbuilding, and footwear and clothing manufacture.  Most of these firms are now closed for the reasons I outlined just a few moments ago: our advent into the EC and before that the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>Up to the early sixties a high level of protection was afforded to goods of Irish manufacture with approximately 50 per cent of all imports being subjected to customs duties.  These rates of duty began to decrease and, with the implementation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement in July 1966, tariff barriers between Ireland and the UK were removed.  At the same time rates of duty on imports from outside this country decreased still further.  On our entry into the EC in 1973 customs duties on imports from the EC countries were removed gradually during the accession period. Because Cork had so many labour intensive industries it failed to get into the new industrial sector and fell behind in its efforts to win new technology in the face of advances made by other areas such as Shannon where we were setting up numerous new technology industries in the electronics area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Cork's new industries are not as mature as those in Shannon and Dublin, and this applies especially to the electronics sector.  However, it is encouraging in recent times that a good cross-section of multinational electronic companies have been established in Cork and that indigenous industries are surviving. These new growth areas are in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, advanced engineering, electronics, health care and natural resource processing which I dealt with in my speech on the NDC.  The processing of our natural resources needs to be expanded dramatically.</P>
    <P>In 1979 we had only three electronic companies in operation in Cork and now <Col N="380" /> we have 42 in the greater Cork area. Therefore, Cork is well equipped.  Infrastructurally, we have also good back-up services and an established university. UCC has the micro-electroncis research centre which is a very good back-up to any of the electronic industries that have come and will come in the years ahead. That centre has published recently a five-year development plan that envisages tripling its size in the next five years.  I believe that will result in a greater enhancement of the scope and quality of the services offered and will make the Cork region very attractive for foreign electronic companies.  Also in Cork we have the dairy science department in the university and the bio-technology unit which has massive potential if we apply the research in that unit to the processing of our foodstuffs and food products.  We have a technical college and the AnCO training centre.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the Free Ports Bill is being introduced and the free port in Ringaskiddy is being set up.  Therefore, Cork is entering its second industrial revolution and the seaport at Ringaskiddy and the duty free port will be important factors in this second industrial revolution.  With the introduction of the legislation all the international economic signs are very encouraging for an economic upswing in the country generally, and I hope that the enactment of this legislation and the introduction of a duty free port will enable us to take advantage of the upswing in the international economy.</P>
    <P>The fall in interest rates, the continued growth in world trade and the stability in exchange rates are encouraging factors and a very encouraging backdrop to the setting up of the free port.  The indicators for the first six months of this year suggest that the modest recovery that commenced in mid 1983 will continue and that there will be a continued increase in manufacturing output.  However &mdash; I am disappointed in this &mdash; the increase in manufacturing output has not resulted in a dramatic improvement in the number of people working in the manufacturing sector.  It is a major problem because <Col N="381" /> the electronics industries coming in are capital intensive but, unfortunately, not labour intensive.  I hope we will see the advent of the labour intensive petrochemical plants we have been awaiting in the area.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the criticisms made in the debate in regard to the Government's performance in the Cork region.  Those criticisms need to be answered.  To attempt to suggest that Cork has been ignored or abandoned by the Government is inaccurate and untrue.  It is an attempt to try to gain political advantage from the misfortunes of the unemployed in the Cork region.  It is worth recording that in recent times a small industries division of the IDA was established in Cork and that an enterprise centre will open early in 1986 in the North Mall in my corporation ward.  That centre is directly across the river from the national micro-electronic centre.</P>

The roads and bridges constructed in the Cork area in the last two years have ensured that the area has the infrastructure to take any major industry.  The Government have also designated areas for special grants such as the 1,000 acre IDA site at Ringaskiddy and the areas at Knocknaheeney, Churchfield and Togher which have been designated for special grants.  We must also remember the massive commitment of £89 million last year to Irish Steel.  We do not know the final figure for this year yet.  Surely that is an indication of a commitment by the Government to the Cork region.  The Cork main drainage scheme is going ahead.</P>

I should like to refer to the fact that the IDA provisionally sanctioned grant aid to 21 industrial projects in the greater Cork area during the second quarter of 1985.  Those projects will create a total of 307 new jobs.  There have been allegations that the construction industry in Cork has foundered.  That industry foundered because of the recession but the Government have invested in road infrastructure, housing and so on.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to criticisms in regard to the introduction of this legislation by Mr. Dermot O'Mahony, Chairman of the Cork Harbour Board, in the course of an article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> recently.  He said that the delay in the introduction of the legislation had prevented the full development of the Cork harbour area.

      <P>I am not in the habit of interrupting Deputies but Deputy Allen must admit that he invited interruptions from this side.  Deputy Lyons painted a true picture of the position in Cork.  I was surprised to hear Members opposite say this morning that employment in the Cork area had improved.  We must admit that unemployment has increased and that the forecasts are not good.  The Bill is an enabling measure to permit the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy and I welcome that.  However, this is but a first step.  I hope there will not be any delay in the formulation of the necessary regulations by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister, and the Government, have spent long enough talking about establishing a free port at Ringaskiddy and I must assume that the Minister is aware of the exact format of the regulations.  The Government should use the free port at Ringaskiddy as a pilot scheme requiring long term commitments. I do not wish to replay a Munster Final with my colleague, Deputy Collins from Limerick, and I will confine my contribution to the need for a free port at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agreed with the Minister when he stated that he did not expect the free port to be an overnight success.  It is important that this free port should be given sufficient time to establish successfully, without having to compete with other Irish free ports.  I am not being parochial in saying this.  A practical approach to any new concept is trial and error.  We know that many adjustments and changes will be made in the course of this development. I mention long term commitment, because I understand that some free ports in Britain are experiencing difficulties. The consensus there is that the concept is being held up by inflexible attitudes and regulations.  Our regulations must be flexible enough to accommodate new and existing businesses.  Cork being such a depressed area, it should be kept in mind that this free port must be used as a <Col N="385" /> nucleus to attract business, especially with a labour content, to ease the appealling unemployment in the whole Cork area.  We do not know at this stage how successful this free port will be.  That is why I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the regulations are flexible in order to bring about its success.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of the free port will depend largely on the provisions and interpretations of section 10, 12 and 13 of the Bill, those sections dealing with duties, regulations and control.  It is vital therefore that the future operators of the free port are afforded adequate time to brief the Minister fully on his perceived requirements regarding these matters and particularly regarding VAT and other duties.  It will be necessary to discuss the present arrangement under which finished consumer goods would not qualify for relief from VAT on importation into a free port, nor in general any other goods imported for resale.  This provision seriously inhibits the attractiveness of Ringaskiddy as a free port and, in my view, should be removed.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a free port operator is critical at this stage as a delay in time before physical work on the free port commences may be considerable. Furthermore, consultations are at present under way on an EC common regulation governing free zones.  It is intended that this forthcoming regulation will replace the 1969 directive and thus become immediately applicable Community law.  The free port operator, and indeed the Government, will need to make their views known before the changes regarding existing regulations governing free ports are made.  Our guiding principle in this matter is that the regulations be maintained.</P>
    <P>Ringaskiddy has much to offer, such as deep water berth, serviced land for industrial development, an airport.  We have all the necessary infrastructure for efficiency and the smooth running of industry.  I do not wish to go into the mishandling by the Government in delaying the development of Ringaskiddy.  I would hope now that they will see this free port as an asset of great benefit to the <Col N="386" /> Cork area, carefully monitor its progress and provide all the necessary incentives to create a determination by all involved to ensure its success.  Determination must be seen from our own Government rather than accepting certain directives or dictates from the EC, where member countries at the drop of a hat break rules in the interest and welfare of their own economy.</P>
    <P>Another very important aspect of the free port will be effective marketing at home and abroad.  I suggest that no effort should be spared in appointing the best public relations personnel to sell the free port concept.  With regard to management and control of the free port, I understand that an application has been made to the Minister for Communications to permit the Cork Harbour Commissioners to advertise for prospective partners to form the free port company.  I shall not comment further on this as I may have something to say on Committee Stage regarding management.  I do not think a State-sponsored body should be a partner of the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  I believe that it should be a group of business people.  I am saying this because I understand there may be some talk about including the IDA in partnership with the commissioners.  State-sponsored bodies have a sufficient workload already.  I would be looking for progressive businessmen to form this consortium.</P>
    <P>I refer to the recent visit to Cork by the Mayor of San Francisco and hope that the promise given of so much money for any business that may be viable in the city of Cork would be part of the venture money in supporting business group to manage the free port in the Cork area. Incentives will be the most important aspect where success is concerned.  I do not think we will have an opportunity to question the regulations that will be implemented by the Minister for Finance.  I believe there will be a ministerial order, which will not come before the House.  I am availing therefore of the opportunity to put some suggestions on record as to what I think the Minister for Finance should confine himself to.</P>
    <P>Trading within the free port should be <Col N="387" /> exempt from payment of customs duties, including VAT, on goods entering the free port, and goods consumed within. Permission should be given to bring goods into the free port for duty-free retail sales, either for shipment as ship or aircraft stores, or to persons leaving or outside the State.  Where it applies, duty should be assessed at the rate applicable here to the raw materials as they enter the free port, or to the finished product at the time of leaving, whichever is the lower.  The purchase of plant materials &mdash; which could be very important for the Ringaskiddy area, initially especially, for use in connection with the free port &mdash; should be exempt from all duties and taxes.  It should be possible to create sub-zones within the harbour area to the free port, if required &mdash; that is a very important aspect &mdash; similar to other designated areas.  At the discretion of the local authtority rates should be reduced by two-thirds during the first ten years after the construction of the free port.</P>
    <P>I make a very special appeal to the two local authorities in the Cork area to give this matter very serious consideration because every possible incentive will be needed to ensure that this concept will be a viable one for the Cork area.  As I said at the outset, I have no guarantee &mdash; nobody has &mdash; as to how successful the free port will be.  Looking across the water we have seen difficulties experienced within other free ports.  I have no doubt that the Minister and the Minister for Finance will learn a lot from these, by reason of the fact that the six free ports now in Britain are not considered viable at present.  I also suggest that other statutory authorities providing services to the free port be permitted, at their discretion, to provide similar reductions in the cost of their services.  Regulations should specify how goods which are within the free port are to be treated for the purposes of the Act.  They should also specify the circumstances in which goods which are not within the free port are to be treated for those purposes as being within the free port.</P>
    <P>I am putting those suggestions on <Col N="388" /> record in the hope that the Minister for Finance, who will be mainly responsible for the formulation of the regulations, will bear them in mind.  From my experience and research into the operation of free ports it would be difficult to lay sufficient emphasis on the regulations because the whole structure and success of this free port will be dependent on them. There is no point in anybody coming into this House, saying, &ldquo;We are giving you a free port in Cork&rdquo;, while, in the next breath, killing it by regulations.  We have been talking about this free port for at least 18 months and the hopes of people in the Cork area have been built up, that this might prove to do something to alleviate the appalling unemployment in Cork.  Especially bearing in mind the presence of oil off the Cork coast there should be co-ordinated effort to bring about the employment so necessary to that area.</P>
    <P>I make this special plea because I know we shall have no say whatsoever once the Minister for Finance formulates the regulations on which will depend the success of this venture.  It is the first free port in the country and every effort should be taken to ensure its success.  We can learn a lot from the free ports in Great Britain which are no longer considered viable for one reason only, because the regulations are not flexible.  Let us learn from their experience.  The Government must be committed to ensuring that everything possible is done to bring about the success of this free port.  I would appeal to other Deputies from other parts of the country &mdash; Rosslare, Limerick and other places &mdash; before making their claim, that they have something to work on.  They will have seen the operation of the Cork one and they can question how successful it has been.  I do not want to be parochial. But it is of vital importance to the country and everybody concerned that this free port be considered on a trial and error basis because there will be many difficulties experienced in the course of its development. Let us give it time, let it be used as an example to everybody as to how successful and viable it can be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> We Cork Deputies, irrespective of whichever side of the House we sit on, may be accused of being parochial and selfish in this matter.  We are not.  We are talking about a concept.  Certainly I would hope that we would not see a second free port in this country for at least ten years because that is about the necessary time limit for the development of a free port at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an enabling one to facilitate the establishment of a free port in the Ringaskiddy area of Cork. It is significant that, with one exception, all of the contributions made so far have been by Deputies from maritime counties or constituencies.  For that reason I welcome Deputy Wilson's contribution.  He could afford to be somewhat objective and he was.  He voiced certain reservations and highlighted points that were quite legitimate whereas all other Deputies, it could be said, had a vested interest. While Deputies did discuss the Bill, deep down I think each and everyone hoped that the free port would be sited in his constituency.  Therefore, there was a slight advantage in the case of a Deputy from an inland county who could be more objective in his approach.  The representation we have from the west and east coasts is very significant indeed.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on some remarks made by some Deputies.  Deputy Wilson welcomed the Bill and expressed concern for the Cork area.  There is no need for me to dwell further on that because other Members from the Cork area have spelled out the problems being experienced in our area and with which everybody in the House and the country is familiar.  The time for crying is over. It is now time for action.  I hope the provisions of this Bill will allow action to begin so that we can tackle our problems. Deputy Wilson also recognised the fact that there would not be any immediate substantial improvement.  Experience in Britain has proved that fact beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wyse, expressing concern about the Cork area, hoped ten years would elapse before another free port <Col N="390" /> was established in the country.  I would prefer to adopt a wait and see approach. If the Cork port proves successful then the overall picture can be examined in order to ascertain whether it would be a viable proposition to set up a second or third free port.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of a free port has been carefully examined and is one we cannot afford to ignore.  I am sorry that my colleague, Deputy Lyons, from the Cork North-Central constituency has left.  I hope he will not think I am taking advantage of his absence.  I was disappointed by his contribution.  His attitude to the introduction of the Bill was that it constituted too little, too late.  I hoped he would have something more positive to say.  I was surprised by his contention that the demand was occasioned by the report of the task force.  It was generally accepted that the introduction of this Bill was occasioned by that report but nobody can contend that with any degree of certainty. I am glad to see that Deputy Lyons has returned to the House.  I did not have access to the report of the task force so I cannot say with certainty what was included or recommended.  I regret I did not see the details.</P>
    <P>Many aspects must be examined, one being the likely benefits that will accrue to the free port from off-shore exploration. That is an area in which many jobs could be created.  Much to our shame much of the activity now going on off our coasts is being serviced from Aberdeen because VAT at point of entry acts as a disincentive to people importing the necessary equipment.  It should be remembered that there is very valuable equipment associated with this industry &mdash; the drill, the drill stems, the casings, the heavy anchors, the drill bits, the cable buoys which must be imported&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The dockyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the dockyard. The maintenance of this equipment involves many painters and oilers in order to keep it in tip-top condition, rendering it ready for use in what is a very difficult area of exploration off our coasts.  Up to <Col N="391" /> now a lot of this equipment has been stored in Aberdeen.  This is deplorable.  I hope that with the introduction of the free port at Ringaskiddy all our off-shore fields will be serviced by Cork Harbour. The fact that much of the equipment originates in the United States, Canada and Japan will be of tremendous advantage to the free port.</P>
      <P>Several speakers have said that the free port should be established on sound commercial criteria.  Deputy Doyle particularly made this point.  This has been the major yardstick for free port success in other countries.  I make no apologies for the fact that politics are involved in the setting up of the free port at Ringaskiddy, but there are also sound commercial reasons for locating the free port in Cork Harbour.  Deputy Collins made a rather scathing comment on the scale of the investment to date, whereas Deputy Wilson said that he had an active part to play in the development.  This is a small country and I fail to see why we should indulge in this type of tribal friction.  It is in the interest of everybody that Ringaskiddy works.  We should go forward without reservation rather than with tongue in cheek.</P>
      <P>Regarding commercial criteria and the suitability of Cork Harbour as a location, 4.5 million tonnes of general cargo passed through the harbour last year.  By any standard that is quite a large amount of traffic.  If we were to centre it in the main area of commercial activity it would have to be in Dublin.  Deputy Collins said that the volume of cargo in the Shannon Estuary had gone up to 3 million tonnes but we must bear in mind that this is largely made up of coal imported to Aughinish and other firms in the Shannon Estuary. Were they to switch from the use of coal to natural gas the tonnage in Shannon Harbour would drop dramatically.  The Shannon obviously has a lot to offer and I am not criticising any Deputy for making a case for his own area.  However, it should not be used as a weapon to put down this development at Ringaskiddy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about European markets in relation to Ringaskiddy.  Deputy <Col N="392" /> Doyle referred to the fact that trade to Britain has decreased.  She gave statistics concerning Rosslare Harbour, which one million passengers passed through up to last year.  There was also a huge increase in the amount of roll-on roll-off traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of that was ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it was diverted from Cork.  Before criticising the location at Ringaskiddy as not being attractive or commercially viable, it should be pointed out that one can get to Roscoff in Brittany in 14 hours or to Le Havre in 17 hours, whereas it takes 24 hours to get from Rosslare to Le Havre.  That is a very important factor.  Ringaskiddy can stand up against these figures.  I imagine there will be many activities in the offshore area resulting from the setting up of the free port.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the area of job potential and job creation at Ringaskiddy.  Several speakers have referred to enticing high technology to the area.  We have been hearing about the educational facilities in the area such as the university, the regional colleges and the NIHE.  We have people with the ability to do this type of high technology work, but we must not forget about creating low technology jobs for people who have little technical ability.  The manual worker has been forgotten.  The great emphasis is being placed on the high technology area but we need labour-intensive low technology enterprises as well.  I do not see anything wrong with manual labour.  I was a labourer myself, I was not a skilled person, although I was a State employee.  General operatives and people with no technical qualifications but with a desire to work must be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that this is very important legislation but it must be seen in association with the regulations which have yet to be presented to this House.  Deputy Wyse spelled out some of the regulations which people in Cork feel should be included.  Without these regulations and without taking away the obstacles, I do not think it will be a very successful venture. It is also extremely important that <Col N="393" /> these regulations allow for a successful free port.  Goods coming into Ringaskiddy from outside the EC must be VAT free.  Trade within the free port area must be free of VAT.  Goods traded within the free port must not become liable for VAT until such time as they are picked up on the open market or outside the free port area.</P>
    <P>The point has consistently been made during this debate that the regulations must not be interpreted too harshly or they will hamper the successful operation of the free port area.  In other places the harsh implementation of regulations and an over-rigid approach by customs people have proved a disincentive and have not been conductive to the success of these ports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins mentioned Miami as one of the most successful free ports but because most of the goods originate within the United States the free port consists of nothing more than bonded warehouses.  They depend far less on imported goods than we do.  There is a slightly different approach in Europe in places like Rotterdam and parts of West Germany where they are experiencing steady success.  This is because they are located in areas of large population.  The United Kingdom has not been so successful. Reference has been made to Liverpool and the other five locations.  The British have not been as successful in this area as the Dutch or the Americans or countries in the Far East.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the location of the free ports on the south coast.  We have a deep water berth at last.  A great deal of money has been invested in it and I hope it will now show a return. However, I would not like to see it developed along the same lines as in the Far East.  Reference was made to the fact that there is a successful free port in Hong Kong but this is because there is a cheap labour market there.  For instance, in Korea there was a guarantee that the workforce would not be unionised and they did not have to cope with planning permission.  I hope that anybody setting up here would be prepared to accept standard practices in regard to industrial <Col N="394" /> relations and planning applications.  They should also be answerble to local authorities in regard to planning permission.</P>
    <P>It is a great pleasure to welcome the introduction of the Bill and I hope it will have universal support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to direct our attention to the need to develop our huge marine potential. Perhaps this debate should have been held in Thurles because it seems to be the mid-west against Cork.  We do not want to interfere with anything taking place in Ringaskiddy and we are aware that the huge investment there is necessary. Various Deputies have criticised Government delays and inaction in developing the Ringaskiddy deep water facility which is a very worthwhile investment and a useful infrastructure for Cork.  We wish to see that potential developed and the Bill gives us a further opportunity to look at other ports because there has been a lack of policy directed towards the development of marine resources.  There is fragmentation of Government agencies and this is why we suggest the establishment of a Roinn na Mara which would be a new marine Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have taken this opportunity to designate major harbours where free port facilities would be provided. It is essential that we know, with reasonable accuracy, where these developments will take place.  While we have designated Ringaskiddy now, the Minister should have designated at least one or two other harbours where necessary research would be undertaken to establish and to benefit the areas in which free ports are established.  A huge amount of research needs to be carried out to establish the need for investment and sophisticated communications are necessary to make an operation like this successful.  The determination of the capital investment would also be needed to have these harbours adequately developed in order to utilise them to their maximum potential with regard to any business which might accrue from the free port concept.  That concept has been <Col N="395" /> overtaken by events in recent times since we joined the EC and all that that means for opening up trade between ourselves and our partners.  This has minimised the importance of the whole concept of the old idea of the free zone which I have seen in operation for 20 years in the Shannon Industrial Estate.  It has successfully operated there and has been of major benefit to the area.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Community in the operation of our economy has minimised the effectiveness of the free port concept and I should like to question the Minister very closely in this regard.  I do not wish to hear the usual propaganda in regard to this issue but what it will mean to Ringaskiddy.  Can the Minister identify where the job potential is and where jobs will be created?  Can he give any indication of the type of activity which will be generated in Ringaskiddy free port and how it can be utilised to increase further industrial activity in that area? The advantage of the duty free zone in Shannon is that we do not have to pay VAT on imported goods at the point of entry, which means that there is customs simplification and fewer formalities than usual.  Would it not be in the best interests of the economy generally for the Government to adopt a simplified customs facility which would enable business to thrive nationally?  Are the jobs in Ringaskiddy to be expanded by providing additional customs personnel?  Is this how jobs will be provided?  We have seen the Government embargo in operation and it has hampered development in many areas.  I hope that we will not see more bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I should like the experiment, if one could call it that, in Ringaskiddy to get under way as soon as possible but I do not believe the Minister has put forward a reasonable case in that regard.  I am prepared to listen to the Minister's reply and I hope he will spell out where the jobs will be created.  They are making a big thing out of this as they did in regard to the National Development Corporation and the Youth Employment Agency.  The YEA were supposed to <Col N="396" /> solve all our youth unemployment problems and the National Development Corporation is merely another example of propaganda and bluff.  Perhaps more could be done if the Government changed their disastrous policies which have hampered development not only in Ringaskiddy but in the Shannon Estuary, the Shannon industrial zone and every port in the country.  They have put a damper on industry which has hampered development.  Establishing free port facilities in Ringaskiddy or anywhere else will be just a minor effort towards solving some of our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>For more than two and a half years now the Minister for Communications has, on successive occasions, promised a review of a ports' policy to be undertaken by his Department but there is no sign of any action in relation to such a policy. This Government have not shown any initiative in regard to the establishment of a joint estuarial authority for the development of the Shannon Estuary.  The Minister has received many deputations. He has visited Foynes, the Shannon Estuary and Cappagh harbour and he has met public representatives and the interests involved, but we have yet to see any Bill to establish a joint estuarial authority for the Shannon.  I know there are problems regarding Foynes but they can be met. People in Foynes have carried out their own development work and they are willing to be involved in any development of the Shannon, either in partnership or in association with any joint estuarial authority.</P>
    <P>Shannon is expanding at a rapid pace and this afternoon Deputy Collins gave figures to the House in respect of tonnage going through Shannon port.  May I say in reply to the Deputy from Cork that these figures do not include any of the tonnage coming through Moneypoint. Deputy Collins told us that goods traffic through Shannon port in 1985 will exceed 3,500,000 tonnes and is forecast to reach 5,000,000 tonnes in the next three years. These are the projections of the Limerick Harbour Commissioners and they do not include statistics in respect of coal to <Col N="397" /> Moneypoint because that trade commenced just recently.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed to exploit the opportunities available with regard to coal being brought to Moneypoint.  That station has been under construction since 1979.  It was known from the time of the first planning application that coal would arrive at that port in huge amounts from areas throughout the world under contract with the ESB.  There were opportunities there to be exploited, but what happened?  We had the first consignment of coal in April in a Japanese-British-Norwegian operated boat and they had to hire tugs from Glasgow to tow the boat into position.  The Government should have been aware of the enormous possibilities in this area but instead we lost out again and the Norwegians, the Japanese and the British are benefiting.  This is happening at a time when we are putting Irish Shipping into liquidation, when Irish boats are up for sale in foreign boatyards and when our whole shipping policy is in disarray and collapse.</P>
    <P>The Government may claim credit for this legislation but they cannot get away from the criticism I shall level at them and the criticism that is being levelled at them by people outside this House.  It was obvious from the beginning that a huge tonnage of coal will be used in Moneypoint station each year for the next 20 years and it was surely sensible and reasonable that the Government and their agencies should have availed of any business opportunities there.  Instead of that, other countries are doing that work while we are putting our ships up for sale in foreign dockyards.  Anyone outside this House could quite legitimately ask us if we are serious about protecting our economy.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the Moneypoint project which has been operating successfully in the past few weeks.  They have there a unique facility.  Earlier I welcomed the development of infrastructure in Cork and the provision of finances to develop the deep sea berth at Ringaskiddy.  In the Shannon Estuary we are capable of handling the biggest super tankers.  In Moneypoint coal distribution for western <Col N="398" /> Europe could be organised and run efficiently if the Government had the necessary policy and had the political will and the determination to carry it out.  For a very small expenditure we could have a coal handling facility in Moneypoint for the whole of Europe.  There is a tremendous potential for jobs and revenue. There is no need to worry too much about free port facilities because the place could stand on its own.  All that is needed is the will and the determination to exploit such natural facilities to the full before the Japanese, Belgians, Portuguese or other people come in here and do it for us.  It is about time we did these things ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Shannon port is an ideal location for the kind of free port facility spoken about here.  With a small adjustment in existing legislation the duty free facility operating in the Shannon area could be extended to cover the harbour.  Deputy Allen tried to confuse the issue by saying that already we had a free port facility in Shannon.  We have a free customs facility in the Shannon Industrial Estate and we should examine this to see if it is possible to extend it to the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>A development that would include both a port and an airport facility would probably be supported by the European Community.  This is the kind of regional project the Regional Fund was designed to meet.  If we are serious about regional development we should look at the potential in the regions and we should utilise all the facilities that exist there. The Shannon area which has an airport and a deep sea harbour is an ideal location for such development.  I am not detracting in any way from the need to develop Ringaskiddy.  Good luck to Ringaskiddy and good luck to Cork.  We support anything that will create industrial stability and jobs in the Cork area which has suffered so much in the past three years.  Because of our deepwater facilities in the Shannon Estuary we have many important projects like Moneypoint, and have planning permission for the establishment of other major undertakings, but we have a Government without a policy for building up our natural <Col N="399" /> resources and utilising our deep sea facilities.</P>
    <P>The free zone at Shannon should be extended to the entire area of the estuary with consequent employment of many more people.  We should have major success there in industrial development, but the policies being put forward by the Government discourage existing industries in the Shannon free zone.  Those industries, many of them very important and successful, have no expansion ambitions and are very cautious about expanding because of lack of encouragement from the Government.  Some industries closed down and pulled out of the area and many of their highly skilled staff are not prepared to continue to work under the present regime.  Though we are giving grants, many industrialists will say they are finding it very difficult to hold on to their skilled personnel.  This is a great loss and it must be tackled by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for a national marine policy.  We have seen the failures of Verolme, Irish Shipping and other key enterprises and it highlights the need to bring together the various agencies and Departments to formulate a cohesive plan.  I suggest a marine Department which would have a great future, particularly in the Shannon estuary where marine resources are relatively unexploited. The number of job creations would be great.  We need industrial structures, and in that region we have the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Foynes Trustees and the Cappagh Harbour Authority as well as other smaller organisations, but they lack finances to do what needs to be done jointly.</P>
    <P>I submit that we will see a rejuvination of industrial life throughout the country only when we see the end of this Government who have damaged industry to an enormous degree.  There needs to be a change and the only way to bring it about is to get this Government out in a general election and get in a Fianna Fáil Government who would recognise the importance of our marine resources.  All this Government do is to legislate for the <Col N="400" /> creation of a free port in Cork under the pretence that something is being done. We have now nearly a quarter of a million unemployed but this Government are doing nothing to create new jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal mainly with section 2 which provides:</P>
      <P>the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, may by order declare that, on and after a specified date, the land enclosed within the limits defined by that order shall be a free port for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the section is that if the Minister decides to extend free port facilities beyond Ringaskiddy he could do it by ministerial order without coming to the House.  Therefore, Deputies from other areas would wish to be concerned in any extensions of free port facilities and my concern is that Rosslare port would be considered.  I do not make my contribution in any spirit of grudging, but there has been a suggestion since 1982 for the expansion of Rosslare.  In 1982 and 1984 the present Minister for Communications announced that he was considering the production of a port policy, and in that connection the Rosslare Harbour Development Board, our of their own funds and from contributions of about £5,500, commissioned a report from Stokes, Kennedy Crowley on Rosslare harbour.  We made that our submission in relation to a ports policy but what we get here is <i>ad hoc</i> legislation before any general legislation on ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A ports policy was heralded before the Cork Special Task Force was put together.  When we take similar decisions to those contained in this Bill we have debates on geographical preferences, what goes where, and we have predetermination by the IDA on criteria laid down by the old Congested Districts Board.  What we need is a modern updated study to see which counties <Col N="401" /> should get the highest grant aid.  Roscommon has the lowest rate of unemployment in the country but it is a designated area, whereas the highest rate of unemployment outside Donegal is in County Wexford, which is not designated.  In regard to decentralisation, Waterford and Carlow have benefited to the detriment of countries bordering on the sea. Geographic relocation has to be thought out independently rather than by political patronage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the legislation generally, the experience of the six UK free ports has not been inspiring in that the benefits have not been seen readily to be accruing to the British economy.  Therefore, in considering this Bill in a general way, one must have two primary considerations: first, that the purpose of the Bill is to generate new business that would not be created otherwise &mdash; it is not for the purpose of shifting business from one port to another &mdash; and, secondly, the consideration must be that within the EC where there is a movement of goods and cargo from an Irish port to a non-EC country, Ireland should be the port of location instead of some other EC country such as the UK.  In that way the full benefits of the Bill can be realised and we can generate new output and revenue.</P>
    <P>The failure to include Rosslare in this Bill can be laid clearly at the doorstep of CIE who are the port authority there. We have seen many examples of Rosslare being slow to develop because of having CIE as the port authority.  It is not until the Minister for Communications announced a new port authority for Rosslare, an authority that would be made up of local representative groups, that there was any action at the port.  If we analyse the prospects for Rosslare, we find that it is an extremely profitable port.  I have yet to see any figures of profitability for Ringaskiddy.  In 1981, Rosslare port made a profit of £339,000; in 1982 the figure was £85,000; while in 1983 it was £195,000; and I understand that in 1984 the port made a very substantial gross profit of £1,250,000.  Between 1981 and 1982 there was an increase of 52,000 or 6.8 per cent in the number <Col N="402" /> of passengers who used the port.  The sailings from Rosslare which are very significant when compared with Ringaskiddy totalled 1,453 in 1981 while in 1982, when there was a slight slump due to the change in sailing arrangements, the figure was 1,292.</P>
    <P>Rosslare is the third largest and the fastest growing port in the country.  It is the primary natural asset of County Wexford.  The basis for putting forward Rosslare for inclusion in section 2 of the Bill is not only because of economics but because of its being the gateway to Europe.  It is the ideal location for ro-ro and passenger traffic.  While I welcome the Government's commitment to Rosslare in terms of the allocation of £800,000 in the past two years, the inclusion of the port within the terms of this Bill would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a group from Rosslare visited Ringaskiddy in October 1983 and saw there some 130 acres of land that had been reclaimed in the previous four years from the harbour area.  That is the location of the port.  The terminal was opened officially in May 1983.  It has all the modern facilities including covered gangways, hydraulic ramp facilities for ro-ro and passenger traffic, all the up-to-date reservation and booking offices and emigration clearance facilities.  All that development cost £17 million.  By comparison Rosslare was allocated only a 16 per cent grant aid in the form of £1.125 million for its phased development.  In addition to the £17 million by way of aid to Ringaskiddy, Cork got 1,000 acres of an industrial estate for the IDA.  I expect that they are so far committed in that respect that there is no turning back.  In addition there was the incredible situation whereby, the Government not satisfied with all that development, sank a further £10 million into a deep berth port facility.</P>

      <P>The point is that there seems to be no limit to the amount of <Col N="403" /> money that may to devoted to this project. Regarding sailings from Ringaskiddy, on the basis of the traffic to Swansea, for instance, a boat has not been justified.  Unfortunately, the type of investment there is not showing the kind of return that Wexford is showing without any of that type of investment.  Therefore, one must ask what the potential of Rosslare would be if given a chance of the same order.</P>
      <P>When we consider that while Ringaskiddy got a grant aid of 88 per cent while Rosslare benefited only to the extent of 16 per cent, we realise the discrepancies that arise.  CIE are being pressed to put further moneys into Rosslare.  All of this is making our position as public representatives very difficult.  The people there are anxious to know why such a level of discrimination should be sustained against them in face of the massive resources being poured into Cork.  I am not saying that this Bill is the last straw so far as Rosslare and the people of Wexford are concerned.  Instead, the Bill is an opportunity to rectify matters.  When it was announced that a free port would be established at Ringaskiddy, the Rosslare Harbour development committee considered that matter to be so grave as to warrant their writing to the Taoiseach expressing their deep concern but our case seems to have been neglected.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister of State to outline when replying whether it was on political grounds, on economic grounds, on grounds of unemployment or whatever that Cork attracted this help.  If the money has been poured in there on grounds of unemployment I should like to remind the Department of Communications that Cork has an unemployment rate today of 22 per cent of the workforce whereas the comparative rate in Wexford is 24½ per cent.  In that respect we are second only to Donegal which is full of farmers who are in receipt of the small farmers' dole and which therefore cannot be compared with Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of the problem is that areas which had industrial development in the sixties and seventies, which established <Col N="404" /> their industrial base, lost a good deal of that employment by reason of factory closures.  I have great sympathy for the people of Cork.  They have lost Fords, Dunlops and so on but they are wailing about the loss of a development that we never enjoyed.  Our industrial base never increased beyond 5.1 per cent.  All the media focus and the wailing are directed towards Cork because of the job losses there.</P>

      <P>This gross provocation from the Cork Deputies is difficult to resist.  If we consider the level of savings for Ringaskiddy and the relevant figures for Rosslare we find there is no justification for favouring one port as against another in terms of the provision of free port facilities.  If we look at the south-east region, we must look also at the report of the South-Eastern Regional Development Organisation.  They said County Wexford was a black spot within the five counties of that region and that <Col N="405" /> the case of New Ross to be a free port could not be neglected.  I would not be so indulgent as to seek two free ports for County Wexford, but I suggest that one of the ports be given favourable consideration.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record that over the last number of years we got every assistance and encouragement from the officials in the Department of Communications especially the principal officer in the harbour section, Mr. Mortimer.  I want to express our appreciation for his work but we ask him to resist the pressures from the Cork direction.  Our weakness is that we do not have 20 Deputies, we have only five, and we are not getting the backing from Deputies in the south-east region to support our claim.  When the Department are extending the free port facilities I hope those civil servants and that principal officer will be as sympathetic to us as they have been in the past.</P>

      <P>I ask that provisions in this Bill will not be tied up in red tape.  There is no point in a customs and excise officer having a problem for every solution this Bill purports to put forward.</P>
      <P>Rosslare port was established in 1906 and has served the country well.  It is the third largest and fastest growing port in the country.  Whether on the cargo or passenger side, it presents a unique opportunity, not to take business from Cork or from any other port, but to develop new Euro-business.  When the new port authority is set up in Rosslare, I hope an application will be submitted and approval will be given for free port status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to <Col N="406" /> Deputy Yates.  He is part of the Government and it is not enough for him to shout from the backbenches and say what the Minister should or should not have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have had enough clout to ensure that the Minister included Rosslare harbour in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said there were no plans to establish any other free ports at the moment.  I want to express concern that other areas were not included.  It is obvious that Deputies have not had an input into the preparation of this Bill.  Once again County Wexford and Rosslare harbour in particular have to take a back seat.  This is a continuation of a lack of interest already shown by this Government over the past number of years in the plight of the unemployed in Wexford.  I will come back to that point later.</P>
      <P>I realise that every Deputy coming from a constituency with even the slightest semblance of a port will be looking for free port status, and I accept that for the Minister to sanction such applications willy nilly would be of no benefit to stimulating economic activity anywhere in the country.  But having said that, I deplore the fact that Rosslare harbour was not looked at on its merits.  Good luck to Ringaskiddy.  We hear a lot of talk about Cork being devastated but solving the problems of Cork will not solve Wexford's problems.  Later I will be putting forward a case for free port status for Rosslare harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The determining of free port status should be based solely on geographical and economic grounds.  Its transport, communications, strategically placed position to the EC and its link with the major nations of the world should also be taken into account.  In England, after something like 45 applications the Government eventually decided to come down in favour of six.  The general opinion there is that the concept of free <Col N="407" /> ports is being held back by totally inflexible attitudes and too stringent regulations. I am led to believe that a team from the British Government are at present examining free port regulations with a view to relaxing the attitudes of customs and excise to make it more attractive for people interested in trading in such areas. Liverpool, it would seem, is the most successful.  Regulations and rules there at customs level are far more flexible than in other areas.</P>
    <P>Bringing in free port legislation is not enough.  We must have a long term commitment with all the required flexibility essential for its proper functioning. There are more than 400 free ports throughout the world at present, many of them in under-developed countries. We are told that Miami is the most successful free port zone in the world.  It is privately owned.  Miami is geographically well placed for doing business with Europe and Latin America.  There is a large cargo airport beside it, which is very much to its advantage.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to look at Miami, Liverpool and the other successful free ports and be prepared to learn and make the legislation workable and free from bundles of red tape and bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the pluses we will be claiming for free ports.  The financial benefits will derive from deferred liability for customs duties and VAT.  The Minister for Finance will have the task of determining the proposed VAT reliefs under the VAT Acts.  Will the Minister for Finance adopt legislation in the liberal manner required to make free ports successful? Somehow I doubt it, knowing his Scrooge-like approach to investment in general.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with financial inducements and we would need clarification of this area.  If one looks at a number of businesses one will see that cash flow seems to be a major problem and is forcing many business to the wall.  I would welcome any provision that would provide cash flow facilities.  I would like to hear from the Minister about that.  I am <Col N="408" /> also concerned about section 3 which is giving unlimited powers to the Minister and needs further clarification because we might end up with too many political decisions being taken.  Section 6 (2) deals with the licensee who does not comply with the regulations.  Has he any right of appeal?  On what grounds can he go back to the Minister?  Under section 7 (1) the Minister has power to revoke the licence, but has the licence-holder any right of appeal against such revoking?  There are other sections about which one could express reservations, but I am sure we will have another opportunity to discuss them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will now come back to the reason why Ringaskiddy and not other locations was picked for free port status.  Like Deputy Doyle, I feel the decision to look after Ringaskiddy was taken on political rather than geographical and commercial criteria. Fair play to the Deputies from Cork.  It is obvious they have the political muscle to swing this free port status for Ringaskiddy, not like their Wexford colleagues who threw in the towel and abandoned the people of Wexford.  In County Wexford at present we have the highest unemployment rate in the country &mdash; way above the national average at 25 per cent. However, we have had no task force for the county, no priority for the 8,000 unemployed there.  Like Cork, Wexford has a litany of closures &mdash; Springs, National Aluminium, Barna Buildings, Beegman and the mushroom factory &mdash; one could go on and on naming the factories which closed.</P>
    <P>It is now more than four years since a new foreign industry of any significance was established in County Wexford.  This surely denotes the lack of recognition by this Government of Wexford's serious unemployment problem.  The best efforts of the IDA have not been successful in reducing or containing the levels of unemployment or in achieving any increase in employment in County Wexford's extremely low industrial base.</P>
    <P>Rosslare Harbour, the gateway to Europe, was the first port to seek free port status.  How much serious consideration was given to the designation of <Col N="409" /> Rosslare as a free port?  How did the Government arrive at the conclusion that Ringaskiddy was more suitable?  Deputies have talked about Cork being depressed, but Wexford is on its knees, reeling from the disastrous policies of this Government.  There is a strong case for Rosslare.  There is a high level of unemployment; Rosslare is the nearest port to Europe; CIE are committed to investing in it in the future; Wexford County Council have provided the infrastructure and it has a rail link to both Dublin and the south.  In the Rosslare area we also have a large land bank available for development. Rosslare Harbour is now the second port to Dublin, in terms of trade value.  In 1984, 11½ per cent of trade value throughput in our ports was through Rosslare Harbour, an increase of 4 per cent from 1980.  If one compares that with Dublin where they have a decline of 8 per cent, it shows the value of Rosslare Harbour to the economy.</P>
    <P>European markets are available now and Rosslare Harbour is surely the port to develop to avail of those markets.  In 1984 Rosslare Harbour accounted for 16 per cent of the total exports coming through this country's sea ports, and 1,000,000 passengers a year pass through Rosslare which is a major boost to the tourist industry.  All experts tell us that tourism will be the world's major industry at the end of the century.  In Rosslare we are providing services which are benefiting the whole economy.  The number of coaches coming through Rosslare has increased dramatically; we have a vibrant roll-on roll-off freight service and CIE, being the port authority, are investing £5 million in the future development of the port.  Economically, commercially and on the grounds of high unemployment, Rosslare has all the criteria for free port status.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that the people of Wexford are not prepared to accept anything less than that status for Rosslare Harbour in the future.  Will the Minister seriously consider, even at this late stage, the inclusion of Rosslare Harbour with Ringaskiddy as a free port area?  Such a <Col N="410" /> free port would service the whole south-eastern region of Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford and Waterford.  It is a must that Rosslare be given the priority essential for the future of the whole south-eastern region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important, now that this Bill has reached the House for all of us to work to ensure that the measure fulfils its potential.  I have high hopes for it and I welcome it, not as a sop to Cork, but as a measure with marvellous opportunities for the whole country.  It is something that I have been advocating for a long time and now that it is almost a reality I rejoice, but it is the rejoicing of a person who sees this only as the beginning and not the end.  It is the rejoicing of a person who, when the concept of a free port for Cork was materialising, saw its advantages yet recognised its limits.  It will not open everything up for us at once but for all that it is a great boost heralding what could be a new beginning for the port of Cork.  What is good for the port is good for the city.</P>
      <P>Having the finest natural harbour in Europe, having expended massive Government aid to bring that area into the era of the 21st century, it was only right and proper that Ringaskiddy should have been selected for the status of the country's first free port.  It has, or will shortly have, all the modern facilities to make it possible to get the greatest value from this new venture, a deep water berth capable of docking the largest vessels, jetties and stores, etc.  In coming to fruition it presents a challenge to all of us, to Cork Harbour commissioners who got all they asked for in the facilities provided there and for everybody concerned in re-establishing the region.  We will have all the tools at our disposal, now let us use them.  There are no more excuses.  We will have, to a degree that did not seem possible a mere few years ago, more or less, everything we asked for.  The crying and whingeing must stop.  Our future is, basically, in our own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will not solve everything at one stroke but it was the right thing to do.  It is the right legislation at the right <Col N="411" /> time.  We have to work from there and I am particularly glad that Cork has been chosen to show its mettle in this regard. If a free port is going to work anywhere it is in Cork.  As I have mentioned, the facilities are excellent and the site supreme.  They are manifestly the best in the land &mdash; the hub of a Ringaskiddy industrial complex, the biggest and the best serviced in Ireland with natural gas laid on, water on tap by the millions of gallons and a massive development ideally appointed for heavy industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister has not yet determined the designation of the area encompassed within the free port.  I appreciate that problem and acknowledge the difficulty.  I am glad the Minister did not come to a premature decision in drawing these boundary lines.  Such has been the expansion of the area, such is its potential, that the problems are readily apparent in this regard.  I would like to make this public appeal to the Minister, as I have done in private meetings with him, to designate as big an area as possible looking beyond the immediate present. Otherwise a small initial area would have to be changed regularly with all the administrative hassle and uncertainty this would entail.</P>
    <P>In conclusion and in endorsing the welcome for this Bill, in praising the initiative of the Minister and the Government in bringing forward this measure, I will repeat that it presents a challenge, which I know will be accepted by everyone who has the good and the future of Cork at heart.  This Bill gives us no certainty that business will flow in and unhappily there are precedents for such failures.  What it gives us is a unique opportunity to prove that what we long advocated can now be put to work.  I am confident of the outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  This legislation is of interest to Louth where we have three ports, Greenore, Dundalk and Drogheda.  Greenore is a deep water <Col N="412" /> port, a port which has developed tremendously in recent years.  Greenore is privately owned and as such has not been eligible for any State assistance or grants towards its development.  It is certainly a great bone of contention that the type of assistance available in other areas is not being provided to Greenore, simply because it is a privately owned port.  We must see this decision by the Government in the context of the potential which exists in Greenore.  Greenore port is the gateway to the sea for the north east region.  It is the gateway from a county which, in recent years, has been devastated by industrial stagnation and everincreasing unemployment.  We have somewhere in the region of 8,000 people unemployed at present, a figure which just a few years ago would have been unthinkable, yet one by one the long established, securely based industries have gone to the wall.  By its very location and nature the county and the region generally has a considerable growth in population.  People have gravitated towards Dundalk and County Louth for education for their families and in turn in search of employment when that education is completed.  Sad to relate here in the Dáil, those employment opportunities are simply non-existent in County Louth at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation and the debate in the Dáil tonight afford us the opportunity to look at the potential that exists for the free port facility and to examine the possibilities in this legislation for County Louth.  Having listened to some Deputies who contributed in the immediate past, one is entitled to ask how the decision was reached to allow Ringaskiddy to be declared a free port while there is no mention of other ports around the country? We must ask if the decision was based on the unemployment levels in the Cork region or on political clout in that region.  If the decision was taken on the basis of unemployment levels, then a port in Louth must be next in line for being declared a free port.  The percentage unemployment figures in Louth are as bad if not worse than those in any other county at this time.  It is unacceptable <Col N="413" /> that on the industrial base the plight of the unemployed in our county should continue to be ignored.  In view of the fact that this is enabling legislation the Minister should examine immediately the possibility of declaring perhaps Greenore port a free port under this legislation after Ringaskiddy has had its share of the cake. Imagine the possibilities that that would open up for County Louth.  It would give some encouragment and hope to those who are striving to make a living, to keep business in existence and to keep the doors of their factories and industries open.</P>
    <P>I said in this House in the not too distant past that the possibility of establishing a special board or county authority should be examined immediately.  Consider the possibilities that would open up for the infrastructural and industrial development not alone of Louth but of the counties right along the Border which have been devastated in recent years.  Of all the counties along the Border, Louth has been the worst hit.  We are the only county right along the Border from Omeath to Donegal that is not designated for industrial promotion purposes, and that has militated very seriously against County Louth recently where the demand for industries, large and small, is so great as is the pull from one region or another.  It is inevitable that people who have investment to make will look at the packages that will be offered in different areas before they decide to locate.</P>
    <P>I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism a mere ten days ago and I was very interested in the reply. I wanted to know how many industrial itineraries visited the town of Dundalk in the last two years and I was amazed to find that 54 industrial itineraries went to that town and the net result of it is a mere few dozen jobs to be set up in the town.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister and the Government will have regard to what has happened in Dundalk and Louth generally and consider the possibility of declaring Greenore port a free port and that we can see it as being the gateway for the north-east region.  We will see it as the gateway to an industrial zone in the Border areas that will work wonders for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not pretending that there are any easy solutions or answers to the unemployment problems in that area.  Industries there have stood the test of time but time has caught up with them.  The sort of process that should take place from within to ensure that adequate replacements for those industries would be forthcoming maybe did not happen.  Take that in conjunction with the very considerable increase in the population in the area and it all adds up to a very serious problem. Let me come back to the question of the possibility of Greenore port being declared a free port and being a gateway for the north-east region.  If a special development authority were to be set up in the Border counties the potential that would exist there would be considerable. I am not making merely a political point in the Dáil tonight.  This is a worthwhile and serious suggestion and I ask the Government to consider it in the context of the very serious problems that we have.  If the necessary measures are not taken it will remain with us for a very long time.  I hope that when the Minister comes to reply he will consider the suggestions I have made, that he will examine their feasibility and, most important, if he feels that they are feasible he will expedite the move to ensure that it becomes a reality and that we who represent the constituency of Louth can say that some progress has been made for <Col N="415" /> those who are weighed down by industrial and economic stagnation and so badly afflicted by unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the intent of the Bill in so far as it relates to the Government's intention to help the situation in Cork arising from their devastating experiences with the closure of Fords, Dunlops, Verolme Dockyard and others, but my concern &mdash; coming from Limerick which is the capital of the mid-west region and one of the regions which is developing most rapidly &mdash; is that an unanswerable case is established already for the creation of a free port on the Shannon estuary.  So far, in spite of all the platitudes that have been uttered by successive Governments since the foundation of the State, there has been no great direct investment by any Government in the Shannon Estuary which is one of the great natural waterways of the world and a maritime asset of which any nation would be proud.</P>
      <P>One would think that as an island nation we would be exploiting that resource to a greater degree than we have been doing.  It is probably true to say that the only major development that has taken place on the estuary so far has been that by Aughinish Alumina Limited. That development is very welcome in that it created a very high quality of employment for more than 800 people.  The ESB have also invested in Moneypoint creating one of the biggest power stations in the country.  I welcome the grants paid through Alcan and other industries located on the estuary, but there has not been any direct Government investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion that we should appoint a Minister with responsibility for the development of marine and maritime resources because we should use those huge resources for the benefit of our people.  Shannon Airport is the most successful duty free zone that has been created in Europe since the war. The estuary can benefit if use is made of the expertise of a semi-State body like SFADCo in the provision of a free port <Col N="416" /> which could be linked to the airport complex. The current role of SFADCo is largely one of job creation.  Its action at the start of the sixties in creating the Shannon industrial free zone was a counter to the threat that was there at the time and was concerned initially with the development of the airport rather than with the development of industry as such.</P>
    <P>However, the zone's full significance became apparent in 1964 when for the first time industrial employment at the airport exceeded that related to aviation proper.  Thereafter, the development of the industrial complex assumed an importance in its own right, although linked to the overall development of the airport.  Over the years that industrial free zone has made steady progress and is the most successful in Europe since the war.  In 1983 alone merchandise exports from the zone amounted to $240 million and of this nearly 70 per cent was exported to other EC member states, 14 per cent to North America and 18 per cent to other world markets.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out to the House, and to the vested interests in the tourist industry on the east coast, led by some prominent hoteliers who attack unfairly the track record of SFADCo, that the company has the capacity to develop a free port.  In fact, representatives of SFADCo have gone all over the world helping to establish similar projects.  Not alone are they helping the Third World but they are earning valuable revenue for the State and building up good relations for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government should seriously consider establishing a free port in the area. An Opposition Member referred to the fact that in recent months he saw ships of 150,000 tonnes bringing in cargo.  That type of business could be developed.  I should like to give the House an example of how a city or region can benefit from the existence of a free port.  The advantages of free ports were dealt with in an article in <i>Business And Finance</i> in May this year.  Hamburg has become one of the major cities of the world because of the existence of a free port there.  All <Col N="417" /> shipping and goods traffic within the free port is free of customs and other duties and there are no formalities to restrict or hamper the flow of goods.  Cargo can be loaded and unloaded, transported, stored in unlimited quantities for an unrestricted period of time, inspected, sampled and subjected to certain types of treatment during storage without any customs clearance or provision of security.  Only when goods deemed to come from beyond the Community customs area leave the free port and international territory do they require customs clearance.</P>
    <P>The west coast, especially the mid-west, has a special case to make because for the last 300 years the ports along that coast have been at a serious disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their counterparts on the east.  If the east is developed any more, if Dublin keeps spreading, Ireland will topple over lopsided into the Irish Sea.  Successive Governments have paid lip service to the idea of decentralisation and reversing the rural imbalance on the west coast.  This is a glorious opportunity to rectify that and it can be done without in any way detracting from the right of Cork to its own free port such as that designated for Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>Shortly we hope that the new Shannon Estuary port authority will be established. I imagine that one of its priorities will be the creation of a free port to link up with the existing duty free zone at Shannon Airport.  That move is so logical that nobody could reasonably argue against it.  It would help as an economic counter-balance to what is happening on the east coast.  Such an authority is necessary because there is no cohesion of policy on the Shannon Estuary in relation to development.  We cannot get an agreement on a unified port authority for the mid-west, but it is not hard to imagine the type of benefits that would flow from having one overall estuarial authority.</P>
    <P>Two months ago industrialists visited Ireland at my invitation.  I got in touch with them through a contact I had in the trade union movement.  At the time they were considering doing something for Verolme Dockyard but decided against it and now intend to locate in the Foynes <Col N="418" /> area on the Shannon Estuary.  There is a potential for good worthwhile employment in that project and an investment of £10 million.  There is plenty of money available from that organisation and negotiations to procure more have started.  It does not take any great imagination to see what could be done if there was a free port on the Shannon Estuary. It is the finest and safest deep water estuary in Europe and I hope the Government will see fit, as a logical follow on, to create this new port authority for the Shannon Estuary so that it can qualify for EC grants.  Ideally, it should lock in with Shannon Airport using the proven expertise and track record of the people involved in the region.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of the Shannon development has been exploited, creating small industries, bringing in service industries, developing tourism, inducing high technology people into the area, the creation of pilot schemes for food processing which has limitless potential for employment. If all that is not kept tapped, we are criminally negligent as a Government and as a people.  One can see what could happen with a combination of the airport, one of the finest international airports in Europe, and the free port which I am advocating in the Shannon Estuary. Think of what that would mean to the people not alone in the mid-west and along the west coast, but in the whole country.</P>
    <P>People in Limerick can remember cycling to Shannon Airport to shoot snipe or grouse on Sundays 30 years ago.  One could not count 20 houses between the city and Bunratty and there would be another 40 between that and Shannon Airport.  The people had left that region, either to go to Dublin, if they were lucky enough to have completed their education to Leaving Certificate standard, to get a job in the Garda or the Civil Service. The rest emigrated.  Tremendous work has been done in that area.  However, there is huge scope as yet untapped and undeveloped for the creation of a free port to link in with the Shannon development zone.  Such a link exists already in other areas within the EC.  I see no logical <Col N="419" /> reason for the Government not giving the strongest consideration to that and I urge them to do so.</P>

      <P>With due respect to the pretty young Deputy on my right, I am not going to shed any tears for her region, the Cork region.  While in recent times that area has had traumatic experiences, over the past 20 years it has been stuffed with industry because of political expendiency. That has been the order of the day in relation to Cork.  I am speaking on behalf of the forgotten area of Ireland, 50 miles to the north, although some Ministers do not seem to know where it is, the forgotten area of County Louth.</P>

      <P>They did not win anything when the Minister of State was there.  I want to state the case for County Louth.  There is no area as economically deprived or as devastated as that area.  It has borne the brunt of the Ulster troubles.  No town, North or South, has been so grievously hurt or deprived as Dundalk.  Last week we saw the collapse of the last remaining industry there, Dundalk Engineering Works.  This industry was a profit making concern which gave employment to 320 people.  This collapse came about because of the collapse of the parent company in Brooklyn.  That is an example of what is happening in Dundalk. Now there are more people in the public sector than in the manufacturing industry.  In addition, we have to watch the spectacle of convoys of cars, buses and trains&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I commend to the Minister and the Government the attractions of the Greenore area.  Greenore would be an ideal venue for a joint operation, North and South, a hands across the Border operation, creating an international free port in the waters of Carlingford Lough. The recent Anglo-Irish Agreement heightens the attractions of that type of operation. Carlingford Lough is a deep water area, ideally located for a venture such as this.  The great success of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement affords a tremendous opportunity in this connection. I have no doubt such a joint North-South operation would have the full support of the EC.</P>
      <P>We are talking about an area which has been identified already by the Community's Economic and Social Council as being the most deprived area in Europe, according to their report published in February, 1984.  The case for Government compensatory measures for my area is undeniable.  For the past 17 years we have gradually been withering and we are now on the point of extinction.  This is an ideal opportunity to create an area to which industry can be attracted.  The free port could be built in the centre of the lough.  In those 17 years this area has not had any help from any Government. I cannot defend my own Government's record in the recent past.  It is no better and no worse than that of the Fianna Fáil administration.  The time has come for action.  Various Government Ministers have recognised the problem but we are not interested in recognition &mdash; we want action.  I commend the port of Greenore to the Minister as an ideal venue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with Deputy McGahon.  I know that he goes north for his holidays but we had better bring him on a trip down south very soon. The whole area of Cork is suffering from a severe depression.  I want to make the case for one area tonight that is, Cobh harbour.  Over the past couple of years <Col N="421" /> Verolme dockyard closed down, putting 1,200 people out of work.  There have been redundancies at Irish Steel, Maritime Industries have closed down and Cobh is like a ghost town.  Yet it has probably the best harbour, not only in Ireland but perhaps in Europe, at Verolme. I am recommending to the Minister that that deep sea port area should be made a free port area.</P>
      <P>This would enhance dramatically the value of Verolme itself to a buyer, to the people who live there and to everybody concerned.  I could see it then going from strength to strength.  There is no doubt that, with the development of off-shore licensing and so forth, of off-shore resources and facilities, some place will have to be found in the southern region where such attendant work can be carried out.  The ideal place for this would be a new Verolme situation of a free port area.</P>
      <P>The quay area in Cobh could also be made a free port area.  I know that the Minister has received several requests concerning other ports, but to my mind many of these have been with regard to very large regions such as the Shannon estuary.  I am not suggesting that the whole town be made a free port area. There are no jobs there; there is utter despair on the faces and in the minds of everybody in Cobh.  I recommend that Cobh become the first free port area after Ringaskiddy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two brief points on this Bill.  First, I welcome the Bill because I believe it constitutes a step forward in the Governments commitment to Cork and Cork county. The overspill from this free port will be of tremendous benefit not alone to Cork city and to Cobh, about which Deputy M. Barry spoke, but to the whole of the area and can do nothing but good.  It will create an environment for employment which is badly needed in the area.  With the control of interest rates and inflation this country is becoming a more satisfactory place to which industrialists can look for the creation of industry, the building of factories and so on.  For that reason <Col N="422" /> also I believe this free port will contribute in a fairly substantial way.</P>
      <P>However, I do not believe the establishment of this free port will see the end to our problems; it could well augur the beginning of some.  Unless we can compete in the marketing of this free port all around the world then, in itself, it will not have been worth the time spent discussing it in this House.  A decision will have to be made on who will undertake that marketing function, whether it should be the IDA, the Cork Harbour Board, a combination of those and others, but we must compete with the English, the Americans and some continentals. Indeed, not alone must we compete but beat them at marketing.  We should be able to do so in our current economic climate.  The amount of money spent around Ringaskiddy, the Cork Harbour Board area, by this Government has been tremendous particularly in recent years, on roads, housing and so on.  There is the deep water berth costing £10 million which is to be completed next year.  These are all facilities on which we can now build.  They will be of tremendous importance and value to the development of that free port.</P>
      <P>One must make reference also to the educational facilities now provided in Cork city which are as good if not better than any to be found elsewhere.  There is the regional technical college, AnCO, UCC and the other specialised areas of education which mean we can now provide young educated people who are as good, if not better than any to be found elsewhere.  We must harness that resource effectively.  If we do not do so, if we do not ensure that the value of this free port is marketed satisfactorily, then we will be back to nought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of this free port was first mooted as a result of a report commissioned by the Government.  This was one of their recommendations.  They said this would contribute in a substantial way to alleviating unemployment in Cork.  I hope the Minister will give this proposal his undivided attention so that this free port will be established rapidly.  The question has been raised as to who will <Col N="423" /> manage this facility once it is in existence. I understand that the Minister has invited suggestions from various people.  It is important that it be done by a group of people.  For example, I believe the Cork Harbour Board should be involved.  Private industry and industrialists should be involved.  I would contend that the Government should also have a finger in this, though I say that with some reluctance because over the years Governments have tended to become too involved in too many things.  Perhaps if we handed over some to private enterprise they might do somewhat better. Also the time has arrived when we must allow people to put their money into projects because, in so doing, they will work somewhat harder.  This would be in sharp contrast to what somebody said here this morning about people coming from abroad with airline tickets in cases, receiving VIP treatment, the suggestion being that some of our people were not receiving such treatment.  Perhaps we should turn the tide back somewhat and encourage our people to develop somewhat more.  If the establishment of this free port relieves some of the bureaucracy and red tape obtaining, in itself that will have been a major step forward.  I believe the environment is right for it to do more than that and I wish it well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies very much for their contributions. I have been gratified to see the general welcome given the Bill.  I was made quite conscious of the fact that many Deputies on all sides of the House would have given the Bill an even greater welcome had it specified their port as being at the top of the queue instead of Ringaskiddy, as is the proposal at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise, and this is a point that has been overlooked, that this is an enabling Bill which, when enacted, will render possible the establishment of a free port anywhere in the country.  Of course, such free ports in order to be successful must have some natural, manmade or other advantages that will attract <Col N="424" /> business.  A free port, unable to attract business, will be of no use.  However, I should warn that whether in Ringaskiddy or anywhere else, a free port should not be regarded as a panacea for all ills.  Also it would be counter-productive if there was to be a proliferation of free ports all over the country.  Therefore, we need to give the matter careful consideration.  We need to watch closely developments in Ringaskiddy before rushing into other areas.  There are a number of limitations to a free port operation, many deriving from the fact that we now belong to the EC.  We cannot be compared with Third World countries as such because we have at present the common customs tariff throughout the EC.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not expect Ringaskiddy to be an overnight success. The United Kingdom experiment is a very sobering one because only one of their free ports has been what might be considered a substantial success.  As Deputies pointed out, we need to examine very closely what happened there.</P>
    <P>Once the free port at Ringaskiddy has been established I know other areas will be putting their act together with a view to making submissions, promoting their causes, but I would recommend that we hasten slowly so that we can learn along the way.  There is potential there but not a panacea for all ills and nobody is endeavouring to hype it up as such.</P>

      <P>Before I concluded last night I was talking about the decline in living standards, the growing pressure under which the middle income group find themselves, the number of repossessions by building societies, the taxation burden and emigration among that group.  We hear many speeches about unemployment generally but I would put it to the House that unemployment among the middle income group &mdash; the so-called executive class &mdash; is quite frightening. Behind the lace curtains in modern suburbia there is a very difficult situation of despair and growing indebtedness to the banks.  That is not often said in this House but it is very important because many a person is experiencing these difficulties although on paper he appears to be doing nicely.  He might appear to have a reasonable salary, a tax free allowance, a car, a house and so on.  I have come in contact with the reality and misery.  There is as much, if not more, poverty and depression among the salaried classes as there is among any other section of the community.  That is not often realised or said.  It is important to put it on the record of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last night that the central feature of <i>Building on Reality</i> was the attainment of 5 per cent of GNP as the current budget deficit.  It is quite clear now that not alone will we not totally bridge the current budget deficit but we will be somewhat off that 5 per cent.  According to my calculations it will be about £800 million.  I asked the Minister last night where we might find that £800 million to bring the current budget deficit back to the 5 per cent envisaged in the plan.  I spoke also about the national debt of £20 billion compared to a figure of £8 billion or £9 billion a few years ago and the fact that the current budget deficit represents <Col N="427" /> the highest percentage of GNP of any industrial country.</P>
    <P>One cannot judge a Government on political speeches, glossy brochures or television appearances.  On can only do so by considering what was laid out and predicted in the plan and dispassionately comparing that to what has happened in the period outlined.  That is the only way I would attempt to criticise this Government. I do not criticise them in a deeply political way but simply from sadness that we have not managed between us to achieve some of the targets in the plan.  The 5 per cent target is gone.  The unemployment target is off by over 15,000.  It was predicted that manufacturing employment would increase but it has actually gone down.  The Taoiseach told me in reply to a parliamentary question that unemployment is now 21 per cent.  The current deficit and the borrowing situation are way out of line with the plan.  All I can do is compare what the Government said they would do with what they actually did and point to a failure of policy.</P>
    <P>I also spoke last night about the repatriation of profits from this country.  It would appear that about £1 billion in profits made by companies are being repatriated.  I asked the Minister for Finance to tell the House about the success or otherwise of the scheme to attract money from multinationals into Government stock.  I would dearly like to know how many of them have bought Government stock rather than repatriate their profits.  I suggested that most of these companies would not take up this scheme because if they have a choice between reinvesting their money in their own company or putting it on deposit in one of their own banks abroad or, on the other hand, lending it to the Irish Government, they will not choose the latter option.  I am keen to know exactly how the scheme has been working.</P>
    <P>I have taken apart in my contribution the detailed figures laid out in the plan and compared them with the figures available today.  Any objective person must agree that the assumptions underlying the national plan were totally and <Col N="428" /> utterly false and the plan should be withdrawn. The figures emerging daily in reply to questions from this side of the House show that the plan is no longer operational and has no relevance to where we go from here.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be entirely negative because that is probably too easy a way out.  There are very positive things that I have welcomed.  I have welcomed the Government's moves on PRSI and in the grants area.  They will do some good.</P>
    <P>We must do more in the area of curtailing State involvement.  This is why I so strongly opposed setting up the National Development Corporation as just another layer of State involvement in the economy.  I was interested in the Minister's reactions to my statement in his speech.  Do we not realise that the State is spending £2 out of every £3 spent? The level of State involvement in the economy is unsustainable.  In the light of this fact, is it not a move in the wrong direction to establish a National Development Corporation on top of the existing layers of government?  With the State being so central in the economy, how is it possible for the private sector to breathe?</P>
    <P>I hold very strongly the view that the State does not create employment.  It creates the conditions around which the rest of us will create employment.  It is that philosophy which is missing from this Government's approach to the economy. They seem to think that the NDC is an adequate response to the unemployment problem.  I suggest that it is not an adequate response.  I suggest instead that an adequate response would be the curtailing of State involvement, deliberate moves to create the atmosphere wherein everybody else could create jobs, an improvement in the venture capital scheme by taking off the gloves and the red tape, a greater commitment to exporting and the removal of our paranoia in this regard, a concentration on small business rather than the large multinationals. Generally we must take the kind of steps which will enable the State to create the environment and conditions in which the Irish people will solve the <Col N="429" /> problems.  Until we get that philosophy we will not tackle the crisis in this economy.</P>

      <P>The premise on which the Opposition base their case in this debate does not hold up. They claim that the economy is in a worse state than it was three years ago.  This is not true.  Budgets have been brought under control.  Whereas there were huge over-runs in the 1979-82 period &mdash; 56 per cent on average &mdash; since we took over budgets have been kept broadly on target.  Any deviations have been on the revenue side, where the Government have little direct control.  In the earlier period the over-runs arose simply because the Government spent more than they said they would because they had cooked the books initially and used too much baking .</P>
      <P>A huge part of what the Government are now spending is interest on past debts.  All that is raised in income tax has to be paid over to bankers from whom Irish Governments borrowed in the past. The only other area of Government spending that has increased as a share of GNP is transfer payments, mainly social welfare.  Many will assume that this is just because unemployment has risen.  This, however, only accounts for half the increase.  Rates of payment of social welfare have increased which accounts for the other half of the increase.  For instance, a non-contributory old age pension grew by 146 per cent since 1980 as against a CPI increase of 92 per cent.</P>
      <P>When the Opposition complain about the budget deficit, as Deputy Haughey did last night, how does he suggest that we should economise?  By failing to honour interest payments?  By reversing the social welfare benefit increases?  Let him be specific when he intones his oratorical concern about public financial problems.  Let him say exactly what he would do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition complain about deflationary policies and monetarism, two defunct theories that have never been Government policies.  The Government <Col N="430" /> policy has been a much more mundane one.  We believe that a Government, like a household, must live within their means &mdash; no more and no less.  We recognise that a legacy of ten years of cumulative budget deficits, started in 1972, will not be reversed in three or four years.  It is a process that requires patience and a long term view of the nation's needs.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Opposition a direct question.  Have they abandoned the policies underlying <i>The Way Forward</i> which called for a reduction in the budget deficit from 7.5 per cent of GNP in 1982 to 2 per cent in 1985 and zero in 1986?  The Government reckoned that these targets were unattainable and were honest enough to set more modest ones in <i>Building on Reality.</i> What is the Opposition's fiscal policy at this point? Is it one of calling simultaneously for reduced borrowing, reduced taxation and increased spending?  I do not know if the public would like to know the answer, but it might be of interest to historians writing text books on economic debate in Ireland in the eighties.</P>
    <P>I know that historians will have little opportunity to find out what the Opposition would do because they will not be taking any active role in policy making. However, it would be of interest to historians to know what the Opposition would have done if they had been returned to office.  That is why I am asking this question which I presume they will answer.  If they do answer, I will be surprised because they have not answered it over the past three years even though it has been repeatedly asked.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the facts.  Inflation and mortgage payments have been cut dramatically since we took office.  This means that ordinary householders can save more money and that our industrialists can compete overseas.  The CII newsletter of 3 September said:</P>
    <P>The catastrophic decline of many traditional industrial sectors has at last been halted and the long hard fight back to recovery has commenced. These sectors are an extremely important part of the Irish manufacturing <Col N="431" /> sector and account for about three-quarters of total employment.  Their recovery has been helped by the reduction in inflation to average EEC levels.  Irish inflation is now slightly below the EEC average and expected to fall further.  However, EEC inflation will fall over the next year.  By keeping Irish inflation at or below the level of our EEC partners the recent recovery of traditional labour intensive industries can be sustained. </P>
    <P>They are not my words.  They were said by the Conferderation of Irish Industry who were well known for complaining in the past if things were not going the way they wanted them to go.  They have clearly indicated that there is a significant recovery as a result of the Government's anti-inflationery policies in regard to employment and output in traditional manufacturing industries.  Investment and spending are beginning to recover. The demand for producers' capital goods &mdash; a leading indicator of investment &mdash; is substantially up on 1984.  Commercial vehicle sales, used by much of the productive sector of the economy, have increased by 15 per cent on last year.  The volume of retail sales is growing and we expect 3,000 extra jobs to be created in the construction industry as a result of the home improvements package.  This boost will go to the legitimate builder and not to the black economy merchant.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to taxation.  In 1985, for the first time since 1979, the overall tax burden will fall.  Admittedly it is a modest fall but it is a move in the right direction. At the end of 1982 unemployment was rising at the rate of 40,000 a year.  Despite the massive increase in the number of school leavers this year, as against a decade ago, we have now halved the rate of increase in unemployment from that which obtained in 1982.</P>

      <P>It is still a tragic situation and by no means good enough, but the trend is in the right direction and the <Col N="432" /> trend was in the wrong direction when the party opposite lost office.  That is why things are getting better.  We must face up to the reasons for unemployment.  Since 1979 hourly earnings in manufacturing have doubled.  Earnings in our competitor countries increased by only 57 per cent.  This led inexorably to a loss of markets and jobs but we have now got that back under control.  This year the increase in earnings will exceed the average of our main trading partners by a smaller margin than for some years past. Again the trend is in the right direction, whereas it was in the wrong direction when we took office.</P>
      <P>The Opposition claimed that the Government's policy is &mdash; to use Deputy Haughey's words &mdash; to close down State companies.  It is the opposite, as our policy is to reconstruct them on a sound and viable basis.  This requires tough but constructive decisions.  Pouring more money into an inherently loss-making structure guarantees nothing except its ultimate closure.  Instead, the Government have pursued a policy of rigorous reconstruction.  We have worked effectively towards getting Irish Steel, Cork Dockyards and Clondalkin Paper Mills onto a solid footing.  The Opposition policy of pouring in money without addressing the problem will just not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now need a policy for producing more and selling more.  All the Opposition can offer is a policy for spending more and borrowing more.  They seem to feel that spending money generates confidence, but confidence does not come from spending, it comes from success. We will only succeed if we turn up in time for work every day, work to ensure the highest quality of goods and services and, if we are working in a profession, provide good services at minimum cost rather than use restrictive practices to protect our income.  If we are engaged in the public service, excellent service at minimum cost must be our watchword.  This is the road to confidence based on success rather than the road to ultimate lack of confidence based on spending money instead of addressing the fundamental <Col N="433" /> problem, which seems to be the policy of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>If we could create a society in which everybody saw wealth creation not just as the enrichment of the few but of the entire community, then we could achieve our full potential.  This must be done on an individual, personal shareholding basis and that is why the Government and I have put so much emphasis on tax concessions for profit sharing and workers' shareholding.  It is also why the Government have put so much emphasis on the development of an over the counter market for shares so that individuals will have an opportunity to buy a share in a small company in their own town. That is why we have introduced a business expansion scheme which will encourage chambers of commerce, if they so desire, to set up investment trusts so that people will have the opportunity to invest in the establishment of an industry in their own locality.  That is why we want to create a situation in which people can buy back their own shares so that if a person buys shares there will be always somebody to whom he can sell them.</P>
    <P>All this policy is based on giving ordinary people a share in the wealth of the country, a stake in making our productive sector more efficient.  The people who vote in elections must be made aware that the wealth generating process will make them better off rather than relying on some anonymous corporation or rich person in their locality whom they can only envy.  If we can get to the point where the broad mass of people on an individual basis &mdash; not on a collective basis, as perhaps some other Deputies might argue &mdash; could own shares in industry, then people will be able to see wealth creation through capital gains and growth as a means of making them better off.</P>
    <P>That is how we can get away from what obtains at the moment where people tend to see wage increases as the only means whereby ordinary people can share in the wealth creation process.  In reality, wage increases only push up costs and deprive us of jobs.  That is the road to destruction as I indicated.  There have been job losses <Col N="434" /> here because wage costs have gone up faster than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If we want to change we have to provide an alternative means whereby owning a share either in his own or in other business the man in the street can have a direct return from the wealth generating and investment process rather than having such benefits confined to the few.  That is a fundamental approach to the regeneration of the productive centre which is being pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>Of course other initiatives are being taken to boost the productive sector.  The combined effect of the employment incentive and PRSI schemes will be to give an employer who recruits extra workers from among the unemployed a wage subsidy of £45 per week or more. That will mean that many employers will take on more workers between now and 31 March.  I address an appeal directly to those engaged in manufacturing industry &mdash; I have already said this to the Confederation of Irish Industry and to the IDA &mdash; to make sure that they use the scheme between now and 31 March to increase their workforce.</P>
    <P>We have got to get away from the psychology that unfortunately obtains in industry to a great extent that it is all a question of cutting costs, of replacing people with machines, so that ultimately we will have factories with no people. That is an unsustainable policy from a social as well as an economic point of view.  It has derived in large measure from the fact that in the past the incentives in our tax code and our grants code have been those that encouraged people to invest in machines rather than in workers.  They had to pay a tax, whether PRSI or PAYE, if they employed a worker and they could not replace a worker without all kinds of requirements being imposed on them through labour law, whereas if they replaced that worker with a machine they could get grants and tax allowances.</P>
    <P>This scheme that will give up to £45 per week to employers who take on additional workers is a timely reversal of past policy.  It is aimed at making the <Col N="435" /> recruitment of people more attractive than was the case in the past.  I hope it will make employers think again before they contemplate replacing workers when, with profit to themselves and to the community they could increase their number of workers.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in industrial policy is being placed on home-based industry entering export markets.  I do not deny we need to continue to attract foreign investment, but the fact is that since 1978 &mdash; statistics on this were produced in a recent publication entitled <i>Perspectives on Industry,</i> edited by a Mr. Fitzpatrick and another gentleman &mdash; we have been losing our very generous share of US investment in Europe.  This is because of increased competition from other countries who are looking for American investment and also because our labour costs have run out of line <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors.  That is a process that will be difficult to reverse, although we intend to make every effort to do so.</P>
    <P>What we need to do &mdash; and what the White Paper on Industrial Policy has said we will do &mdash; is to put more emphasis on developing Irish companies to get big enough to break into export markets.  We do not need to bring in foreign companies with foreign technology as the sole means of exporting our goods in the high technology area.  We have to build up the strength of individual companies here. One provision in IDA legislation which has been little used in the past allows the IDA to give assistance to the reconstruction and regrouping of Irish companies in the private sector by getting them to merge.  By becoming stronger they will have the clout to enter foreign markets. That is a policy instrument I have asked the IDA to use much more fully than they have in the past.</P>
    <P>I have also asked the Irish Export Board to put more emphasis on getting Irish firms to come together and to market their products as a group.  Small businesses do not have the money to spend on expensive product development and export marketing schemes.  However, if they can come together and share <Col N="436" /> the costs and overheads there is the strong possibility that they can overcome existing barriers.  In that way we could have Irish flag bearing companies selling our goods overseas rather than having to rely on overseas companies, welcome as they will continue to be.</P>
    <P>Long term reforms, not short term palliatives, are the Government's aim.  We have revamped educational policy, the curricula in schools, the way the Dáil works.  Through the White Paper we have revamped the public service and we have published major policy documents on tourism and industrial policy.  All of this is aimed at laying a foundation for sustainable economic growth and employment. We are switching the emphasis in the health service from the treatment of illness in hospitals to the promotion of health in the community.  These are reforms that will still be of benefit to the Irish people in ten or 20 years time.</P>
    <P>All the evidence of recent polls is that the people are beginning to see the contrast between the patient policies of the Government and the erratic expedients of the Opposition.  The trends indicate clearly that, from the point of view of the Opposition, this is a mistimed motion in the sense that the public are beginning to see that the policies of this Government which are long term, constructive and consistent are more valuable than the policies of the Opposition.  These policies are announced by their spokesman on Finance on a Saturday night and disavowed by the Leader of the Opposition on a Sunday night.  They are advocated by the Leader of the Opposition a week before a Government initiative is announced and then they are subtly changed when they are presented in the Dáil at the conclusion of the debate.  This type of metamorphosis in policy on the part of the Opposition is very speedy.  It would do credit to the great advances taking place in the area of bio-technology, the way one being can be transmuted into another.  This is the way Opposition policy is changed from day to day and from week to week depending on who is talking at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a speech I heard at the opening of a large industrial plant in Cork three weeks ago. The president of the US corporation explained why his company came here. For me it was the best evidence I have seen that the policies of the Government are working.  He said that his company wanted to come to Europe; they had a very wide choice but they came to Ireland for four reasons.  First, they were struck by the dramatic drop in inflation from 20 per cent to 5 per cent in a few years which, they felt was an indication of the commitment of the Government and people to make the country competitive; they were struck by the rapidly falling bank interest rates, and from their experience of talks with other Governments and their agencies they considered that our industrial development policy and our agencies were the best they had encountered.  Last, they commented on the young, well-educated and enthusiastic work force.</P>
      <P>If one of our Ministers had made that speech he would be accused of being political, but that was a man who had never been here before, who had no Irish background and who had made that speech on the facts his company had ascertained. He said, better than any Minister or Government spokesman, that with all our problems we are beginning to get things right.  As further evidence of the effectiveness of our policy, I would refer to the most recent CII publication, <i>The Economic Trend</i> which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current indications point to a <Col N="438" /> resumption of growth, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years.  Looking at the seasonally adjusted figures, the picture is quite encouraging and suggests that manufacturing is currently experiencing a more widespread growth, even though at a modest rate. Some of the traditional industries are showing growth.</P>
    <P>The report went on at length to name the industries that are showing growth, and it continued:</P>
    <P>In June employment in manufacturing fell by under 0.4 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with March, the lowest quarterly fall in growth in over three years.</P>
    <P>There is a cautionary note in that report about competitiveness &mdash; the Minister for Finance made that point last night.  There is no room for complacency.  We have an inflation rate of about 5½ per cent and naturally we regard it as an excellent achievement.  In Europe the Commission are talking about an average inflation rate next year of 3.9 per cent.  Therefore, unless we can maintain pressure on inflation our competitiveness will begin again to be eroded.  That is not monetarism, it is a fact of life if we are to continue to complete as we are beginning to do successfully.</P>
    <P>There are other indicators.  For the first time there has been a pickup in our domestic economy.  Retail sales are up overall, car and truck sales are up.  The effects of the changes in VAT rates and reductions in duties have shown up very dramatically in the sale of colour televisions, which are up 50 per cent, and videos, up 100 per cent.  So, the domestic economy which takes so long to respond to any stimulation, is beginning to show signs of recovery.</P>
    <P>That does not remove the problem that during this generation and the next unemployment will be our greatest single headache. It is easy to see from history that this is not a party political issue.  In the five and a half years from October 1979 to April 1985, unemployment figures have grown from just 80,000 to 228,000. <Col N="439" /> During that period alternative Governments were in power for two and a half years and three years, respectively.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a dreadful, difficult problem that will confront any Government here.  Because of the growth of our labour force, in addition to our other problems we would need to create 100,000 jobs by 1991 just to stand still, because that is the anticipated size of the growth in the labour force.  That is unique in the developed world.  If we want to get employment down to, say, 100,000 and make up for job losses we will need to create 40,000 jobs a year.  That will require ingenuity, innovation and determination on all fronts.  We will have to cut out ideological claptrap and concentrate on every front.  We must continue to reduce and control Government expenditure, reduce borrowing and reduce taxation.  We must not just talk about reducing taxation because the corollary must be to deal simultaneously with the other two.  The Government must get down the present level of borrowing.</P>
    <P>We must increase incentives to persuade investors to go into the manufacturing industry where jobs can be created.  We must encourage the private service sector to grow because there we can get new jobs.  We have always tended to assume that that would grow by itself. We must encourage private investment in infrastructure to get the Government out of some of that heavy involvement. We must speed up our oil exploration programme because that could give the spark the economy needs.  We must eliminate at least some of the disincentive to employment, and there are many.  We must get on with developing industries like food processing, and promote greater growth in tourism.  So there is no room for complacency, but the Government are moving in the right direction, are making clear progress.  The indications are all positive and we must build from that.</P>

      <P>Táim buíoch duit an cúig nóiméad seo a thabhairt dom. <Col N="440" /> Deputy Conveney has illustrated my reason for putting down an amendment. Unemployment is the greatest issue facing any Government, has been over a number of years and will be in the future. I commend the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for his enthusiasm and optimism but I must deflate that optimism some what by pointing to the words of Deputy Coveney.  I doubt if we accept even half of what the Minister said, but if we accepted it all about the turn about in the economy, our problem would not be solved.  Our unemployment rate will continue to increase throughout the next decade because of the increasing labour force, as surveys have shown.</P>
      <P>That is and will be our major problem, but if we could tackle the major problems leading up to the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the past four years why can we not do something of that nature on the greatest issue facing us now, unemployment? That is why I suggest that some forum be established to do that.</P>
      <P>I would not agree with Deputy Coveney that ideology is claptrap because if there is an ideology which dictates that a handful of people must control the cattle trade or the wool trade or the grain trade while what the rest of the people have to say is of no consequence we much change that sort of ideology. Ideologies are very real.  They are operating in this country but we must face up to the issues affecting people.  The need to base our industry on the production and processing or our own material of all kinds is becoming more widely accepted. That is the real wealth creating effort but why must we allow the Mallow Erin Foods plant to close when it was the only alternative for farmers now that the CAP is collapsing in Europe and meat and dairy production is no longer able to sustain all the farmers?  We should be going into the area of new products and in that way creating jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I say that if various parties, while not agreeing perhaps on every issue, on social policies or on health policies or on many other policies, could agree on industrial policy and on this very area of job creation we would be doing a <Col N="441" /> good day's work.  I think that is what the Minister is talking about though he may be speaking in terms that are different from those I would use.  Nevertheless, he is talking about creating new wealth and that is vital when we talk also of the creation of jobs.  The Minister referred to the current thinking regarding emptying factories rather than filling them with workers.  I suppose we will continue to have different ideas on policies but this is an issue of such great importance that something on the lines of what happened in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement should happen here also because we must get together and agree on a job creating policy.</P>

      <P>If many people here were to share the perception of <i>Building on Reality</i> that was portrayed in the House this evening we might very well end up like a ship at sea without its captain. No analysis of what the Government were supposed to do and of what they have done in their three years in office would support any of the optimism that has been expressed here this evening. I do not disagree with Ministers being optimistic if they are convinced that there is reason for optimism but the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism does not believe in what he says. Deputy Coveney quoted a man who, though not knowing anything about Ireland, made a lovely speech in Cork.  I can tell the Deputy that if that man did not have all the facts at his disposal, if he did not know enough about Ireland, he would not be putting his money into Cork in the first instance.  However, many more people of that kind are needed in Cork if the damage done by the Government is to be redressed.  The devastation that this Government have been responsible for in that area will require ten to 15 years of good Fianna Fáil Government to put right.  That is the length of time that would be required for us to build up the area again and to do the job the Government have failed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism invited us tonight to consider the marvellous job he <Col N="442" /> is doing.  Is there any chance that the Minister would make up his mind?  Does he believe in the National Development Corporation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Programme for Government a national development corporation was singled out as the one answer to the unemployment problem but in these last days of November and three years after the Government coming into office we have just concluded the Second Stage of the Bill setting up the corporation.  The Minister knows that the NDC will have no effect in terms of solving the problems we are told it will solve. The legislation was introduced merely to keep the Government hanging together for another six to nine months.  Eventually the Minister put his name to the Bill and under pressure allowed it to go forward.  However, the Government will not be long enough in office for the corporation to be put into operation.  But this is typical of what the Government are all about.  After three years in office they are talking about what they intend doing.  That is the average term for a Government here, though there was the exception of that time not so long ago when we had three general elections in 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would expect any Government, on looking back on what they had done, to say, &ldquo;This is what we said we would do when we were coming into office and here is what we have done.&rdquo;  That is the criterion by which they will be judged on the day of reckoning, on the day when they take to the streets to look for votes. We all remember what the Government <Col N="443" /> promised.  They said they would reverse the unemployment trend and put our finances in order, to mention but two aspects of their programme.  I shall not take time to go through the Programme for Government.  After 12 months in office the Government decided to produce that new bible known as <i>Building on Reality.</i> Apart from one figure in that document, it is off target in every respect. The Government might as well give the national plan a decent burial and forget about it.  It, too, was produced in an effort to hold the two parties together.</P>
    <P>One would not have believed that the final bible to be produced would be the CII.  The Minister gave the impression that the CII are the bible in terms of what is happening in the economy.  I wonder if anyone in the Government read the Central Bank reports.</P>

      <P>Who are in Government now?  I have here the latest report from the Central Bank.  The bank offers no signs of optimism of the kind the Government are trying to offer.  I wonder, too, whether anyone on the other side has read Coopers &amp; Lybrand's analysis of the economy.  What we have are a Government, not of performance, but of presentation, a presentation of nice marketing ideas by way of trying to con the people in regard to what is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What an insult it is to the PAYE sector and to taxpayers generally for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to say that the level of taxation is reduced this year.  I would refer those Ministers to an article written recently by that good economic journalist, Paul Tansey, though it is not necessary to quote him to show how bad matters are.  One need only speak with any wage earner to know whether the level of taxation has been reduced.  His answer will be in terms of hard cash.  There is no point in the Government indulging in fancy statistics, <Col N="444" /> percentages of GNP and so on, though the figures in that regard, too, are wrong despite the picture the Government are trying to portray.  The people opposite knew what the problems were on coming into Government.  They had been in Government only 12 months earlier. They presented a programme but they have failed dismally in every aspect.  They will pay dearly for that failure whenever they take their courage in their hands and go before the electorate.</P>
    <P>Both the Ministers to whom I referred endeavoured to concentrate on four areas.  The first of these was what they referred to as the rapid reduction in inflation, a mighty achievement, they say. In the knowledge that members of this Government like to reminisce, let us consider inflation figures for some previous years.  Between November 1981 and November 1982 inflation fell by 10 percentage points while the reduction from November 1982 to November 1983 &mdash; during which time the Coalition were in office &mdash; was of the order of two percentage points.  During the period November 1983 to November 1984 inflation fell by 3½ percentage points and my best estimate &mdash; and I am being generous &mdash; is that the decrease will be of the order of about 1 per cent from 1984 to 1985.  That is against a background of the lowest inflation in the EC in the past 15 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that irrespective of what Government are in power, we can only control 50 per cent of inflation because of our open economy.  Outside influences play a major part.  In the three years this Government have been in power, they have done slightly more than half as well as we did up to November 1982.  We went out of Government on 14 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us talk about controlling expenditure. I refer the House to the last year we were in Government, 1982.  Was Government expenditure controlled in that year?  The record will show that it was.  Have this Government controlled it <Col N="445" /> since?  In their Programme for Government they set out to control current expenditure but they have not done so because real expenditure on the current side has continued to grow.  In 1982 the current budget deficit was £989 million; this year this Government will establish a record when the current budget deficit will be more than £1,300 million and, on 15 November, it stood at £1,350 million. The Taoiseach likes to talk about percentages, and that is the highest percentage of GNP ever recorded in the history of this country.</P>
    <P>This Government will leave power having made records.  This Minister, Deputy Bruton, will hold the record for the largest increase in the numbers unemployed; the Minister for Finance, whenever he decides to move over or the Taoiseach decides to move him, will have earned another place in the history books.  He will be the Minister who borrowed most but has the least to show for it.  This Government will go out of office with these two fine records which deal with the issues on which they came into power in December 1982.  If they are proud of that, then they should take their courage in their hands and run to the electorate.  They will get the real answer there.</P>
    <P>I will dismiss what the Minister had to say here this evening, because he did not even mention the NDC.  He tried to tell the taxpayers that the burden of taxation was no longer there and he said the Opposition claimed that the Government policy was to close down State companies. Last night the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, said we were insulting the intelligence of the people by even suggesting that the financial and fiscal policies pursued by this Government contributed to unemployment.  I will tell him in a few words how their policies have contributed to massive unemployment.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into power they knew what the problems were, but what solutions did they apply? They ran away from making the decisions they had convinced the public they would make and turned to the softer option <Col N="446" /> without calculating how that would damage the economy and traditional industries.  They increased taxation to horrific levels.  VAT is the highest ever, 35 per cent.  At that time we told them they were wrong.  We told them they would lose business to the North, and that they would destroy consumer spending, but still they increased personal taxation to a level which has created real problems for the people who are trying to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at recent statements from the banks will see that personal borrowers are becoming bad risks because the Minister has not left them enough to meet their commitments, whether to children at school, the family budget or buying the necessaries of life. The Minister for Finance has taken so much money by way of taxation, directly or indirectly, that he has crushed consumer spending and put thousands of people on the unemployment list.  That is the reality.  Anybody who knows anything about running an economy knows that when consumer spending is crushed, massive unemployment will result.  That is what has happened here.</P>
    <P>Companies have gone into liquidation and receivership.  This Government will hold another record, which I had forgotten up to now.  During their term in office there have been more liquidations, more factory closures and more people on the dole queues than ever before in our history. That is a fine record to try to boast about.  This Government will go on trying to mislead the public and use every marketing device to tell them they are doing a decent job.  The people were fooled the last time, but never again.</P>
    <P>We heard about the great things this Government were going to do for our natural resources and the development of the food industry.  When they came into office they immediately set up a task force of junior Ministers to look into the food industry.  I do not know if they are abroad all the time, but they have not appeared on the horizon for the past three years with a plan to set up a food industry.  As Deputy Mac Giolla said, this Government are closing down the last <Col N="447" /> food processing industry in the mid-Cork region.  That industry has been part of the economic makeup of the region.</P>
    <P>The farmers in the region grow vegetables for this processing plant and all the necessary ingredients are there on which to build a food industry and, yet the Government are closing that plant.  I looked at <i>Building on Reality</i> to see what the Government intended to do about the food industry, but there were only a few lines which said that the Government were going to appoint a marketing consultant. I do not want to get uptight about all these consultants and task forces that are to be employed and the committees that were being set up, but in my view that was a recipe for doing nothing.  This Government have nothing to show for three wasted years in power.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, spoke about the fire brigade package which he introduced to try to build up the morale of Government backbenchers.  He said that as long as he was Minister he had not heard one constructive idea from this side of the House.  For two and a half years we preached that the Government policy in the area of building and construction would lead to more unemployment. He is the man who sat here and tried to sell the magnificent budget of last February, who tried to convince the people in a television programme that this was an imaginative budget, a new breakthrough and that all the fancy ideas would be good for all, but when the PAYE taxpayers got their pay packets in April and May they found out the truth.</P>
    <P>I said to the Minister on that television programme that, so far as the building and construction industry were concerned, the Government had put the final nail in their coffin by increasing the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  He said that was nonsense because it did not work that way.  The reality is there to be seen.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister for Finance were more interested in getting the idea across that this was a marvellous innovative budget.  Is it any wonder people are crying out for a new Minister for Finance because they <Col N="448" /> say nobody could be worse than the present Minister?</P>
    <P>There is nothing worse than technocrats trying to bring in fancy schemes, people who have no idea what the repercussions of their decisions will be.  All I can say to the technocrats on the opposite benches tonight is that, in my view, not one of them could make a living running a sweet shop on a corner in Pearse Street, never mind being able to manage the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>We have talked about unemployment figures.  This Government would like to ignore the 40,000 people who have had to emigrate. In the future we will need people who are talented in the areas of science and technology.  It is a sad reflection on us that having spent so much scarce taxpayers' money on educating people in science and technology they are now emigrating.  At least 700 of the brightest graduates in the area of science and technology alone have gone abroad in the last 12 months.  This emigration is occurring because of the punitive taxation system and because the Government cannot reward the people who would be the leaders in industry.  Well educated people know that they can command high salaries abroad and that they will be remunerated for their work.  The Government have not recognised that fact.  These people are gone, though we will badly need them when we return to power, to try to rebuild the economy.  If the Government do not get out of office fast, there will not be much to rebuild because the foundations will be gone.</P>
    <P>We put forward ideas in relation to the building and construction industry because for every £ invested in the construction industry, 90 pence keeps spinning around in the economy.  That makes good economic sense.  The Government have always been the biggest investor in the building industry and 90 pence of the money invested goes round in the national economy.  Anybody who says that that is bad for the national economy must have a hole in his head.  I do not accept the logic of the technocrats of this Government who say it is good policy <Col N="449" /> to borrow money to pay people to do nothing while there is so much work to be done, whether it is filling potholes, building new roads, houses or the various areas of infrastructure.  If the Government hang on to the old-fashioned idea that it is good business to borrow money to pay people to do nothing, things will remain static.  Fewer prople will have to pay more and more tax to pay people on the dole.  Our first criterion must be to get people back to work so that more money will be paid into the Exchequer. That is why we stand over our commitment to the building and construction industry, as the quickest response to the national unemployment crisis.  For two and a half years we have preached that doctrine.  We are glad of the conversion by some of the Government speakers, even if it came on the road to Damascus.</P>
    <P>In their great package produced a few months ago they finally recognised that the building and construction industry could do with a little injection.  We welcome that injection.  I would refer both Ministers, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Dukes, to an article in this evening's <i>Evening Press</i> that shows that it is clear from a survey done for the Institute of Chartered Surveyors that not alone will that package not redress the damage done by the budget by raising VAT, but that already that VAT increase has contributed to the loss of an additional 1,200 jobs in the industry and that next year it will cost 3,300 jobs.  I do not have time to go into the article but I hope the Deputies opposite will read it.  That is the reality.</P>

It is now the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to do. We are glad of their conversion.  We should be proud to develop and renew the capital city.  We should be proud of <Col N="450" /> our capital city and we should not see it falling into ruin.  When the proposition for inner city development came from this side of the House, the Government poured cold water on it &mdash; and they say we lack ideas.  For two years I told the present Minister that one of the greatest weaknesses in industry was lack of equity capital.  I told the Government, on two successive budgets, that the way they were handling the venture capital system, or the business expansion scheme, would not work.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  So few applicants have taken up the scheme that it is clear that it has been a total disaster.</P>
      <P>When the Government went overboard in trying to plug every loophole, they left it inoperable.  People could invest their money, not get the tax relief, and not get their money back.  That is a double edged risk that a person with money to invest would not be prepared to take.  We need incentives to invest and incentives to work.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, referred to our non-competitiveness and the wage rate scheme.  I employ people.  The problem is not how much is paid, but the level of productivity one gets for what one pays.  A proper comparison between here and Germany for instance will show that our wage rates with the productivity we get is only 55 per cent of the German rate.  Our productivity is way behind.  Our problems are also related to taxation.  Deputy Haughey outlined what he believed to be the first prerequisite to get the economy moving &mdash; a reduction in the levels of taxation.  We do not advocate the spending of money but the Government have brought the economy to the depths and there must be selective investment and taxation reduction to get the economy out of the depths and on the road again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick and tired listening to the Government speakers saying that we are turning the corner.  In the first issue of <i>The Democrat</i> by the Fine Gael Party in May 1983 there was the banner headline &ldquo;Economy, up, up and away&rdquo;.  I repeatedly heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, say &ldquo;We have turned the corner&rdquo;.  I heard the Taoiseach <Col N="451" /> say many times &ldquo;We have turned the corner&rdquo;.  We have turned the corner so often that we have gone the full circle and we are meeting ourselves on the way back.  They talked about the light at the end of the tunnel.  The Taoiseach should make sure that it is not a train at the end of the tunnel which he sees.  That is the light which the Taoiseach sees.  There is not a light at the end of the tunnel.  The facts do not support the view that they tried to put forward again tonight.  This is reflected in the Central Bank report and in the Coopers and Lybrand report. What the CII are saying is that productivity has tailed off, our exports have tailed off, and not increased, which was the impression which the Government tried to give here tonight.  What really happened is that the large investment which came here in the Fianna Fáil years of Government kept the economy going for the last number of years, but investment failed dramatically in 1983 and there was little difference in 1984.  Without investment we cannot have jobs. Investment today means jobs tomorrow. Until we can recognise that first of all to get investment you must be able to reward that investment and not witness the corporate migration we had across to the States to get a reward for investment, and secondly until we recognise that the workers who do the work also have to be rewarded for their work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputies on the far side last night and tonight have attempted to discredit the Government's performance and in doing so have made a number of unsubstantiated and totally unfounded allegations about recent economic developments.  I do not share their obvious desire to reduce the tone of the debate to a squabble about numbers and statistics.  The issues at stake are far too serious.  However, I feel obliged to put the record straight by pointing out just how wide of the mark those Deputies have been.  It would take all night to complete the job but, in view of the limited time at my disposal, I will have to concentrate on the bigger issues, such as inflation, interest rates and output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Facts are stubborn things.  Let me say my piece now. The Deputy took some of my five minutes.  Let us be practical with one another.  Deputy Haughey alleged last night that the improvement on the inflation front is no more than a reflection of international development.  This is utter nonsense.  At the end of 1981 inflation here was running at an annual rate of 23 per cent.  These are facts and they are stubborn things.  That was about double the rate which prevailed in the UK and the EC at that time.  Today the picture is <Col N="453" /> transformed.  The latest figures show that inflation is down to 5.5 per cent which is in line with the EC average and below the UK rate.  Furthermore, evidence that our inflation performance is not simply a reflection of international trends comes from the comparison of inflation rates here and in the wider group of 24 main industrial economies.</P>
      <P>In 1981 we were among a small group of countries which were at the bottom of the league in that regard &mdash; Iceland, Turkey and Greece.  Since then we have pulled clear of the danger zone and are situated comfortably at the middle table ahead of such industrial powers as Sweden, Italy, Spain, Australia and, of course, the UK.  The inflation rate here has been cut to just a quarter of the rate which prevailed four years ago.  These simple facts and figures demonstrate what is necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey also had the gall last night to suggest that the performance of the manufacturing industry has not been up to scratch.  The facts are as follows. Over the last three years manufacturing output has risen in real terms by nearly 30 per cent and by the end of this year we should be on schedule with the targets set in the national plan.  Certainly the growth of output this year may be somewhat less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of glib, unhelpful comments have been made about the special employment and training schemes introduced by the Government. Would the Opposition prefer that we had done nothing for the over 50,000 young people who participated in youth employment levy funded schemes in each of the past two years?  Are they saying that the 10,000 or so who have shown commendable initiative in starting their own businesses under the enterprise allowance scheme would have been better off to remain on the dole?  They seem to imply that the people in the social employment scheme should have been condemned to an even longer period of joblessness.  We admit that on their own special measures can never be sufficient, but we think we have made commendable efforts in that area.  Even though some of my time was taken I am prepared to submit to the Chair.  If I had time I would go on and deal with much more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to offer the Minister of State some time, but having regard to the short time available to me perhaps I had better use it.  I put down this motion on behalf of Fianna Fáil about two years ago, in October 1983.  We decided at that point that since it was only nine months after they took up responsibility it was only fair to give the Government an opportunity to honour the commitments they made on coming into office.  The signs were already very worrying; the rends were alarming; but we held back and did not proceed with this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this past year we contemplated putting it down again or proceeding with it.  Then the Government came up with a new target and plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> Again we felt, as a responsible Opposition, that we should wait and see if even that belated action, which obviously we expressed no confidence in, might turn the economy around and provide encouragement, incentive, opportunity and hope, and we held back again.  We have decided after over two years that it is time that we brought this motion before <Col N="455" /> the House to demonstrate exactly the extent of the failure of this Government.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Government, one should rely not on what we say but rather on what they say themselves.  The Joint Programme for Government contained four main planks of Government policy: first to eliminate the current budget deficit in four years, second to reduce the proportion of tax paid by PAYE, third to reduce the level of our borrowing, and fourth, to halt the alarming increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>I want to deal first with the budget deficit.  We start with chapter 1, the budget statement of the Minister for Finance in 1983.  He said in his statement that the reductions in the levels of both the current deficit and the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement were substantial. He was then presuming that the target he set was already achieved, and the target he set in that year was £997 million or 6.75 per cent of GNP.  The statement of the target was already the achievement, having regard to his assertion that this is a substantial level of reduction in the budget deficit.  He went on to say in the next breath, as if this Government were going to be consistent and reliable, and I quote from the official Report of 9 February 1983, column 1515, volume 339:</P>
    <P>As the experience of recent years has amply shown, the mere setting of targets, and the introduction of proposals to achieve these targets, are not in themselves any guarantee that the targets will be reached.  The Government are strongly committed to avoiding any major overrun this year.</P>
    <P>Now we were entering into a new phase of credibility.  We were going to ensure that the targets set would be achieved. No longer would there be anything other than determination, confidence and consistency in Government.  What was the result?  The budget of 1985 &mdash; I will skip the intervening ones &mdash; gives the actual story.  The Minister for Finance at the beginning of his statement on that actual story said the estimated current deficit <Col N="456" /> was £1,234 million, 7.9 per cent of GNP. That amounted to an increase of almost £400 million or 1 per cent of GNP over and above the proud boast of achievement two years earlier.  However, that does not tell the full story because the Minister acknowledged in the House last week that the current budget deficit at the end of this year will be 8½ per cent, or of the order of £1,350 million.  Therefore, that proud assertion, that statement of fact that the current budget deficit was now being substantially reduced, can be seen for what it was, totally and utterly misleading.  We now have the position that even with the adjustment, as it was called within the framework of the plan, the Government now propose, instead of eliminating the budget deficit by 1987, to reduce it to 5 per cent by that year. Within six to eight months of that assertion we know full well that there is no prospect in the world of the target in <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; a strange title for a document so totally based on unreality &mdash; being achieved in 1987.  Even if that was adhered to that would involve the addition of an extra £2 billion per year to our national debt.</P>
    <P>Let us now look at the position of the national debt, the second matter the Government said they would tackle in their determination to correct our finances.  At the end of 1982 when the Coalition took office the total State debt was £12.8 billion, an admittedly sizeable and very significant sum, but within three years under the Coalition it has increased by 60 per cent to £20.5 billion by the end of this year.  In those three years we have succeeded in raising the State borrowing to two-thirds of what was borrowed since the foundation of the State and we are told that we can rely on the determination and credibility of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that within that huge growth in borrowing one of the most alarming indications is that two-thirds of present borrowing is to finance current expenditure.  They are not my figures but facts.  Only one-third is going for investment in the capital programme. We have borrowing growing to a totally unsustainable level and that has made <Col N="457" /> us the laughing stock of the democratic world, particularly in so far as the Government presented themselves as being the ones who would correct those matters.  It now takes more than total income tax to service the public debt and if, as is now clear, the budget deficit is over-running I wonder what the scenario will be next year.  I believe the total income tax will not go anywhere near paying the service on the public debt.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with taxation and the fact that we were told that the Government would reduce the tax element paid by the PAYE sector.  When the Coalition came to office in 1982 the total tax here was £4 billion.  After three years that figure has increased by 66 per cent to £6 billion at the end of the year. That is the measure of the Government's success in reducing the overall level of taxation.  In considering those figures we should have regard to the concern expressed by the Coalition for the PAYE sector.  In 1982, 35 per cent of the total tax, which was a little more than 45 per cent of what we are paying now, on the basis of figures supplied by the Minister, was paid by income tax payers.  With the total tax now increased by 66 per cent the income tax payers now pay 38 per cent and we are being told that we are moving towards reducing total tax and within that bringing about a level of equity in terms particularly of the PAYE sector.  The estimate for this year is that the income tax element of total taxation will amount to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>We hardly need to state the obvious to the people in regard to unemployment but I should like to make one point in the time available to me.  Unemployment has grown to an average of 230,000 this year. The Minister for Social Welfare will within a week or two be coming to the House to move a Supplementary Estimate for not less than £30 million for unemployment benefits and assistance because he acknowledged to me at the beginning of the year that if we had an average of 230,000 people unemployed throughout the year an extra £31 million would be required to fund unemployment benefits and assistance.  That is a measure <Col N="458" /> of the total disarray in the public finances. It can be seen more dramatically, and sadly, outside the House in the total frustration, disillusionment and despair of our people.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the question of investment.  In November 1982 inflation was 12.3 per cent and the AA rate for normal commercial borrowing was 15 per cent, leaving a real interest rate of 2½ per cent.  Today inflation, according to the Minister, is 5½ per cent and the AA rate is now 12 to 12½ per cent, leaving a real interest rate for commercial borrowers of 6 per cent to 7 per cent.  Is it not clear that interest rates of that level are ensuring that the level of investment in our economy has dropped to an all time low?  We would need an annual investment of £1,000 million, in the private sector, to sustain even current levels of manufacturing growth, and they are not something that anybody wants to boast about.  At present only half of that amount is being invested with the result that we can look forward to a lower level of manufacturing activity next year than we experienced in the last two years.  If we were to see any improvement in the position we would require at least £300 million to be raised per annum for private investment in industry.  Instead we have a figure of £80 million being raised on the stock exchange.  What is happening on the stock exchange?  More than 90 per cent of the turnover there relates to Government gilts.  The Government have swallowed up any investment funds that should be available for real enterprise in the economy.  The consequence is that by doing that they are driving up domestic interest rates to a level that is totally out of line with the international level.</P>
    <P>We find, unfortunately, that instead of the enterprising and the risk-takers being rewarded or encouraged people are going for the safe havens if they are not already shunting their money out of the country. They are the direct consequences of the Government's policy on taxation, particularly their most ineffective attempts to bring an element of discipline into our current finances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> In this area we always attracted investment but we are now driving out our own. More than £1,000 million of the profits of companies that set up here as a consequence of policies we introduced for high technology and pharmaceutical companies, are being repatriated abroad because the companies recognise that this is not the place to reinvest in profitable activities.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers' money by way of grants is being leaked at an alarming rate and we are not able to sustain any level of continuing activity through the re-investment programme, either domestically or externally.  I want to mention not my judgment or that of anyone else but that of the EC in their annual report for this year.  They said:</P>
    <P>Fiscal adjustment has effectively marked time for the past two years so that the size of the national debt continues to grow by further substantial annual increments and may, indeed, approach 120% of GNP.</P>
    <P>Since that report, published a few months ago, it will have increased to 135 per cent of GNP.  They said that the targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> were the very minimum that could be contemplated.  Now we know that those targets will be <Col N="460" /> nowhere near realised.  The EC has criticised us sharply.  The OECD has placed us at the top of the international taxation league.  The Central Bank have told us that we will be banqueting on borrowing and have warned us that this kind of borrowing cannot be sustained, particularly having regard to the fact that it is not going for productive enterprise in our economy.</P>
    <P>Most important of all is the judgment of the people, and that really counts. They know that this Government, who presented themselves as a Government of discipline and responsibility, have turned out to be quite the opposite, a Government of no discipline.  They certainly have turned out to be a Government who have killed enterprise and have ensured that our young people and those with the ability to lift this country out of its present position &mdash; please God, sooner rather than later &mdash; look to the day when they will have a Government again who will know what the real job of Government is &mdash; to create a climate in which the efforts of all will be rewarded and the failures that we have witnessed in the last three years will be history.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure: Control of Capital Projects.</P>
      <P>This report arose from public concern about major cost overruns on public construction contracts and the committee decided that an urgent review should be undertaken of the extent to which public sector contracts were monitored and controlled at present and also to examine two projects in which there had been major overruns, namely, the Howth harbour development scheme and the Department of Justice prison building programme.</P>
      <P>Because of the committee's concern about the apparent lack of control of expenditure on public capital projects it was decided to appoint the first sub-committee to examine this important area and in as much depth as was possible, given the resources available and within a very limited time scale.  The sub-committee, which met for the first time on 31 October 1984 consisted of four members &mdash; Deputies Richard Bruton, Joe Doyle and Noel Treacy, with myself appointed to act as chairman of the sub-committee.</P>
      <P>The sub-committee met on 12 occasions and heard evidence from officials of the Departments of Finance, Fisheries and Forestry, Justice and also the Office of Public Works.  Submissions were received from the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors in the Republic of Ireland and I want to take this opportunity to thank all those people who attended our hearings or sent us written submissions.  It goes without saying that, but for their co-operation and help, we would not have been able to complete our work.</P>
      <P>Once the sub-committee members identified the areas to be examined we structured our examination along the following lines: firstly, the sub-committee looked at the historical background, including the 1983 report of the working group on cost overruns on public construction contracts; secondly, we examined the present system of control of capital expenditure operated by the Department of Finance and at Departmental level generally; thirdly, we examined in detail the background to the cost overruns on the Howth harbour development scheme; fourthly, the sub-committee reviewed the Department of Justice prison building programme which had resulted in large-scale professional fees being paid in the case of some projects which did not get off the ground and finally, we looked at the role of the Office of Public Works and the extent to which that office acted as principal and agent in the case of a number of capital projects.</P>
      <P>Other speakers this evening will describe in some detail the progress and results of the main committee's review.  I propose to outline the sub-committee's main findings which formed the nucleus of the report adopted by the Committee on Public Expenditure last July and which is the subject of the present debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most vital and interesting documents before the committee was the report of the working group on cost overruns on public construction contracts which reported in 1983.  That report <Col N="467" /> detailed the scope of the problem of cost overruns on capital projects and estimated that they averaged at least 7½ to 12½ per cent which was equivalent to about £60 million to £100 million in 1982. The working group were of the view that substantial savings of up to £60 million could be made if capital cost-overruns could be avoided.</P>
    <P>The working group's brief was to consider what measures might be taken to avoid non-viable investment decisions and to reduce the increase in costs on public contracts during construction.  The group also looked into consultants' costs, particularly in relation to fees.</P>
    <P>There were 17 important recommendations in the 1983 report which were aimed at making the appraisal and execution of capital projects more effective. Though we know that the Department of Finance have tightened up controls generally in this area we have to say that, in the important area of introducing changes in the system of payment of fees to consultants, there has been no change made to date, so far as the committee are aware.  This aspect will, no doubt, be referred to by other members of the committee during the debate.  To sum up, the committee were disappointed with the lack of progress on the implementation of the working group's report and this was one of the reasons why we decided to review what action was being taken to control public expenditure.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to put the scale of the problem in context.  The Public Capital Programme amounted to £1,259 million in 1980.  In 1985 the total Public Capital Programme is estimated at £1,800 million.  This is financed by Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources of £1,066 million with Exchequer borrowing funding the balance.  The size of capital expenditure this year, representing a fifth of total public expenditure, means that every effort must be made to ensure that there is value for money in the case of every £ spent on capital projects.  I will now refer to systems in operation at present for control of expenditure in that <Col N="468" /> area.  The present controls were referred to in paragraph 3 of the report.</P>
    <P>The committee were informed that the Department of Finance issued a comprehensive circular, known as 1/83, which set down guidelines for the appraisal, control and execution of public capital projects. The purpose of that circular was to ensure a systematic approach to capital project planning and implementation throughout the public sector.  It encouraged the review of and improvement of planning and control procedures already in operation as well as providing guidelines for Departments and agencies in introducing formal procedures where none previously existed.</P>
    <P>We asked the Department of Finance to send the committee a formal memorandum on follow up action taken since the publication of circular 1/83.  The response to our request by the Department of Finance is referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the committee's report and the memorandum itself is summarised at appendix 7 of the report.</P>
    <P>The overall conclusion the committee reached in the area of centralised or departmental control was that, despite the new guidelines, not all Departments were adhering to the Department of Finance control systems &mdash; in essence there seemed to be an acceptance that Departments may be allowed some discretion on the extent to which capital projects may be controlled.  This we would find unacceptable and the committee have not only drawn attention to this weakness in the present system but have specifically included reference to it in the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>We hope that the Minister for Finance will examine the systems in operation within his Department for the control of capital expenditure and that action will be taken to ensure that any discretion or loopholes that exist at present will be dealt with so that unwarranted leaks of scarce Exchequer resources on the capital side can be stopped by immediate remedial action.</P>
    <P>The initial objective of the committee's inquiry was to examine the steps which <Col N="469" /> had led to a reported increase on the Howth harbour development scheme from an estimated £3.5 million to £12 million.  Following the hearing of evidence from Department of Fisheries and Forestry officials towards the end of 1984 the committee decided that an in-depth inquiry should be made.  The review was included in the sub-committee's terms of reference as part of the general inquiry into the control of capital projects.</P>
    <P>Given the technical nature of the Howth harbour project the committee decided to engage the services of Mr. John Ballance, architect and engineer, as consultant to assist in that particular aspect of the report.  I would like at this stage to pay tribute on behalf of the sub-committee and the committee to Mr. Ballance for the excellent work he undertook on our behalf.  Apart from officials of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the sub-committee heard evidence from Mr. P. McCabe, Commissioner of Public Works, and his advisers.  Again, I would like to thank the officials involved who were very forthcoming and helpful in giving evidence.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Howth harbour scheme inquiry revealed disturbing evidence of lack of proper controls which led to the final cost of the project being four times the original tender price.  Our report sets out the various factors which led to the huge cost overrun.  Perhaps I could summarise what happened as follows: the Department changed their plans radically after going to tender; despite the fact that two independent borehole investigations in Howth harbour showed discrepancies, the Office of Public Works went ahead with excavations and much greater quantities of rock were found than anticipated, costing an estimated £1.241 million compared with a tender price of £0.243 million; additional works cost £1.69 million; effects of a price variation clause, £2.25 million; a syncrolift £0.91 million; and other works £0.56 million; the committee were gravely concerned at the lack of control on the Howth harbour development scheme and the lack of action in the Department of Fisheries and the Office <Col N="470" /> of Public Works when the costs began to get out of control.  The consultant's report, which is included in our report, shows clearly the evolution of the project and how the original tender price rose from just over £3½ million to almost £12 million.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year the committee became aware that, in the case of a number of major capital projects for the prison service, considerable expenditure had been incurred on professional fees. The buildings and installations were designed as commissioned by the Department of Justice.  The design work had reached an advanced stage before it was decided by the Department that the projects would have to be redesigned.  This was to secure economies of cost by modifying the requirements originally planned. I should mention here that in one case the redesign was proceeded with even though the Department of Finance had refused to sanction expenditure on the site development works for the project.</P>
    <P>Because of their concern, the committee decided to follow up the initial inquiries by seeking written material from the Department of Justice and subsequently by hearing evidence.  Following a series of meetings the committee found the following:</P>
    <P> (1)  Four prison building projects were involved, two in Wheatfield, Dublin, and one each in Cork and Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>(2)  Total fees of almost £13 million were payable.</P>
    <P>(3)  During 1982 the Department of Justice decided to modify the prison designs to increase the accommodation while reducing unit costs. </P>
    <P>The committee were seriously concerned at the fees that had been paid for design work on prisons when work had actually commenced on only one site.  For that reason the sub-committee were given the task of examining the other aspects of capital expenditure to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee set out to establish: (a) why very considerable fees were paid; <Col N="471" /> (b) what caused the delay in getting work off the ground and, (c), what information &mdash; such as projections of prison population &mdash; was used by management in the Department of Justice in deciding on the original designs and the subsequent redesigns of the new prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee found no clear evidence as to why designs on four separate prison building projects were initiated in 1979.  The committee could not accept the reasons advanced by the Department of Justice for deciding on abandoning original designs and commissioning four new designs and questioned why the projects were not cost effective in the original design.</P>
    <P>This particular case graphically illustrated for us the level of consultants' fees that must be paid under existing agreements, whereby the greater proportion is paid before construction work gets underway.  The committee regard the present fee system as inequitable and are recommending that this situation should be altered immediately.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that we found this particular case difficult to comprehend in terms of how the prison building programme got out of hand.  Questions must be asked as to why certain decisions were taken and subsequently changed, the result of which added to the overall cost to the Exchequer.  These and other aspects will, I am sure, be covered in speeches by other colleagues on the Committee on Public Expenditure.  One other disturbing aspect was the refusal of the Minister to clarify a number of issues. This added to the confusion in the minds of members of the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>It would be an understatement to say that the committee were unhappy with the role of the Office of Public Works in relation to capital projects generally. They might have assumed that in the case of the prison building programme the Department of Justice, if not aware already, would have been alerted by the Office of Public Works to the fact that delays and redesigns would involve greatly increased expenditure.  As stated <Col N="472" /> in our report, the Office of Public Works must, in their capacity as professional-technical adviser to Government Departments, assume responsibility for warning client Departments of the financial and other consequences of modifying or amending designs on public construction projects.  Our recommendations define how such problems can and must be avoided in future and how the Office of Public Works can improve their performance in this area.</P>
    <P>The committee were particularly concerned about the payment of fees to professional consultants acting on behalf of client Departments and offices.  I should mention here that consultants' fees based on a percentage of total cost were last fixed by the National Prices Commission in June 1975, though we understand the Minister for Finance is now reviewing this whole area.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee of four members, as I said before, reported to the main committee and their report and recommendations were fully endorsed.  The report before the House, with minor amendments, represents the work undertaken by our sub-committee and I am happy to have been associated with them from the outset.</P>
    <P>To sum up, in their review of capital projects, the Committee concluded that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The guidelines laid down in the Department of Finance Circular 1/83 left an undue level of discretion to Departments, offices and State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The guidelines had not been universally adopted by all agencies.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Approval and/or sanction &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; by the Department of Finance is used from time to time.  There is a need for clarification on the contractual or other commitment involved in such a practice.  If it implies that public expenditure is committed in the absence of detailed project appraisal and evaluation, then this approach should be changed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;On the basis of the evidence heard in the case of (a) the Department of Finance Circular 1/83, (b) the Howth <Col N="473" /> harbour development scheme and (c) the Department of Justice prison building programme, the committee are convinced that radical changes are required in the management and control of capital projects if major cost overruns are to be avoided in future.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Office of Public Works need to improve their present approach to project management and this will occur only if there is a commitment by their management to introduce a system of tighter technical and administrative control.  One of the main problem areas identified by the committee lay in the rather passive role adopted by the Office of Public Works in their relationship with client Departments.  The office should act with more decisiveness and authority and should refuse to accept projects on behalf of any Department or office who do not conform to standards laid down by them, particularly in relation to briefing, monitoring and control systems.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The present system of fee payments to consultants must be changed immediately if the Exchequer is to eliminate or greatly reduce the excessive sums that have been paid on public capital projects.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The present contract system in relation to capital projects, has in many cases operated to the detriment of the Exchequer, that is, contracts which are not on a fixed price basis are, the committee believe, open to abuse by virtue of contingency and other additional costs being added in subsequently.</P>
    <P>There are 11 recommendations in the committee's report.  If time allowed I could read them all into the record but I will refer only to the more important ones as I see them here.  The recommendations are as follows: (1) Departments or offices and the relevant State-sponsored bodies must improve present systems of briefing, monitoring and controlling of public expenditure on capital projects so that cost overruns will be eliminated; (2) <Col N="474" /> Fixed price tenders should be sought in all cases of contracts of shorter duration than two years; (3) Project proposals should be drawn up on the basis of estimated total costs, that is allowing for inflation, interest, contingencies etc. rather than where only current costs are shown.  The system of fee payments for consultants must be immediately amended as follows: (i) Fees should be paid in two moieties, (a) related to the cost of the project at tender stage, and (b) the smaller portion related to the final cost of the completed project; (ii) Fees should be negotiable; (iii) In the case of repetitive projects fees should not be on a percentage basis but at a reduced rate; (iv) In general, fees should be open to price competition; (v) Under no circumstances should fees be fixed as a percentage of the final cost of a project.</P>
    <P>Reporting systems between the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works and client Departments/offices and State-sponsored bodies must be improved.  Better planning, regular reporting and early warning systems should ensure that (a), the most cost effective schemes are undertaken, (b) delays will be avoided and (c), cost overruns will not occur.</P>
    <P>A small technical advisory unit should be set up immediately in the Department of Finance reporting direct to the Second Secretary, Public Expenditure Division. This unit, which would be small, consisting of, say, a construction economist and an experienced architect/engineer, would bridge serious gaps that exist at the moment.  The function of such a proposed technical unit would be to provide the Minister for Finance with professional advice on the Public Capital Programme and which, the committee believe, is essential if the PCP is to be monitored and controlled adequately.  This unit would liaise with the OPW on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Specific responsibility and accountability for capital projects and their budgets should be assigned to individual management teams appointed within the Department which should liaise with <Col N="475" /> OPW or outside consultants.  The committee, while recognising the constitutional and statutory position of Ministers and Accounting Officers, feel that no real progress can be made in the elimination of excess expenditure unless individuals are assigned responsibility and are held accountable on a personal basis.</P>
    <P>I believe the committee's report to be one of the most important to be laid before the Dáil to date.  I am confident that the Minister and his officials will study it in detail and act on the reasonable and basic recommendations contained in it.  The implementation of the recommendations will result in an improvement in the planning and execution of projects under the Public Capital Programme.  It also points the way towards significant savings, more cost effective use of taxpayers' money and ultimately a reduction in our borrowing requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot improve on Deputy Fitzgerald's review of the report. The committee's findings can be summed up very simply.  In the case of Howth harbour, we found that in real terms it had an overrun of 66 per cent on what it should have cost.  In the case of the prisons programme, we have spent more than £8 million on consultants' fees and for that money we have eight sets of prison designs but only one site has been entered.  What is important about those findings is not just the individual examples but the committee's conviction that they are not isolated problems.  In recent times we can recall the problems that occurred in the case of the IIRS &ldquo;A&rdquo; building; we can recall the problem in the case of the Bord Iascaigh Mhara offices, the delay in moving into them; the Office of Public Works fit outs and the Beaumont Hospital problem where an expensive building is still unoccupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are numerous cases in respect of which capital programmes have come badly unstuck for the Government and substantial overruns were incurred.  We looked at individual cases and we found, disturbingly, that basic mistakes were <Col N="476" /> being made that should never have occurred.  For example, in the case of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Howth harbour, no basic economic feasibility studies were done and the return on the money to be invested was very hazy in the minds of the project sponsors.</P>
    <P>The most basic idea that anyone undertaking a home improvement would observe is not to change your plans once you have the builder on site.  That error was made in the case of Howth harbour. Entirely unrealistic contingency provisions were made in that case.  Any prudent person would have put in a reasonable expectation that contingencies would have to be provided for.  As we know to our cost, enormous overruns were encountered when they hit rock in Howth, but the contingency put in was 4 per cent, far below what would be standard in that type of project, admitted by all to be uncertain in regard to costings and likely to go wrong.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental problem we found was that there is no professional system of control once the project is under way.  This made for many difficulties. The reasons for all these basic mistakes are numerous, but one undoubtedly is that there is no internal professional expertise in many of the sponsoring Departments in either the presentation or execution of a brief for a capital project. There is no proper management scheme in those Departments which could respond to information that would be fed back by, say, the Office of Public Works when a project is being developed, or which could use the analytic work done on the feasibility of the project.  From the evidence of the Department of Finance it is quite clear that just providing analysts who would assess feasibility will not be an answer to the problem unless there are management teams who can use that information and respond quickly to problems that crop up on capital projects.  At present this is seldom the case.</P>
    <P>Another problem referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald is the unwillingness or inability displayed by the Office of Public Works to assert a more professional approach to sponsoring Departments if <Col N="477" /> such Departments do not have a professional approach and are somewhat slipshod.</P>
    <P>To his great credit, in January 1983 the Minister issued guidelines to Departments designed to deal with the sort of problems the committee reviewed.  As a model, those guidelines are excellent &mdash; I do not think the committee could find any fault with them &mdash; but unfortunately there are no case studies on which we could assess the impact of the guidelines. The committee had misgivings because though the model was excellent, whether the guidelines could be brought to fruition was questioned.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that in 1971 similar guidelines were issued to Departments and, as I have said, we cannot say the results were excellent when the Howth harbour project, for example, occurred during the existence of those guidelines.  From reading the response to the guidelines, it appeared to the committee that the various Departments seemed to be giving a rather relaxed response. There seemed to be discretion which would allow them to decide whether the guidelines would apply in their case.  They were obliged to reply within three months but many of them did not do so.  That would show their lack of commitment.</P>
    <P>The guidelines have limited coverage. Projects that do not have to go for Department of Finance approval are not covered.  The guidelines left major areas like housing and continuing programmes of spending from their remit.  We were not convinced that the guidelines had the teeth they would need to be effective: any project that did not conform with the guidelines should have been ruled out of the Public Capital Programme.  That is the ultimate way to enforce the guidelines.</P>
    <P>We must go further than the guidelines have gone if we are to make sure that the experience of the application of the 1971 guidelines will not be repeated.  The committee recommend that the guidelines be obligatory and that a project would not be admitted to the Public Capital Programme without conformity with the guidelines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> The committee decided that the Minister for Finance should set up a central unit within his Department.  It was represented to us by the chartered surveyors that there is a basic problem of lack of co-ordination in the Public Capital Programme generally involving the Department of Finance and that there is need for greater expertise in that Department to tackle this problem.  The Department of Finance in that way would become much more effective as a sanctioning body in regard to projects being put up for sanction.</P>
    <P>For instance, I do not think it would accept the rather hazy projects presented in the case of Howth Harbour so far as economic feasibility is concerned.  It would look questioningly at whether different options had been considered by the sponsoring Departments and, perhaps most important, it would vet the sort of assumptions that tend to form part of cost benefit analyses.  From my experience of the arterial drainage programme, I am aware that it is very easy for a sponsoring Department to present a rosy picture of an investment they are making.  It is important that the Department of Finance should have the expertise to question such rosy assumptions in relation to so-called feasibility analyses. That is an important area and one that needs to be strengthened within the Department.</P>
    <P>The other role that such a central unit would assume would be the role of better co-ordination of the capital programme generally.  The committee found that it was disconcerting to find programmes being stopped in their tracks because of Government decisions in cases where there were considered to be side effects to some costs on those projects that were not taken into account properly when the decisions were taken.  It is important that an expert unit within the Department would recognise the cost of delaying a project or of stopping it in its tracks. Similarly, the unit would consider the difficulties that might arise in cases where the plans of different Departments would mean that in one region there might be an enormous number of projects in progress <Col N="479" /> while in another there would be none. Such a clash occurred in the mid-west area, for instance, where at one period there was a huge level of activity in the capital programme area.  That had a bad effect in terms of increasing the cost of conducting the work.  It is another aspect that this unit could become involved in. In other words, they would be performing overall co-ordination of the capital spending programme.</P>
    <P>A final point that the Minister should examine seriously for future capital projects is that in the case of ongoing programmes, such as the arterial drainage programme which continues year after year, there should be an insistence by him that not only are feasibility studies presented when projects are being undertaken but that performance studies are carried out after the completion of a project with a view to ascertaining whether it achieved the results its sponsors intended.  That did not occur in regard to the arterial drainage programme.  The take-up by farmers, the hoped for increase in stocking and so on did not materialise.  It is important that sponsoring Departments should have the discipline of finding out whether their past projects were a success if more money for ongoing programmes is to be considered. The same is true of other programmes that are financed continually.</P>
    <P>There is another side to better management results than merely laying down procedures as has been the approach of the Department of Finance in their guidelines and that is that better procedures must be buttressed by financial practices that bring the chickens home to roost to the various sponsoring Departments who incur overruns.  That means that there would have to be one serious change, that Departments should have on their current budgets the cost of interest and depreciation of the capital projects they undertake.  If, for example, the Department of Health undertake to build a hospital they do not have to include in their current budget the cost of the interest and depreciation involved.  That has a very bad effect.  Obviously, it means that <Col N="480" /> delays in occupation and in the completion of the project do not have an immediate impact on the budget of the sponsoring Department though it is their responsibility to ensure that does not happen.  The Department of Health are exemplary in not having delays in the construction of hospitals and neither do they have overruns, but other Departments have very serious overruns.  At the end of the day they do not feel the cold winds on their budgets of those bad decisions.  They can continue merrily the following year using the new capital resources.  The Minister for Finance must find the capital for those financial overruns and that money must come from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we should charge out interest and depreciation costs to sponsoring Departments.  Similarly, we should charge them the full cost of consultancy services of the Office of Public Works. That office should not be providing services to Departments on a free basis. Departments availing of those services should pay the full fees.  This would be another way of reminding them of the cost of delays in the execution of projects.</P>
    <P>An equally important change we need to make in the way sponsoring Departments deal with their projects is to ensure that they submit full cost projects.  The habit has grown up in Ireland of giving at constant prices the cost of a project as if a hospital or any such building could be constructed in five minutes thereby incurring only today's prices.  Everyone knows that while construction is in progress the capital cost and the interest on that must be incurred and that provision must be made for cash flow if inflation will increase the cost during the course of construction.  We should abandon the practice of not providing full cost projections.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed the belief that his guidelines alone will render unnecessary measures such as those I have outlined. I do not consider his faith as expressed to us when he was kind enough to attend at a meeting of the committee to be well founded.  I would not have faith either in the point he made that <Col N="481" /> Departments' capital budgets are being trimmed already in cases where there are overruns.  I do not think that is the case. Certainly it would not be the case in a Department such as Fisheries where the Howth Harbour Project would probably represent several years of their capital spending as would also the overruns involved.  Therefore, that sort of expenditure cannot be controlled by saying that next year's budget will be pruned.  To proceed in that way might mean missing out on some very valuable project.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to a pet subject of mine.  That is the conviction that not only must we put financial constraints on Departments to ensure that they recognise the cost of overruns and not only must we have good procedures of the kind the Minister has introduced into his Department, but we must have public knowledge and Dáil scrutiny to ensure that projects being embarked on are being executed effectively.  The Public Capital Programme as presented now to the Dáil falls far short of what is needed in that regard.  We do not vote on the Public Capital Programme.  We vote only on a small part of it.  We have no annual debate on that programme though it is absorbing £2,000 million.  In the document itself we do not have the sort of information that would allow us to ascertain whether the various Departments who are engaged in projects are doing what they are setting out to do.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in future we should provide a Public Capital Programme which in the case of major projects should outline a brief summary of the appraisal on which the project was based, the reason it is going ahead and the hopes for benefits from it.  We should get a statement of the full cost that is expected to occur and the cash requirement year by year over the coming years.  Each year after the project is introduced, and until it is completed, the Dáil should be given a progress report to see how the project is proceeding both as regards the timescale and the budget. That sort of information is already provided within Government.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for something new, <Col N="482" /> extraordinary or onerus.  For anyone running a project costing more than, say, £5 million or £10 million, that type of information should be easily accessible. There are no State secrets involved here. We should insist that that type of information be laid before the Oireachtas so that we can make a realistic appraisal of it and perhaps, spot cases where things are going wrong at an early stage.  This would have a salutory effect on Departments sponsoring such projects because they would know the Oireachtas will be watching like hawks for cases where overruns occur.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that seriously.  I know he is supportive of that idea as evidenced by his publication of the comprehensive programmes in the case of current spending. I ask him to extend that commitment into the Public Capital Programme area which is, in many ways, more important because capital investment sets the constraints for current spending for a number of years ahead.  If we do not get it right at the time of capital investment, it will be hard to get it right later when the costs of manning and so on come home to roost.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the fees issue.  This is a difficult issue because we do not have any evidence before us that excessive fees were paid or that fees were paid for work which was not carried out conscientiously by the consultants.  In my view, the present system of fees is inappropriate to the Government's style of programming and the way Governments are forced at times to stall or delay programmes and, regrettably, the present situation where bad briefings occur and delays are happening because of bad management.  We must question some aspects of the fee system.  In particular the present situation where payments are based on the final cost of a project, regardless of when the consultant made his input, is ludicrous.  The bulk of money paid to consultants&mdash;architects, quantity surveyors and engineers &mdash; is paid at the tender stage.  In the case of architects it is 75 per cent and somewhat less in the other two cases.  Yet, when the project is <Col N="483" /> completed, perhaps with massive overruns, they get their fees linked to the final cost price.  There is no sense in that and we should not continue that system.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is no sense in the fact that at present interim payments are not index-linked.  In other words, if a consultant got paid in 1980 pounds, when the final cost of the project is calculated he gets his percentage as if the 1980 pounds were equal to the 1985 pounds when we all know that the 1980 pounds were much more valuable.  This means he is being paid even more than his percentage which some people might feel is high.  Those two aspects in particular need careful scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Finance for the very constructive way in which he has approached the committee's work.  I could not conclude without saying that the approach of the Department of Justice did not match up to what we expected from a Department reporting to a committee trying to do serious work but I hope this was a once off problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this report which deals with the control of capital projects.  This is a very important area. As has already been mentioned, £1,800 million will be spent in 1985.  This is an area where there can be a huge saving of taxpayers' money, especially in these days when it is very difficult to raise extra taxation.  I would like to highlight one area of concern.  When decisions are made by a Government in office, a new Government coming into office may reverse the decisions made and as a result taxpayers' money is wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give one example dealing with the decentralisation of Government offices.  This policy was adopted in 1980 but in 1983 another Government reversed that decision.  As a result, considerable costs which had already been incurred were written off because no further development took place on the policy decisions made in 1980.  Sites costing £641,000 were purchased in ten centres.  Consultants' fees for architects, <Col N="484" /> surveyors and engineers were paid for preparing plans and working drawings to enable tenders to be sought for these projects.  In September 1981, £2 million was approved by the Department for planning and design fees but by 1983 only five tenders had been received.  It was noted that up to 31 December 1983 a total of £2,296,000 approximately had been paid in respect of fees but a small proportion of these fees was refundable because the capital estimate costs were lower in some cases and because of the fact that work did not commence.  I do not dispute the fee charges as these are recognised fixed charges.</P>
    <P>The work being done by these people would be accepted as very satisfactory.  I say this because I want to stress that Government policy changes, redesign of plans and tenders not being sought immediately, are the real causes of the wasteful spending of taxpayers' money. It is obvious that the principle that time is money is not recognised here today.  It is in this area that the major problems lie.  Until we have a better relationship and understanding between Government and the officials of the Office of Public Works especially, there cannot be much or any improvement in spending taxpayers' money on capital development. God knows, the PAYE workers are crying out loud about the savage amounts of tax deducted from their wages each week.  I hope that the present work being done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Expenditure, and this report, will convey some hope to the taxpayers that we as elected representatives are very concerned that their tax is at least spent wisely.</P>
    <P>I would like to see radical changes in management and control, the Office of Public Works acting with more authority, a review of the present system of fee payments to consultants and a review of the present contractors system.  This report also recommends that fixed contracts be agreed where the work would not take any longer than two years to complete.  We should also identify early and eliminate cost overruns if possible. These are a few of the suggestions in the <Col N="485" /> report which clearly outlines our grave concern regarding capital expenditure. We also include in this report many ideas and suggestions which warrant the serious consideration of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Committee on Public Expenditure which is now before us is a comprehensive one and, like the curate's egg, is good in spots.  The fact that it concerns itself, in the main, with matters which are also the concern of the Office of Public Works, indicates the important role exercised by that office in public capital projects.</P>
      <P>The office comes in for a fair amount of criticism in this report and I would be less than honest if I did not agree that some of it, but not a lot of it, has some justification.  Criticism is not all that is merited by the Office of Public Works and might I suggest that an objective assessment of the work of that office would reveal many a job well done and would also reveal that there is no other agency at the full disposal of the State which has the organisation, experience and varied skills to undertake the many architectural, engineering and other projects which, over the years, have successfully been undertaken by that office.  Had that office not been available to the State, and had it been necessary to engage private interests to carry out those projects, the extra professional fees that would, of necessity, have been involved and the profit which the private interests would naturally have expected to make on their ventures would have added up to even greater calls on the public finances.  It is important to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>The title of this report is &ldquo;Control of Capital Projects&rdquo;.  There are so many references to lack of control in this report that one could be forgiven for getting the impression that, once a programme or project started, everyone sat back and let it take its own course.  That is not the case.  Of course there was control but it was not as formalised as it might have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time past the Commissioners <Col N="486" /> of Public Works have been impressing on sponsoring Departments the need to establish fully their total requirements at the initiation of a project so that the need for changes or extra works during the course of a job will be kept to a minimum if not entirely eliminated.  In the past, changes and extras have been a major factor in increasing the costs of projects.</P>
    <P>Estimates are now being framed to include all relevant costs where formerly construction costs only were included. This former practice gave rise to what are loosely called cost overruns whereas a major part of the overruns was inflation, but I will return to that later.  During the course of major projects, detailed cost reports are now being obtained at regular intervals and this is proving to be very helpful in monitoring the financial progress of projects.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention that the implementation and continuation of these procedures is dependent on the availability of necessary staff resources. If the staff of the Office of Public Works continues to be depleted, as it has been over the past couple of years, the success of these procedures cannot be guaranteed. It will be appreciated that it is not easy to adopt and operate regular detailed control methods if a single official is expected to administer 20 or 30 projects of various sizes and at different stages of development at the same time.</P>
    <P>Now I would like to turn to the question of appraisal which is mentioned in the report.  The committee say they would like to see in-depth appraisal and evaluations undertaken of all capital projects, and rightly so.  But only on rare occasions does that responsibility rest on the Office of Public Works.  It cannot be within the competence of that office to decide whether or where to provide fishery facilities such as a pier or a slip-way. Neither can it be for that office to determine the need for an employment exchange, a prison, a veterinary laboratory, or a customs post.  For the most part, the office act as agent providing for the needs of other Departments.  There are some cases where the decision rests with the Office of Public Works but very <Col N="487" /> often it amounts to a straightforward decision whether to restore a building or let it fall down.  It goes without saying that the office always contribute whatever technical advice on meeting the needs of other Departments is within their competence to give.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about cost overruns.  This phrase appears again and again throughout the report and its use for the most part is inaccurate.  Anyone who knows anything about the management or administration of projects will know that, before a reliable estimate of cost can be made, it is necessary to know precisely what the requirements are and to have done a certain amount of planning. Normally a project is taken beyond the inception stage on the basis, among other things, of its probable cost.  It is unfair to call that probable cost an estimate. It is no more than just that &mdash; a probable cost based on perceived needs rather than firmly established needs and on assumed building costs rather than costs based on detailed planning.  Too often such a figure is referred to as the estimate and, when eventually actual costs emerge which include not only contract sums, an allowance for unforeseen variations or extras, fees, fitting-out, inflation etc., the cry of cost overrun is heard and there may be no cost overrun at all in the strict sense of that term. People who shout about cost overruns should first make sure that they know what they are shouting about.  I can tell what a cost overrun is not.  It is not the difference between the original order of cost and the final cost.</P>
    <P>Frequent reference occurs in the report to the Department of Finance circular 1/1983.  The guidelines set out in that circular are being followed by the Office of Public Works in so far as it is possible to do so.  Since it was issued, only one architectural project and one engineering project costing in excess of £10 million have been started.  An inter-departmental committee have been set up in each case to monitor the progress being made and the expenditure.  The committees <Col N="488" /> meet at regular intervals and consider detailed cost reports submitted by the design teams at equally regular intervals. The design teams and, indeed, the contractors are invited to attend the meetings as considered necessary and I am very pleased to be able to say that the degree of co-operation received from all the members of the design teams and from the contractors has been excellent and the projects are on target.</P>
    <P>Much is said in the report about consultants' fees.  I understand that the Minister for Finance will speak on this particular aspect of the report in his contribution to the debate.  My comments so far have been of a general nature dealing with the broad subject of public capital projects.  The report also deals with two specific projects, the Department of Justice prison building programme and the Howth harbour development scheme.  I will deal with the prison programme first.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to major overruns on both projects.  In the case of prisons, the report concentrates on four specific cases and concerns itself with the amount paid out in consultants' fees.  It also draws attention to the fact that only one of the four cases actually got under way. Incidentally, it was not the women's prison.  In these four cases, there has been no cost overrun at all.  By no stretch of the imagination can properly payable consultants' fees be described as a cost overrun.  In the case which is in progress, I have already stated that it is on target &mdash; in fact it is running slightly under budget so far but we are only about one-third of the way through the work as yet. As I said earlier, if somebody wants to shout about cost overruns he should first of all make sure that he knows what he is shouting about.</P>
    <P>There is another statement in the report that I would like to follow up. The committee were unable to make a judgement as to whether the expenditure to date on the prison building programme was efficiently/effectively spent or otherwise. They are the committee's own words.  They say the reason for that was that the Department of Justice felt unable to divulge certain information.  So what <Col N="489" /> happens?  The Office of Public Works gets the kick &mdash; a kind of sideways swipe. The committee assumed that the Department of Justice, if not aware already, would have been alerted by the OPW to the fact that delays and redesigns would involve greatly increased expenditure, and then went on to believe that the fees debacle in the case of the prison building programme would not have occurred if a more professional relationship had existed between the office and the Department of Justice.  I am not sure what that last bit means but it looks to me to be a case of kicking the cat.  The Department of Justice and every other Department are well aware that if new or altered design work has to be done it has to be paid for and, if anyone thinks that something can be got for nothing these days, he is living in cloud-cuckooland.</P>
    <P>Later on in the report, the committee decided to have another go by saying that the OPW must accept partial responsibility for the cost overruns.  I am still talking about the prisons programme and must ask again, what cost overruns?</P>
    <P>Again, the office is criticised for allowing Departments to change plans &ldquo;in mid stream&rdquo;.  Does this mean that original plans must prevail even if they are found, before it is too late to change, to be unnecessary by reason of changed circumstances, or too expensive, or otherwise in need of change, for sound and valid reasons?  Are we saying that the OPW must say to any Department, even though the Department reconsider their needs in the meantime, that they continue with what they started?  I am sure the committee do not intend to say that but that is what they seem to be saying.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Howth harbour project. Let me say first of all that while there is criticism in this report of certain aspects of the way in which this project was carried out, nowhere is there a suggestion that the works do not represent full value for the money spent on them.  The end product, by any reckoning, is a fine engineering achievement which, in addition to providing a major fishery harbour, adds considerably to the <Col N="490" /> public amenity that is the village and harbour of Howth.</P>
    <P>I now wish to address myself to some aspects of the report.  I quote from paragraph 7.4.2 on page 18: &ldquo;despite the fact that two independent borehole investigations showed discrepancies, the Office of Public Works went ahead with excavations and much greater quantities of rock were found than anticipated...&rdquo; The clear implication is that further investigations should have been made to determine the amount of rock to be excavated. The Office of Public Works do not accept that such further investigations, costly in themselves, would have been warranted.  The simple fact is that, at that time, there was no reason to believe that further boring would provide more accurate information.  If a further investigation had confirmed the findings of one or other of the sets of borings, clearly, as the eventual outcome showed, the findings of that further investigation would also have been inaccurate and nothing would have been achieved.  On the other hand, if this third investigation had thrown up a new set of figures, what was then to be done?  Should there have been a fourth, a fifth, or maybe a sixth, in an effort to obtain two coinciding results? What guarantee would there have been that such coincidence of results would have represented an accurate picture of the actual incidence of rock?  There would, and could, be no such guarantee. In this case a total of 118 holes were bored, and I note that the committee's engineering consultant does not dispute the Office of Public Works' view that this number was adequate.  The simple fact of the matter, recognised internationally, is that civil engineering project investigations must be limited in their extent.  I would refer Deputies to the publication entitled <i>Managing Construction Projects</i> issued by the International Labour Office in which this fact is forcefully expressed. Let me quote from this publication:</P>
    <P>When costs are estimated, it is important to make some allowance for the unexpected, because the earlier investigations cannot have covered <Col N="491" /> every possibility.  Unless they are done in great detail, and consequently at enormous expense, engineering investigations will be limited in their extent, i.e. in the hard information they provide. </P>
    <P>This quotation relates to engineering work in general but is doubly relevant to underwater civil engineering projects.  I submit that the criticism implied in paragraph 7.4.2 is unwarranted and, if Deputies will pardon the unfortunate pun, without foundation.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion emanating from this report is that the Office of Public Works were remiss in not providing a client controlled contingency to cover, and I quote, &ldquo;the inevitable and expected difficulties in the sea works&rdquo;&mdash; paragraph 7.8.  In fact, a contingency sum of £340,000 was included in the January 1977 Estimate on which the decision to proceed with the project was taken.  This whole matter is dealt with in the OPW submission to the committee, as recorded at pages 166 to 169 of the report.  I shall return with some general comments on the question of contingencies in a few moments.</P>
    <P>While there is an understandable tendency to draw alarming, but misleading, conclusions when a reputed estimate of £3.6 million results in a final cost of £11.8 million, I want to substantiate my initial contention that the Howth harbour works represent full value for the money spent. Let me put the initial estimate and the final cost in their proper context, using the figures adopted by the committee's engineering consultant.  The figure of £3.6 million was the contract sum for the civil engineering works only and did not include the cost of other works then envisaged, such as certain ancillary buildings and the syncrolift installation.  The actual estimate for the entire scheme, excluding the yacht mooring basin, is put &mdash; paragraph 7.7 &mdash; at £4.6 million in 1977 prices.  Adding the inflation figure, calculated by the committee at £4.75 million, one arrives at a sum of £9.35 million.  To this must be added £1.2 <Col N="492" /> million which is the cost, before inflation, of the yacht mooring basin.  One then arrives at a total of £10.6 million which should, by the committee's reckoning, have been the final cost.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the final estimated cost given by the commissioners, and quoted at page 164 of the report, is £11.8 million.  The difference we are talking about is £1.2 million which represents an increase of some 10 per cent. This is by no means extraordinary in a complex marine engineering project of this nature.  The increase is accounted for mainly by the additional rock encountered during the works.</P>
    <P>On this question of rock, I might mention that, when the inner harbour was dried out and the overburden removed, the rock profile exposed was most unusual in the view of the Geological Survey Office.  This fact is one of many contained in a document submitted to the committee in which the involvement of the OPW in the whole project was described and analysed.  I think that the absence of this document from the report is an unfortunate omission.  Its inclusion would have assisted Deputies to appreciate the whole picture as it evolved from 1959 to 1983.</P>
    <P>I return to the question of contingency sums with a cautionary note, again based on the views expressed in the report.  The recommendation is made at paragraph 7.9 that an adequate and carefully thought out contingency in line with the prospective risks in the project must be included in the feasibility document.</P>
    <P>Nobody will quibble with this aspiration. The difficulty arises in its implementation.  The fact is that, if the items intended to be covered by a contingency sum were capable of being adequately identified and measured in advance, there would then be no need whatever for a contingency sum.  Items covered by contingency sums, by their very nature, cannot be accurately evaluated in advance.  Certainly, in the light of experience and of any information that can be made available at reasonable cost, every effort should be made to include, where necessary, realistic contingency <Col N="493" /> provisions.  But I can see a real danger emanating from the recommendation, that exaggerated or unnecessary contingencies would be included in cost estimates. There are superficial attractions to such a course.  Were the project not to proceed, the exaggeration would not come to light and if the project did proceed, the underspending on contingencies could be applied to unnecessary variations.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, an entirely spurious saving could be shown.  Such a saving might result in an entirely undeserved pat on the back.  The temptation is obvious. So what, one might ask, as long as the saving, spurious or otherwise, is realised? The danger is that the inclusion of safe, that is exaggerated, contingency amounts so as to achieve notional savings may tilt an economic appraisal of a project in the wrong direction.  I know that this is not the intention of the recommendation made in the report but I trust the House will agree that the recommendation raises genuine problems in implementation.</P>
    <P>There is no perfect answer to this problem. As I see it, assessment of likely contingencies, however honestly made, must, inevitably, include an element of risk and the possibility of error.  This is particularly relevant in civil engineering projects and doubly so in civil engineering projects undertaken in a marine environment.  In undertaking projects of this nature, this fact must be faced.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of contingencies, I return to the point made in the report that a client-controlled contingency should have been included in addition to the contingency provided in the bill of quantities.  I have explained that a client-controlled contingency was, in fact, included.  But I am inclined to take the report's recommendation a stage further.  Nobody will dispute that a client-controlled contingency should be a <i>sine qua non</i> in major projects.  But, are there adequate grounds for continuation, in all cases, of the practice of including contingencies in the actual contract?  I think not.  Unless there are compelling reasons for it, contingency sums should not be <Col N="494" /> included in Office of Public Works contracts. Contingencies should be reserved to the client.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that what could have been an excellent report should have been spoiled by some instances of what I can only describe as less than fair and less than objective reasoning and comment.  Lest I should be accused of being only critical. I want to assure the House that I support much that is in the report.  I should like to pay tribute to those who examined these matters and helped in the compiling of the report.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to see the report advocating a more stringent and aggressive approach by the Office of Public Works in relation to all parties involved in their projects.  The Commissioners of Public Works have assured me that they welcome any encouragement and support they can get in this regard.</P>
    <P>Mention is also made of Departments conforming to standards set by the Office of Public Works in relation to certain matters.  This also is welcome.</P>
    <P>Fixed price contracts are mentioned. Certainly in theory that form of contract is the ideal and should be aimed at where at all possible.  Indeed, in the Office of Public Works fixed price contracts have been in use for many years.  There are, however, hazards attached to them in certain circumstances and they are not necessarily always to the best advantage of the State in the long term.</P>
    <P>While I have been critical of many aspects of the report, I feel obliged to say that, in so far as they affect the Office of Public Works, I am broadly in agreement with the recommendations in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of members of the committee are anxious to make contributions and for that reason I shall be very brief, which in itself may be a pleasant change.  I am prompted to make a contribution on the basis of some of the statements by the Minister of State. He was a little too sensitive and appeared to hold the view that the burden of the report of the committee was being <Col N="495" /> entirely directed at the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It was principally directed at the OPW.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the intention in any circumstances.  We recognised that the OPW is the agent of the Government in carrying out public contracts and if the Minister of State, and his advisers, read our report carefully they would find that we were not singling out that body as the target for a further attack from the committee.  We were talking in terms of a general monitoring of programmes, particularly cost overruns. We never suggested &mdash; I do not know how the Minister of State could draw the conclusion &mdash; either in relation to harbour or prison programmes that fees spent for work that was not completed were cost overruns.  We did raise the consequence of decisions which meant that professional fees that were committed would not be spent and, worse still, that the work undertaken on the basis of these professional recommendations would be cancelled.  We did not make that case against the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State asked in that context if we were seriously suggesting that the OPW should go ahead with programmes which proved to be unnecessary in view of changed circumstances or which proved to be too expensive and the answer to that question is: &ldquo;No, we are not so seriously suggesting.  We are not criticising the Office of Public Works in that connection&rdquo;.  In the case under review, at whatever level of Government the decision was taken, is it now being suggested by the Minister who made that statement that the prison development programme which was sanctioned in 1981 was unnecessary?  The case that the committee always made was that if it appeared to be necessary at that time, with the advice available to the Department of Justice, the evidence before them seemed to suggest that it was even more necessary now.  The evidence of the lack <Col N="496" /> of prison accommodation which has been all too obvious in the last two years, with horrific consequences for our society, demonstrates very clearly that no Department and no Government could suggest that the prison programme which was cancelled was unnecessary in view of changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>If any member of the current administration, or any administration, proposes now that that was the reason that that programme was cancelled after major consultancy fees had been already committed, then they had better stand up and declare it publicly and formally in this House.  I do not think the Minister for Justice could now say that, or the Minister for Finance who probably would have been pretty directly involved in the initial decision to cancel that capital programme. I do not think that anyone could suggest that what we are talking about here would be unnecessary in view of changed circumstances.  This may be perhaps a personal gloss of mine on the committee's report in that context, but I wanted to make it abundantly clear that our criticism in that instance is not directed at the Office of Public Works. We know that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance would not have the authority to go ahead with the programme when the Minister now sitting beside him decided with his colleagues in Government that they were cancelling that programme.  We are not so naive as to suggest that in those circumstances the Minister of State at the Department of Finance should tell the Minister for Finance that irrespective of whatever decision the senior Minister made he was going ahead, anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I come to the next element and here is my personal gloss.  I believe that that decision was a disastrous one on the part of the Government of which the Minister of State is not a member, though obviously he is in association with that Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>And security, of course.  We find the consequences of the disastrous decision that was forced upon us in Spike Island.  We find that there is totally inadequate prison accommodation and, quite frankly, the whole administration of justice being undermined when prisoners are not only being let out before their sentences have concluded but others are being met at the gates of the prison after being sentenced and told, &ldquo;No room at the inn&rdquo;.  And we worry about the morale of the Garda Síochána, of our prison officers and of our courts.  Nothing did more to undermine the administration of justice, the morale of the people at various levels, be they gardaí, prison officers or judges, than that most disastrous decision.  We lost, of course, the money that was paid to the consultants.  I forget the precise figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>£12.7 million for nothing.  It has been clearly established by experience in the meantime that never was it more necessary for the work in respect of which that amount was spent not only to be started but to be completed. That is the point that I make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that from time to time there are changes of Government and that Governments that come into office look at the programmes which are ongoing. We make a special case that in relation to necessary capital programmes, unless the advice of those charged with giving that advice to Government, namely the officials of the Department of Justice, is totally and utterly wrong and bad, there should not be changes in essential capital programmes on a change of Government. Otherwise we will have stop-go decisions which will only give rise to these consequences.  In that connection it is <Col N="498" /> easier on the day, in the interests of controlling public expenditure as far as the public are concerned, to cancel capital programmes because people will not say that it is going to cost them more money for school transport, for instance, or that they are losing money on their grants, or that their social benefits are being reduced.  You will not get the public reaction. For that reason, it is easier on the day to cancel this or that programme and claim virtue for doing so.  As we now learn to our cost, the reality is that that kind of easy decision gives rise to some very serious consequences of the kind which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I want to make another comment which directly involves the two Ministers present and I shall not press their patience much further than this.  I also heard with great interest the Minister of State say &mdash; and I think that his officials in the Board of Works obviously and understandably wanted to get this point across &mdash;and I am now paraphrasing, &ldquo;Can we seriously be expected to monitor programmes properly and effectively when we are not provided with the necessary staff and adequate resources to do it?&rdquo; Can the officials of the Office of Public Works be criticised for not doing what they know is necessary when they are not provided with the necessary resources, money and staff to do it?  If ever I heard, to say the least of it, a sharp criticism scarcely veiled, of a senior Minister by a junior Minister, I heard it in that reference. I do not expect that the officials of the Office of Public Works can do what is not possible to do without the staff required to do it, or without the resources necessary.  I do not blame them for raising the question as to whether they can seriously be expected to do all these things without the necessary money or staff.  It is time for the Government who took the decision to get their act together, to use the cliché.  Certainly, the two Ministers who worked most closely together in the Department of Finance should resolve their differences before they come into this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the Minister for Finance by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance it is expressed there, that the Minister for Finance has depleted the resources of the Office of Public Works over the past couple of years.  The Minister of State is now telling us that if this continues, then we may not expect his section of that Department to <Col N="500" /> discharge their responsibilities.  He continued to say:</P>
      <P>It will be appreciated that it is not easy to adopt and operate regular detailed control methods if a single official is expected to administer 20 or 30 projects of various sizes and at different stages of development at the same time.</P>
      <P>I have to say hear, hear: to the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham.  I agree entirely with him.  Had I been writing the script I could not have done a better job myself.</P>
      <P>I can only say to the Minister for Finance &mdash; who will be replying in a moment &mdash; that he might take note of what his Minister of State has sharply criticised him for.  Would he take note of the fact that these officials cannot be expected to do the work without the necessary staff resources and finance?  Would he ensure that the next time he happens to have some opportunity to discuss these things with his Minister of State they might resolve their differences in private before coming in here and embarrassing the rest of us by following the habit we are supposed to have of criticising the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues? I thank the Minister of State for having been so open, courageous and determined in this frontal assault.  I hope somehow it will draw some response from the Minister now sitting beside him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I might draw the attention of the House to the fact that the eloquent vice chairman of the committee did indicate that there was a certain personal gloss on the remarks he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairman of the committee I want to express a word of appreciation to the chairman of the sub-committee, Deputy L. Fitzgerald and his colleagues, Deputy R. Bruton, Deputy N. Treacy and Deputy J. Doyle who did most of the work on this.  They have produced for us a significant report with significant recommendations.  There are 13 specific recommendations.  I have to admit to being a little disappointed that the Minister of State did not accept or reject any <Col N="501" /> one of them, although he said at the end of his remarks &mdash; and one might be forgiven for thinking up to then that he was not going to say it &mdash; that he was broadly in agreement with the recommendations in the report, which is heartening and encouraging to those of us who put some work into this.</P>
    <P>I believe that the recommendations contained in the report are worthy of being implemented.  They may not be refined to the point to which the expertise available to the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance would bring them. But they all contain a valid perception of something that is not adequate, some inefficiency or ineffectiveness which could be put right by the implementation of the specific recommendation.  I do not believe there will be any change in the way we do things until such time as recommendation 13.7 is implemented.  In brief what that boils down to is that each Department would pay, out of their budget, the cost of what they consume in the course of doing their work.</P>
    <P>At present the reality is that Departments order what they like, when they like, change their minds as often as they like, because they do not have to worry about who pays the bill.  It does not matter one whit to their budgets how much it costs.  It is absolutely unacceptable that client Departments can change their minds willy-nilly.  Until such time as departmental budgets reflect the excesses and largesses, the inefficiencies and the changes of minds and hearts they regularly make in seeking to procure their requirements, there will be no change. Ultimately when Departments have to pay the bill &mdash; and even then, of course, we should be reminded that the degree of perception they will have will not be similar to that of the rest of us who have to pay individually out of our own pockets for items we consume &mdash; at least it will be reflected in their budgets.  Then we may get some automatic and spontaneous system of order, internal constraints, simply because it will come out of their budgets.</P>
    <P>I would seriously ask the Minister for Finance &mdash; when he contributes in a few <Col N="502" /> moments, if he has an opportunity to tell us as succinctly as he can, whether he considers that recommendation as being open to be implemented; yes or no.</P>
    <P>One of my regrets is that the defence this evening by the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, in a sense, is understandable.  But that is not the point of this report.  We are not interested in attacking the Office of Public Works, any other Department, or officials.  That is all irrelevant.  What is relevant is what we will be doing next week and next year. What we inside and outside this House want to know is: will Howth harbour recur?  Will we be talking about £25 million in eight years time for another set of plans in some other Department? Whether one describes it as an overrun is irrelevant.  That is the nettle that must be grasped: whether the systems have been changed to ensure that these débacles &mdash; to use the words of the Minister of State &mdash; will not recur.  In due course &mdash; preferably tonight &mdash; I should like a comment, affirmative or negative, on each of these 13 specific recommendations which are the fruit of many months of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made a couple of remarks on which I should like to make an observation.  For example, he said:</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that, had that office not been available to the State, and had it been necessary to engage private interests to carry out those projects, the extra professional fees that would, of necessity, have been involved and the profit which the private interests would naturally have expected to make on their ventures would have added up to even greater calls on the public finances.</P>
    <P>That simply does not add up.  We are not asking two different sets of people to do the same work.  We want it done efficiently.  We do not care whether it is done by the State or by people outside; it should not be done twice.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister of State has confirmed for us that estimates are now being framed to include all relevant costs where formerly construction <Col N="503" /> costs only were included.  If our modest nudgings in that respect have perhaps encouraged that change to be brought about, so much the better.  I am pleased also to note that detailed cost reports are being obtained at regular intervals.  That is all good and is apparently happening now.  It was not happening when we were examining the issues in this report.</P>
    <P>Seeing the opportunity as a senior Opposition politician, Deputy O'Kennedy put the boot in on the question of staff.  I use a slipper because I am on this side of the House but his point is well made.  Quite frankly, it is disarming and a little bemusing to hear an office holder bleat about lack of staff.  That is not our problem.  I am not sure that it is the Minister for Finance at whom he is getting. I gather that the Minister for the Public Service actually has the final say. Anyhow, let them sort it out but do not, for God's sake, tell us that they cannot get the act together because there are not enough staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said also:</P>
    <P>only on rare occasions does that responsibility rest on the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>On that question, we do not mind.  We are not interested in whether it is the Office of Public Works, the Department of Justice, the Department of Fisheries or whoever.  We are simply saying that, from the perception of the man in the street, there is a lot of money being spent and not enough being obtained for it. We tried to spell that out clearly.  The Minister of State continued to say:</P>
    <P>It cannot be within the competence of that office to decide whether or where to provide fishery facilities...</P>
    <P>This on the question of professional expertise.  Yet, to be fair to the Office of Public Works, they have to put up with a bewildering succession of requests for the provision of just such items.  The question of the technical competence and expertise available to them in making <Col N="504" /> certain judgments in that respect obviously is a hazy area and is in need of some degree of clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State continued to say:</P>
      <P>For the most part, the office acts as agent providing for the needs of other Departments.</P>
      <P>That is a fair statement.  Again I believe we could bring about an improvement if we could get individual Departments to pay for the costs which they incur.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made a point relating to the definition of an overrun. He takes us to task and there is probably some truth in what he says.  It is probably not fair to call architectural fees for plans which are not implemented an overrun.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a total waste of money.  A rose by any other name will smell just as sweet or a nettle by any other name will sting just as deep.  It does not matter what one calls it.  Redesigning the parameters of the definition will not work in this case.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>...before a reliable estimate of cost can be made, it is necessary to know precisely what the requirements are and to have done a certain amount of planning.  Normally a project is taken beyond the inception stage on the basis, among other things, of its probable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what he means by that last sentence.  In the private sector they have very clear costs and estimates.  They do not operate on the basis of hazy notions of probable cost, whatever that phrase means.  A probable cost is obviously different from a final estimate.  I presume it is a ball park figure which relates to the <Col N="505" /> estimate.  If there was a major discrepancy there would not be any point in having a duplicate system of probable cost <i>vis-á-vis</i> estimates.  We do not mind which is which.  When the State decides to build X it should know precisely what X will cost.  In the case of Howth harbour one of the officials of the Department said openly and bluntly that not alone did the Department of Fisheries not know what it would cost but they spent £3 million without the sanction of the Minister. If that is what they call probable costing, the sooner it is dealt with the better.  The Minister said it was unfair to call a probable cost an estimate.  Perhaps it is and if we are wrong we should apologise. It is not germane to the point we are making.</P>
    <P>The Minister distinguishes between a probable cost based on perceived needs rather than firmly established needs and on assumed building costs rather than costs based on detailed planning.  I am not sure about the difference between perceived needs and firmly established needs.  There should not be any discrepancy between them.  Work should not begin on the basis of perceived needs.  By whom are they perceived?  Is it written down somewhere?  Is it worked out in a plan?  Need should be spelled out clearly before any proposal is taken beyond inception stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the guidelines set out in the Department of Finance circular 1/1983 are being followed by the Office of Public Works in so far as it is possible to do so.  These are the type of qualifications I worry about.  They are either being followed or not.  This is the kind of qualification we get on all sides of the House from successive administrations. Things are &ldquo;under review&rdquo; and all the other clichés are used which allow people to slip out of responsibility.  In this case the cliché is &ldquo;in so far as it is possible to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Later in his speech the Minister unconsciously used a phrase which sums up our perception of the fees issue in the case of the prisons.  He referred to the fees &ldquo;débâcle&rdquo;.  It is his word and it is an honest expression.  The Minister went on <Col N="506" /> to talk about the Howth harbour project and he said repeatedly that nowhere in the report is there a suggestion that the works do not represent full value for the money spent on them.  He said that the end product adds considerably to the public amenity.  That is absolutely accepted.  It is a fine achievement and nobody disputes that it adds to the lustre of life on that side of the city or that it is arguably good value for money.  That is not what we are talking about.  We are talking about whether the same amenity value could have been provided for less. That is the issue which the report addresses.</P>
    <P>I am a little intrigued at the logic of the Minister's remarks about the boring for the Howth harbour site.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The clear implication is that further investigations should have been made to determine the amount of rock to be excavated.</P>
    <P>There were contradictory borings which could have led to further contradictory findings.  Obviously the extension of that logic is that one does not do any boring and the problem does not then arise.  The sub-committee reported that the investigation indicated there would be problems which would reflect on the final cost and that therefore the contingency sums and other aspects of the project should perhaps have been dealt with in a different way.</P>
    <P>On the question of contingency sums the Minister of State made the very valid point that ideally in a Utopian world there should not be any contingency sums.  Life is not like that and problems will arise.  If a change has to be made in a project for some good and valid reason that problem must be addressed.  In this case the committee are saying that the contingency fund was wildly disproportionate to what it could reasonably have been expected to be.  It was below the average on public construction projects for a project which was somewhat hazardous because it was an underwater job with complicating factors.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about <Col N="507" /> many aspects of the work of the Office of Public Works detailed in a document submitted to the committee.  He said that the absence of this document from the report was an unfortunate omission.  The report runs to 250 pages.  As cháirman of the committee I was worried about the size of the report.  Every conceivable document which had any relevance was included.  If it is considered proper, I will be very happy to include the document referred to as an addition so that the House or anybody else will have the benefit of it.  I have a feeling that this document came to us after the report was completed.  I am sure the House will be agreeable to adding the document to the report so that there will be no recriminations.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that what could have been an excellent report should have been spoiled by some instances of what I can only describe as less than fair and less than objective reasoning and comment.</P>
      <P>Nobody could be more staunch, more loyal or more supportive of the Office of Public Works than the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>His defence of the Office of Public Works brings to mind the classic legends we came across in the classroom &mdash; the battle of Thermopylae and the Pass of Cuchulainn.  Nobody stands firmer in the gap than the Minister of State on behalf of the Office of Public Works.  I respect that.  In fairness to his officials who do a lot of good work, it has to be respected.  It is always with a slight sense of discomfort that I become involved in a report which might be interpreted as rubbing the Minister of State the wrong way.  None of us had any desire to do that.  It is proper to put on record that <Col N="508" /> the Office of Public Works do extremely good work.  The report never disputed that.  We do not talk about whether it adds to the final value of the generality. That is not the issue.  We want to know whether we can do things a better way and the report unequivocally says that we can.  It makes 13 specific recommendations which the committee want in place.  Alternatively a good reason must be given as to why they should not be in place.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the sub-committee for their help in preparing the report. I thank both the Minister of State and the Minister for their presence this evening. It is encouraging to see men taking an evening off to come here at this late hour to be with us in these deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the only non-Dublin member of the sub-committee I was delighted to work on the investigation of capital projects and cost overruns.  I want to say how delighted I am to have worked on this sub-committee and to pay tribute to my colleagues for their dedication to their task.  I should particularly like to pay tribute to our excellent clerk, Mr. Judge, and to the professional advice which we got from Mr. Ballance who made a major contribution to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not here to single out the Office of Public Works for unfair treatment.  We are here, as the chairman of the committee rightly said, to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money in future.  We are not satisfied that they got that value for money in the past and we hope, as members of the Committee on Public Expenditure and particularly as members <Col N="509" /> of the sub-committee, that we can pinpoint ways for the future in which money can be better expended with the same good resultant end product and positive projects being realised.</P>
    <P>As laymen who examined the Howth harbour project, we were very pleased with the final project although we felt that the management involved left a lot to be desired.  The Minister of State admitted this in his speech when he said that of course there was control but that it was not as formalised as it might have been.  I applaud the Minister for admitting that, because we are not satisfied that there was tight formal control from the start to finish of the project and that from the outset the Office of Public Works only acted as agents.</P>
    <P>I have just completed my third year in this House and I understand clearly how the Office of Public Works are always standing in the breach as agents for the State, doing these projects and providing services for other Departments.  I understand that they are often in a straitjacket and that when they are given instructions and put them into operation, after a week, a month or a year there can be a change of direction, attitude and policy and the Office of Public Works have to carry the can and justify why so much money has been spent on small projects.</P>
    <P>The Howth harbour development was originally estimated to cost £3.5 million but it ultimately cost £11.8 million.  This was 200 per cent more than originally expected.  The Department of Fisheries and Forestry had ultimate control over the Howth harbour area and they changed their plans radically after the project went out to tender.  I accept that this put major pressure and constraints on the Office of Public Works and, ultimately, on the Exchequer in regard to the financing of the project and its total cost.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the treatment which the Department of Fisheries and Forestry gave to the many agencies involved, including Bord Iascaigh Mhara and other commercial and voluntary organisations.  They listened to them, accepted submissions from them and they <Col N="510" /> implemented those submissions and recommendations, even those from voluntary bodies.  Perhaps they were not implemented in full, but major parts were accepted by the Department and were implemented, on their instructions, by the OPW.  Of course this led to cost overruns. The fact that the Department changed their plans radically after going to tender was a disaster because it was obvious that more money would have to be expended and that the people involved might think there was a never ending supply of money.</P>
    <P>The other project which we investigated was the Department of Justice prison programme.  The Department commissioned designs for various prisons. Then there was a change of policy, possibly because there was a change of Government, and a sum of £12.7 million was paid in fees for five designs, four new prison designs and one redesign.  When we interviewed the Department of Justice officials it was hard to get them to admit that there were five designs involved as they tried to say that there were only four.  However, they ultimately accepted the fact that there were five designs.  We received every co-operation from Government Departments, State agencies, public servants and departmental officials.</P>
    <P>We are public representatives and Members of Parliament elected by the people to work for the common good and to ensure that the funds of the Exchequer are spent to give the maximum benefit and to get the maximum value for taxpayers' money, and we were held in contempt by some officials of the Department of Justice who did not co-operate with us to the full extent or give us information which was so vital.  These officials hid behind various Ministers and said that they could not impart information for security reasons.  The Minister is a servant of the people and the common denominator available to all Ministers by way of resources are the advisers in his Department and the nation's finances. The same advice must have been available to the present Minister as was available to his predecessors and there is no <Col N="511" /> reason for any Department officials to hide behind a Minister.  The information we sought should have been forthcoming. Ultimately, we did get the information owing to the forthright manner in which the sub-committee went about their business and the persistence and diplomacy of our excellent clerk.</P>
    <P>Hindsight has proved conclusively that it was a disastrous decision to suspend the prison programme and to redesign the various planned projects.  I appeal to all Governments to ensure that planned projects are brought to fruition.  We now see the high cost of security, the morale in the Garda, the difficulties being encountered by the Judiciary and the legal profession because there is no prison accommodation for people who need to be confined for certain periods. Judges in some courts, especially in the city, are often told before the court sits that there will be no prison space available for the week and that is how they are forced to operate.</P>
    <P>The fact that the prison programme was changed at a vital time has led to this serious situation developing, but I do not wish to alarm anybody.  It is not in the interests of this House or the country that any responsible public representative should do that.  It is vital to change the system whereby professional fees are paid for various projects and it is time that the State, which has ultimate responsibility and control, should be the agency which decides the type and method of payment of professional fees for public projects and State tenders.  It may be all right in certain circumstances &mdash; although personally I do not think it is all right at any time &mdash; for a percentage fee to be paid to a professional group, person or agency for putting projects on paper and for those fees to be paid before the project starts.  The amount of money spent in this instance would have built one or two prisons.  I appeal, as did the chairman of our sub-committee and the chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure, to the Government and to the Minister of State to ensure that a new <Col N="512" /> policy is initiated <i>vis-á-vis</i> payment of professional fees.</P>
    <P>I should like particular attention to be paid to the many recommendations we made, particularly recommendation 13.1.  This states that there should be more briefing, monitoring and control of public expenditure on capital projects so that cost overruns will be eliminated. Any future capital projects should be properly planned, designed, costed and examined before being set out for tender. After that there should be a realistic contingency figure allowed for inflation or for some eventuality that may necessitate a small change in direction to bring the project to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the total amount of money initially planned for the project should be in line with the timescale.  If that timescale is two, three or four years, it should be possible to allocate an amount from the annual Estimates rather than the present position where the Estimates are planned annually, where each Department or semi-State body make their application which is considered by Cabinet, which is then put before the Dáil and passed.  Where there are overruns it is a matter for the client Department or the State agency concerned to put the case before the Minister concerned and explain why the money is needed.  Then it is up to him to persuade his Government and his Minister for Finance to ensure that the allocation is available in the Book of Estimates.  That is not a good system.  I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to ensure that future projects are planned over a period, with the amount of money needed being allocated at the start of the project to come out of the Estimates year by year rather than having to make a case for a cost overrun 12 months later when the Book of Estimates is being prepared and when the budget has to be passed by this House.  In the final analysis this is where the finances are found to run the State.</P>
    <P>It is vital that fixed price tenders be sought.  In this way the possibility of a cost overrun would be minimised.  I expect the officials in the Office of Public Works will <Col N="513" /> consider this point in the future.  It is vital that there be clear negotiations on fees. These could be identified for the initial design and, secondly, for the supervision and the bringing of a project to conclusion. These fees could be paid in two stages or in various stages.  This would be preferable to the present situation where fees are paid on a professional scale on the estimated cost of a project.  This is basing amounts on future costs which may not be realistic or which may become unnecessary because projects planned do not always come to fruition.</P>
    <P>The report before the House is having some effect already as I understand the architects and other professional people working for State agencies and Government Departments are not finding it so easy to get payment of fees.  I accept that everyone is entitled to payment for work done but I am delighted to see that what we have recommended is being implemented in what I hope will be a professional ethical manner.</P>
    <P>We are a young developing country. We do not want a repetition of what happened in regard to Howth harbour.  I hope the experience garnered by the Office of Public Works, by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and ultimately by the Department of Finance as well as the report of our committee will highlight the way forward in the future for client Departments, for the Office of Public Works as agents of the State and for future administrations.  In this way we will have tighter control, better management, better programming of finances and a more efficient and expeditious conclusion to all future State projects.</P>
    <P>Ultimately it is the taxpayers who carry the can, the PAYE sector, the self-employed and all who make their contribution to the finances of the State.  We must ensure that Government Departments and State agencies do not change their minds or change direction.  Projects that are planned, initiated, designed and costed should be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  We must make sure that there is no change of policy or direction just because there is a change <Col N="514" /> in administration.  We must act as responsible politicians, both in and out of Government.  We must ensure that what is planned and projected is in the interest of the common good and that State funds are not wasted because of a change of course or direction.</P>
    <P>In the past few years many projects have been changed.  I refer to projects such as the Ballyforan briquette factory managed by Bord na Móna where much money was expended.  However, a decision was made not to go ahead with it.  There is also the case of the project involving inner city development in Dublin which was planned when we were in Government and put into action by us. It was brought to a standstill and now two years later it is being reactivated. However, much money has been lost in the meantime.  Costs are higher and there has been a considerable loss to the Exchequer in respect of PRSI and VAT contributions. Sites have been purchased throughout the country for the decentralisation programme but they are now being put up for sale.  These were good, sound, solid projects to develop the country and to provide services in the interest of the common good.  Some have been abandoned and others are being reactivated. We should ensure in the future that any sound project that is properly planned and costed will be brought to fruition in the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>As a member of the sub-committee and of the Committee on Public Expenditure, I hope that in our small way we have made a contribution in highlighting the necessity to have cost efficient and effective management of all projects.  I am confident that the Minister for Finance and his Minister of State will ensure that the recommendations we have put forward will be implemented as sensibly and as positively as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report and share the views of most of the previous speakers in regard to overruns in projects like Howth and in regard to the Department of Justice.  The report gives us an opportunity to try to prevent repetitions of these overruns.  At a time when <Col N="515" /> it is so difficult for the Government to find finance for public projects, it is frightening to see vast sums being paid in fees to consultants.  I am sure the Minister of State in charge of the Board of Works would not agree with overruns in contracts, with the State having to pay far greater sums than the original tender prices.</P>
      <P>The alarming thing is that these extra costs are concerned with so many Departments. I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and I am keenly aware of the vast overruns on capital projects.  It is proper that this House should discuss those matters.  I endorse the points made in regard to the system of fixing consultants' fees and I share the view that it is high time to re-examine this matter as it has obtained in the last ten years.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to examine it with urgency, particularly the system by which fees are assessed and fixed.</P>
      <P>Another cause of extra costs is that changes are allowed in contracts during the work.  I thoroughly object to this process and I suggest it be examined speedily. I note that in a Department of Justice contract placed in 1979 for £273,000, the ultimate cost was more than £1 million. That was in respect of staff accommodation in one of the Department's institutions. I understand that the accommodation was supposed to be temporary, but each unit finally cost £22,000 when completed in December 1981.  This is a disgrace and repetition should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same occurs throughout the whole field of capital expenditure.  A telephone exchange was built for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the tender being placed in 1978 at £1.8 million.  The final cost was £2.6 million, an overrun of £600,000, because of a dispute between the Board of Works and the contractors. The contractors' excuse was the bad winter and overtime.  That should not be tolerated.  When the Board of Works sign a contract there should not be changes, and many of the overruns happen because contracts are changed.  It is like <Col N="516" /> giving a cheque book to contractors engaged in public building contracts.</P>
    <P>I will return to consultants' fees.  If I were in that business, apparently all I would have to do is to get a contract from the Board of Works and I would have no financial worries for a long time.  I will give two further examples of increases in contract prices.  A library and lecture hall were built at UCC and the contract in 1978 was for £3.9 million.  In 1980, the final cost was £8.6 million.  A State laboratory at Abbottstown was to be built at a cost of £1.2 million.  The final cost was £2.7 million.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue to have huge overruns, and the Minister must examine it as a matter of urgency.  The whole system must be examined, including how consultants' fees are arrived at.  When projects are let to contract there should be a clear contract without deviation.  A stadium was to be built for £600,000 but on 7 December 1979 there was a further cost of £284,000 and still a further tender was given to the same company for £180,000, the final cost being £600,000 above the original tender price.  The Government cannot and should not tolerate this any longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the members of the committee and especially the members of the sub-committee for the work they have done and for the concerns they have expressed.  I wish in particular to thank Deputy Naughten who so far this evening has been the only person not a member of the committee to participate in the discussion of the committees work and their report.</P>
      <P>The area covered is one of very considerable importance, one to which the Government and I have been paying a good deal of attention.  The concerns which motivated the committee to take up this matter were very similar to those which inspired the changes that have now been put in place by the Government and the new procedures we are now following.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did have the opportunity of fairly extensive and probing discussions with the <Col N="517" /> committee while the report was being drafted.  We covered quite an amount of ground during that discussion, some of which has been referred to this evening but not all of which comes through in some of the comments that have been made in the debate.  To reply to some of the comments made here tonight would necessitate covering some of the same ground I covered in my discussions with the committee.  It is not my intention to do that.  The report might have gained a little had the committee given themselves a little more time to finalise it after the discussions we had.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies on the other side of the House will realise that during the course of this discussion I may be tempted into indiscretions here and there.  That is not my intention.  In my discussions some weeks ago with the committee, they will have found a very ready ear for the concerns that are expressed in the report.  Without any wish to be contentious, I must say that I found some of the remarks made by the Opposition and particularly those of Deputy Treacy to be such that, if followed to their logical conclusion, would seem to be in conflict to a certain degree with the concerns expressed in the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is difficult to set out a procedure for decision making and for analyses as we go about our political business and suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It can be difficult to adhere to the ideas that appear to be good when the basic analyses are being done but I am prepared to do that and I should like to think that I would have the support of the members of the committee in that regard.  We will have the opportunity of seeing the degree to which each member of the committee is committed to all of these matters as we go through Estimates discussions and as we proceed with the budget debate in the early part of next year.  I will be looking forward to the support of members of the committee on <Col N="518" /> all sides of the House for a number of matters I will be talking about then, in relation particularly to capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>The committee's report deals with shortcomings in the procedures for planning and monitoring capital investment projects and supports that line of argument with a detailed analysis of two projects &mdash; the Howth harbour development scheme and the prison building programme. I do not propose to go into detail on either of these projects.  My colleague, the Minister of State, has dealt with a number of aspects of both programmes but I should like to make the point that both programmes were planned before the publication in March 1983 of my Department's comprehensive guidelines for appraisal and control of capital expenditure, referred to more widely as circular 1/1983.  I should not like it to be inferred from what I have said that I take the view that since those guidelines were published, everything in the garden has been rosy, that there are no difficulties remaining.  That is far from being the case.  There is always room for improvement and I welcome a number of suggestions put forward by the committee with a view to bringing about improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>I should like to put the issue in the broader context of the quality of capital investment generally.  In the past decade, public capital investment has accounted for about 50 per cent of gross domestic fixed capital formation in the economy and has heavily influenced the composition of a further 25 per cent.  In this way, the State plays a pivotal role in the determination and composition of the level of national investment.  The level of gross national investment itself has been maintained at a consistently high level &mdash; averaging about 27 per cent of GNP in the past ten years.  It is clear that successive Governments have attached a very high importance to public investment as a means of achieving long term economic growth and of generating jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paradoxically, however, despite large scale involvement in investment and despite the maintenance of high overall <Col N="519" /> national investment ratios, the rewards in terms of growth and job creation have been less than satisfactory.  In fact, the annual average volume growth in GNP in the past decade has been of the order of only 2 per cent per annum.  This can hardly be termed a good return.  Other forces have, of course, had an influence on the level of growth, but it is clear that the return on public investment has been less than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We should all be concerned about the apparent lack of return on State investment expenditure in the past.  While it would be a misleading over simplification to say that poor quality public investment was the cause of low growth in the economy in recent years, it is clear that this has been a substantial contributory factor.  I welcome the committee's report for the opportunity it affords us to look again at what has been accomplished and what remains to be done in this area to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of State investment so that we can enhance its contribution to growth and employment.</P>
    <P>A fundamental requirement for any investment project, whether it be undertaken by a Government Department or a private firm, is that the benefits or income flows accruing from the investment yield a positive return over and above the cost of the investment decision.  The State does not have access to free funds.  In the current year the Exchequer must borrow about £¾ billion to finance the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>Capital assets are by their nature long-lived; their useful life extends over a period of many years into the future. The process of acquiring these assets, typically by construction, usually takes several years.  Once they come on-stream, it may be several years more before the benefits which they were created to produce begin to flow.  In the meantime, of course, the State has had to put its money up front in the expectation that over time the benefits deriving from the investment will outweigh the costs.  It is clear that, once the decision to undertake a project is taken it pre-empts the State's freedom of choice in future years <Col N="520" /> because the annual capital expenditure associated with the project becomes a first charge on Exchequer resources in subsequent years.  The selectivity and prudence which should apply to the spending of these funds is therefore of critical importance and is all the more so today given the priority of restoring balance to the public finances.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that every investment decision carries a degree of risk. Some are a good deal more risky than others.  It would be foolish to expect that every investment project would perform fully up to original expectations.  What we need to do is to ensure that an adequate proportion of investment projects provide sufficient return to cover the cost of the overall investment portfolio.  The initiatives which have been taken by the Government in recent years are designed to ensure just that.</P>
    <P>The first major step was taken with the establishment of the working group on cost overruns on public construction contracts in late 1981.  That group's report proved to be a key document in the drive towards better quality appraisal and management of public investment projects. That working group made 17 recommendations which they felt would contribute to a substantial improvement in project conception and appraisal, effective management and control.  They specified procedures for formulation, vetting, design and supervision of projects along with arrangements for improved cost control and payment of consultants' fees.</P>
    <P>Around the same time, the Department of Finance were completing work on the preparation of comprehensive guidelines for public investment planning and control.  Many of the improved procedures proposed by the working group were accordingly incorporated in circular 1/83.  That circular formalised a more rigorous and systematic approach to the appraisal, monitoring and management of public investment projects.  It had two main objectives, first to improve the quality of decision making by improving the quality of the information on which decisions were based through the use of <Col N="521" /> systematic appraisal techniques and second, to improve the quality of management control once projects were underway.</P>
    <P>The guidelines deal with the various stages of project appraisal, sanctioning procedures, contract supervision, project management and cost control.  They are not intended and I want to emphasise this, to be a standardised rigid system designed to apply inflexibly to the wide range and variety of individual projects that go to make up the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>Circular 1/83 marked an important change in attitude to the appraisal of capital projects.  Although some Departments and agencies had previously followed effective appraisal procedures, the overall standard was uneven and left a great deal to be desired.  The current procedures have been in operation for a comparatively short period &mdash; less than three years &mdash; but already they are bringing about a more rigorous and cost-conscious approach to the planning of public investment.  My Department are in regular contact with the spending Departments to ensure that proper attention is given to appraisal.  The national plan, published in October 1984, emphasised that Government approval for projects to be included in the Public Capital Programme depended on rigorous appraisal being applied along the lines of circular 1/83.</P>
    <P>More recently, I have been taking initiatives in the area of consultants' fees and contract procedures, subjects which have figured largely in this evenings debate.  My Department are currently in consultation with the professional institutes about fees and have drafted proposed new procedures in relation to the placement and administration of public contracts which I hope to introduce early in the new year.  I will return to these developments later.</P>
    <P>It is fairly clear that we have not been shirking our responsibilities in this area. Every opportunity to push home the message of the need to improve the quality of State investment has been taken and will continue to be taken in the <Col N="522" /> future.  It is plain commonsense that we as a nation simply cannot afford to sink money into projects which fail to give adequate returns and we no longer intend to allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I took more than a passing interest in what Deputy O'Kennedy called the personal gloss he wanted to give to the discussion this evening.  I cannot remember the exact month, but during the autumn of last year I had the pleasure of being invited to speak to one of our institutes of engineers about project appraisal in relation to the Public Capital Programme.  Deputy O'Kennedy, who was not present at the conference, got hold of a copy of the paper which I had given at the conference, which was rather weighty which, I think, was appropriate to the occasion.  That Deputy came in here this evening in his usual smiling way to talk about his personal gloss on this report which is concerned about getting better value for money for public investment.  Some days after I had given that paper, he stood in those benches and emoted at me &mdash; that is the only word I can use &mdash; and took issue with me for taking an excessively rigid economically based approach to public capital projects.  That man, who this evening as vice-chairman of the committee was emoting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I said before this evening and on other occasions in this House, I will wait for the day when Deputy O'Kennedy and his Fianna Fáil colleagues, who have worked very hard in the preparation of this report, put public money where their mouths are, and defend in this House measures that are intended to get value for money.</P>

If project A is more important, then that is the project with which we will go ahead and project B, no matter how desirable it might be, will have to wait.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to turn now to the specific recommendations made by the committee, several of which are critical of circular 1/83.  I do not intend to itemise them now, but I want to use my time to make specific remarks about them.  Guidelines, by their nature, are flexible instruments designed to allow the bodies or individuals to which they apply to put them into operation in a way that best suits the circumstances of particular programmes. I have already stated that the purpose of Circular 1/83 is to ensure a systematic approach to capital project planning and implementation across a wide spectrum of public capital investments.  The circular makes it quite clear that responsibility for the design and implementation of detailed procedures consistent with the <Col N="525" /> guidelines rests with individual Departments and agencies precisely because differences in procedures may be appropriate to different programmes and that capital appraisal, <i>per se,</i> is an integral part of the responsibility which departmental managements hold.  Departments do not, however, have discretion to disregard project appraisal.</P>
    <P>The committee's emphasis on a much more central role for the Department of Finance in capital project appraisal seems to be both inflexible and unwieldy and unnecessarily and excessively bureaucratic. It is nice for once to be able to come into this House and tell other Members that their proposals are excessively unwieldy, inflexible and bureaucratic. It is the case on this occasion.  In addition, it would undermine the important principle that line management in spending Departments should be accountable for implementation of the programmes.</P>
    <P>Circular 1/83 acknowledged, and this still holds true, that the size and nature of projects must, inevitably, influence the extent to which the steps outlined in the circular are applied.  Some Members of the House seemed to feel this evening that Departments were a little too relaxed in their approach to the application of circular 1/83.  I can assure the House that they are not relaxed about it for any lack of attention from me or my Department.  There is another area, similar to the area just referred to in terms of responsibility for management, which gives me the opportunity to raise paragraph 4.2.3 on page 6 of the report where it says:</P>
    <P>The Committee noted that Circular 1/83 excluded a number of major areas of public expenditure, namely, loan finance advanced by agencies such as the Industrial Credit Company, Agricultural Credit Corporation, Fóir Teoranta, Housing Finance Agency and local authorities for houses (par. 7). The Committee would wish to ensure that <i>all</i> capital projects which are financed from public funds should, as <Col N="526" /> a matter of routine, be subject of rigorous appraisal and evaluation. </P>
    <P>I must make it clear that I do not agree with that approach.  On reflection members of the committee will agree with me.  It would be absolutely impossible even to conceive of a situation where every loan made by the ICC or the ACC, where every operation carried out by Fóir Teoranta or by the Housing Finance Agency and every scheme of houses built by a local authority, would have to be subjected to this kind of appraisal under the terms of circular 1/83, and end up at some stage on my table or in my Department for sanction.  The committee have taken an excessively centralising view of this and have done so in this respect in rather too indiscriminating a manner.  I fully agree that decisions made by the other agencies mentioned here should be subjected to fairly detailed appraisal and evaluation by those agencies but it must be on the basis of specific criteria laid down to suit the needs of those agencies and the context in which each one of them works.</P>
    <P>Recommendations 13.1, 13.3, 13.5 and 13.8 propose improvements in control and reporting systems, assigning specific responsibilities for projects to management teams and making the costing of projects more comprehensive.  These features are already an integral part of recommended project appraisal, monitoring and control procedures as defined in circular 1/83.</P>
    <P>The main features of the procedures are that:</P>
    <P>First, there should be clearly designated individual project manager with responsibility for overseeing the execution of the project.  The new management system referred to in the recently published White Paper on Public Service Reform envisages increased personal accountability by individual managers for the expenditure programmes which they administer.</P>
    <P>Second, all those concerned with a project, officials of the sponsoring <Col N="527" /> agency, outside professional consultants or others are required to proceed on the basis that proper management of the contract must ensure that costs are minimised and that the project will be completed within the budget cost.</P>
    <P>Third, major once-off projects with a value in excess of £10 million have a cost control and supervising committee charged with responsibility for overseeing the execution of the project.</P>
    <P>Fourth, design changes are not allowed unless they are fully justified by changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>Members of the Committee have been a little over enthusiastic in their feeling that on no account should we make any allowances for changed circumstances.  That is not something which can be defended in the real world, nor would the model of private sector behaviour in matters like this indicate that one should batter on ahead regardless of the original plan without taking account of changed circumstances. The committee's enthusiasm has run away with them on that point.  The other main features are:</P>
    <P>any extra costs arising from permitted design changes must, in the first instance, be offset by cost reducing changes in other areas.  If this is not possible, the approval of the sanctioning authority for the design changes and the extra costs must be secured before any commitment is entered into with the contractor or consultants in relation to such changes.</P>
    <P>Fifth, extensions of time are agreed by consultants only for most exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances outside the control of the contractor. </P>
    <P>The cost control and supervising or monitoring committees just mentioned, are an important element of the control and reporting procedure.  These committees maintain continuous liaison with consultants, contractors and others involved in the construction work on projects and insist on careful management <Col N="528" /> and control throughout.  In addition, they prepare frequent reports summarising all relevant developments relating to the project costs and viability and submit them promptly to the sponsoring Department and other relevant authority.  The monitoring committees also review the project as each stage is completed and ensure that the next stage can appropriately proceed having regard to the overall cost approved by the sanctioning authority and to the availability of funds. Finally, if adverse developments should occur which call into question the desirability or viability of the project, part of the monitoring committee's brief is to prepare a special report and submit it at the earliest possible moment to the sanctioning authority with an assessment of the costs and benefits of terminating it before completion.</P>
    <P>These monitoring committees are now in place on several major capital projects, for example, the Wheatfield prison project. Future major capital investment projects in the pipeline will also have monitoring committees as and when the Government decide that they should proceed.</P>
    <P>Circular 1/83 is also quite explicit on the scope of the detailed feasibility and investment appraisal study which must be carried out.  It is also quite explicit as to what is required in relation to financial appraisal.  The procedures are comprehensive and cover, in particular, the estimation of the full cost of the project and its phasing, both in cash terms that is inflation-adjusted future price levels contrary to what some members of the committee seem to think, and in real terms that is at constant prices.  This applies also to all possible alternative options so that all of those considerations can be taken into account at the very beginning. An allowance must be made in the costings for the possibility of cost overruns for various reasons e.g. design problems, higher than expected inflation etc.  Consideration is also given to the Exchequer costs, including the proposed capital contribution from the Exchequer; ongoing current costs to be borne by the Exchequer, directly or indirectly, if the project <Col N="529" /> or programme is undertaken, including interest charges on capital, commissioning costs, additional current expenditure, staffing requirements and so on.  In this regard the proposal to include in departmental voted allocations all of the ongoing costs that have been mentioned during the discussion would be an extremely complex matter, particularly if we were to put in the ongoing interest costs and allowances for depreciation.  It would be extremely difficult to put those kind of allowances into departmental allocations and reconcil them with corresponding Central Fund flows.  I say, having thought about it at some length, that unless we were to take up the option &mdash; which I think the committee would not recommend &mdash; of specific earmarked funding on the borrowing side for each project, a very complex operation, we could not go along with that proposal if it is meant in the way I understood it to be put forward this evening.</P>
    <P>Two of the most important and immediately relevant recommendations made in the report are those at 13.2 concerning fixed price contracts and 13.4 concerning the system of fee payments to consultants.</P>
    <P>On the question of consultants' fees, I agree broadly with the committee's recommendations.  Indeed, I wrote to the professional institutes involved last April seeking to have a number of changes introduced into the system.  First, fees should be calculated on the VAT exclusive cost of projects; second, over a certain value of contract &mdash; £2 million &mdash; fees should be open to price competition and, under that level, fees should be negotiable; third, fees should be split, one portion paid by reference to the cost of the project at tender stage and the other portion related to the cost at completion. I am very pleased to have the committee's support in adopting that line of approach.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say the first change concerning the VAT exclusive cost of projects as a basis for fee calculation has already been implemented.  Consultations are continuing with the professional institutes with a view to early implementation of the other changes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> On the matter of fixed price contracts, I agree that these are desirable and public authorities are being encouraged to use fixed price contracts whenever possible. The Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, referred this evening to this matter.  To be workable, however, such contracts must be well defined beforehand, should not be open to significant changes after award, and should have fixed starting and finishing dates, all features which I think the committee would wish to see in them.  With the decline in inflation, it should be possible to extend the use of this form of contract and I intend to encourage it in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>In the past, unfortunately, many public sector projects have not been sufficiently well defined at tender stage to enable a fixed price tender to be obtained.  We are now taking steps to make it a requirement on public authorities that every aspect of the design should be completed before going to tender.  This will go a long way towards meeting the concern which Deputy Naughten expressed.  Such requirement would obviate the scope for client or consultant inspired changes, and consequent claims for extra cost by the contractor.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommend the establishment of a small technical advisory unit in the Department of Finance to bridge what they consider to be various gaps that exist at present.  The function of this unit would be to provide me with professional advice on the Public Capital Programme, advice which the committee believe is essential if the PCP is to be adequately monitored and controlled. While I find the committee's suggestion interesting, it appears to indicate a lack of awareness and understanding of the true problems involved in successfully implementing project appraisal.  The main stumbling block, if one exists, to converting the circular 1/83 guidelines into operational rules and thus to improving the quality of projects making up the PCP, lies outside the centre with line Departments and agencies.  Unless the will and expertise exist in the outside Departments and agencies to undertake <Col N="531" /> proper capital appraisal then the required improvement in performance will not materialise.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the basic role of my Department in relation to capital appraisal and control must be to (a) define standards for project evaluation; (b) ensure that these standards are applied uniformly and (c) review the adequacy of appraisal arrangements from time to time.</P>
    <P>The application of those standards must, however, remain in the hands of management in line Departments of offices, where it belongs.  It is important from the point of view of management accountability that we keep that principle in mind.  We must, therefore, equip those Departments who are directly responsible for project implementation with the requisite professional and technical skills to do the job.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I am conscious of the need to achieve significant improvements in the level of accountancy skills and expertise in the Civil Service generally and in the field of capital appraisal in particular.</P>
    <P>We have already made progress in that regard.  One initiative which I would mention is the analyst training programme run by my Department.  At present about 25 officers with training in analysis have been allocated and training is proceeding at the rate of four per year. We have taken steps to increase the number of professional accountants available in the Civil Service both by having people serving in the professional accountant grades and encouraging by a number of means serving officers in the Civil Service to acquire new or higher levels of accounting skills and expertise.</P>
    <P>Recommendations 13.9 and 13.10 address the format and content of the Public Capital Programme booklet.  Basically, what is being looked for is an expanded publication which would provide details of feasibility studies and appraisal, details of current and prospective costs and so on, and the provision of capital projects data on a multi-annual basis.  I must say that I have some difficulty with that recommendation.  I do <Col N="532" /> not think that the PCP booklet would be an appropriate vehicle to use to get that information across.  It seems to be a matter which would more properly be dealt with in the comprehensive expenditure programme booklet which, the House knows, I want to develop further so that it becomes a more useful tool not just for us in the House here but for interested parties generally to give them a better basis on which to assess the suitability and the returns to public expenditure, particularly on the capital side but also on the current side.  Too often we forget that we should look for a return on expenditure there also.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 13.7 deals with a related point &mdash; charging the full cost of capital projects to the budget allocations of the Departments concerned.  Important steps in this direction have already been made with the development of comprehensive public expenditure programmes. I refer the House to my remarks a few moments ago on the complexities of accounting in following what I understood earlier to be a suggestion made by some members of the committee.</P>
    <P>I accept that, having regard to the long-term nature of capital expenditure, there are obvious benefits to be gained in settling public investment allocations on a multi-annual basis.  Such an approach would, for example, provide a guide to the private sector as to the Government's intentions for national investment.  It would also help to avoid cases where programmes have to be stopped because the original level of ambition set out was far in excess of the level of resources likely to be available to carry out those programmes.  I would make that remark in particular in relation to some of the comments that were made about the prisons programme and to remarks that Deputy Hilliard made about decentralisation.</P>
    <P>I agree with the committee that the state of affairs existing before the implementation of Circular 1/83 was in many regards most unsatisfactory.  The position has improved very substantially <Col N="533" /> since the application of that circular but I would be the last to say that it is entirely satisfactory or perfect.  I wish to commend the committee for the initiative they have taken in drawing attention to the problems set out in the report.  I should like to repeat that I look forward with very pleasurable anticipation to the support of each member of the committee in the work I will be carrying out to give effect and recognition to the concern expressed in the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise the matter of the present position of the B &amp; I, something I regard as a very important matter.  The B &amp; I are the only State shipping company left to us.  The ICL are at the moment in the never-never land of receiverdom and, consequently, there is an obligation on us to look with particular attention at the parlous state of the B &amp; I.  As they are our only fully State owned shipping company as of now there is all the more reason why we should nurture and try to preserve the company.  In common with other people I am exceptionally worried about the turn of events in the B &amp; I recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the workers have been committed to the company and that the House is anxious to have a fully lean and commercially viable company which adds to our serious consideration of the matter.  I asked for this opportunity to raise the matter not to be critical or to raise cain in any particular area.  There are many plans for making the company commercially viable.  I commended a <Col N="534" /> plan in the House and submitted it to the Minister as being one which would succeed in the objective of making the operations of the B &amp; I commercially viable.  That plan was elaborated under the chairmanship of Mr. Boland when he was chairman of the B &amp; I.  There is now a plan which emanated from Mr. Alex Spain, the new chairman, backed by his private consultancy firm, Zeus Consultancy which, I presume, is the plan under consideration now.</P>
    <P>However, there is one way that we cannot make the B &amp; I commercially viable, one way that is not the correct way and that is to have a strike.  For that reason I must say how much I regret that the SUI have gone on strike at a time when a new corporate plan is being negotiated I cannot see how that can do anything but damage to the country, the company and the workers in general.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to raise any hackles in this debate but I must refer to the gratuitous attacks the Minister made on the SUI at a time when these negotiations were getting under way.  That cannot have been helpful.  I am not saying that those comments justified the workers going on strike but I do not think it was the politic thing to do or something that helped the position in any way.  Anybody who has any responsibility with regard to unions of one kind or another will realise that the human factor is very important, that negotiation is better than war, that jaw, jaw is better than war, war as a neighbouring leader once said.  For that reason attacking a union before the negotiations got under way was not the politic thing to do.  The strike will damage the company and there is a grave danger of our losing our last State-owned shipping concern.  Everybody should be told that and should be impressed by this danger.  There are predators waiting to take up the business on the Irish Sea. There are foreign interests prepared to take up that business and for that reason there is an added onus on management, workers and the Minister for Communications to get this sorry mess cleared up so that profitable trading can be developed without any undue delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> We want to own the ships; we want to have the ships under the Irish flag.  We want to have those services fully Irish owned and at the command of the Irish Government.  We are aware that at the time of the Malvinas War the British Government told shipping companies that they needed ships to bring troops, munitions, food and materials down to the South Atlantic and, while I do not wish to sound alarmist about this, whatever transport that exists between this country and the United Kingdom could by a nod be taken away leaving no services on the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The group of unions, other than the SUI, who are involved in the B &amp; I have circulated to all Members a copy of their counter proposals to those prepared and put to the board of directors by the Zeus Consultants and Mr. Spain.  One of the things they asked for was more time. From what I can gather, the Seamen's Union of Ireland, as late as Tuesday I think, were having discussions with Mr. Spain and the B &amp; I.  There was not a breakdown which would have, or was likely to have, sparked off the strike. That makes the strike all the more puzzling. The group which consist of all the unions other than the SUI asked for more time.  They felt that an agreement could be hammered out in discussion between management and workers if a little less rigidity were applied.</P>
    <P>The group want a relaxation with regard to the time limit on reduction of the number of people employed by the B &amp; I.  They think that cutting 525 workers out just at once is much too drastic, that the same result can be achieved with very little, if any, loss to the State by early retirements, non-replacement of people who had reached the age of retirement, voluntary severance and so forth.  That is the path of reason which any reasonable person would be anxious to follow.  They have also suggested that special attention should be paid to people who are young enough to be retrained and that other Government Departments could be involved in making provision for the <Col N="536" /> retraining of people who would have to move out of the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>There should be an analysis of the Dún Laoghaire switch.  It does not seem to make sense when it is indicated that there would be a saving of £100,000 but that 59 jobs would go.  That would mean 59 unemployment benefit payments, redundancy payments and so forth.  The saving, in the short-term anyway, does not seem to justify that switch.  Time should be given to think it out, to come to some kind of arrangement.  As a result of the Dublin Cargo Handling and the deep sea dockers coming to an agreement, the port of Dublin is improving its atmosphere &mdash; let us put it that way &mdash; for business over what is has been in the recent past, when there was loss of business to other ports as far north as Carrickfergus.  That is an argument that should be put on to the scales with regard to the switch in favour of Dublin port.  We discussed plans for the development of Dublin port in this House recently and in that context the switch to Dún Laoghaire should be thought about.</P>
    <P>The privatisation of road transport, although the unions argue that would mean the loss of 76 jobs, does not mean necessarily that there will be that loss. If there were privatisation the company would need personnel and I presume experienced and efficient personnel would be taken over.  I find all the arguments put forward by the unions to be reasonable.  They say there should be discussions on possible public saving.  The suggestion is discussion, negotiation and so forth about the proposal that the on-board functions should be privatised. About catering, the perfume business and duty-free spirits, I am not <i>au fait</i> with the accounts in connection with these and neither is anybody in this House.  The Minister may very well have the report from Zeus Consultancy on this but if, as is rumoured there are major losses on that operation I think it is a public scandal. That should not happen.  This is an area which would require special attention and I am not sure if the group of unions have any helpful suggestions in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> Again I express doubts about the cartel.  The company with whom B &amp; I are forming this cartel are an American company, very much involved in a high percentage of return on investment.  I am not criticising them for that, but that is the scene.  I think B &amp; I would be losers in this regard if, as they propose, they sell their ship and rely on the ship belonging to Sealink, even though they get a 50-50 cut of the profits on that route.  There are financial obligations, as far as I understand, with regard to Milford Haven, in that we have undertaken to pay a certain sum of money.  From what I gather it would take £8 million to get out of Milford Haven.  If we make savings, or even profits &mdash; and that would really be the operative word &mdash; on the southern corridor, it will probably take most if not all of those savings to get out of Milford Haven and pay the debts in two years.</P>
    <P>The group have suggestions about absenteeism.  I cannot see anything that is not reasonable in these suggestions. They say that management and unions should get together and hammer out an agreement with regard to absenteeism, which seems to be a serious problem in this business.  As part of the rationale they see the group as partners in the development of the company.  That is a very sober, responsible and admirable philosophy for a group of unions to have. I should like to know the age spread of the staff, both on-shore and sea-going, because that would be important with regard to the suggestions of voluntary severance, waiting until people retired and so on.</P>
    <P>I asked a question in the House, but the Minister was unavoidably absent.  The Minister of State indicated the official answer but all the negotiations and plans indicated that there was a requirement of £43 million &mdash; over what period was not stated &mdash; of equity in order to get the plan going and make it a reality.  Are Zeus Consultancy reporting to the Minister? If not, they should be, because he is paying that firm.  Was the plan that Mr. Spain put to the board the fruit of suggestions from that firm?  If so, has he any commitment to the expenditure of the <Col N="538" /> £43 million?  The taxpayers paying Zeus Consultancy are entitled to know exactly what the consultants are advising and what commitment the Minister has made with regard to the equity for the new company.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, welcomed the proposals for the new corporate plan for the B &amp; I.  I cannot see how he welcomed them without having studied them.  Did the Government study them and did they approve the expenditure of £43 million if it were linked to the suggestions that Zeus Consultancy and Mr. Spain were putting to the board?  How could the Minister say he did approve of it &mdash; and he said it twice &mdash; if he had not studied it?</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, my purpose in raising this matter here is to say that it is the last shipping company we have effectively, that it is in danger, that it is the concern of this House that it should be saved for the nation.  I am not here in a carping or critical mood.  I simply want to get the Minister's view, to encourage the Minister to step in and try to save the B &amp; I Line.</P>

I shall deal with some of the points he raised at the end of my statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now 20 years since the B &amp; I Company was acquired by the State.  Following heavy trading losses in recent years, the company is now in extreme financial difficulties.  It has become almost completely dependent on the Exchequer for its survival.  It has received £24.5 million from the Exchequer since 1982 and during the past four years the company has incurred losses of almost £40 million.  The burden of keeping the company in operation has fallen heavily on the taxpayer and it is out of the question that the taxpayer should continue <Col N="539" /> to subsidise a loss-making shipping company.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government is that the B &amp; I should survive and continue the service for which it was purchased.  The company has a board comprising first class people headed by a chairman and managing director of wide business experience appointed for the very purpose of salvaging, if at all possible, B &amp; I from collapse.</P>
    <P>When I appointed the new chairman and managing director of the company last May, I asked him to carry out a review of the operations of the B &amp; I.  I also asked him to identify the measures necessary to restore the company to profitable operation by the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>The board of the B &amp; I company is currently considering a package of proposals for restructuring the company which has been put forward by the senior management not by Zeus or anybody else.  The board's proposals, when finalised, will be considered by me and the Government in so far as they require Government decisions.  I want to make it clear, as it was already made clear in reply to Parliamentary Questions on 14 November 1985, that no proposals have as yet been submitted to me by the board. Until such time as the board have finalised their considerations of the management proposals and have submitted their own proposals to me for approval, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the substance of the proposals which have been published in the media.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me, however, that unless a realistic commercial strategy is initiated by the board and management, the future of the entire workforce will be jeopardised in a short time.  I am satisfied that with determined management and a dedicated workforce, the B &amp; I company can be operated on a fully commercial basis in accordance with the mandate which it was given when it was acquired by the State, and that a majority of the jobs can be preserved.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to exacerbate an already difficult situation, I have to say <Col N="540" /> that the current strike by the Seamen's Union of Ireland is totally reckless and irresponsible.  First of all, no notice of strike action was given and I have been informed that the normal procedures in the company in relation to strike notice were not observed.  Secondly, before taking strike action, the union were not prepared to enter into negotiations on their demands.  Indeed, I understand that the union's demands are in fact unclear and confused.  Furthermore, the Chairman of the Labour Court made himself available to both B &amp; I management and the seamen's union last evening to discuss the dispute.  While management attended the proposed hearing, the union failed to put in an appearance and are guilty of a gross discourtesy to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>There is ample machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes at the disposal of the parties involved and, in all their interests, the procedures and industrial relations machinery provided should be utilised with speed.  I have been informed that the board of the B &amp; I Company met today to consider further the proposals in regard to the future of the company which have been made by management.  The board also considered the responses to the proposals which have been made by the B &amp; I policy group of unions and other unions concerned.  The board will meet again next week to examine the matter further.  In the meantime, arising from the situation created by the seamen's union's strike action the company will commence to lay off other workers from Friday next.  The hardship caused by this lay off is clearly the result of the precipitated and reckless action of the Seamen's Union of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I must make it clear also that I would not expect the company to negotiate under duress or be blackmailed into an unsatisfactory settlement by the strike action.  The Seamen's Union of Ireland has effectively controlled the shipboard operations of the B &amp; I company for many years.  They have retained the power to hire, promote, transfer or dismiss employees on board ships up to the rank of chief purser.</P>
    <P>The one critical note in what Deputy <Col N="541" /> Wilson had to say was that he attacked me for attacking the unions.  In response to a question in a radio interview I said that the seamen's union had uncommon prerogatives.  If that is to be interpreted as an attack, I do not know what to say. But, as I have already said, this uncommon prerogative can no longer be tolerated. Deputies will appreciate that this prerogative carries with it enormous influence and power and the facility to abuse that power to the detriment of the B &amp; I company.  This is a matter of intolerable scandal on which I may wish to elaborate further at a later date.  If I am not mistaken, Deputy Wilson himself implicitly referred to this matter in what he had to say.  I urge the Seamen's Union of Ireland to come to the negotiating table in an effort to achieve a settlement. These days are extremely critical ones for the B &amp; I Company.  I could not overemphasise the seriousness of the company's situation.  I would not be putting it too strongly if I said that the future of the company and the jobs of all its employees are at stake.</P>
    <P>The seamen's union should call off the strike immediately in the interest of its own members and enter into the negotiating procedures with the company when the board has finalised its proposals. If strike action were ever to be <Col N="542" /> justified in a company in the perilous state that the B &amp; I finds itself in it should be only after all possible negotiating avenues have been exhausted.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the points made by Deputy Wilson who, in fact, advocated negotiation and discussion.  I would urge the same course on the Seamen's Union of Ireland who are, it must be remembered, one of 17 unions in the B &amp; I.  The other 16 unions have made constructive proposals for discussion purposes, as have a number of other groups involved in the company.  I would urge that the Seamen's Union of Ireland &mdash; who are the only group who have made no counter proposals &mdash; would at least return to the negotiating table and discuss the proposals when they emerge from the board.</P>
    <P>As I have said in the course of my remarks, this is an extremely grave crisis which has been much exacerbated by this precipitate strike action which cannot be in the interests of the members of the Seamen's Union of Ireland or any of the employees of the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 November 1985 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Work is proceeding on the <Col N="349" /> construction of the new place of detention for male juveniles at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, County Dublin, which, when completed in 1987, will provide 320 additional prison places.  Work is also proceeding on the construction of a new cell block at Cork prison which will accommodate about 50 offenders, enabling the purpose built education unit at Cork to be returned fully to educational use.  This new cell block is due to be completed towards the end of April next.</P>
      <P>At Portlaoise prison work is in progress on the renovation and reroofing of the D Block at the prison.  This will enable about 30 additional prisoners to be held there.  It is hoped to have this work completed in the early spring.  At Mountjoy female prison work on an extension is continuing.  This extension, which again I hope will be completed early in the new year, will enable better segregation to be provided and will improve conditions generally.</P>
      <P>At Fort Mitchel, Spike Island, work is proceeding to increase the capacity of the institution from 50 to 80 and it is intended that this work will be completed in about three months.  As I said in reply to a question here on 23 October, the building damaged in the fire will not be rebuilt to its former state.  No decision has yet been taken on major development at the Fort. In addition if the new unit at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, is utilised to deal with prisoners with serious drug problems a further 31 places would be available.</P>
      <P>In addition I am considering the possibility of utilising the former Scoil Ard Mhuire at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, and the newly completed single officers quarters at Portlaoise as accommodation for offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like it to be thought that the problem faced by society in dealing with criminals can or should be solved solely by reference to the provision of more custodial places.

    <P>The House will be aware that the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System deals at some length with the question of prison accommodation as well as alternative methods of dealing with offenders.

The Legal Aid Board administer the scheme of civil legal aid and advice but my consent is needed to the establishment of new full time law <Col N="352" /> centres.  I made a detailed statement about the scheme on 29 May last in answer to a number of Parliamentary Questions (Official Report, Volume 358, columns 2520 to 2523) and I would refer the Deputy to that statement.</P>
      <P>In the course of that reply I indicated that arising from the fact that certain moneys had become available under a provision of the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984, the Government had authorised the establishment of a new full time law centre in Tralee to service Kerry.  It was expected that that new centre would be in operation before the end of this year. However, the board's plans in regard to the centre are running a little behind time, but I understand from the board that they expect the centre to open in January.</P>
      <P>The opening of new centres is, of course, subject to general financial constraints which apply in other areas also. Pending the establishment of a full time centre in Tralee the board have since 1983 provided legal aid services for Kerry through a part time centre at Tralee, serviced from Limerick.  The level of services there had to be reduced due to pressures at Limerick and for the past year the service at Tralee has been provided on the basis of fortnightly attendances by a solicitor from Limerick.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assume that the question refers to the Garda checkpoint that has been operating on the Newry road north of Dundalk for the past two months.  No firearms have been seized at this particular checkpoint since it was set up.  The checkpoint is part of a series of additional measures that were introduced to combat terrorism and its effectiveness could not possibly be judged on criteria such as the absence of a seizure of firearms or explosives.  The measures were introduced by the Garda Síochána following an assessment of the security situation and I am satisfied that the Garda would <Col N="354" /> not have introduced the checkpoint if they did not consider it to be worth while.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Prior to 1983 the average annual intake of applications under the ground rents purchase scheme was roughly 5,500.  In 1983 the intake increased to 19,378, largely due to the fact that the scheme had been scheduled to end on 31 July 1983.  As the staff restrictions applicable to the Civil Service generally were in force in 1983 and as the Land Registry is a part of the Civil Service it was not possible to recruit additional staff to deal with the huge increase in the intake of work with the result that since 1983 there have been long delays in processing applications.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of 1985 there was an arrear of 18,754 applications.  By the end of October 1985 the arrear had been reduced to 14,399 applications, a reduction of 4,355 or 23.2 per cent.  The reduction is mainly attributable to (a) a drop of 73.5 per cent in the intake of applications in 1985 compared with 1984 and (b) the use of modern technology in the processing of the applications.  On the basis of the output now being achieved average delays are one year and three years in consent and arbitration cases respectively.</P>
