      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the names of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa.  Amendment No. 12 is related: by agreement, amendment Nos. 1 and 12 will be taken together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;After the passing of this Act it shall be unlawful to discriminate in matters of social welfare on the grounds of sex either directly, or indirectly by reference in particular to <Col N="266" /> material or family status, in particular as concerns:</P>
    <P>(i)  the scope of the scheme and the conditions of access thereto,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the obligation to contribute and the calculation of the contributions,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the calculation of benefits including increases due in respect of a spouse and for dependants and the conditions governing the duration and retention of entitlement to benefits.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the time allowed for discussion on Committee Stage has been restricted to less than three hours, given the important nature of the Bill and the serious consequences it could have for a quite a number of families in terms of their income.  It is a mistake to limit a Bill of this nature, particularly as it has been available for discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That point would have been more appropriate on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I did not raise it on the Order of Business because I did not want to delay discussion on the Bill.  I am simply making a brief point to the effect that I think it was a mistake and that we should have had an open-ended debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Our amendment to section 2 seeks to incorporate in the Bill a direct reference to the EC directive which required the legislation to be introduced.  There is no reference in the Bill as it stands to the fact that it would be illegal to discriminate against a person because of marital status or sex.  For that reason we are proposing that this amendment be accepted.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the amendment is a direct quote of article 4 of the Council directive of 19 December 1978.  The preamble to that article states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of equal treatment means that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex, <Col N="267" /> either directly or indirectly by reference in particular to marital or family status.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that it concerns in particular the scope of schemes, the conditions attached thereto, the obligation to contribute, the calculation of contributions and benefits including increases and so on.  Given the nature of the Bill and the long time we have been waiting for it, it is important that the specific exclusion of discrimination should be included in it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that two of my three amendments have been disallowed on the basis that they would involve a potential charge on Revenue.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the general point that when the Bill is enacted the directive will then have the full force of implementation in Irish law.  As such it would be inappropriate to put sections of a directive into the Bill.  Secondly, I do not think there is much merit in repeating &mdash; as was done in the amendment &mdash; a section of a directive.  That would be unusual.  It would diminish the directive and inevitably it would cause confusion.  I do not think it would enhance the thrust and the legal intent of the Bill.  There is also the reality that if it were enacted in that form it would be an unqualified directive within the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment states that it shall be unlawful to discriminate in matters of social welfare.  That is not what this Bill is about.  This Bill is about part of the social welfare system.  For example, it does not deal with the question of survivor benefits.  If that were opened up one would have to recast the whole social welfare system because inevitably one would have to give equal benefits to <Col N="268" /> widowers and widows and other areas also would be opened automatically. Effectively, we would have a completely new definition of discrimination which was not contained in the directive, which relates solely to the question of dependency and of the ending of discrimination against married women in our social welfare system.  For these reasons I am not disposed to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I understand that we are also discussing amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy McCarthy.  For more serious reasons I would be entirely loath to accept that amendment because it is too vague.  The amendment would make it an offence for an investigating officer to ask discriminatory questions of married women.  I have indicated clearly that I will be issuing definite guidelines in the Department of Social Welfare to all officers concerned directing that discriminatory questions not be asked.  However, one could have a situation where, in order to avoid discrimination, one would have to ask the same questions of everyone. You might have a list of 30 questions you had to put to everybody so as to avoid a technical offence.  It might mean having to ask people who had no children what arrangements they were making for looking after their children.  That would not be a very auspicious interview.  Amendment No. 12 does not set out at all what action should be taken if an offence is thought to have been committed.  It does not define an offence and the penalties provision in our existing legislation could not apply to that because there is no definition of such an offence.  We would have to have a whole new series of provisions incorporated in the legislation. Amendment No. 12 as drafted says: &ldquo;to ask discriminatory questions&rdquo;.  There is no definition of what constitutes a discriminatory question in that amendment. I do not think it would be wise or possible to implement an amendment of that nature.  I would ask Deputies to reconsider their amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit <Col N="269" /> to accept the logic of my amendment.  He says it is vague.  If it is, I apologise but I do not think it is.  What is implicit in the amendment is that it would be an offence for an investigating officer to ask discriminatory questions of a woman who is being investigated consequent on the repeal of section 136 (3) (d) of the Principal Act.  It is obvious that the discriminatory questions one is talking about relate directly to sexuality.  I am sure the Minister foresees a situation, just as I do, in which when these married women with children present themselves for examination of their rights to claim unemployment assistance, one of the main bones of contention with the investigating officer will be whether they have at home someone who looks after the children.  If this type of questioning is to be pursued it will totally negate the purpose of this Bill in relation to the equalisation of the rights of women and men.  If the Minister had accepted my amendment it would have ensured that the officers could not ask discriminatory questions in relation to how a woman's children were being minded and who had been employed to do it.  The Minister must realise that this type of questioning, which will relate specifically to women and will not be applied to men and is not applied to men at the moment, totally destroys the whole purpose of this equality directive.  I would ask him again to consider the logic of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he did not see any merit in including a particular section of the directive.  The point I was seeking to make was that the Bill as it stands makes no reference to the fact that it is aimed at ending discrimination against women in the social welfare code.  I do not accept that there is no merit in including the section.  I do accept that the unqualified reference to matters of social welfare in my amendment does make it a bad amendment in that sense but I am sure there is no problem in altering that to refer to matters of social welfare referred to in this Bill or covered in this Bill.  A minor amendment to <Col N="270" /> amendment No. 1 would cover that particular point.  The Minister should reconsider that the intent of the amendment, as is the intent of amendment No. 12, is to ensure that discrimination against women will be eliminated in fact as well as in law and that in the course of the administration of the Act there will be no tendency to continue with practices which have discriminated against women in the past.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider my amendment.  If he is willing to accept it in an amended form I would be quite prepared to re-enter it for the Report Stage and I hope we will have time to debate Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered in considerable detail whether it would be possible to put in that type of amendment to meet the Deputy's wishes but the more I went into it the more it became apparent that it would be unwise to try to incorporate either a part or the whole of the directive into the Act and the more it became apparent that it would be unwise legally to attempt to do a kind of double take on the situation.  The amendment put down by Deputy De Rossa is section 1 of article 4 of the directive and it would be very confusing to just put in that element of it.  The long title of the Bill makes it quite clear.  It is an Act to provide for equal treatment for men and women in matters of social welfare and for that purpose to amend the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 to 1984.  That is as broad as it can be.  Equally one has to stress that when this is enacted any person who feels that they are not getting equal treatment in accordance with the directive has an absolute legal right under the directive to pursue any complaint relevant to it.  That right should be kept separately.  To try to reinforce the existing legal basis would complicate the matter and the legal position. The directive stands in its own right. We must enact it.  I examined carefully the question of inserting a formulation of words into the Bill, but the more one worked on such a formulation the less evident it became that such a formulation was warranted.  We would diminish the <Col N="271" /> import of the directive which will be part of our general body of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about this area on Second Stage.  It is an area which most Deputies feel strongly about. I am disappointed to see many of the benches opposite vacant.  The Minister received a copy of the social welfare report from the Joint Committee.  Two members who felt most strongly about discriminatory questioning were members of the Minister's party, including the chairman, and several members of Fine Gael.  The consensus was that one of the biggest problems we as public representatives had in social welfare, particularly where married women were concerned, was that of discriminatory questioning.  We appreciated that the social welfare officers do not have specific guidelines as to the type of questioning that should take place and were entitled to ask whatever questions they felt were appropriate.  The only way to get over the kind of questioning Deputy De Rossa and others spoke about was to give power to the Minister to issue guidelines in relation to discriminatory questioning.</P>
      <P>If a married woman at present decides to go back to work the question which is asked by the examining officer is &ldquo;Who will mind your children&rdquo;?  That creates the impression that child neglect is largely brought about by women.  That is the implication in the question.  I have never come across a case where a married man going back to work was asked the same kind of question.  I feel strongly about this.  All members of the committee felt that some effort should be made in this legislation to try to come up with a solution.  I appreciate that the Minister tried to come up with a formulation of words, but perhaps the Department jealously guard the type of powers they have at present.  This opportunity should be available to be innovative in the Department and bring about a system where no married woman applying for benefits or payments can come back and say she was asked who would mind her children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> At present most married women bring a letter to the social welfare office from their mother, mother-in-law or aunt stating that they will mind the children.  That places an extra burden on them and it should not be necessary for the officers to do that.  Rather than adopt the attitude that these discriminatory questions should be asked of both sexes, they should be deleted altogether.  Either the Minister should accept our amendment or state that he is about to issue guidelines which would ensure that this kind of discriminatory questioning does not continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give one absolute assurance to the Deputy.  In the context of equal treatment legislation, guidelines will be issued to all exchanges directing that any bias or perceived bias in questioning or inquiries made of women claimants in particular as to their availability for work should be deleted.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in that I do not think child minding is or should be exclusively the responsibility of a woman as a social welfare applicant.  I gave that assurance to ICTU when I met them recently.  I am not certain that everyone will be satisfied but when the guidelines are issued I will make the content of them available to the House and the Deputies here present.  It would be very unwise to incorporate the directive as such into the Bill.  I do not know of any other area where this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not question the Minister's intention in eliminating discrimination.  I welcome the commitment he has given to issue guidelines in relation to how women and all social welfare recipients are to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These guidelines will not have the force of law.  Where a woman feels she has been discriminated against in relation to the form of questioning asked or the decision made, which may be in breach of the guidelines but not in breach of the Bill as interpreted in law, what redress will she have?  I take it from what the Minister said in reply to a previous question that if the directive is breached there will be <Col N="273" /> a case in law on that basis.  Is the Minister saying that the directive will take precedence over the Bill as it may be interpreted by the courts?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We would need to have conclusive information about the general position.  We do not have that. Much of social welfare research is anecdotal and personal.  Enormous pressures in the social welfare system make it difficult to do research, as staff must be released to compile data, but recently we took a sample of 100 unemployment benefit cases involving married women. Fifty cases were allowed and 50 were disallowed.  The survey was carried out in the major Dublin exchange in Cumberland Street.  Of the 50 allowed cases, 36 were cases of women with children and of the 50 disallowed cases 36 had children. Of those, 31 were disallowed on the basis that they were not available for or seeking work, but of the 50 allowed cases and the 50 disallowed cases an equal number had children.  I am not trying to derive a trend from that.  One would need to examine a very large number of sample cases before reaching any conclusion as to whether there was any inherent bias.</P>
      <P>The main point I would make &mdash; and this relates to the first point I made about the amendment in the names of Deputies De Rossa and Mac Giolla &mdash; is that the amendment would enlarge very much the scope of non-discrimination in areas where the directive does not apply.  The amendment in the name of Deputy McCarthy would be almost impossible to incorporate because of the lack of definition of the various issues it raises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might be convinced of the fairness of the process of investigating and questioning on the basis of the 100 cases that were examined, but he must be aware that the precedents in relation to discriminatory questioning have been well established in the context of applications for unemployment benefit.  Therefore, I am disappointed that the Minister has not tried in some way to adopt our amendments.  While I <Col N="274" /> accept his good intentions in regard to endeavouring to ensure that there is not discriminatory questioning, something more concrete is needed.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the Minister would abhor any degree of discriminatory questioning, but we must not leave the matter vague in the legislation.  I am convinced that the questioning which applies now in relation to unemployment benefit will be followed through in respect of claims for unemployment assistance.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has stated, married women who have children experience much difficulty in their applications for unemployment benefit especially if they have lost their jobs by reason of being unavailable for work beyond the period of the maternity grant payment. Obviously, employers would not be able to hold the jobs for these women for an extended period.  In some cases six months might elapse before a woman was fit and well enough to return to work and she would then have to apply for another job.  Many of the women in these circumstances I have encountered have been clearly seeking work, having enrolled with the National Manpower Service and with various employment agencies.  If a woman is not successful in obtaining a job she must then go before an investigating officer in respect of her applications for unemployment benefit and must produce a note from a mother-in-law or perhaps from a neighbour to the effect that this other person is looking after the woman's children.  Since that precedent is well established I am convinced that it will pertain in respect of unemployment assistance.  The investigating officers are well used to this practice.  Therefore, unless the Minister endeavours to incorporate in the Bill a format on the lines of that proposed in my amendment, there will be problems for women in this area. I appeal to him to copperfasten the equality rights of women by accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might say that women who have children are lucky, but unless the amendment or a similar one is accepted they will be discriminated against in the social welfare code because they are supposed <Col N="275" /> to be the ones to stay at home and mind the children.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked, rightly, whether we ever hear of a husband being asked, on applying for unemployment assistance, to prove that there is someone to take care of his children. Is this responsibility to rest solely with the woman?  It would be an error of judgment on the part of the Minister if the legislation should be passed without ensuring that discriminatory questioning will not be allowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was replying earlier to a point I raised, he said that of course it would be an offence under this legislation to subject an applicant for unemployment assistance to discriminatory questioning but that the applicant would have to prove that there was discriminatory questioning. The only way in which there could be such proof would be by way of the applicant having someone else with her while being investigated by an officer from the Department, but to allow that sort of practice would be to open the gates to all kinds of things.  I, too, accept the bona fides of the Minister's good intentions, but the mere expression of good intentions will not be of much use to the thousands of married women who are subjected to this type of questioning. Practical application is far more important and that is why I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.  He has referred to difficulties that might arise, but perhaps he will tell us whether those difficulties were represented by the Department or by the parliamentary draftsman.  The Department will always guard jealously whatever powers they have, but it would be unfortunate if the opposition to the acceptance of this amendment came directly from the Department as opposed to coming from any other quarter.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way in the area of equality in the home.  The rearing of children is no longer the sole responsibility of women.  It is being shared equally by men, and we should recognise this fact.  One of the most positive ways of recognising it would be for the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I am pleased to see Deputy Barnes here.  Before she arrived I had been saying to the Minister that we had ample proof in our deliberations as members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights that this type of questioning takes place.  The Minister says there is not sufficient proof of this in the Department.  Without ever referring to the committee, inquiries from individual Members on both sides of the House would provide ample proof that women are subjected to discriminatory questioning by officers of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not here for the beginning of this very important debate.  It is ironic that I was trying to deal with a case of a married woman who has been refused unemployment benefit. The reason given rightly or wrongly, particularly in employment exchanges, is that, as she had a husband, they could not give her her entitlement.  Yet she was a social welfare contributor.  It highlights existing thinking.  Unfortunately, as women in this country, we have discovered to our cost that unless there is backup legislation, even with the greatest amount of goodwill on the part of legislators and Ministers, that is not sufficient, equality does not obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way we can enforce real equality here is to have the necessary back-up legislation.  I am afraid that the spirit of such legislation is never acknowledged ahead of its implementation.  This has led to a tremendous amount of injustice being meted out to women, pressure being put on them, leaving them with a sense of guilt.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, in the examples of cases of which we hear as public representatives, it is not only the sense of injustice that affects married women but the sense of guilt plied on top of that during their interrogation &mdash; I use that word deliberately because it is not a compassionate or discreet questioning.  I should like the Minister to confirm that there will be an improvement effected even when a woman asserts herself to the extent that she appeals such injustice and appears <Col N="277" /> before the appeals tribunal because, very often, the appeals tribunal upholds the discriminatory attitude shown her in the first place.  It would appear that the same kind of prejudicial and traditional thinking obtains within many appeal tribunals. Even if such an appeals mechanism remains can the Minister ensure that these tribunals will in the future act in a fair, unbiased and unprejudiced manner?</P>

      <P>It is most important in a debate such as this to appreciate four incontrovertible facts.  First, the vast majority of married women who claim unemployment benefit get unemployment benefit in their own right.  There is no doubt about that.  Second &mdash; and I want this very clearly on the record &mdash; the majority of married women who are paid unemployment benefit have children. That is another incontrovertible fact. Third, the women and the families concerned, the spouses concerned, have a whole range of child-minding arrangements. It is quite evident that there is a wide variety of child-minding arrangements which are reported when questions are asked.  There is also one remaining fact.  There is the tendency on the part of Members of the Oireachtas to differentiate sharply between the administrators of the system and its recipients.  I have now been almost 17 years in this House.  Social welfare staffs, as I know them &mdash; they happen to be Irish men and women similar looking to the rest of us &mdash; are not the kind of genderless chauvinist, bureaucratic animal prowling the administrative highways and by-ways seeking out married women, ascertaining whether they wear wedding rings, asking them personal questions, looking at them and questioning them as to whether they have child-bearing characteristics.  They too happen to be people who are married, or unmarried, who have children, or who have not children.  I am not making these allegations against anybody here but there is such a public perception of them. They too have spouses who claim social welfare and who do not claim social welfare. They have spouses who work and do not work.  They are part of our public <Col N="278" /> service administrative structure.  The only absolute assurance I can give this House is that the guidelines very clearly and specifically direct the officers concerned to adhere to the non-discriminatory aspects and ensure that in no way will they ignore those guidelines.  Officers do not ignore guidelines; their job is to implement them in good faith.  I have to accept that people who work in the administrative system work in good faith. The main reason I am not at all anxious to enshrine the directive provisions in the Bill itself is that, for example, if one takes article 5 of the Directive it states very clearly:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that any laws, regulations and administrative provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment are abolished.</P>
      <P>The guidelines and the way the people implement the system on behalf of our people constitute the administrative structure.  We must very clearly ensure that within that administrative structure, there is no bias or discrimination.  Any applicant who feels discriminated against has absolute recourse to the appeals system of the Department.  They have absolute recourse to the courts and to taking an action under article 5 against the State.  Article 5 very clearly outlaws administrative or statutory discrimination. The directive itself is so explicit in that area it would be unwise to incorporate part of it in the Bill or to endeavour to summarise it in another way and insert it in the Bill.  The directive is there &mdash; God knows it was signed on 19 December 1978 &mdash; and we have had long enough to implement it.  I am endeavouring to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am very anxious to have the Bill enacted and <Col N="279" /> to get the colossal amount of administrative work under way in having its provisions implemented.</P>
      <P>Within the Department of Social Welfare staffs get very irate &mdash; I am not suggesting that Deputies here this morning are involved in such allegations &mdash; feeling that they are accused of singling out married women with children in a uniquely separate way, and, even if they do, then the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that they will not do so in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is unbelievable because, up to the last couple of minutes I believed that he had good intentions.  I am now beginning to seriously doubt that.  Nobody here ever suggested that social welfare investigating officers were prowling our highways and byways &mdash; and I can tell the Minister that there are many highways and byways in my constituency.  I have a huge file of married women who have applied for social welfare benefit and who have been refused, and been refused on appeal. They were refused only because of the question asked: who is going to mind your children &mdash; when, because they did not have a signed letter initially from somebody, say, a mother-in-law or aunt stating that they were going to look after their children for them, they were refused.  The officer stated that they did not have satisfactory arrangements made.  That is not the business of the investigating officer.  They may get very irate when we complain but that is the greatest argument for including this provision. If we put in a section that makes it an offence to ask the question, they will not have to ask it anymore and those of us who are concerned will not have to complain about it anymore.  Investigating officers would welcome such a provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If women feel they are discriminated against they have recourse to the courts. Surely the Minister is not suggesting that married women should go to their solicitor and take a case like this to court? The vast majority of women who want to work want to do so because of financial <Col N="280" /> necessity and they would not have the kind of money required to bring a case like this to court.  There is ample evidence of these cases but perhaps the Department have not correlated the evidence. Public representatives have thousands of cases on their hands where this kind of discriminatory questioning has been the reason why married women are refused social welfare payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>An important point is that the vast majority of married women in Galway and other places who apply for unemployment benefit are paid unemployment benefit.  There is not an internal heel dragging on this question. Both the Department and I examined very carefully in the past week or two whether we could write into the Bill specific non-discriminatory legal provisions. We then examined the directive and short of repeating the directive in a new section in the Bill, which would be regarded by the parliamentary draftsman as being unnecessary, we do not know in what other way we could ensure that the directive is adhered to.  I accept the responsibility for that.  It is not possible to just take a Council directive and write it into the Bill.  The directive has been there since 1978 and I am the first Minister who has taken it seriously.  It will be implemented.  There is no departmental heel dragging or any reluctance to implement it.  When the guidelines are issued I am quite prepared to give copies to the Deputies and to the Dáil Library if there is a request for them.  The guidelines could be the subject of communications between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputies that as far as I am concerned discrimination will not be tolerated. Indeed as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn well knows, if there is a perceived discrimination or an actual discrimination there are plenty of lawyers who would bring the State to court and would win damages and costs, because any breach of the directive would be evident.  The Department of Social Welfare, no more than any other Government Department do not want to spend their time paying out damages and costs in legal actions <Col N="281" /> where it is evident that there has been a breach of the directive.  Admittedly, in terms of questions relating to the care of children and the social role of spouses in terms of their availability for work, there is an element of subjectivity but in all cases of assessing people's entitlement if they have exhausted their ordinary statutory entitlements, there is an element of subjectivity.  The main thing is to ensure that that subjectivity does not become discriminatory.</P>

      <P>In relation to the point the Minister made that the vast majority of married women who applied for unemployment benefit were successful, I assume that the Minister is not suggesting that they were successful because of a fairy godmother attitude by the Department but because it was their right to be awarded social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>We are debating something much more fundamental than the section and that is why I would remind the Minister that we accept that the male chauvinist pigs, the prejudices and the obstacles to women are not solely within the staff officers in the Department of Social Welfare.  I wish it were, as it would be an easy situation with which to cope. What we are talking about is the pervasive prevailing fundamental conditioned obstacles and discriminations against women, particularly married women in employment.  There is an accepted attitude that married women do not and should not have the right to work.  This attitude is clearly exposed in the social welfare system dealing with married <Col N="282" /> women and their unemployment benefits.  We are not just talking about one group of people.  It would be unfair to allege that the legislators are scape-goating one section of the community. We are trying to ensure that if we bring in long overdue legislation to right injustices we have enough teeth to enforce that legislation.  Our experience shows that under the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Opportunity Act the agencies that should have the guidelines are years later continuing to discriminate under the law.  That is why we are showing such concern and taking such time on this Bill this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I put down a parliamentary question seeking information about the number of married women who were applying for varying kinds of social welfare, including disability benefit and unemployment benefit and the numbers who were refused and who had to appeal and the numbers who were successful on appeal. At that time I was told that that kind of information was not available.  I put the question because of the numbers of women coming to me claiming that they were being refused either because they were married or because they had children. I wanted to see if I could compare the number of women who have been refused with the number of men who have been refused to see whether the number of women who were successful on appeal related in any way to the number of men who were successful on appeal against disallowance.  Perhaps the information is available now but at that time it was not available.  I am asking the Minister as part of his assurance here today that discrimination be eliminated and that perhaps this kind of information should be made available to ensure that discrimination, whether intentional or simply arising from the kind of conditions that Deputy Barnes has spoken about, where it arises can be seen and eliminated. I am asking the Minister if he will ensure that some kind of comparative figures will be made available so that Deputies in this House and the public in <Col N="283" /> general can see that from hence forward discrimination is not applied on the basis of marital status.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly said that of course the staff in the Department of Social Welfare are not the owners of Irish society. I have never claimed that and I do not know of anyone in this House who has so claimed, but obviously there are people who do.  My admiration for the public service rose by the day in my dealings with them.  However, having said that, it must be said that there are individuals who do a disservice to the Department of Social Welfare and the public service in general.  I presume that one will get that kind of problem in any job that one comes across in any area where people are dealing with the public.  Given the pressures that staff in the Department of Social Welfare work under and the huge increase in the numbers of people claiming social welfare at this time, it is not unexpected that nerves will fray and so forth.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that much of our information as regards how social welfare works, either in a discriminatory manner or otherwise, is anecdotal.  That is true, again because the kind of information I sought apparently is not available.  A number of women have come to me and claimed that simply because they were accompained to the labour exchange by a child they were disallowed and in one instance a single girl was disallowed because she happened to have her sister's child with her on the day she went in to claim unemployment assistance.  Presumably there is argument for and against, but not a single man has ever come to me to say that because he brought his son, daughter or whatever into the labour exchange he was disallowed.  Whatever the basis and however widespread it is, the evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, would seem to indicate some element of discrimination against women, particularly women with children.  That is the reason we here today are pressing the Minister so strongly to ensure that this kind of discrimination ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give the Minister the point the law in <Col N="284" /> itself will not end discrimination <i>in toto</i> in Irish society.  No matter how progressive we like to think ourselves, we are all to some extent sexist and discriminate against the opposite sex, and that is as true of women in certain instances as it is of men.  I have come across a number of women with daughters and sons who tell me that they would be delighted if their sons could get jobs but the girls can stay at home and mind the house or the child or whatever.  That is part of the conditioning that Deputy Barnes has spoken about and it goes across the board with both sexes.  No matter what laws we pass here, a much wider and broader approach towards education and so forth is required to end that ultimately.  However, in so far as we can do it here today, we should include in this Bill a section which will end discrimination against women in the social welfare code.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister saw fit a short time ago to embark on one of his now familiar ego trips.  We are dealing with a very serious problem and the longer this discussion goes on the less convinced I am of the ultimate intentions of the Department to ensure that these discriminatory questions will not be asked.  I am sorry that the Minister seems to be more and more concerned about the sensitivities of his investigating officers &mdash; I have no doubt they are well able to protect themselves &mdash; than he is about the sensitivities of married women with children who will be subject to this type of questioning.  This morning we have not heard the Minister assure us absolutely without equivocation that no women would be asked who was minding the children.  I am not convinced that these instructions will be given absolutely. We have tried to enshrine them within the Bill and at this point I have become disillusioned with the unsatisfactory answers I am getting.</P>

I assure the Ceann Comhairle and my colleagues that there is no argument about the need and the directive to end discriminatory administrative provisions.  The only point at discussion &mdash; I regard it purely as discussion &mdash; is how best to do it.  My view, supported by the legal and administrative advice I have received, is that ali of the provisions of the directive, including article 5, will be law on enactment of the Bill.  Secondly, the guidelines will be issued to make quite clear in detail the questions which are permitted to be asked regarding availability for work. Therefore, on that basis the amendments are not necessary.  I assure the Deputies that the intent and import of what they have said this morning will be implemented by me and by the Department of Social Welfare.  I cannot go any further than that.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment to tighten up the wording of the new definition of &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo;.  It provides for the substitution of the words &ldquo;the beneficiary&rdquo; by &ldquo;that person&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that amendment No. 3 was ruled out of order on the basis that it would involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  This is an unfortunate decision because I was merely trying to ensure that, where a wife worked part time or whole time for a relatively low income, her husband, if he was in receipt of any type of social welfare benefit, would not lose his dependency claim for her.  On Second Stage the Minister conceded that there were approximately 3,000 families where the income of the wife is on or below £50 per week. That leaves approximately 9,000 families, where the wife is working and the husband receiving welfare payments of one kind or another, with an income of £50 or upwards.  In at least half of those <Col N="287" /> 9,000 families, the wife has an income of between £50 and £100 per week, which is a meagre amount nowadays when costs are so high.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister gave notice of his intention to arrange, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that a spouse whose weekly wage is less than £50 per week would be regarded as a dependant, will he pursue that matter and consider raising the figure to £100?  This would ensure that most families &mdash; not all &mdash; in the lower income group would be accommodated and would not lose dependency claims or income from social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>My amendment was also ruled out of order.  I wanted a spouse who has weekly earnings of not more than £100 to be classified as an adult dependant.  I consider that the figure which the Minister has indicated he intends to set in the regulations &mdash; £50 &mdash; is far too low and that the consequent losses to families will be very severe.  I know that the Minister recognises that families will be hit by this section and that is why he indicated his intention to make regulations to ease the effect.  However, the floor of £50 is far too low; and I am sure the Minister is aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have made representations to many Deputies to the effect that the floor should have some relationship to average industrial earnings.  The figure of £100 suggested by the ICTU should be seriously considered by the Minister.</P>

The purpose of the subsection is to prevent the unemployment assistance scheme being used as a general top up on family income.  The amendment is necessary to tighten up the wording of the subsection.  I should like to make the broad point that where a person is in receipt of social welfare benefit he and she will be entitled to an increase in respect of the spouse who is not himself or herself in employment or in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The personal rate of unemployment assistance is higher than the increase of social welfare payable in respect of an adult dependant and, therefore, there would be an incentive for the spouse at home to seek unemployment assistance in his or her own right.  The unemployment assistance scheme is a means tested one to provide income maintenance for households in case of unemployment.  In a scheme of this kind it would be inequitable <i>vis-á-vis</i> the vast majority of families where there is one spouse in employment and one at home if other families could receive higher rates simply because the second spouse could show that he or she is available for work.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks, as the Minister said, to tighten up the section.  There is no reason to treat a married woman any differently from a single woman which, it appears, is being done in the section.  It appears that because a woman or a man is married &mdash; I may be misreading the section &mdash; they are discouraged from applying for unemployment benefit or will have the benefit <Col N="291" /> decreased more or less to the level of the adult dependants allowance.  If a person is single it appears that he or she will be entitled in the normal way to their unemployment benefit.  For that reason it appears that this is a reintroduction of discrimination.  Will the Minister clarify that matter?</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance scheme is a means tested scheme to provide income maintenance for households in case of unemployment. It is clearly a family household type scheme because the income of the wife is taken into account when assessing the husband's means for unemployment assistance purposes.  In a scheme of this nature it would be inequitable <i>vis-à-vis</i> the vast majority of families if one's spouse on household work would continue to receive the married rate of £56.40p if other families were to receive higher rates of £57.50p simply because both spouses could separately show that they were available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 (1) and (4) propose that families be compensated at the appropriate rate in respect of the contingency of unemployment.  It is regarded as a fair and reasonable way of applying the overall benefit.  Subsection (1) provides that where both spouses are eligible for unemployment assistance the total of their entitlements should not exceed the appropriate amount payable to a married couple where only one is claiming and the spouse is a dependant.  If both apply the subsection provides that each will be paid half of the total amount.  In the case of the unemployment assistance benefit subsection (4) provides that the amount of unemployment assistance would be adjusted accordingly, namely, that the applicant would only receive such an amount of unemployment assistance which, added to his or her spouse's personal benefit entitlement, would bring their overall entitlement up to the appropriate married rate.  There is no discrimination in that.  We have consulted our legal advisers on the issue and the restriction on the amount payable to a married <Col N="292" /> couple <i>vis-á-vis</i> an unmarried couple is not discriminatory in terms of the directive because marital status is not being used as a means of discriminating indirectly on the basis of sex.  A lot of work has been done in this area both at interdepartmental level and in consultation with successive Attorneys General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation.  If two persons are cohabiting they will both be entitled to their full unemployment benefit, assuming they have made the correct contributions, but where a couple are married, the total cannot exceed the amount which a spouse with an adult dependant would get.  To my mind, there is clear discrimination there between the couple who are married and the couple who are not.  Is that not the case?</P>

      <P>The directive is very clear.  It precludes discrimination on the basis of sex, whether direct or indirect. It is of considerable importance that we adhere to this directive because up to now a married woman did not have the entitlement to get half the total benefit, but from now on there is a specific statutory entitlement in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Discrimination may not be on grounds of sex but surely discrimination is on grounds of marital status. If the couple are not married both will get full unemployment benefit, but it seems that a married woman who is eligible for benefit by way of her own contributions is now relegated to being a dependant in order to regularise things and to keep her on the same level as the married woman who is really a dependant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Section 12 (1) provides <Col N="293" /> that where both spouses are eligible for unemployment assistance in their own right, the total of their entitlements should not exceed the appropriate amount paid to a married couple where one only is claiming and the spouse is a dependant.  If both apply the subsection provides that each would be paid half the amount.  In the case of unemployment assistance benefit, subsection 12 (4) is the mechanism for that adjustment.  That is the only way we could apply this directive. Otherwise there would be particular incentives built into the application of the directive which would be unsustainable.</P>

      <P>We have got to a point where there is an incentive being provided for women to remain dependants. Surely the purpose of this Bill was to end that situation where women would automatically become dependants. There is clearly no incentive for a woman to apply for benefit in her own right if there is no net gain for her.  This section will have the effect of encouraging women to remain as dependants of their spouses.</P>
      <P>I return to my original point: it seems that the spirit of article 4 is being breached &mdash; this is the section I attempted to have included in section 2.  The principle of equal treatment means that there should be no discrimination on grounds of sex either directly or indirectly by reference in particular to marital or family status.  By ensuring that a married woman cannot have the full unemployment benefit simply because she is married is discrimination on the basis of her marital status.  If she was single and cohabiting she would be entitled to the full unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The motivation behind this Bill is to allow women to get their fair and just return for their contributions.  It seems that by cutting back on the unemployment benefit to which the wife is entitled in her own right, we are in contravention of the legislation we are attempting to bring in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept <Col N="294" /> that.  The section confers a very important right on married women for the first time.  It confers the right of one half of the cash income provided by the State directly to herself and to her family.  If she remained a dependant she would not have the right to any of the cash payment. It would go direct to her husband.  That is the critical change.  The unemployment assistance scheme is means-tested.  It is designed to provide income maintenance to households in case of unemployment. It is a family household type of scheme and the income of the wife or husband is taken into account, at the moment, in assessing the husband's means for unemployment assistance.  We are not cutting back at all on benefits paid for contributions. This has nothing to do with unemployment benefit but everything to do with unemployment assistance.  We are dealing only with cases where one spouse is on unemployment assistance, or both. It has been very carefully examined at departmental level and the Attorney General's advice, of which we are quite confident in terms of comprehensive examination, is that this is in accordance with the directive.  That is because we are not discriminating on grounds of sex, which is the important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The points still stand.  The Minister is stressing that the discrimination is not on the grounds of sex.  However, it seems from article 4 that there is discrimination in relation to marital or family status in section 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that the effect will not be that women will remain dependants of their husbands, because there will be no benefit for them to go through a separate means test and the various inquiries which have to be made in that regard.  It would be easier and simpler for them to <Col N="295" /> remain as dependants.  The intention of this Bill and of the directive is being defeated in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think one has any option but to apply the directive on this basis.  The alternative which one can pose is for one spouse to draw all the benefit.  For the sake of argument, the wife would draw the unemployment benefit for herself and her dependent husband. He could, for example, go off then and gain employment.  That would clearly be inequitable.  The scheme would be impossible to administer.  The advice I have received is that restricting the amount payable to a married couple in that framework is not discriminatory in terms of the directive.  Marital status is not being used as a means of discriminating indirectly on the basis of sex.  The directive precludes such discrimination, whether direct or indirect, on the basis of marital or family status.</P>
      <P>I have gone into this matter with considerable care and the kernel of the whole issue is that unemployment assistance is a family means-tested scheme and the income of one spouse is taken into account in assessing the entitlement of the other spouse.  Where both spouses are receiving unemployment assistance on a separate basis, the total payment should not exceed what would be paid to a married couple where one is working. That does not diminish the rights of married women, rather does it divide the total payment for a married couple 50-50.</P>

      <P>An assessment for unemployment assistance purposes is still <Col N="296" /> made.  There are two separate claims, but the social welfare officer would be entitled to inquire as to the precise income of the individual person.  When two people are cohabiting they would receive separate payments, having been assessed in terms of actual income.  We are talking exclusively about unemployment assistance.  There would still be a degree of assessment.  Admittedly, the social welfare officer may have difficulty in establishing the precise degree of income, one with the other, but nevertheless the principle of assessment would still apply, particularly with a couple on a common law or cohabitation basis, applying for unemployment assistance from the same address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the point I made.  Will section 12, as amended by the Minister's own amendment, apply in the same way to a couple in those circumstances as it will to a married couple?  We are talking about whether this discriminates against a woman on the basis that she is married. The Minister has not yet refuted to my satisfaction that section 12 will not apply to common law husband and wife in the circumstances to which I refer and that both will be entitled to their full unemployment assistance, assessed presumably on the basis of both incomes, not reduced by section 12 to the level of unemployment assistance and adult dependant's allowance.  Therefore, there is a clear case that married women are being discriminated against in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 does not necessarily aid the cohabiting couple because they may have great difficulty in coming within the framework of the definition of &ldquo;household&rdquo; and, therefore, their entitlement will be reduced.  I do not think the measure confers any exception or entitlement on a cohabiting couple or on a common law couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede quite readily that this is a difficult area.  There are many areas in social welfare, including the question of cohabitation, where it would be <Col N="297" /> extremely interesting if there was available a comprehensive body of law. However, we have to work within the framework we have at present.  In the years ahead I can see considerable legislative difficulty, particularly in terms of defining cohabitation and household, but we have to work on what we have at the moment.  I wish to assure Deputies that in farming this legislation I have not discriminated against married persons <i>vis-à-vis</i> unmarried persons on the basis of sex discrimination.  The directive specifically refers to discrimination on the grounds of sex.  That is the critical aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the vast majority of adult dependants are women.  Because of the way our social welfare system has developed, in most cases it is the married woman who is automatically accepted as an adult dependant.  Whether it is explicit or implicit discrimination, that discrimination exists.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer and I am somewhat diffident about arguing the case too far. However, a case was brought in relation to the income tax code where it was found unconstitutional to treat married couples differently from single persons for the purposes of tax allowances.  I am of the opinion as a lay person that this principle would apply here also, that there is an implicit discrimination in the section against women in particular because generally they are the adult dependants we are talking about.  For that reason I oppose it.</P>

    <P>(x) any moneys, except so far as they exceed £104 per year, received by such person or by the spouse of such person in respect of work of the kind referred to in paragraph 7 of Part I of the First Schedule, under a scheme that is, in the opinion of the Minister, charitable in character and purpose,</P>
    <P>(xi) where he or his spouse is engaged on a seasonal basis in the occupation of fishing, one-half of so much of the income derived therefrom as does not exceed £120 per year and one-third of so much of such income as exceeds £120 per year but does not exceed £300 per year,</P>
    <P>(xii) any moneys received under a statutory scheme administered by the Minister for Labour in respect of redundancy or by way of financial assistance to unemployed persons changing residence;</P>
    <P>(c) the yearly value ascertained in the prescribed manner of any advantage accruing to him or to his spouse from&mdash;</P>

    <P>(2)  For the purposes of subsections (1) (b) and (1) (e), the income of a person shall, in the absence of other means of ascertaining it, be taken to be the income actually received during the year immediately preceding the date of calculation.</P>
    <P>(3)  For the purposes of this section, &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;, in relation to a person, means a spouse who is living with, and not apart from, that person.</P>
    <P>I would stress that there is no change of substance being made in this amendment and no new principles as such are being introduced. The purpose of the amendment is to improve the general wording of the legislation.  The section amends section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 which deals with the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes.  Under existing provisions the husband only can apply and any earnings of his wife are taken into account under the heading of &ldquo;income he may expect to receive as head of a household&rdquo;.  This expression would be incompatible with the principle of equal treatment in the context of both spouses being able to apply for unemployment assistance and has to be abolished in any event.  In all means-tested schemes the <Col N="302" /> earnings of the spouse are taken into account and there would be no reason to depart from this principle in the context of the opening up of the unemployment assistance scheme to married women. Section 13, therefore, provides the changes necessary to effect this.  As initially drafted section 13 did this in a global way.  On further consultation with the draftsman it has been decided that the better approach is to amend section 146. In effect what is happening is that the expression &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; is being deleted and where the section refers to &ldquo;income of the applicant to be assessed as means&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or his spouse&rdquo; are being added.</P>

      <P>While respecting the decision of the Ceann Comhairle in regard to my amendment, it is unfortunate that it has been ruled out of order because it was tabled solely for the purpose of compensating those families where both husband and wife are in receipt of social welfare payments for the actual loss of £20 per week which they will suffer as a result of the implementation of the directive.  An average overall loss of £20 per week is a significant loss for persons in these circumstances.  I welcome <Col N="306" /> the directive but it is unfortunate that families, and especially in cases where both parents are relying totally on social welfare payments, should suffer such loss of income.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate the Minister intimated that in such circumstances he would recommend payment of £10 per week for a period of not more than one year to such families.  However, even if this payment is made the families will still be short to the extent of £20 in their weekly incomes.  To some people that might not seem a lot of money but it could be considerable to families in the social welfare category who are depending on those payments for the necessities of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that it was incorrect to rule the amendment out of order but that may not be such an important point at this stage.  The intent of my amendment was to render it mandatory on the Minister to introduce the regulations he has promised.  The amendment that was tabled by Deputy McCarthy and which also has been ruled out of order sought to provide for a scaled reduction over a period of six years and that is a proposal with which we would have agreed.  It also formed part of the submission we received from the Congress of Trade Unions.  It seems a reasonable way of mitigating the effects on low income families in regard to the losses they will suffer as a result of the equalisation legislation.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has promised a payment of £10 for one year or for the duration of the receipt of a given benefit, whichever is the shorter.  When the loss could be anything up to £30 or £40 per week I do not really think that £10 constitutes sufficient compensation; particularly when one considers that after a year, or less, the £10 will disappear, it is not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an amendment relating to the regulations which the Minister proposes <Col N="307" /> introducing and I shall deal in somewhat more detail with the question of compensation when we come to that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20 is an enabling section and provides special arrangements for the continuance of particular rights.  I propose making regulations providing transitional alleviating measures in cases where both spouses are on benefit when equal treatment is introduced.  In a number of cases at present a husband would normally be receiving an adult dependant's increase in respect of his wife even though she is also drawing benefit in her own right.  In effect the social welfare system at present is paying double for that person.  Since we must provide equal treatment, and henceforth a spouse on benefit would not be deemed to be an adult dependant, unquestionably there is a problem which must be resolved with regard to the loss which could arise for a number of married men who would lose out on that basis.  In those cases we propose to reinstate half of the loss.  I stress that it is in a situation in which the spouse is working or drawing benefit that this arises, so that the people concerned have a degree of income over and above the average income of families generally.</P>
      <P>I have been looking at the mitigating measures.  At the same time I must implement them in such a way that they could not be made a permanent feature of the equal treatment provisions.  Otherwise we would be in breach of the directive itself.  I take the point made by Deputies but this is as far as I can go at this stage in terms of available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not at least considered the purpose of my amendment, that these changes should not be made in one fell swoop since it has taken us from 1978 until now to implement the directive.  I do not blame the present Minister alone for that. It would not be unreasonable to expect that a loss such as that which will be incurred could be compensated for, in a percentage fashion, on a phased basis <Col N="308" /> over, say, a six year period, which would constitute a real mitigation.</P>
      <P>On the Minister's own figures there are 8,000 families who will be affected, who will lose £20 per week as a consequence of these provisions, which is a considerable number.  To force them into a position in which, for one year, they will incur an average loss of £10 per week, after which they will have to bear the full brunt of what would be a loss of £20 in real terms, to my mind, is not availing of the provisions of the section in their fullest meaning. The Minister should have endeavoured to fully mitigate the loss resulting from the implementation of the directive.  I would appeal to him to increase the £10 to £20 per week, phasing it out over the one year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputies want this to happen but I would have grave reservations about it: in the case of, say, disability or unemployment benefit are we in favour of the husband claiming disability benefit, getting payment for two children &mdash; if there are two children in the family &mdash; while, simultaneously, his wife draws disability benefit in her own right, separately, and she receives a new payment at the enhanced male rate which would comprise an additional £4.50?  I merely pose the question: where does it end, where can it end? We are not talking about circumstances in which a husband or wife is at home with no income with one of them drawing benefit.  This is a case where the wife or husband is at work, in paid employment, and simultaneously the second spouse is drawing benefit for the other.  On an equality definition of that nature there is equality but there is also a problem of inequality and a problem of the proper usage of particularly scarce resources. Therefore, I wonder where we draw the line.  We must draw the line and one cannot have equality of treatment if, simultaneously, a husband is drawing benefit for himself, his wife and two children and she is drawing benefit in her own right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The medium term policy of the Government with regard to reform of the taxation system is set out in chapter 6 of the national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i>  In so far as the PAYE sector is concerned the plan pledges that the Government will, over the period of the plan, adjust tax bands and allowances each year so that the overall income tax burden on taxpayers will not increase.  The relief provided in the 1985 Budget for PAYE taxpayers met this pledge in respect of the first year of the plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the tax payable by the PAYE sector in 1985 will be higher than that taken from them in 1984 and that, in effect, the take-home pay of most PAYE workers will have seen no improvement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of fact set out in the various budgetary documents published that total income tax revenue in 1985 will be greater than in 1984.  The <Col N="310" /> projection for total income tax revenue for 1985 is £2.13 billion and the outturn for 1984 is £1.966 billion.  As far as PAYE receipts are concerned, to the extent that they can be estimated, the outturn for 1984 was £1,682 million and the projection for 1985 is £1,860 million.  In 1984 PAYE tax accounted for 86 per cent of total income tax.  We expect that that proportion will be about 87 per cent in 1985.  The total income base on which tax is being levied will increase by an amount much larger than the extra taxation, so that the relative burden of taxation is going down.  Had we not made the changes we made in the budget, the expected tax revenue from income tax and PAYE in 1985 would be considerably larger than it is now.  It is not true to say that the burden is increasing.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is an inequitable situation disclosed by the Minister's figures and does he propose to do anything about implementing the recommendations of the income tax commission about which he has spoken in his last three budget speeches and, if so, what proposals will the Minister adopt from that report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entirely agree with the Deputy that the figures I have given out show an inequity.  The vast bulk of total income is employee income, so it is natural that a large proportion of total income tax receipts come from employees.  As far as the First Report of the Commission on Taxation is concerned, I would be happy to have a debate with the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order here.  But Deputies should think about this: were we to introduce the main recommendation of the Commission on Taxation, that is, a single rate of income tax on all income with the expenditure tax proposal which most people seem to have forgotten about, the result would be immediately a single tax rate in the region of 35 per cent, which would substantially <Col N="311" /> increase the tax burden on people at the lower end of the income tax scale.  I do not think that is what the Deputy would have in mind.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister specify any steps he is taking to ease the burden on the PAYE taxpayer, particularly in relation to the special 1 per cent income levy, and whether or not he intends to change the situation where tax is levied on total income even though there are health contributions, Youth Employment Agency levies and so on deducted from the gross figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detail all the steps because that would require a rerun of the budget provisions in relation to income tax for 1983, 1984 and 1985.  I will draw attention to the changes in this year's budget &mdash; the increase in personal allowances, the increases in the exemption limits, the increases in the various associated limits, the fact that we have reduced the number of tax rates to three, the fact that we have reduced the top tax rate from 65 per cent to 60 per cent, that we have replaced the two central rates of 45 per cent and 55 per cent by a single rate at 48 per cent.  This combination <Col N="312" /> of measures means that for any given taxpayer a bigger proportion of income is now liable to income tax at a lower rate than it was heretofore.</P>
      <P>As far as the 1 per cent levy is concerned, in 1984 we exempted incomes up to a certain level from the operation of that.  We increased the level of that exemption this year, and I remind Deputy De Rossa that in chapter 6 of the plan we made the firm statement that that levy will be phased out as soon as possible.  Those are just the most recent measures.  A longer list would take far longer to give out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce legislation on the lines proposed by the Deputy.  I would not consider it desirable to make any special provision in this matter relating to marriage in the Income Tax Acts.  Provisions regarding the status of common law spouses should be contained in the general law relating to marriage and would be reflected in relevant income tax legislation.  If the Deputy has in mind any particular cases, which he wishes to bring to my attention I will have the matter investigated, an invitation to him which I repeat and <Col N="315" /> which I made on the last occasion when he put down a question on this.  Presumably the Deputy is aware of the special status accorded in the Constitution to the institution of marriage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to situations where the institution of marriage as referred to in the Constitution has broken down and the Constitution denies the right to persons to have a divorce.  Where a second relationship is established and a spouse, usually the woman because of the nature of our society, is dependent on the common law husband, in those circumstances the man, the person working and paying tax, is not permitted to claim allowances for her. Can the Minister give any indication of either official or unofficial arrangements that are made or can be made to overcome that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The question appears to have a wider ambit than that which Deputy De Rossa has now given.  On 13 December last I answered Question No. 103 put down by Deputy De Rossa where he spoke specifically of cases where persons had remarried in various circumstances. I am afraid that the answer to the question in that case is the same as it is now.  Briefly and most succinctly the answer to the question is really that this is a matter of law relating to marriage and not a matter of income tax law.  The provisions of income tax law are inevitably reflected in law as it relates to marriage, but I do not think it would be correct in effect to change the law relating to marriage via income tax law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of the European Regional Fund which has been spent in Kerry; the amount for the past five years; and the portion of the total spent on industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy on 28 February 1985 it is not altogether meaningful to speak of receipts from the European Regional Development Fund being spent in a particular <Col N="316" /> area.  Receipts from the Fund are paid to the Exchequer as partial reimbursement of expenditure already made through the Public Capital Programme on projects approved for Regional Fund aid and are used to increase the overall level of resources available for further regional development through the Public Capital Programme.  Since the Fund was set up in 1975 a total of about £IR14 million has been allocated from the Fund in respect of expenditure in County Kerry under the Public Capital Programme. The amounts for 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984 were IR£0.903 million, IR£0.671 million, IR£1.818 million, IR£2.150 million and IR£5.795 million respectively.  The portion of the total since 1975 allocated for industrial development was IR£3.121 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred correctly to the practice having been that the Regional Fund moneys are utilised in ease of the Exchequer.  Would he not agree with me that that is entirely a wrong principle, one to which the Commission objects very strongly in both our case and the case of other countries?  Will he not agree that these moneys would be far better utilised if they were spent through agencies here rather than being channelled into the Exchequer in ease of Exchequer difficulties and used by the Exchequer to reduce its liabilities to areas like County Kerry and elsewhere throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The short answer is that I would not agree to any of that.  The funds are not, as Deputy Lenihan alleges, being used by the Exchequer to ease its own liabilities to Kerry or anywhere else. The resources available from the Regional Fund increase the total amount available in this country for regional development purposes.  I do not agree that the system we use is a bad one. Numbers of my predecessors, including Deputy Fitzgerald who is sitting over there, took the same view.  I do not detect anything in the record that suggests that Deputy Fitzgerald was agitating for a different way of doing things while he held <Col N="317" /> the office which I now have the honour to hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the final part of Deputy Lenihan's question, let me point out that it is a condition of Regional Fund aid that part of the funding for the project in question be made available by the national Exchequer of the recipient country so that in any case there has to be an input from the recipient country.  The process Deputy Lenihan is suggesting we adopt would complicate things unnecessarily and probably &mdash; a very distinct probability &mdash; would reduce the efficiency of the planning of the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, as outlined in his document published the other day &mdash; the receipts document for the first half of this year &mdash; that including a line relating to the European Development Fund under Exchequer receipts merely amounts to a simple transfer grant from the Community to the Exchequer and bears no relationship whatever to what should be a regional development policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree.  It seems inevitable and properly in keeping with the most elementary principles of a country if the Exchequer receives funding that that be properly recorded in that table but, of course, the Deputy is looking at the other side of the table which shows how the moneys are expended from the Exchequer.  The fact that receipts from the ERF are included in that table in that manner has no bearing and makes no comment on the way in which the policy works.</P>

      <P>I will confine it to Kerry.  The sentiments expressed by my colleague are so right.  I appreciate that the Minister has no local authority experience, that he is not a member of a local authority, but will he accept from me that the principle as operated by the Minister for Finance be it himself or any predecessor and the Department of Finance, is not in the best interests of the infrastructural development of counties like Kerry, simply because the authority best equipped to handle that development is the local authority, in this case the Kerry County Council?  Rather than what is happening at present with basically the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance keeping reins on the development, will he not accept that the infrastructural needs of counties like Kerry, far removed from the centre, are far greater than the infrastructural needs of the immediate Dublin area?  Will he not accept that there is a need to change the system which has continued since the Regional Fund was first introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of my regrets that at the moment &mdash; and I expect for quite some time &mdash; I am statute barred from experience of local authorities, but then life is long and God is good and one never knows what might happen.  I do not agree that the most appropriate way of handling these funds would be in the manner suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission carry out their own lobbying and we will discuss everything constructively with the Commission.  It is not the case that local authorities have a comprehensive role or would be given a comprehensive role under the Government's very constructive decentralisation proposals, and even less under the rag of a proposal that came out from the Opposition, in the generation and carrying through of the kind of projects which are covered by the Regional Development Fund.  In many cases the local authority do not have a direct function in that matter so it would be totally inappropriate to carry out that suggestion.  Neither is it the case, as Deputy Fitzgerald was trying to claim, that the system of allocating Regional Fund moneys and accounting for them amounts to the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance keeping reins on development.  In the nature of the fund regulation, with which I am sure the Deputy is fully familiar, the projects have to conform to a certain number of criteria laid down by Council regulation, with which we have agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Bluster is no answer to proper analysis.  Our experience up to now has been that in every year we have had more than enough qualifying projects in order to be able to take up our total <Col N="320" /> entitlement from the Regional Development Fund.  It is not a case of projects being reined in.  We have more projects than are required to take up our total entitlement.  It is a question of ensuring that our own action through the Public Capital Programme gives the maximum support and uses our entitlement from the Regional Fund to the maximum benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a restriction on many projects which do not qualify on the criteria laid down?  It is about time that the Minister examined the criteria used so that there will be a spread between projects submitted by individuals, communities or groupings and those which have been examined and approved by the Department of Finance.  We had several laudable projects which would have given great benefit and required very little Exchequer input.  It has been accepted by European Parliament officials who came here that projects from individuals and communities should be examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputies opposite are going to start off with this old claptrap about Ministers for Finance and the Department of Finance, they might as well forget about it and go home because they are only obstructing the giving of a proper answer to Deputy Leonard.  It is not true that there are projects which have been turned down and which would have benefited from assistance from the Regional Fund with very little input from the Exchequer.  It is a condition of qualification for assistance from the Regional Fund that there be a substantial Exchequer contribution from the recipient country. There is no case where it can be said that projects have not been assisted from the Regional Fund although they would not have cost the Exchequer money.  That <Col N="321" /> cannot happen under the regulations. Given the fact that we always have enough projects to use up our total entitlement, if we were to switch from one project to another or bring in a project which had not been foreseen for participation, the result would be that a similar project would be pushed out.  As long as we produce enough projects to use up our total entitlement from the Regional Fund, it does not particularly matter which projects are in and which projects are out for the purpose of the Regional Fund.</P>

During the past year Fóir Teoranta have been organising seminars and talks throughout the country in order to bring to the notice of smaller firms the services they provide.

The figures the Minister has just given in relation to Fóir Teoranta bear out that basic malaise in regard to investment here, particularly in manufacturing industry.</P>

I would caution Deputy Lenihan in using the excellent publication to which he referred to check out the definitions of manufacturing investment and its place in overall investment before dribbling that class of a bibful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will amend legislation so that redundant workers who have excessive tax deducted from lump sum redundancy payments will be entitled to receive interest on the overdeduction when it is repaid similar to the manner in which self-employed who over-pay tax are entitled to have interest added to their repayments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to amend the legislation in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Lump sum redundancy payments are properly chargeable to tax, subject to certain measures of relief.  It is an inherent feature of the relieving legislation that part of the relief may be given at the time of payment of the lump sum and a further measure of relief cannot be given until the end of the tax year in question. Any such end of year payment is, accordingly, a relief and cannot properly be described as a repayment of an overdeduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to explain that latter remark.  I was under the impression, like all workers who receive redundancy payments, that they would get a refund at the end of the year, because in the majority of cases they are overtaxed.  That refund does not include any interest on the overpayment <Col N="328" /> made, although in the case of the self-employed who also pay what the Minister calls properly assessed tax and who over-pay their tax refund includes interest on the overpayment.  That does not apply to redundant workers.  Why is it that the same regulation does not apply to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is starting from a false premise.  In the first place the legislation governing relief for lump sum redundancy payments is fairly complex. Essentially, it consists of a basic exempt amount which is calculated on whichever one of several bases is most favourable to the taxpayer in question. There is then a further measure of relief, called top slicing relief, on the taxable balance, if there is a taxable balance, after the first exempt amount has been allowed for.  The top slicing relief is a specially calculated rate of tax based on the taxpayer's average rate of tax over the five years up to and including the tax year in which the lump sum payment is made.</P>
      <P>The basic exemption is mainly given at a time of payment of the lump sum but the top slicing relief cannot be calculated until the end of the tax year.  It is in that context that a further relief is given at the end of the year since it is based on the average rate of tax paid by the taxpayer in the five years up to and including the year in which the relief has been paid.  It is in the nature of the system that a part of the relief falls to be paid only at the end of that tax year and is not properly regarded, or cannot be, as repayment of an amount overpaid in the first instance. It is a further relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second contention of Deputy Mac Giolla, I should like to point out that he is relying on a comparison between interest paid in relation to the refunds of taxes overpaid by self-employed persons. That, of course, is something that very seldom arises in practice.  It arises only in the case of the payment of specified amounts of tax by self-employed persons where the specified amount turns out in the event to be in excess of the liability. As Deputy Mac Giolla knows, in the vast majority of cases the specified amount <Col N="329" /> turns out to be less than the final liability and the reason for paying the specified amounts as set out in the legislation is to avoid incurring interest on the balance that turns out to be due.</P>
    <P>In general terms, in the PAYE system there is no provision for the payment of interest either on refunds of overdeducted tax or on payments of tax underpaid. For example, where there is substantial underpayment, for whatever reason, of tax in a PAYE case, no interest is charged on the amount and, in fact, the most common method of recovering underpayments of PAYE is on the basis of a restriction of tax free allowances over one or several years without any charge of interest being made.  Deputy Mac Giolla is making a comparison that, strictly speaking, is not relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister gave us a rather extended reply and I will be able to pore over it at my leisure when I get a copy of the Official Report. The Minister's reply is not satisfactory to the PAYE sector or workers who are made redundant.  Is the Minister saying that what one loses on the roundabouts in the PAYE sector one makes up for in the swings?  If that is the case some people are on the swings all the time and never get to the roundabouts in regard to over and underpayments.  That is not a fair method for deciding on interest rates on overpayments.  In regard to redundancy, is the Minister saying that the relief to which the redundant worker is entitled but which cannot be calculated until a year later is not subject to interest on the relief held back from him for one year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making anything like the point about swings and roundabouts that Deputy Mac Giolla has just mentioned.  The essential point I should like to make is that, in relation to the self-employed, income tax repayments, the payment of interest on amounts overdeducted does not happen.  In certain circumstances there may be a payment in cases where the specified amount turns out to be in excess of the finally determined <Col N="330" /> liability.  Those cases are very rare.  I could wish from another point of view that they were less rare.</P>
      <P>In relation to PAYE income tax, there is neither interest on amounts of tax underpaid and subsequently recovered nor is there interest on amounts of tax overpaid and subsequently refunded to the taxpayer.  I do not think Deputy Mac Giolla is making a case for that system to be changed with interest applying on both sides.  I would not favour that for a number of reasons.</P>

      <P>The point about the top slicing relief is that it can be given only at the end of the tax year in which the relief arises.  The fact that it is given at the end of the tax year does not mean that there has been an overdeduction of tax at a previous stage.  It is a relief that cannot be given until the end of that tax year.  The question of it being an outstanding amount does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to the difference between commitments entered into by the Community in respect of Ireland and the payments received.</P>
      <P>Ireland's receipts from the European Community can be grouped under two broad headings.  The first is EAGGF guarantee section receipts which finance the price support arm of the Common Agricultural Policy.  As these payments are made in advance, the question of moneys outstanding does not arise.  The second heading relates in the main to receipts from the structural funds &mdash; the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and EAGGF Guidance Section, which are dealt with by my own Department, the Department of Labour and the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries respectively. In the case of the three funds there is a difference between amounts committed for payment and actual payments. This is because the commitments relate to multi-annual programmes and projects and payments are phased over the life of these operations according as expenditure is incurred.  Accordingly a certain amount of payments will normally be outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Regional Fund, on 28 June a total of IR£84.319 million was due to Ireland in respect of commitments entered into by the Commission prior to that date.  As I have said, payments from <Col N="332" /> the fund are made in line with member states' expenditure on approved projects and the amount at present outstanding will accordingly be paid in this and subsequent years.  I would add, lest there be any misapprehension, that the latest figures available from the Commission indicate that in terms of translating commitments into payments from the Regional Fund, Ireland has the best record of all the member states.</P>
    <P>As far as the Social Fund is concerned, the amount of moneys claimed but not yet paid by the EC in respect of pre-1984 operations is £25.5 million.  For 1984 operations a total of £158 million was approved for Ireland but claims for payment of this amount will not be submitted until October next.  Because of the considerable amount of work involved in the preparation of these claims member states are allowed ten months after completion of operations to submit final claims.  As regards the current year, a total of £187 million has recently been approved for Ireland and advance payments of 50 per cent of this amount are now due.  I expect that these payments will be made in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In relation to EAGGF Guidance, two types of measure are involved: the first are the socio-structural schemes where Departments' claims for EC aid generally relate to expenditure in the previous year.  For some regional measures &mdash; drainage and the programme for western development &mdash; part of the EC contribution may be advanced in the current year. Moneys outstanding from the EC amount to £46.2 million of which £41.4 million relates to claims made this year.  As in previous years, every effort will be made to obtain early payment from the EC.</P>
    <P>The second group of projects are grant-aided projects for marketing and processing. These EC payments are made direct to firms and depend mainly on the rate of completion of projects.  Moneys outstanding as at 31 May 1985 amounted to £35.2 million of which approximately £23 million related to grants awarded in 1983 and 1984.  While the firms have five years in which to complete their projects it is the practice for the Department of <Col N="333" /> Agriculture and the IDA to encourage them to submit their claims as rapidly as possible.  However, the final responsibility for claiming the grants awarded rests with the individual firms.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3.513 million is also outstanding in respect of schemes relating to aid for the construction and modernisation of fishing vessels and aid for aquaculture, operated under the aegis of the Department of Fisheries.</P>

      <P>That is not the case.  Unlike the European Regional Development Fund, the entitlement of this country to assistance under these schemes depends directly on the level of activity.  We make our own choices as to the level of activity in relation to farm modernisation, for example, so that there is no fixed amount of money to which we are entitled or which by not carrying out the scheme we forego.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Further and more comprehensive participation in these schemes with the application of extra amounts of Exchequer, that is taxpayers', money, would have the effect of attracting further EC moneys, but those decisions are made by people who are engaged in carrying out the individual projects.</P>

      <P>Over the years there have been a number of substantial approvals for FEOGA grants and at one stage a commissioner was critical of the slow take-up, but are there are any problems of drop-outs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Leonard is referring to the marketing and processing scheme.  As I said in my reply, the rate of take-up of the money depends on the rate at which the firms involved carry out their projects.  If they are slow in carrying out the projects obviously the money will be slow coming in, and if firms drop out then obviously the money will not come in.  At one time there was a worry that firms seemed to be excessively slow in taking up their entitlements and efforts were made to ensure that they got on with the job so that they got the aid to which they were entitled.  But essentially that is a matter for decision by the people involved in the individual firms.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister tell me why there has been a massive mound of earth in the green area for some time? He said car parking is taking place on a temporary basis, but will he agree that often car parking which is described as temporary has a habit of becoming permanent? This is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city and it is imperative that everything in the area should be preserved. The green space has been a great visual asset.  The Minister says temporary work is taking place there but it has been going on for a very long time.  Would he ensure that something is done to clear up the area because it is a disgrace to the Office of Public Works and all concerned.</P>

      <P>If I may make a preliminary remark, it seems that the lacuna which seems to emerge &mdash; and I regret the Deputy's absence because I was looking forward to a discussion &mdash; requires a certain amount of planning on the part of the Opposition.  These things are all predictable now, according to the rota.</P>
      <P>The Government's intention, as indicated in the context of the issue of the end-June Exchequer returns on Monday, is that there will be no major overrun on the budget figures.</P>
      <P>While there are a number of uncertainties, indications are that the 1985 outturn will be reasonably close to target.  The overall position is the subject of regular monitoring but, on present indications, I cannot accept the implication in the second part of the Deputy's question that particular action is necessary this year over and above continuation of the close control over budgetary aggregates which the Government have exercised since taking up office and will continue to exercise.</P>

      <P>Our interest rates are not aligned with UK interest rates as a matter of policy.  As the Deputy will have noted, interest rates here, having been significantly above those in the UK in recent years, have now fallen to a level where our interbank rates are about 1 per cent below their UK equivalents.</P>
      <P>Interest rate policy is primarily a matter for the Central Bank.  While not being tied to rates in any particular country, policy must take account of the general international level and trend of interest rates.  However, the recent further encouraging fall in the rate of domestic inflation, as well as the improvement in the balance of payments, the stability of the exchange rate in the EMS and the Government's commitment to correcting the imbalances in the public finances, should all help in creating scope for further declines in our interest rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Given, on the one hand, the severity of the international recession and, on the other, the completion of a number of productive infrastructural projects in the public sector, the decline in investment in recent years was not unexpected. However, the Deputy will be aware that there was only a marginal fall in real fixed investment in 1984, which represented a significant improvement on the 1983 performance.  Most commentators agree that a further recovery will occur in 1985.</P>
      <P>This year's budget, which was an important step in implementing the policies in the national plan, was designed to improve the economic climate and stimulate growth.  I am confident that the objectives in the plan of improving competitiveness and remedying the imbalances in the economy will encourage capital spending over the period to 1987.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, CIE have been under the microscope almost since I became Minister in late 1982.  There was good reason for that as 1982 marked a 13th year of losses escalating by a multiple of the rate of inflation.  When I came to office, I said that my first priority for CIE was to create a new environment for CIE to operate within.  Within six months of coming to office a new five-year approach to CIE's finances had been decided on.  The abandonment of the wishful thinking, the lack of control and the drift, which characterised Government's relationship with CIE for many years past, became a must.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government introduced as a first step in June 1983 a package of measures covering a five-year period aimed at reducing CIE cost to the Exchequer and improving the organisation's performance. This package included new arrangements for determining the CIE subvention which is now limited to the lesser of either half of the board's revenue <Col N="364" /> or to one-third of their expenditure.  They also provided for the first time ever for payment of the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; in recognition of the provision by CIE of certain unprofitable but socially desirable services.  Most of 1984 was taken up with building on that foundation as conclusions on the longer term future of CIE, in the context of the McKinsey report and other reports on the transport sector, were overdue.  A fresh start for CIE was mapped out in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>The Government subvention formula effectively provided that one-third of CIE's expenditure would be paid by the Government provided that expenditure is reduced in real terms by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1988.  This was extended to 1989 in the context of the national plan.  That these targets have been met so far, and without massive redundancies or cuts in service, is testimony to the wisdom of the approach.</P>
    <P>Now CIE know well in advance what their allocation is and can plan to keep within it.  Previously, a figure &mdash; often bearing no relation to reality &mdash; would be notified to CIE two or three weeks before the commencement of the relevant financial year.  This lack of notice and lack of reality were constantly rewarded, not surprisingly, by being ignored.  As a result CIE's finances had rocketed almost out of control.</P>
    <P>The improvement now is perceptible and real.  This is good news, not alone for the board, management and workforce of CIE, but also for the taxpayer who has to fund it.  While there is no room for complacency, I think it right that these achievements should be recognised and I want again to congratulate all in CIE for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions have been accompanied by a major overhaul and strengthening of the board of CIE.  The introduction of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and the Road Transport Bill are further steps in the creation of the new environment which I have set out to establish.</P>
    <P>The Bill to reorganise CIE into three operating subsidiaries under a parent <Col N="365" /> board is in preparation.  I had hoped to have it before the House at this stage. That was not realised but it will be enacted as soon as possible and, in any event, before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Until the reorganisation has been completed, it is understandable that some uncertainty and worry would abound in CIE.  Indeed, I understand that among some sections in CIE it is leading to resistance. In the light of that situation, it is important that it should be known and understood that the whole purpose of the reorganisation is not to close CIE, as some people suspect, but to ensure their future by organising CIE in a way best suited to serve the customer, whose support is vital to any company's success. The completion of the reorganisation is in the best interests of the workforce and the travelling public alike.</P>
    <P>I want to again appeal strongly to all in CIE to assist in the reorganisation so as to ensure that recent encouraging trends in the CIE performance are continued in the future.  1983 and 1984 have brought a 20 per cent reduction in real terms in the deficit.  So far in 1985 the CIE performance is on target for a future reduction in the deficit in real terms.  This represents a dramatic improvement after the trend of the previous 15 years. Inflation has been down to low single figures over the past few years and CIE are still beating it &mdash; a cause for much encouragement.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise from the decisions taken so far by the Government and the financial provisions made in relation to CIE, the work of creating a better environment for the organisation to operate within is evolving at a fairly satisfactory pace.  We cannot at the same time be complacent.  The measures which have been taken and are planned are in the longer term interest of CIE and its workforce.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House today is of significant importance for CIE's operations and capital programme and is another development in the creation of an improved operating environment for CIE.  The purpose of the Bill are, first, <Col N="366" /> to enable CIE to convert £30 million of the board's temporary borrowings into a loan repayable over a period of ten years with the Exchequer providing £3 million annually for repayment of the principal of the loan and, secondly, to increase the statutory limits on CIE's capital borrowing power from £230 million to £250 million and the corresponding guarantee powers of the Minister for Finance. Under section 4 of the Transport Act, 1983, CIE may incur, with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance, temporary borrowings of up to £40 million. This borrowing power would normally be used by CIE to respond to short term cash shortfalls, to meet unforeseen payments and for normal overdraft purposes.</P>
    <P>Between 1979 and 1983 the borrowing facility has been used, with Government approval, mainly to finance the difference between total CIE subvention and deficit, where the total subvention made available was insufficient to meet the board's deficit on subventible activities. Since 1979 there was considerable expansion in the size of the shortfalls which led to the revision of the statutory limit from £5 million to £20 million in 1981 and to £40 million in 1983.  At 31 December 1983 CIE had approval for temporary borrowings up to a limit of £36.245 million. There has been no change in CIE's temporary borrowing limit in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The shortfalls which arose in the period 1979-83 resulted from an assortment of reasons, for example, under-estimation by CIE, increased costs, including labour and oil charges, industrial disputes and fall-off in traffic.  Other significant factors were delays in sanctioning increases in fares and rates and subvention provisions, which were not realistically related to CIE estimates of the board's requirements. Decisions to bring the deficits closer to the subvention limit set were unacceptable because they would have involved extensive cuts in jobs and services. Inadequate levels of subvention meant that the CIE financial objectives were unattainable and led to Government approval for financing shortfalls by temporary borrowing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> When I became the Minister responsible for CIE the subvention for CIE for 1983 had been already fixed at £86 million. In the review which took place immediately after the Government came into office it was clear that there was no possibility of increasing the subvention beyond that level, even though it was recognised that the board's deficit would exceed the subvention.  In the circumstances the only real alternative was to let CIE carry the shortfall of almost £16 million in 1983 by temporary borrowing. This was the cause of the increase in the statutory limit in the Transport Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>Interest charges paid on the temporary borrowings, which fall to be met by the board out of their revenues, in the period 1979-1984 amounted to almost £13 million. In 1984 alone the interest charges amounted to about £4.5 million.  It was clear to me from the beginning that the interest charges on the temporary borrowings were a considerable burden on CIE.  I felt that the board should not have to bear the handicap of interest and repayment costs, arising in the main from the failure of Government either to provide in the past adequate levels of subvention over a number of years or to take decisions which would have enabled CIE to move significantly closer to the direction pointed by the subvention limits fixed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the costs of temporary borrowings are high because of the levels of interest demanded for short term loans and the associated roll-over costs.  Additionally, the hard core nature of the debt was becoming a source of concern.  I came to the conclusion that a substantial reduction at an early date of the principal sum outstanding was essential and saw an urgent need to relieve CIE of the bulk of the burden as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In planning for CIE's future the Government decided to reduce the board's temporary borrowing by £30 million by the rescheduling of £30 million into a ten year loan.  The enactment of the relevant provisions of the Bill is necessary so that CIE can raise a loan <Col N="368" /> of £30 million repayable over a 10 year period in equal annual instalments, financed by the Exchequer.  The board will continue to be responsible for the interest charges on the loan as well as the balance, that is £6.245 million of the temporary borrowings, but the charges will decrease annually in line with the repayment of the principal.  The board are also required to eliminate the balance of the temporary borrowings from their own resources.  The existing statutory limit of £40 million for temporary borrowings is being retained.</P>
    <P>The treatment of CIE temporary borrowings in this way will make a useful contribution to the regularisation of the finances of CIE by relieving the board over a period of years of substantial borrowings as well as easing the total CIE interest burden.</P>
    <P>To complete the information on temporary borrowings, CIE will need to increase their temporary borrowings by £8 million later this year and by a further £8 million in 1986.  This increase of £16 million was foreseen when the subvention allocations for 1985, 1986 and 1987 were being fixed.  This will arise from the Government's acceptance of responsibility for the interest charges in respect of the capital investment in the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  These charges will amount to £16 million in each of the three years 1985/87.  Because of the difficult financial situation it was possible to provide no more than £8 million in each of the years 1985 and 1986, but the shortfall in subvention of £16 million will be made good in 1987, when CIE will be paid £32 million in respect of the interest charges.  These necessary additional temporary borrowings will be for a very limited period.</P>
    <P>CIE's capital expenditure is financed from the board's internal resources, mainly depreciation provisions, borrowings, leasing arrangements and Exchequer capital advances.  The borrowing arrangements require my approval and that of the Minister for Finance, who has power to guarantee them.  CIE's total capital borrowings at 31 December 1984, <Col N="369" /> amounted to £216.373 million.  CIE need to borrow £15.416 million for capital purposes for 1985 so that by 31 December 1985 the board's capital borrowings are expected to amount to £231.789 million. As the statutory limit on capital borrowings is £230 million, it is necessary to increase that limit and I am now proposing an increase of £20 million to give a new limit of £250 million, which will be adequate to cater for the board's anticipated borrowings for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The board's original capital allocation for 1985 was fixed at £30 million and it had been expected that the existing statutory borrowing limit would have been adequate for the borrowing requirement involved in financing the CIE capital programme.  However, in an effort to ensure continuity of employment at the GAC bus building plant at Shannon, the Government decided to reschedule the CIE capital allocation for bus building in the period covered by the national plan. As a result £10 million from the 1987 allocation for bus building is being brought forward to 1985.  This brings the total CIE allocation for capital purposes for 1985 to £40 million.  This change created the need for increasing the board's statutory borrowing limit for capital purposes at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Government, in recognition of this decision, placing an additional financial burden on the board, decided that the extra financial charges arising on the authorised increased borrowing which are estimated at £0.5 million in 1985 will be recouped to CIE this year.  Similar arrangements will apply in respect of 1986 borrowing.</P>
    <P>The Government have made provision for substantial capital expenditure by CIE over the period of the national plan.  The board's capital allocations for this period amount to £93 million.  Provision has been made for expenditure in this period of £36 million on the CIE bus programme, including bus acquisition. Almost £43 million will be spent on mainline rail and mainline carriage acquisition and just over £14 million will be spent by <Col N="370" /> the board on their signalling-communications and normal capital programmes, including £1.16 million which has been earmarked for work to be carried out at Rosslare Harbour in 1987.</P>
    <P>The allocations for bus acquisition will facilitate continuance of the board's current bus replacement programme which commenced in 1980.  In February of this year replacement of the board's city single deck fleet was completed.  In addition 184 rural single deck buses have been programmed for construction and delivery in 1985.</P>
    <P>The provision of almost £43 million for mainline rail, including carriage acquisition, will enable continuance of CIE's programme to construct 124 mainline carriages at Inchicore works by 1988. This programme which currently employs 61 persons was approved by the Government in 1982.  The total cost of the project is estimated at £53 million in 1984 prices.  The first of these carriages were put into service on the Dublin-Cork line in July of last year.  A total of 34 are now in service on the Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Waterford and Dublin-Galway lines.  The introduction of these new air conditioned carriages has reduced journey times and gives greater standards of passenger comfort than ever before.  The balance of CIE's capital allocations over the period of the plan, i.e. some £14 million, will be spent on signalling and communications and on the board's normal capital programme.  The signalling programme which began in 1980 is scheduled for completion in 1988 and is designed to update the signalling system on the mainline railway.</P>
    <P>The board's long term capital borrowings are very considerable indeed.  I am concerned about this level of borrowing which is a matter which will need to be given careful consideration at a future date.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to rail safety about which I am very concerned.  A few times this year rail safety, particularly in regard to the carriage of dangerous substances, made the news headlines.  I know that the chairman of CIE shares my concern and is willing to take any necessary steps to <Col N="371" /> make good any deficiencies which are brought to light.  Rail is a very safe mode of travel but continuous vigilance and awareness of the risks and dangers of rail accidents is essential.  There is a need for an on-going search for additional improvements in the interest of safety.  I am satisfied that current arrangements relating to the transport of dangerous substances by rail embody all reasonable and practical elements.  Nevertheless, having regard to recent events I have instituted another look at all aspects of the question of the transport of dangerous substances and involving other Government Departments and other interests immediately concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government in charting the future for CIE have fully recognised the extent of the board's difficulties and in so far as possible special measures have been introduced to deal with the situation.  The Government have also, of course, set very specific financial targets for the board but they have also made available financial incentives to help in their achievement.  These targets will not be easily achieved but they are realistic and should be capable of being realised.  It is now up to management and the workforce to ensure the future success of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are becoming accustomed to listening to the Minister beating his drum about what he has done for CIE since he took office and the arrangements he has made for financing CIE.  I know that the above the line subvention has now been adopted.  If the Minister searches his file he will see that the decision was taken by his immediate predecessor. Consequently introducing it as something which was specifically introduced by him does not carry weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to lack of reality is interesting in that the House has been asked to make provision for £30 million extra for CIE which will be paid by way of non-repayable grant for the next ten years.  It is to be £3 million per year.  In other words it is a subsidy to CIE.  The Minister <Col N="372" /> has explained in detail how the necessity for this arose.  Temporary borrowings were made in order to cope with the deficit as between what the Government were prepared to make available to CIE and what the costs turned out to be each year.  What we are being asked to do is vote £30 million to CIE in instalments of £3 million over three years.  The conversion of the borrowings to a loan for a ten year period is part of what the Minister is doing but we must call a spade a spade. We are giving £30 million extra to CIE on top of what the Minister says they are being asked to do with for the period of the plan.  This runs for seven years longer than the plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the introduction of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and regards this as a major overhaul of what is going on in the transport world. We have already criticised that Bill.  I sent the heads of a Bill to the parliamentary draftsman in December 1982 before leaving office and every piece of muscle in that Bill was taken out by the present Minister.  Many of the Government back benchers agree with me that this Bill has not got the muscle it should have.  The opportunity was missed to put a Bill on the Statute Book which would succeed in improving Dublin city transport to a degree which is not now possible due to the weakness of the Bill we have been asked to pass.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned legislation to set up the three subsidiaries.  Promises were made that this would come before the House in this session.  We must criticise the Minister for not bringing it before the House.  When I was Minister I thought the Dublin transport authority should be given priority and I recommended that the Dublin city bus service should be taken away from CIE.  We could have seen how a combination of the Dublin transport authority, as conceived by me, and the new Dublin city services organisation would work before going on to deal with the rest of CIE, namely the national rail and bus services.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to break it into three parts.  He has a weak Dublin transport authority and this will show over the <Col N="373" /> years in that difficulties will be created for the Dublin city scene.  I am not saying I disagree with what the Minister did with regard to the other two.  I am saying I would have preferred if the Dublin Transport Authority Bill was passed, the authority set up and the Dublin city services sector set up which would then work in harmony with the Dublin transport authority. CIE were conceived of as agents of the Dublin transport authority within the heads of the Bill that we sent originally to the parlimentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>Referring to uncertainty and anxiety in CIE regarding the reorganisation, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In the light of that situation, it is important that it should be known and understood that the whole purpose of the reorganisation is not to close CIE, as some pessimists fear, but to ensure its future by organising it in a way best suited to serve the customer, whose support is vital to any company's success.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the words, &ldquo;best suited to serve the customer&rdquo;.  I am glad to hear the Minister sound an optimistic note about the company.  I would be supportive of him in that regard because I presume his purpose is to take CIE out of a rut and put them into the field as a competitive commercial venture in all their three facets.  Therefore, any criticism I offer will not impugn that position but we must not lose touch with the reality and some parts of the Minister's statement would indicate that he has lost touch with reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also that he was appealing strongly to all in CIE to assist in the reorganisation so as to ensure that recent encouraging trends in the company's performance are continued.  That sentence must be taken in the context of a Bill providing for the payment of £30 million to CIE apart from the arrangements the Minister has made in respect of his above the line subsidies to the company each year.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the importance of serving the customer but the customer does not seem to be anxious <Col N="374" /> to be served as is indicated by some statistics outlined on page 354 of the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin.</i>  These statistics indicate that the customer is shying away from the improved service.  In 1980, for example, passenger journeys in Dublin city totalled 175, 137.  The Library here were not able to obtain statistics for me relating to 1984 but by 1983 the corresponding number of passenger journeys was 158,244.  I agree with the Minister that the whole purpose is to serve the customer but obviously increasing numbers of customers are not satisfied with the service.  In 1980, too, other city services accounted for 24,489 passenger journeys but this number fell to 20,967 by 1983.  We can fiddle around as much as we wish, by audit or by accounts, with the moneys but at the end of the day the passenger will be paying and these in terms of transport are usually either bus or train passengers.</P>
    <P>The number of long distance internal passenger journeys in 1980 was 45,893. The corresponding number in 1983 was 45,520.  The overall figures as presented in the statistical bulletin were 245,519 in 1980 and 221,731 in 1983.  Those figures would seem to indicate that much remains to be done by way of installing customer confidence in CIE.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's purpose is to instil a commercial and competitive spirit and a passenger serving spirit into CIE, I am in total agreement with him but perhaps a more radical look will have to be taken at the service being provided with a view to ascertaining why the numbers of passengers are not increasing.  We can become wrapped up in organisational problems and direct all our attention to those problems but at the end of the day the important factors are the numbers of passengers using the service and, linked closely with that, the type of service being provided, plus the potential of increasing those numbers during the coming years.</P>
    <P>A few days ago we had a wrangle in the House about Dublin Port and Docks. That wrangle concerned management and unions but there was not a word from anyone about those who are paying both management and unions.  They are the <Col N="375" /> people who are using the port and whose requirements must be met.  The parallel with the subject we are talking of is exactly the same because in this case the passengers will have to pay.</P>
    <P>I gather from what the Minister said that the approval for temporary borrowings amounted to almost the limit of £36.245 million.  I presume the Minister means that the company had borrowed that amount by way of temporary borrowing. He gives an analysis of why this happened and I have no quarrel with that analysis.  He refers to the £86 million subvention that was allocated to CIE for 1983 which was the Minister's first year in office.  I recall distinctly being responsible for that allocation.  At that time we were putting together our policy on transport and on all the other areas of national Government.  We must take into account that this Bill is an effort to cope with temporary borrowings, not merely for that year but for this year, for last year and for a number of years that involved the putting together of the £32 million.</P>
    <P>That is what we are dealing with here. We gave Aer Lingus a subsidy for three years in respect of the North Atlantic service but we did not like to refer to those moneys as a subsidy.  They were moneys transferred from the Exchequer to the funds of Aer Lingus just as we are talking here about money being transferred from the Exchequer to the funds of CIE.  We are talking about a non-repayable grant of £3 million during a ten-year period.  Admittedly, CIE will have to pay the interest on the money and will also have to pay the £6 million the Minister referred to, that is the sum that is left from the total aggregate of temporary borrowings sought.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the matter of the £8 million CIE will need to increase their temporary borrowings later this year.  The Minister tells us that a further £8 million will be required by the company in 1986.  This is connected with the Howth/Bray rapid transport line, the DART.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> These charges will amount to £16 million in each of the three years 1985-87.</P>
    <P>I find this a useful bit of political footwork&mdash;</P>
    <P>Because of the difficult financial situation it was possible to provide no more than £8 million in each of the years 1985 and 1986, but the shortfall in subvention of £16 million will be made good in 1987, when CIE will be paid £32 million in respect of the interest charges.</P>
    <P>I do not know what particular virtue attaches to the year 1987 but that seems to me to be just a useful piece of political footwork.  The Minister has decided that he will not be Minister in 1987, that some other Minister will have the responsibility. Therefore he will not pay this year but he will shove it on to the year 1987 and hang this considerable sum around the neck of the Minister who will be there in 1987.</P>
    <P>I was a little disappointed at the Minister's treatment of the capital project.  I must say I see very substantial arguments for the capital sector of this Bill.  My disappointment lies in the fact that not enough information has been supplied about what is happening in the bus building plant.  The Minister will know that I complained yesterday, in the august presence of the Ceann Comhairle, of having questions refused over a wide area in the transport field because the Minister has not got responsibility etc.  I did try to get a question down about GAC, the financial arrangements they had made with CIE, about how much information the Minister himself had <i>vis-à-vis</i> this financial arrangement.  After all, the complete plant in Shannon is owned by CIE.  All the machinery and so on is owned by CIE and the Bombardier company was a tenant.  They have gone and GAC have taken over.  Under what conditions have they taken over?</P>
    <P>As the Minister is talking about rationalising finances and so on, I would like some information on the cost of buses coming out of the GAC plant at present, <Col N="377" /> how it compares with the cost of similar buses being put together elsewhere either in Europe or in North America.  We took decisions on the rate of building of buses, both single and doubledecker, in the plant at Shannon when Bombardier were the tenants.  We found we had to exert a certain amount of muscle to keep them to the programme we had outlined for them.</P>
    <P>My complaint is that in this House we are responsible for the capital investment &mdash; what we are doing here is increasing the amount the Minister for Finance can guarantee &mdash; and, therefore, we are entitled to full knowledge of what is going on, even to access to reports of how satisfactory are the buses they are assembling or making.  I undertook a minor survey of the actual bus drivers at a time when Bombardier was the subject of severe criticism both in this House and on the part of people &mdash; some with vested interests, I must say &mdash; outside it.  One had to learn how to interpret an article which was in praise, say, of a certain bus, call it whatever you like &mdash; bus X.  Of course one found that the article criticising Bombardier and praising this other bus was planted by the manufacturers of the bus coming out well in the comparison.  This House should be in a position to have full information on costings, on the business arrangement for GAC and on the quality of the buses.  I must say that the drivers I interviewed at that time were quite pleased with the bus they were getting as distinct from outside critics who said it was a bad bargain and a poor bus.  From the point of view of availability and driving &mdash; apart from some teething problems &mdash; they claimed it was a good bus to drive. Here the point I want to make is that the Minister tells us about continuity of employment at the GAC bus plant in Shannon, when he said:</P>
    <P>... the Government decided to reschedule the CIE capital allocation for bus building in the period covered by the national plan.</P>
    <P>I should like to know exactly how many buses are being produced per week &mdash; the Minister might give a list of buses <Col N="378" /> here &mdash; the costings, the arrangement as far as the business side of GAC is concerned.  The Minister might be able to give me some of that information when replying.  I shall be particularly interested in the cost per bus whether single or double-decker.</P>
    <P>We took a decision about the main line carriages at Inchicore.  I am glad that the Minister has continued &mdash; I know his heart would lie in that general direction &mdash; the Inchicore effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister said further:</P>
    <P>The introduction of these new air conditioned carriages has reduced journey times and gives greater standards of passenger comfort than ever before.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I had a question down about the unfortunate death of a passenger on the Cork-Dublin line.  One of the statements &mdash; I do not think it was an irresponsible statement because it was made by a very responsible journalist &mdash; was that the temperature in the carriage was over 80 degrees and that there was no way it could be lowered.  If that is so, that is air-conditioning gone haywire.  Those of us who have to endure parts of this House will know that when that occurs it is impossible to work and difficult to survive. The communication problem which the Minister admitted in his reply had not been attended to since the Cherryville disaster, should be attended to as a matter of life and death.  This particular incident was unfortunate and I do not want to make a meal out of it in that the person was going for treatment for a heart disease.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be able to tell us when the three Bills for the setting up of the Dublin city bus services company will be introduced.  Also he might like to give some reflections on their relationship to the new Dublin Transport Authority, how he conceives the Dublin Transport Authority CIE &ldquo;interface&rdquo; might be a good word.  I do not want to get into clichés already, but I have indicated to the House that my thinking was that CIE should be the agent of the Authority. Consequently, the Authority would be in <Col N="379" /> a position to put their plan into operation, a plan being basic to the Bill for which I had ambitions.  I know the plan was thrown out totally by the Minister.  That is my major criticism of the Bill, probably the most important criticism.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister said that CIE was in a markedly better financial position than they were a few years ago when the Government came to power. He said this in one of his press releases. In the light of the statistics I have read into the record of the House, I cannot see that.  As far as commercial criteria are concerned, money cannot come from anybody other than from the passengers; and, if the number of passengers is going down, then one has to either charge outrageous fares to keep the accounts going or get into a worse financial position. The Minister has not denied a report on 23 March 1985 in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which said that the deficit in 1984 would be £114 million but that the estimated deficit for 1985 was £123 million.  Judging by what we say will be the rate of inflation, some of the claims the Minister is making seem to be out of kilter with that.</P>

      <P>It is under 5 per cent, then, on the total of last year.  I will listen to the figures with interest.  The figures I had admittedly came earlier on in the year and there may have been an improvement.  But up until the start of this debate I could not get up to date statistics for 1985.  There is not a noticeable improvement in the finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with that, the numbers that DART is now taking would give some heart to those who study the statistics. The Minister has said in this respect that the figures would want to double before it would be a paying proposition or before it would break even.  I do not know what factors have been taken into consideration when coming to that conclusion. Is the Minister talking about taking the servicing of all the loans into <Col N="380" /> account when he gives that figure?  The really pertinent question to ask is: what is the position about feeder services with regard to DART?  We cannot get the maximum potential out of DART until arrangements have been made with regard to the feeder services.  I know there are trade union difficulties that have been going on for some time.  Optimistic statements were made about having all those problems ironed out and the wider problem of the one-man buses ironed out by the end of 1985.  Will the Minister make some comment on that in his reply?</P>
    <P>If available, I would like the Minister to give the House the estimated revenue for 1985 and the actual revenue for 1984 as a percentage of costs.  The estimated subvention for Dublin city bus services that I have here for 1985 is £17.6 million. Perhaps it is a pipedream I was entitled to when I envisaged a strong Dublin Transport Authority and a Dublin city bus service working together harmoniously, and where harmony could not be arrived at the powers given to the Dublin Transport Authority would provide a method of inducing harmony.  I had this pipedream that Dublin, a vast city and conurbation, should be in a position to make a profitable bus service available and a transport authority that would be in a position to take certain strong measures to achieve that.  I know there is a vast question of pedestrianisation and of access to the perimeter of a pedestrianised area for buses.  There are various problems to be dealt with.  It may be naive but I do not see how certain private transport companies can keep going, making a profit with limited customer availability, and not CIE in a Dúblin city bus services structure backed by a strong Dublin Transport Authority.  They would have a huge number of customers available and should be able to provide a profitable service, one that would be in aid of the transport finances in general.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I gave statistics for various European cities of roughly the same size as Dublin and Dublin did not come out of that comparison too badly. If the Minister's optimism extends to that ambition of a Dublin city bus service <Col N="381" /> which would provide a good service at a reasonable cost and make a profit, I support him.  A statistic which was scattered about earlier in the year was that it took £100,000 to keep one CIE bus on the road for one year.  I know that CIE used that statistic when they were attempting to rebut arguments put by a suburban deputation which wanted a service to their suburb.  It is a very substantial cost figure.  I presume a heavy percentage of that would be taken up with wages.  The figure would work out at £187 million to keep the Dublin city fleet on the road for one year.</P>
    <P>The statistic I gave of falling passenger satisfaction is difficult to understand when one looks at the statistics for private cars as between 1980 and 1984.  Between those years there was a drop from 736,000 to 711,000 private cars available for use. That should provide an extra opportunity for a bus service.  The House will know, if it studies the figures, that the major subvention each year for CIE is absorbed by the railways.  What is the Minister's view with regard to further expansion of the suburban rail services?  The Minister has generally indicated that he is not in favour of a similar type of operation to the Howth-Bray operation for the Tallaght area.  The Minister has also gone on record as saying that, if he were Minister, he would have been very reluctant to embark on the Howth-Bray project.  It will take time, but in time this project will be justified.  For the standard of service and comfort, it is already justified; but I am talking also about the hard-nosed realm of commercial viability.  The potential is there.  I would aid the Minister in his efforts to try to have the feeder services provided as early as possible. When the Bill setting up the three separate companies comes before the House we will have an opportunity to assess the provincial bus services operation &mdash; I read some statistics into the Official Report of the House from that as well &mdash; and also an overall picture of the railway system.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I am in support of and not opposing this Bill.  I want the truth to be seen to be told with regard to what <Col N="382" /> this £30 million is.  It is temporary borrowings, all right, being converted into a loan and then this mechanism is being used to pay an extra £3 million a year for ten years to CIE.  I am not quarrelling with it, but that is what it is.  We should not lose sight of that.  With regard to the increase of the amount up to £250 million which the Minister for Finance can guarantee in moneys to be used for capital purposes, of the two major areas for this mentioned by the Minister, the GAC plant in Shannon is a venture that should be supported.  I am making a plea for more information for this House and for the Members of this House with regard to the workings of that operation, the costings, etc.  The other major one the Minister mentioned was the Inchicore venture, whose product, I gather is worthy.  There will be some difficulties to be ironed out with regard to the operation of air conditioning and communication from the new carriages, and this should be attended to as quickly as possible. With regard to the signalling, of course we know from the inquiries that were conducted and so on that it is absolutely essential to have a first-class system and this is a very worthy place to deploy some of the capital investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and in particular the note of optimism which the Minister brings to the House in relation to CIE, our national transport company. I suppose the Minister should feel relieved that the spokesman for the Opposition agreed, even though reluctantly, that he was entitled to some optimism about the future of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an effort to make financial targets feasible, and the Minister is taking the right steps, in relation to the capital spending and the interest subsidy which he is proposing in this Bill.  The three areas directly concerned, GAC in Shannon, in my constituency, the mainline rail and the DART system, are all new life to this ailing company.  The capital spending in GAC at Shannon has been justified.  This company were set up after a series of prolonged industrial disputes in the city of Dublin when it was found <Col N="383" /> impossible to manufacture schools buses, rural buses and city buses.  People in Shannon with no native skill have taken together to themselves this new company and have proved nationally that they have the determination and ability to succeed. Most of the employees in GAC were made redundant from different companies on the industrial estate.  They had not the basic engineering skills, yet they have proved themselves adaptable.  I commend the Minister on the fine work he has done in reorganising the finances which were set out in the national plan to accommodate the production which GAC now find they can achieve.  This line of buses which they have sold has been successful in the country and in the cities and I am sure that the school buses will be successful also.  These vehicles are manufactured to the standards which CIE look for.  While we have in Shannon an adaptable workforce and a quality product, it is not easy, as Deputy Wilson required, to make a fair comparison because different items will be involved. If Deputy Wilson had changed his request to the Minister to mean some kind of cost benefit analysis of the buses I would understand it, but competitors in this industry have come in here previously and offered buses which have not proved to be the most reliable.  The GAC product has proved itself despite early hiccups when various problems arose and Minister went from this House down to Shannon.  When the management of Bombardier, now GAC, began to rely totally on the local workforce there was a great response and people in our area are happy that this company, who rely a great deal on local services for small products, have without doubt made a mark in the Shannon region and have helped us nationally.  The Van Hool project in Inchicore left a bad taste and GAC, Bombardier and their workers deserve the thanks of this House.</P>
    <P>However, I am not happy about one aspect of the GAC operation.  When that company were set up they intended to <Col N="384" /> export a considerable amount of their product.  Unfortunately, to date their success in foreign markets has been negligible. They have sold some buses to the US and at present they have a bus in the Middle East.  However, they do not seem to be making great strides in this area, and I ask the Minister to impress on the company the necessity to have alternative products by the time the period of this capital allocation runs out.  In fairness to CIE and to the Government, there is a limit to what the country can purchase in the way of buses.  The GAC have a duty to the employees in Shannon and to the myriad of small companies there in the mid-west region and throughout the country who are supplying them with goods and services and who should get continued support.</P>
    <P>The capital spending has been successful also in the mainline rail coaches and in DART.  Teething problems arose in the commissioning of coaches in mainline rail and there were numerous instances where doors did not open or did not close, long delays and so on, but the public generally are very satisfied with the quality coaches which are on the mainline rail from Dublin to Galway, Cork and Waterford.  Travel from Limerick to Dublin in the train now is really superb, and the CIE engineers and operational staff deserve the praise of this House for the manner in which they conduct themselves.  The only regrettable feature of that CIE operation on mainline rail is when they introduce some of the old coaches as a supplement when demand is heavy.  Some of these coaches can be a disaster in winter.  One can travel from Dublin to Limerick in freezing' cold with no heat whatever, in rare contrast to what Deputy Wilson talked about, the poor man who died the other day.  Sometimes CIE can reach a very low level in that regard.  However, this Bill is helping them to continue with their capitalisation programme and it is helpful in the national interest.  DART is a very good service and the Minister is doing the right financial thing in subsidising the interest payments at present.  This will help to set an attainable target for CIE.  I understand <Col N="385" /> that DART will become operationally viable by 1987 and if the public respond fully I am sure they will find CIE willing to look after them.  I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be made clear that the Bill is making provision for an extra £30 million as a subsidy for CIE. This is due to the deficits which were run up by CIE over the years by temporary borrowing above their subvention from the Government. By this method the Government are setting up a loan and giving CIE £3 million each year for a period of ten years.  We must call it what it is &mdash; a subsidy.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the Dublin Transport Authority Bill which was to be a major measure.  Deputy Wilson set out what he and the Fianna Fáil Party had intended to do, making CIE an agent of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The Minister has failed to grasp that nettle and consequently this is a very weak Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a Bill to reorganise CIE into three operating subsidiaries, but he has not yet brought forward this Bill.  I fear he is putting it on the long finger.  When the Bill is finally put before the House we may find that it is weak and ineffective.  The end result could be to make the situation worse than at present.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about serving the customer.  Unless people are provided with a proper service they will not utilise it.  Deputy Wilson has shown that the number of people using CIE services has fallen dramatically in recent years.  One reason is that CIE are not providing the bus services at times required by people in the country.  Under Deputy Wilson's Bill, CIE would have to compete in the market in the Dublin area.  We see plenty of private bus owners making profits and CIE should be able to do likewise in an area where there are sufficient customers.</P>
      <P>An important feature is that borrowing by the board for capital purposes has been increased.  It is good to see a change in the Government attitude towards creating employment.</P>

      <Col N="386" /> The NET factory is near to my home and numerous trains pass by carrying dangerous substances.  On a number of occasions during the past year there have been leakages.  I am glad to note that CIE and the Minister's Department are checking and testing to make sure that every safeguard is provided against an accident involving these dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>People tell me that the new coaches being used on the inter-city trains are a marked improvement on the old type and that the speed between Cork and Dublin is fantastic.</P>

      <P>While we have no objection to the provisions in this Bill, it must be made clear that its purpose is to convert temporary borrowings and give a grant of £3 million a year to CIE.  I hope their financial position will be strengthened in years to come so that there will be no need for a Bill of this type in the future.</P>

      <P>I am not opposing the Bill but I wish to make some comments on aspects of CIE and their expenditure. It is understandable that Deputy Carey should defend the GAC factory in Shannon since it is in his constituency and they fought hard to have this factory there.  However, it is time that the Minister considered this matter.  Deputy Wilson's comments were nearer the mark in regard to the viability of that factory for CIE.  It is probably quite viable for the company but is it viable for CIE?  My understanding is that CIE own both the factory and the equipment and that the <Col N="387" /> GAC company build the buses and then sell them to CIE.  As well as buying a very expensive bus, CIE must then pay VAT and excise duty of about £20,000 on each bus.  There is also a mark-up for the company of 33 per cent.  The whole operation seems to be absolutely crazy from CIE's point of view.  They are buying the dearest buses in the world and the company are unable to sell these buses to anybody else.  All except two or three of their buses have been sold to CIE.</P>
      <P>I believe CIE are unhappy with this situation, but the Minister would know more about that.  I do not know if they have expressed their dissatisfaction to the Minister, but from the point of view of money saving and viability CIE would be far better off running the factory as the workers in Inchicore wanted them to do in the first place.  They have a highly skilled workforce who would be far more efficient if they were paid higher wages. The fact that people in other parts of the country might have been prepared to take less wages or to accept worse conditions does not necessarily mean that they will make a cheaper bus and certainly it does not look as if GAC are building the cheapest bus on the market for CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are spending a lot of money in subsidising a factory.  We should look at the question of State companies subsidising other companies.  In that connection &mdash; and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; a private bus company. The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Bus Company was sold.  I suppose if it was still in existence it would be known as The Derry and Lough Swilly Bus Company. When it was put up for sale I understand that CIE offered to buy the company but were prevented from doing so and that the bus company and all assets were sold to a Mr. Doherty, a private individual. His first action on purchasing the company was to sell off the depots and whatever assets the company had to property developers and I understand that there is a supermarket on one of the depot sites. However, Mr. Doherty held on to the bus services.  When the company made a <Col N="388" /> loss on the bus services they applied to the Department of Transport for a grant to keep them in business and they have been getting a grant &mdash; something in the region of £80,000 per year &mdash; for the last three years to keep them in business.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of this is that apparently the grant is paid to this private bus company by CIE, presumably on the Minister's instructions.  If this is true, the Minister should explain why a State company is paying a grant to a private bus company who are in opposition to CIE and whom at one stage they wished to buy.  I understand that this year the bus company are looking for an increase in the grant to £100,000.  The Minister should indicate whether he thinks this is the proper way to spend taxpayers' money and he should also ask the Minister for Finance if the company are up to date in their payments of PRSI and PAYE as CIE must always be up to date in their payments.</P>
    <P>I am not worried at the Minister's delay in bringing in a Bill to split the company into three because of the highly dangerous implications for provincial bus services, the railways and, to a lesser extent, the Dublin city bus services.  CIE have closed down an enormous number of railway lines over the years and have been seeking to close others like the Limerick to Rosslare, Waterford to New Ross and Nenagh to Limerick lines.  However, as a result of public outcry and political pressure they were prevented from doing so, and I am in agreement with that.  The rail lines we have left should be kept open because they are a great asset to the country.  Does cost benefit analysis ever take into account the enormous amount of traffic which they keep off the roads and the further expense that would be on the taxpayer on the upkeep of roads?  Yet CIE have never considered that a subsidy is necessary for the upkeep of railways. They pay for all the permanent way. Laying of rails, renewal and upkeep of rails, building bridges and so on come into CIE operating costs.  Roads do not come into the operating costs of any other transport company &mdash; they are paid for by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> The House and the Minister in any discussion on railways should immediately take into account the enormous benefit to the country of the work and money which CIE are putting into railways. We should ensure that more goods are carried on railway lines, thus reducing the cost of road building and the upkeep of roads, bridges, etc.  These involve enormous expense and are never looked on as a subsidy to private transport.  The payment of subsidies to the railways should be looked at in the light of their benefit to the community generally, to the country, to the whole area of pollution and also to social benefits.  CIE are told that they must work within their budget; but, when they say that in order to do so they must close down certain railway lines, they are told that that would be politically dangerous and that they cannot do so.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of the Irish Sugar Company.  They are told they cannot continue to make losses, but when they wanted to close a loss making factory in Tuam there was a wild outcry.  I agree that the factory in Tuam should be kept open, not as an economically viable part of the company but for social and job reasons.  Therefore, we must be prepared to subsidise the company which does that for society.  Similarly, CIE must be subsidised for keeping loss making railways open for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>It is strange that when Dublin city bus services are ended there is not a word and the public do not seem to know. Even when small railway lines are closed there is a national outcry, but the same does not apply to the buses.  CIE have cut back one No. 16 bus, two No. 19 buses, five No. 7 buses, five No. 8 buses &mdash; mostly due to DART &mdash; one No. 55, one No. 86, one No. 34, one No. 24, one No. 31, five No. 12 and one No. 45.  This was done without the slightest outcry from anybody.  There was no publicity &mdash; they just stopped them.  This is a reduced service to the community.  We are told that they are doing this in order to save money because they must be viable.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Wilson say that the city should be able to provide <Col N="390" /> a profitable bus service without any subsidy. Later he pointed out that the city does better than any other city in Europe. No city in Europe is providing a profitable bus service and the subsidy to the Dublin city bus service at 20 per cent is a lot less than the subsidy given to bus services in other cities.  For example, in Rome the subsidy is between 50 and 60 per cent. City bus services throughout Europe are more heavily subsidised than CIE.  The Dublin bus service is doing very well but the company is being forced all the time to cut back more, give a lesser service to the people of Dublin because they are not getting more money.</P>
    <P>More money is spent on keeping railway lines outside Dublin open, and I agree with that.  The railways outside Dublin have receipts of £53.9 million and receive grants of £72.4 million as against grants to the Dublin city bus service of £17 million.  The savings the company could make by closing some of those lines would more than make up for the grant to the Dublin city bus service, but those lines must be kept open for political and social reasons.  In spite of all social and political reasons the Dublin city service is cut back because the money must go to other sections of CIE's operations.</P>
    <P>There should be a decision on what is the mandate to CIE.  If we want the railway lines open &mdash; and I would press for that &mdash; then we give CIE a mandate to keep them open and to do everything possible to have increased goods and passenger traffic on those lines.  There is little hope of getting increased passenger traffic on some of those lines.  I understand that an average of 29 people use one of the lines.  However, there are opportunities to increase goods traffic on them.  If we give CIE such a mandate in regard to railway lines we must give them sufficient funds to operate on them.  We must have a policy of giving a service to people rather than one of cutting back when money is tight.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister will be introducing a new policy in regard to CIE with the division of the company into three units.  I am glad he is taking his time in doing that and is not, as Deputies have <Col N="391" /> asked him, rushing in the change.  I hope when he announces the changes he will give a clear indication of what the Government require of CIE in regard to rail services, provincial bus services and the bus service in the city of Dublin.  It will be a disaster if he says that he will give the city of Dublin a mandate to make money in two years' time or else further grants will not be allocated.  That cannot be done in any city and a city cannot provide an adequate service under such a requirement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned at the shareholder control, that is, what taxpayers are doing in regard to the operation of the various commercial semi-State companies.  Last year alone the commercial semi-State companies lost an aggregate more than £200 million. Yet the House tends to vote through &ldquo;on the nod&rdquo; things like increased borrowing possibilities for those companies, all of which are guaranteed by the taxpayer.  In the same way we vote through injections of equity into those companies.  Subventions to companies are scarcely scrutinised in the sort of detail we need.  I am worried because I do not think the House knows what is being paid for in a lot of those cases.  The country was rocked by the discovery in the case of Irish Shipping of liabilities that nobody knew about and were out of control.  In the same way many of the other commercial semi-State companies have been less than frank in presenting information to the House so as to help us assess the value we are getting for taxpayers' money.  It is commonplace for annual accounts to be presented late; but, more important and in the case of CIE, we do not know what is happening to the massive subvention that is going to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> We have an aggregation between the major categories of rail, bus and provincial bus, but we do not have any proper information on how, for example, in the Dublin city service that subvention is being allocated between routes.  In short, we do not know whether what we are paying for is really worthwhile.  I know that in the past CIE operated at a significant loss items that could not possibly be construed as having social value, such as sundry freight.  That has been operating at a loss and I find it hard to see why the taxpayer should be chipping in money to subvent that type of operation.  In the same way in the Dublin city bus service we do not know which routes are losing money.  That is a jealously guarded secret in CIE.  My suspicion is that the routes that are losing money are those that go to areas that are in the main more affluent.  In a sense we are losing on the double.  We have reasonably profitable routes where affluence is relatively low and the taxpayer is getting money back, but in other areas where the population is generally affluent the taxpayer is chipping in money.  It is difficult to see the justification for that.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to discover that the Dublin Transport Authority have not got to grips with the issue of what it is we pay for.  I am seriously worried about the way in which the losses were incurred by CIE over the years.  What we have seen in the case of the Dublin city bus service is a continuing loss, year on year, of passengers. In the last ten years or so we have lost 25 per cent of passengers on city buses and yet we have sustained the size of the fleet and the operation and suffered increased costs on them.</P>
    <P>I am willing to subsidise a public transport system.  I see great virtue in a public transport system that takes people out of their cars in a rush-hour, provides a better amenity and takes freight off the roads. But there is no justification for the State chipping in money to prop up a service that requires a subsidy, not because it is winning new trade that may not be 100 per cent profitable but because it is losing the trade it has.  That serious problem needs to be confronted.  I am not satisfied <Col N="393" /> that the approach by the Minister in introducing this 33 per cent subsidy across the board to CIE is the correct one.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his success in getting some control over the finances in CIE but I do not think his approach is the correct one in deciding how much of taxpayers' money should go to services.  How can we stand over what we are paying for if it is to be on the basis of 33 per cent of everything regardless of whether it is a service that should be paid for 100 per cent by the commercial interests who are availing of it?  We need to confront in greater detail what it is we are paying for within the various elements of CIE and other semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>What we are getting down to is the hard core of giving the commercial semi-State companies a mandate in which they can operate.  This Bill is yet another <i>ad hoc</i> measure rather than getting down to the much more serious task of confronting what it is we expect the commercial semi-State bodies to be achieving and making that clear to all.</P>
    <P>The Minister described how temporary borrowing crops up.  There are points here which, to my mind, do not represent acceptable reasons why we should end up subsidising the paying off of these temporary borrowings &mdash; things like underestimation of costs, fall-off in traffic, which was presumably unexpected, and so on.  These items essentially represent failings because management fail to live within a budget they agreed at the beginning of the year.  We cannot, as this Bill appears to do, come along after the event and say that these temporary borrowings are insupportable for CIE and that the taxpayer will have to pay off, as subventions, those items even though originally the taxpayers held out strongly in a last ditch attempt saying they would not pay these moneys.  This makes a nonsense of setting a CIE subvention if after a couple of years have elapsed we give them the money by way of a capital sum to wipe out temporary borrowings.  We need to address the problem more seriously than is done in this Bill.  I am not singling out this Minister but these <Col N="394" /> Bills come before the House with increasing frequency to extend borrowing rights and we have not got down to confronting how we will set a more coherent mandate for the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board, which reported to the Government in 1984, went a long way down the road towards indicating how we can set about doing that.  They said indicators of management performance should be set in a public and visible fashion so that we would know CIE were successful in, say, the quality of service they were providing, manning levels, the extent to which they won new passengers and so on.  All these points should be quantified for the Dáil so that when we vote the money each year we can say that CIE did very well in a certain year and in this way we could stand over the money we were paying them.</P>
    <P>The planning board said the State subventions for so-called social services should be based on what the Government feel we should pay for these services and on a least cost tender basis, and not necessarily just subsidising inefficiency in providing a certain service.  We should say we realise a service will be loss-making, but that as it is socially worthwhile we will pay a certain sum.  At the end of the year CIE should be able to come back to us saying they were able to live within that sum and provided a certain service.  Until we get this type of information regularly we will be floundering and failing in our responsibility to the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The planning board also went into the very thorny issue of the under-capitalisation of the commercial semi-State bodies. That is a very important point because too often we hear semi-State bodies whingeing about the need for capital injection in equity, as if equity was something which did not have to earn any return.  Equity for the taxpayer is just as hard earned as any other money and should earn a dividend.  Without going into the planning board's suggestion, I think it makes a lot of sense.  Basically what they are saying is that where there is a viable service and there is an over hanging of liabilities, we should wipe <Col N="395" /> them out and from there on put them on a footing that there will be no more free capital injections and they will be on a much more strict leash.  That, combined with the explicit subsidy for the loss-making social services would give CIE a system in which to operate.  Not only would they know what they are going to get from year to year but we, as the Oireachtas, would know what value we were getting for money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acted commendably in letting CIE know what they are going to get but he has not completely resolved the problem because we, the Oireachtas, do not know what we are getting for the taxpayers' money.  Before introducing the new Bill breaking CIE into three subsidiaries with an overall board, the Minister should address these problems and get for the Oireachtas a handle by which we will know what we are getting from CIE.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his many achievements.  My criticisms of this Bill are of a general nature which I address to many semi-State bodies who come to the Oireachtas looking for increases of subventions but do not provide the kind of information we need to justify giving them this money.</P>

      <P>I would like to speak briefly about the uncertainty of the train service to Sligo.  A threat has been hanging over the people of the north-west for a long time.  There have been rumours that their line between Dublin and Sligo will close.  I hope the Minister will tell the people that that line will not close.  As far as I am concerned, CIE are giving an excellent service to the north-west.  The line between Dublin and Sligo is the only link between Dublin and the north-west because there is no train service to Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with the recent decision to almost completely close the CIE garage in Sligo which services all the buses and the school buses in the area. They are also talking about closing the offices in Sligo although they have excellent office accommodation there.  These <Col N="396" /> offices deal with the services for all the school transport needed in the Sligo-Leitrim area.  It is proposed to transfer the staff to Ballina and to build new offices there, although, as I said, they have excellent offices in Sligo.  If these rumours are true, it is time CIE were put on a right footing, so that a decision like this would not be reached in Dublin or Heuston station on matters which affect the north-west.</P>
    <P>CIE are offering an excellent service to Sligo.  It is a social service.  Before the recent opening of the kidney unit in Sligo, a number of people travelled by CIE on different days from Sligo to Dublin to go on a kidney unit there.  For many years we have been looking for a supertrain to Sligo and better CIE service to the north-west. I see from the Minister's speech that there are new air-conditioned carriages on trains between Cork and Dublin, Waterford and Dublin and Dublin to Galway, but some of the carriages now in use on the Dublin to Sligo line should not be used on any line.  Why have we not a better train service with better air-conditioned coaches from Dublin to Sligo as are on the Galway to Sligo line?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worried about Minister Nealon, but I hope that no Minister of any party would make such a decision.  The Dublin to Sligo line offers a great service, indeed, to Sligo. When is it hoped to get the better coaches that we were many times promised?  With regard to the recent design for the new road between Collooney and Sligo the people involved have been asked by the Department of the Environment to plan that road by the side of the railway line. <Col N="397" /> That is taken as a further indication that CIE may close this line.</P>
      <P>Many years ago CIE decided to close the Claremorris to Sligo line and the only link to Limerick was the Sligo to Limerick train.  They then put on a CIE bus which ran daily between Sligo and Claremorris and eventually to Galway.  There are rumours that it has been decided this month or early next month to take off that bus service.  The Minister mentioned Minister Nealon a couple of moments ago.  Would he give the information to Minister Nealon about the position of the bus route between Sligo and Claremorris? If that bus service is discontinued, there will be no CIE link between Sligo and Claremorris.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will seriously reconsider the closure of the CIE garage in Sligo.  This is taking much needed jobs from Sligo town and transferring them to Ballina and Longford.  I hope the rumours that CIE are closing the office in Sligo and building new offices in Ballina, where there is already excellent office accommodation, are not true.  I am asking the Minister to state that the Dublin to Sligo line will always be there as long as he is Minister and during the term of office of whichever Minister comes after him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on this Bill.  First, I represent a constituency in which a number of people work for CIE.  I worked for that company myself and grew up beside the CIE works in Inchicore, as did the Minister.  I do not want to be hard on or critical of CIE but there is a problem.  I do not think they inspire confidence in their own workers. That says something of the company itself.  There is something essentially wrong in the outlook of policy of the company and this has gone on over a very long period.  It lacks modern outlook and imagination in its present management and in the approaches which have developed over a very considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the morale of the employees and inspiration in the company could be improved, there would be no end to the possibilities for such a company.  The CIE <Col N="398" /> works in Inchicore are a very exceptional engineering works in these islands.  They surely are capable of building almost anything and there is nothing in the Republic to compare with them.  One would have to go to Harland and Woolffs in the North to find a comparable engineering work. Yet the Inchicore works are totally under-utilised and have been for a long number of years.  That is one of the problems with regard to CIE.  Their own workers do not feel confident about the future of the company or its performance.</P>
    <P>There is also a feeling within the company that it is top heavy in management, that it is a pyramid in reverse, with small numbers of employees supporting a large number of managers.  That feeling is probably somewhat justified.  The lack of dynamism in the CIE make-up must be changed.  They need a boost of the type which An Post have been getting.  That organisation were very good even as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and they have received a great boost in the last two years.  CIE need similar treatment, but it will be more difficult in their case.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why CIE are not making coaches instead of assembling them.  In many cases they are bringing in fully assembled coaches which only require the plastic to be taken off and a few screws put in here and there.  They have an engineering works capable of doing quite a lot of work in the assembly and manufacture of coaches for trains and buses.</P>
    <P>I do not see why Aer Lingus need to import small aircraft from Northern Ireland.  Surely there is a possibility for CIE in this area of development and diversification?  Unless we get CIE thinking in terms of diversification and dynamism and inspiring confidence in their employees, no increase in capital or any other injection will slove the underlying problems which that company have faced, are facing and will continue to face.</P>
    <P>Would it be too much to consider the opening the Harcourt street line as a toll road, if it is not possible on the basis of <Col N="399" /> a rail line?  We tend to think these things simply cannot be done until somebody in private enterprise does them.  They can be done if they are investigated and we must get that sort of thinking into the CIE boardroom.  That would help not only to improve the financial standing of CIE but to give a boost to their employees who are a very capable and very qualified work force who, unfortunately, feel that their skills are not being put to the best use because they are not producing manufactured goods which they are capable of producing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about buses being taken off certain routes.  He left out one bus, namely, the 81 bus.  I can understand CIE having to take buses off routes particularly where a population has become settled, where there are many cars and where the use of public transport has dropped, when at the same time there is pressure for transport in areas such as Tallaght.  What happens is that the management get together with the trade unions and they come to an arrangement acceptable to them, but they do not consult the consumer.  I will give an example of what I mean.  The 81 bus passed by a block of flats occupied by old folk and it took them about one mile down the road to the old folks' centre.  Now that the 81 bus has been taken off, no other bus will pass on that route.  A very small detour by one of the buses in the area would solve the problem, but it is very difficult to get any response from CIE.  There is no consumer consultation or input.</P>
    <P>There should be some kind of consumer body to advise the management, particularly in the case of Dublin city services, regarding the views of consumers and in particular when they are considering changing bus routes.  That would not be difficult to organise.  Under the proposed legislation on local government reform, I understand from speeches made on Second Stage, that there is a proposal to give consultative status to community development councils <i>vis-a-vis</i> local authorities.  Could those bodies not also have the right to be consulted by <Col N="400" /> CIE when changes affecting commuters are proposed?  It would be easier to implement changes and it would solve many of the problems that arise as a result.  In addition, it would be a useful and democratic exercise.  Our job is to see that CIE serve the commuters, not just the management and workers.</P>
    <P>In the most diplomatic way possible I should like to make the following point. In discussing the finances of CIE we should consider the question of penalties for commuters who conspire not to pay their fares.  When this happens &mdash; and one hears of such stories &mdash; it affects the income for certain bus routes.  In turn, that reflects on the figures for the number of people using those routes.  Buses may be taken off certain routes in Dublin on the basis of information that is not entirely accurate.  In times gone by people have been abusing the system on a weekly basis.  We will have to give serious attention to providing for penalties for commuters who conspire not to pay their fares.  I do not want to say anything that would reflect on bus conductors or on CIE staff.  In every large group of people there are always a few who are not honest.  I am fearful that, unless we ensure that there are sufficient penalties, commuters may be deprived of services on certain routes.  In parts of the Continent it is a very serious offence for a person to conspire not to pay a fare.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter because it could affect the availability of routes in certain cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes announced regarding CIE pensions.  This will improve morale in the workforce.  I hope the Minister will ensure that those changes are implemented without further delay.  The situation that has existed up to now is quite outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the taxpayers in the area to which I refer are highly critical of CIE and the demands they are making for supplementary estimates.  It is the right of every citizen to be cherished equally.  Citizens in the south-west Cork constituency were deprived by a Fianna Fáil Government in the past of a train service.  We had an excellent train service from Cork to Bantry but the tracks were pulled up in 1954 and sold to the blacks in Africa.  We were told then that there would be a comprehensive bus service for the area, that the service would be unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They told us that, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were also told that our roads would be improved.  However, we did not get one mile of national primary road in the south-west Cork constituency. It is hard to blame the taxpayers in my area if they are highly critical of a semi-State body like CIE making the demands they now put forward on an over-taxed community.</P>
      <P>I am highly critical of the high-handed dictation of personnel at the top in CIE who can change the weekly service to the Kilcrohane-Durrus peninsula in my constituency.  It operated to the satisfaction of the inhabitants of the area, even though it was only a weekly service.  However, the people in west Cork are very tolerant.  If citizens in Dublin city had only a weekly service from CIE they would be parading outside this House. We would not be able to come in here with the hordes outside Leinster House with placards on their backs.  That service in south-west Cork was changed from a Friday to a Saturday to suit CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if CIE stands for &ldquo;Coming in Empty&rdquo;?  When that service to the Kilcrohane-Durrus peninsula was running on a Friday morning at 10.30 or 11 o'clock to bring people into Bantry, which is the nearest town to that peninsula, <Col N="402" /> the bus was packed to capacity.  The post office, the banks, the Government offices were open on a Friday and everything was catered for with that one day a week service.  For some unknown reason some fellow sitting at his desk in CIE thought it would be much handier to run it on a Saturday &mdash; a weekly service on a Saturday when there is no post office, no bank and nothing at all to attract the people to the town.  What is the result? The result is that the bus is coming in empty and going out empty.  It is disgraceful to think that the inhabitants, the taxpayers of that peninsula, are asked by the Minister here today to subscribe further millions towards a State-sponsored body which does not seem to give two hoots about the inhabitants of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Mac Giolla criticising the fact that there was only £17 million being spent by CIE in the Dublin area.  There are children in south-west Cork walking three miles to a CIE bus to be collected in the morning and walking three miles back to a CIE bus.  What area of Dublin is not within 30 yards of a bus service?  Does Deputy Mac Giolla realise what the citizens of west Cork are enduring in comparison with the citizens of Dublin?  It is high time the Minister took this into consideration.  I am asking him when this debate is finished to contact CIE immediately and get that Friday bus service to the Kilcrohane peninsula back immediately.  I want that back because I think citizens of that area deserve a little bit of consideration even though it is only a once a week service.</P>
    <P>There was another weekly service from Skibbereen to Baltimore, a distance of ten miles.  Baltimore is the port of call for Oileán Cléire.  CIE withdrew that once a week service.  After repeated representations they made a decision to restore it for the months of July and August.  Big deal, leaving Baltimore, Cape Clear Island and Sherkin Island without a bus service for ten months of the year.  Who is codding whom?  Surely the person living in Cape Clear, in Sherkin Island and in the Kilcrohane peninsula deserves the same consideration as the person living in Finglas, Foxrock or Dundrum? <Col N="403" /> The sooner the Minister realises that and makes sure CIE give that service the better.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers cannot be expected to carry the can whenever a State-sponsored body falls into difficulties.  Every country must have a railroad service.  It is most important.  The most backward countries in Africa have one.  But at least there should be a time limit put on CIE to make sure that they balance their books and make their service pay.  With the volume of people living in Dublin I can see no reason why CIE have not got surplus revenue from their Dublin services that would correct any imbalance in the provision of services in rural parts of the country.  It is of vital importance that CIE be built up.  The Minister should make sure that they are able to stand on their own feet in the not too distant future, that they give a service to the people and not allow the high ranking officers of CIE to dictate to the ordinary citizens of this country.  There is an old saying that the customer is always right.  The customer must be provided for.  Seeing that the Minister has been so generous to CIE this evening, I hope he will ensure that they meet the demands I have made on the floor of this House.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The taxpayers in south-west Cork and rural Ireland generally are highly critical of giving one penny extra from the national purse to a State-sponsored body that will not give them a service in their area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill in so far as it takes some relatively small steps towards the funding and capitalisation of CIE into some kind of acceptable order.  I do not think it goes far enough in that respect.  CIE and transport should be a service provided to the members of the public.  It is not something that should be expected in any way to break even and still less to make a profit.  I believe that with a different pricing policy, an improved service and a more regular service, particularly to densely populated areas, it would considerably improve its cash flow.  I find it <Col N="404" /> remarkable that the major expenditure that has taken place in CIE in the last decade &mdash; by the provision of the excellent DART service &mdash; was provided to serve relatively low populated areas along the north south access along the coast.  The planners surely knew that the main concentrations of population would be located in west Dublin in the new towns which during the period of the construction of the DART project have built up to very high populations indeed that have been left there with a completely unsatisfactory transport system.</P>
      <P>I believe that the development of the rail system of transport is crucial.  I prefer it in many respects to the road method. It is cleaner, it is better for the environment, it is cheaper to run.  It avoids the clutter and the traffic jams that we experience in and around our major towns.  I believe that people take to their cars not because they particularly want to but because the public transport system provided for them is utterly inadequate in terms of reliability and in terms of cost. I believe that if a good, regular, cheap rail service was provided in and out of the city of Dublin to the satellite towns it would be used to a very large extent.  It would benefit the country, it would save us much valuable foreign exchange in imports of oil from abroad, it would improve the environment to a considerable extent and avoid the appalling intrusion of lead fumes to the frightening degree we have at present.</P>
      <P>Why has there been this constant bias over the years, both with this Government and with previous Government towards the road programme?  It is always the road programme that is favoured and all the Government documents over many decades show that.  We talk about accelerated State investment in roads but we talk about a package of retrenchment measures so far as the rail links are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very bad decision and will hit back at us in many ways.  It should be reversed very quickly.  In the new town of Tallaght, which has been described as the fastest developing area no <Col N="405" /> this country but in the whole of western Europe, the planners in the county council and corporation fully expected that a rail link would be provided.  They planned for that in advance with great trouble and foresight.  They reserved the land which would enable a rail link to be provided and a rail station to be built.  They realised it could take in the population centres of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Ballyfermot, the Minister's own constituency, and would make sound business and investment sense so far as the transport programme is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am appealing, as I have done before on so many occasions and will continue to do so, that funds be allocated as an investment.  We are not talking about expenditure but about an investment which would pay for itself many times over.  A rail link would provide tremendous benefits for the massive population which has been settled in Tallaght, Ballyfermot and Clondalkin and would also provide benefits for the State in many different ways.</P>
    <P>I welcome expenditure on the roads. We must have a road network as well but the emphasis is wrong.  The Government should look again at the large sums of money being provided in the plan.  A substantial proportion of those funds would be far better invested in improving our rail links to densely populated areas. CIE are anxious to do that.  Skilled technicians and others were employed on the construction of DART and they would be ready, willing and able to undertake this task.  The position is clear for all to see.  We have a densely populated town, land reserved for a rail link, a connection point on the Cork line, skilled men with ability, many of whom no doubt are currently on the dole, to carry out the construction work and funds have been allocated in the national plan for transport purposes.  Does it not make sound economic and business sense that those strands should be knitted together to provide this facility for the population of 90,000 in Tallaght and the large populations in Ballyfermot and Clondalkin?  It <Col N="406" /> would be of great benefit to them and the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's attempt to introduce an element of sanity into the area of transport.  The Minister referred to the fears of some people working in CIE as to what exactly would happen.  There have been welcome elements in the review of the Government's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> CIE in that at least now those in CIE know exactly what is open to them by way of financial allocation and so on.  However, that could smack of &ldquo;the patient died but the operation was a great success&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to take into account the legitimate fears of sections of the workforce of CIE.</P>
      <P>Anyone travelling by CIE, whether by rail or bus, will appreciate that we have one of the most efficient services in Europe given the type of money that it is expected to operate under and a most courteous staff.  The unions are fearful about what the Minister and the Government have in mind.  I urge the Minister to have the fullest possible discussions and ask the unions for their ideas.  Very often whizz kids come in full of good ideas.  They have the answer to everything but the solution to nothing.  They bypass the advice of those working on the ground within the company who know the set up.  In some semi-State bodies we have seen engineers coming in with professional qualifications and the porter or the ordinary &ldquo;two by four&rdquo; in many cases advising them as to the best way to carry out a certain task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party have had many discussions with the CIE groups of unions and the transport union is very much involved. The fear is that CIE have become top heavy with engineers who apply a clinical type of approach and miss out on the basic service aspect of the operation.  As I understand it there is no rail system in Europe which pays its way with the exception of Switzerland.  I am open to correction on that.  Switzerland rely on electricity and have a powerful hydroelectric scheme.  It is crazy to expect CIE <Col N="407" /> on the one hand to provide a social service and at the same time emasculate it financially.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the heightened losses within the Dublin city service. Many years ago I asked in the Limerick Council of Trade Unions &mdash; and subsequently wrote to the then Minister for Transport &mdash; why it was that to travel from Shannon to Limerick, a distance of 16 miles, cost in the region of 20p, whereas to travel the same distance in Dublin cost 6p.  It was three and a half times as much to travel that distance in the country as compared to the city.  The reply we got back was that the Dublin city area was paying its way whereas the Limerick-Shannon area was not.  Within the overall Dublin city services there are jealously guarded secret areas which are losing money but which are not disclosed.</P>
    <P>CIE's philosophy has probably been wrong in that they are entering into an area of diminishing returns.  By increasing rail fares out of all proportion they are forcing people to use their cars and not the rail system.  The fairly simplistic approach adopted in many European cities is to apply a flat fare regardless of where one wishes to travel within a city. This would tempt people to leave their cars on the perimeter of a city and use the buses.  The disparate approach that we adopt to the whole question of transport policy is a disgrace.  There is one policy for the airports, another for shipping which unfortunately is in tatters, and a kind of makeshift <i>ad hoc</i> policy in regard to the CIE problem.  This Government and all previous Governments stand indicted because we have failed to draw up what must surely be a requirement of every economy, that is, an overall and integrated transport policy.  I talk about a system where the Arabs must be smiling all the way to the bank, where because of the unplanned road system in every one of our cities, millions of pounds are being exported to pay for fuel and where there are huge logjams of buses and cars. Apart from the convenience to motorists and pedestrians we would save millions if we elected an overall transport committee <Col N="408" /> to consider in detail the whole question of an integrated transport policy.  If a country were to spring up suddenly in the Atlantic off the west coast of Ireland, the first task in such a virgin economy would be the production of a transport system for the transport of goods, services and people.  That would be the priority even in any banana republic in South America.</P>
    <P>Certain trains run every day, whether from Limerick to Dublin, from Cork to Dublin or from Sligo to Galway.  These trains will be on time anyway.  The State provides millions of pounds per year by way of subvention to CIE.  Surely it is time that CIE decided on a fare which would attract people to use their sevices? Let us go broke on this one if necessary and make some imaginative attempt to woo people back to public transport.  One thinks of what that imaginative young woman from the Civil Service was able to accomplish by way of hiring a train and offering a realistic fare of £10 return at weekends from Dublin to Limerick.  She was able to pack the train but CIE could not do that on their own.  This is not an indictment of the management of CIE. They do their best within limited resources but would it not be well worth the Minister's while to proceed as I have outlined?  I was very pleased to read in today's papers that the liquidators appointed to Irish Shipping have absolved the management of all fraud.  That is what we all expected.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight.  It is said in politics that while victory has many fathers, defeat is an orphan.  No one wants to know any person or group when they fail.</P>
    <P>The Irish Productivity Centre are a State funded body who are experts on all aspects of industrial relations, mobility, transport and so on.  What would be wrong with the State making the services of the IPC available not only to CIE but to other semi-State bodies?  I am the chairman of the committee on semi-State bodies.  Labour would say that we do not do away with jobs but that we wipe out inefficiency.  Nobody can defend the indefensible. When we think of some of the feather bedding going on in some of the <Col N="409" /> semi-State bodies and some of the items that will be examined, it behoves us as trade union officials to speak out.  The public will not believe their ears in regard to some of what they will hear.  We lose all credibility if we seek to defend the indefensible but that applies equally to management.  Unfortunately, some semi-State bodies are top heavy with the wrong kind of management.</P>
    <P>It would be very imaginative of the Government if they were to send an efficiency team, such as the IPC, into CIE.  Before moving into any organisation the IPC could guarantee, as the ICTU guarantee, that there will be no loss of jobs, that they are going in for the purpose of undertaking a feasibility study, whether in respect of staffing or the restructuring of policy or anything else, and that their purpose is to introduce worthwhile methods and new systems of efficiency.  These are the resources that are at our disposal but there must be the imagination and the political will to use them as I have suggested. There would be no need for the IPC to move in in any terrorising or draconian manner.  They could move in on a positive commitment to talk with the people who operate the organisation on a day-to-day basis and draw from them in a co-operative way their best ideas.  There is a residue of goodwill but it must be drawn on properly.  Sometimes we adopt the big stick approach and frighten people off. CIE would have nothing to lose by that approach.</P>
    <P>The company should consider the introduction of a standard rail and bus fare so that people could use the buses or the trains to go from point A to point B, to alight and later travel between other points on the basis of one ticket.  The buses will be going to these places anyway and it would be better to have a bus full of passengers paying 20p each rather than having it half empty with passengers paying 50p each.  That is elementary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning these figures off the top of my head.  It is the principle I am concerned with.  In Limerick for example there is a whole new development at a place called Moyross where there are 1,200 houses and about 3,000 people.  The area is bigger than any town in County Limerick and is about a ten minute walk from the railway station.  The rail service could be extended to service Moyross.  I note that on the excellent DART service, intermediary lines are used to facilitate more frequent stops.  That is an excellent idea.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister and the people in CIE that the same thing could be done, for example, at Moyross &mdash; and remember that of the population there approximately 54 per cent are unemployed and are expected to take costly taxis out from the city in a rush hour.  That is very unfair. It should be remembered also that it is the poorer working class areas that support the buses and trains if we make them available.  I use the example of Moyross because there is a difference of opinion between the authorities and the people down the line who drive the buses.  Some of that area is not facilitated and people have to walk long distances before catching a bus to go into town.  It would not cost a whole lot to site a small station there with somebody to man it.  The train passes through there anyway but never stops to drop off the people from Moyross. I would urge the Minister to take up that suggestion with the people concerned. That is one simple example where they could make money, ease congestion on the roads and help the people in a huge, local housing estate that has at present no such facility.  For example, the buses are not satisfactory for people in the Glenagross Park area which has over 300 houses, more than many small towns and villages.  It is an example of what could be done with a little imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on extensively about CIE. <Col N="411" /> It is my honest opinion that the black-guarding that CIE has received from successive Governments would be tolerated by no other semi-State body.  They have not been given the wherewithal to supply the type of service they are expected to supply.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that what the Government are endeavouring to do is to preserve CIE.  It is worse than lunacy to attempt to carry out an operation of the size proposed unless one has the deepest and most meaningful discussions with the people who really know the business &mdash; not parachutists, like some of the professionals and academics who drop in from beyond the system and who have the answer to everything but the solution to nothing.  Rather those who should be consulted are those who grew up with the system, whose parents and families were involved, who know the system and who can make positive recommendations if only they are listened to.</P>
    <P>For example, it might not be before its time to have an ideas programme in each region where local workers could be asked for their suggestions about how the system could be run more effectively.  It could be done on a trial and error basis which would not cost much more money than what is being spent at present.  There must be many imaginative ideas, and such a scheme would have the tremendously positive effect of stimulating people into a sense of co-operation. There is a malaise throughout the system, a sense of demoralisation, a feeling that they are nobody's child.  Anybody wanting to have a go at CIE tends to talk about their multiplicity of unions.  It should be remembered that there is a multiplicity of unions in every semi-State body, and I say that as a trade union official.  They are all the same trade unions but yet there are no problems there.  We like to blame somebody and we all latch on to CIE. They are doing a fantastic job, £ for £, given the lack of support to them over the years.  The return they have given is out of all proportion to the money they have been allocated.  The Minister might <Col N="412" /> throw out some of these ideas, speak to the people who made and know that system and see what will emerge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my thanks to the Deputies who participated in this discussion.  I should like to acknowledge the co-operation of the Opposition in facilitating the passage of the Bill, which has been taken at rather short notice.</P>
      <P>The importance of CIE to the community, the economy and their dependence on the Exchequer from the basis of their high profile.  I welcome views, even those with which I do not agree, of Members of the House whose contributions reflect their personal experiences and, in some cases, those of their constituents. Criticism of policy must be taken into consideration in legislating for CIE. Those criticisms of its operations are of value to the board and management in ensuring a response to experiences which generate such criticism.  I am glad that Deputies have been able to comment on the positive aspects of CIE and their operations.  While the job of CIE organisation is difficult and the environment in which their employees operate is not always the most congenial, nevertheless overall their services are good and deserve many more supporters.  As their dependability grows, the public will allow CIE do the driving to a greater extent. The financial performance of the board has improved markedly and the general public is becoming less grudging in recognising CIE's strong points.</P>
      <P>The enactment of this Bill will help CIE to improve their overall services and financial performance.  The next development in the policy field to be brought before the House will be the Bill to restructure CIE.  As I explained in my opening statement, that Bill is in preparation with a view to enactment in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with specific points raised by Deputies I should like to make some general comments on matters that occurred to me in the course of the <Col N="413" /> debate.  I was somewhat depressed with the notion which seemed to run throughout almost all contributions that I, the Minister, should decide what services should go where, at what level, etc.  Politicians have meddled too much over the years in deciding what services should go here or be retained there, no matter what changes have taken place in population and transport patterns, that has contributed to the problems of CIE over the years.  When I became Minister I made a conscious decision that that was not my job, that I would not receive deputations on operational matters, that that was the job of the board and management whom we appoint and pay to do that job.  Therefore I shall not answer questions in this House, as I have refused to do since becoming Minister, on operational matters raised by some Deputies.  That is not my function.</P>
    <P>In that respect I was particularly depressed by Deputy R. Bruton's contribution. Deputy Burton praised me &mdash; he did not praise the company but they deserve praise also &mdash; for getting the finances of CIE under control.  Effectively, he went on to argue that I should be deciding on the subsidy for each service, that I should be deciding the social content of each service.  Can one imagine any worse political scenario than that? Imagine what would happen to bus and train services as every local or by-election arose.  Apart from the obvious political dangers of such an approach, can one imagine the commitment of manpower and the cost if I and my Department were to decide whether there should be, say, a Westport-Newport bus service, or whether there should be a Cloughjordan-Nenagh bus service.  Deputy R. Bruton's proposition was absurd.  I feel I should reject it very strongly.  Deputy R. Bruton is a respected Member of this House and a person for whom I have a great deal of regard.  But the notion that we politicians, Governments or Departments should decide where bus services should go, the level of social subsidy and so on is something that would carry extreme danger and, the House can be assured, <Col N="414" /> that it would have little to do with the real transport needs of an area.</P>
    <P>One of the general features of this debate is the relative absence of criticism of CIE although the House has not been lavish in its praise of what has been achieved.  This is a new development in debates on CIE.  It shows some recognition of what has been achieved, perhaps a grudging recognition that things have turned around.  I do not say that to seek credit for myself, although I would not mind some of it, but it is important that the board, management and workforce of CIE understand that their achievements have been recognised.  For too long our criticisms of CIE have added to the demoralisation of the workforce.  I am glad to be in a position now to praise the achievements of the company.  Their achievements are all the greater because they have been achieved without massive redundancies or cuts in services.  Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned a number of cuts in bus services but did not mention the new bus services which reflect a change in the population patterns in an expanding city.  The populations of the old suburbs have declined and also the demand for services and new bus services are needed in the new suburbs.  Deputy Mac Giolla seemed to suggest that we should not make these changes.  That is absurd. Deputy Mac Giolla did not mention all the new services set up to service the new suburbs.  We cannot guarantee that services there today will be there for ever. It depends on need and demand.</P>
    <P>Up to 1983 the subvention limit for CIE was set by the Government some time during December.  The subvention for the following year starting on 1 January was communicated to CIE some time around mid-December.  To deal with the situation in 1982 Deputy Wilson who was Minister, and his Government settled on a figure of £86 million as a subvention limit for 1983.  This merely repeated what had gone on for years.  The outturn for 1982 was £109 million.  CIE were to reduce their needs by £23 million despite the fact that inflation was running at 20 per cent.  If the £109 million had gone up with the rate of inflation by the <Col N="415" /> end of 1983 there would have been a loss of about £132 million.  CIE were to reduce that to £86 million.  This was totally unrealistic.  Even if CIE were to sack half their workforce, it could not be done because the redundancy payments would have greatly exceeded £46 million.  That illustrates the lack of reality in Governments' handling of CIE for years. They were given unrealistic figures plucked out of the air, to fit in with the Estimates two or three weeks before the financial year.  The figures were ridiculous and were ignored.  For the 15 years 1968-69 to 1982 the deficit in CIE went up by a multiple of the rate of inflation so that in 1982 there was a loss of £109 million. The National Prices Commission eloquently pointed out that had the deficit gone up merely by the rate of inflation from 1969 to 1982, it would have been only about £12.5 million in 1982 and not £109 million.  That indicates how CIE got out of control.  This is not something that could be blamed on CIE management and workers, although clearly some blame could go to them.  The Government played a huge part in bringing about that disgraceful trend because they failed to face the issues.  That is what we sought to change after December 1982 and that is what we have changed.</P>
    <P>In January 1983 I said that we had to create a new climate, a new environment in CIE and get away from year to year budgeting.  By mid-June 1983 CIE had a five year profile.  It is working.  In 1983 the losses declined to £102 million, a drop of £7 million.  Inflation that year was close to 18 per cent, so we are really talking about a reduction in real terms of about 15 per cent &mdash; a dramatic improvement without massive cuts in services and without redundancies.  The 1984 figures are not yet published but it will probably be somewhere between £104 million and £105 million, leaving aside the new subsidy for interest charges for DART which we have taken on board.  Inflation in that year was at 7 or 8 per cent.  That means another 5 per cent reduction in real terms in the deficit.  We are now half way through this year and the projected outturn <Col N="416" /> is that losses will be £104 million, allowing for 5 per cent inflation which gives a further reduction in real terms probably of the order of 3 or 4 per cent. The board, management and workforce of CIE should be given credit for that achievement.</P>

      <P>It is important for them to know that their achievement has been recognised, that it is worthwhile, and that the future of CIE is now more assured than it has been for many years. There is, however, no room for complacency. Deputy Wilson and Deputy Prendergast alluded to this question and Deputy Wilson in his interjection a moment ago raised the question of passengers. Passenger numbers are falling, and I want to deal with that subject. Many Deputies have talked about a social service and I think it was Deputy Prendergast who used the phrase that we should go broke on this.  Deputy Taylor and others advocated a spend, spend, spend policy on railways.  Deputy Taylor criticised the emphasis given in the national plan to the road programme. The railways cater for only 4 per cent of all passenger miles in this country, a very small percentage.  They cannot be argued to be a massive social service.  I believe that the railways should be used more and I would encourage everybody to use them.  They are safe and an increasingly comfortable and fast way to travel, and I hope that more and more people will seek to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that passenger numbers have been declining and I hope that we can arrest that.  In the city bus services at least we had a little halt in 1982-83 and again a slight return to declining numbers.  As I remember it, the decline is less rapid than previously.  I have said, and it is no harm to repeat, that CIE have now a new urban bus fleet.  They are in the process of getting a new provincial bus fleet and they have DART.  They have the first quarter of their new mainline coaches. That is all part of the new environment <Col N="417" /> we are seeking to create, but what we need now in the urban bus services in particular is dependability of service. That is the next ingredient.  We have new buses, busways, faster and more comfortable journeys, and we need dependable, reliable services, and that is where the question of industrial relations and absenteeism in Dublin city services is very important.</P>

      <P>In a sense when Deputy Prendergast was speaking on this question of passengers he highlighted one of the old gems that are often raised in relation to transport, that is: &ldquo;Reduce your prices and get more passengers&rdquo;. This has been tried previously.  We had the great train robbery sales promotion a few years ago.  Yes, it is true that the great train robbery promotion scheme attracted more people to the railway, but it lost a great deal of money to CIE because the extra numbers multiplied by the smaller price amounted to much less than the previous numbers multiplied by the higher price.  Unwittingly Deputy Prendergast highlighted this problem.  A half busload at 50p is better than a full busload at 20p.  He was making the opposite point but he was wrong.  It highlights how wrong the old argument in relation to transport is.  By just reducing the fares you are not necessarily helping the transport situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £30 million which has been referred to in this Bill and by several Deputies &mdash; in fact £36 million &mdash; in short term borrowings has accumulated because of wishful thinking in the past by the Government and possibly by CIE, but more so by the Government.  That was setting £86 million and wishing it <Col N="418" /> into existence.  The year before that they wished £96 million into existence and the outturn was £109 million, and so these short term borrowings increased.  Now we are saying that we recognise that this matter was not faced up to in the past. We are taking it on board as a Government; we have not got £30 million to pay it off but we are going to pay it off over ten years.  It is only right that we should do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell spoke about CIE pensions.  I am very glad, very happy to have been able to do something about CIE pensions.  Coming as I do from Inchicore, which is the principal point of employment for CIE, I have known since a child many men who retired on very small pensions.  Negotiations have been going on for some years between management and unions on a new pension scheme but, a new pension scheme having been drawn up, the cost of it to the workforce was found to be too high and it was dropped.  An interim arrangement improving the present scheme has come before me and I am delighted to have approved it.  It means that the maximum pensions for wages grade workers in CIE have been increased from £16 to £34 subject to there being no objections. It is required that these increases in pensions in CIE be advertised in the newspapers and observations sought.  I understand that the newspaper advertisements will be placed in the next few days and 28 days must elapse before the scheme is implemented.  I hope there will be no insuperable objections to it, although apparently there may be from one of the unions.  I will be only too delighted to approve finally immediately it comes to my desk &mdash; the increasing of the maximum pension from £16 to £34. The idea is that this supplements the normal social welfare benefits so that all wages grade employees leaving CIE will have two-thirds of their retiring wage to live on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the details.  I would like to deal quickly with some points raised by Deputies.  Deputy <Col N="419" /> Wilson raised the question and speculated on some rumours which I have not heard of a loss for last year of £114 million and next year of £123 million.  I am glad to say that this is not the case.  The losses for 1984 will be of the order of less than £105 million, around £104 million, which is very much on target.  That does not include the interest payments on DART, as we treated them separately and the Government are paying them.  For 1985 again the figure of £104 million is on target with six months gone.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson, Deputy Mac Giolla and in particular Deputy Carey raised the question of GAC at Shannon.  I have made a general comment about Deputies wishing Ministers to run State organisations and interfere all the time and do this, that and the other.  One of the things that has caused many of the problems in State companies is not leaving them to the boards to run them.  I have had to repel a great deal of harassment from Deputies, particularly Deputy Carey, about GAC. I am glad that, having harassed me for so long, he was able to recognise what we were able to do to keep the jobs going in the GAC plant at Shannon.  I suppose Deputy Carey by his harassment ought to take much of the credit for that, but it was the right decision for this country.  It is true that the buses are somewhat dearer than we would pay if we were importing them, but at least we are saving money on the balance of trade and maintaining employment in Ireland.  I am grateful to Deputy Carey for acknowledging what has been done there.</P>
      <P>I am rather puzzled at Deputy Mac Giolla's attitude.  It is the first time ever that I have heard a person purporting to represent a workers' party arguing that workers' jobs should be done away with and that we should import cheaper buses. That seemed to be what he was arguing. He was actually criticising the production of buses in this country.  I do not know what motivated Deputy Mac Giolla.  It certainly could not have been a pro-worker bias.  I am somewhat confounded by his stance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The GAC operation at Shannon might <Col N="420" /> be criticised on some grounds.  I cannot pretend to be totally happy with every aspect of it, but I believe we were right overall in bringing forward expenditure from 1987 to 1985 in order to keep that plant going.  Provision had been made in the national plan for a certain amount of money to be spent by CIE in 1985, 1986 and 1987 in replenishing their bus fleet. If we spent only the amount envisaged for this year it would not be enough to keep GAC going until the end of the year and they would have to close down, forcing us to import buses in future years. Rather than do that, the Government decided to rearrange the allocations and bring forward an amount from 1987 to 1985 and the remainder to 1986.  That is enough to keep the plant going in 1985 and 1986 and we will get all the buses we need without importing them.</P>
    <P>The future after 1986 is something about which I am sure GAC are worried. We cannot go on buying buses.  Most of our bus requirement will be met by 1986 because of the upgraded bus programme. They must find export markets.  We are paying now for buses we need, although we do not need them quite as fast as we are taking them.  We are doing that to keep jobs in this country.  Beyond 1986 the situation is very worrying and GAC will have to redouble their efforts to export.  I hope that Deputy Carey, who has been so articulate on behalf of the workforce there, will be articulate in bringing that message back.  GAC will have to find orders abroad if they are to survive in the long term.  The Government have done everything possible in extremely difficult financial circumstances to keep them going for the next two years.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Lyons on Tuesday, 2 July 1985:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to take all the necessary action to ensure the continuance of Irish Steel Holdings Limited.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;expresses its confidence that the Government in taking a decision on the request from Irish Steel Ltd. for additional support in the light of its financial results in 1984-85 will consider all the relevant facts including the potential commercial viability of the Haulbowline plant; the impact which closure would have on the Cork area; the effectiveness of cost cutting measures recently announced by the company, and, the competing demands for scarce Exchequer resources.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, when I had the opportunity of speaking here, I outlined many of the reasons I believed it was essential to the economic life of Cork that Irish Steel and the jobs therein should be maintained because we had already suffered too many body-blows in the employment scene recently. I said that we could not afford to lose <Col N="424" /> another 650 jobs plus the spin-off estimated at 400 jobs &mdash; although the Minister alleged that that was an exaggeration &mdash; in other industries in the region.  Cork cannot afford to lose these jobs.  We must be very clear on the meaning of the motion and amendment before us.  One of the factors taken into account in the amendment is the effectiveness of cost cutting measures recently announced by the company.  By voting for that measure the Deputies opposite, especially the Labour Members, are voting to support the cost cutting measures announced by the chairman to the workers on 13 June. The statement from the chairman said:</P>
      <P>At a special meeting of the Board last week, we came to inescapable conclusions. The first &mdash; and most important &mdash; is the company will face financial problems later this year.</P>
      <P>If the outflow of cash is not staunched at once, the Board will be left with no alternative but to recommend to the Minister that the plant cease to trade and, in fact, close down.</P>
      <P>The following decisions, therefore, have been taken by the Board:</P>
      <P>1.  There will be an instant pay freeze at all levels until the end of 1986.</P>
      <P>2.  The numbers employed by the company will be reduced by approximately 100 persons.</P>
      <P>3.  Redundancy payments will be restricted to statutory requirements plus one week's pay for every year of service.</P>
      <P>4.  The 1.7 per cent increase by way of analogue review for 1984 which was recommended by the Labour Court will be paid.</P>
      <P>These decisions are the only way to resolve the crisis in our industry and to extend the life of the company.  In consequence, they are not negotiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Government policy both on analogue payments and the measure of redundancy payments in State Bodies.  For this reason, I have to add that payment of the analogue of 1.7 per <Col N="425" /> cent and an extra week over statutory redundancy payments will require Government approval.</P>
    <P>I am not here to campaign for or to seek huge redundancy payments.  I want the preservation of jobs.  If a package of measures is being introduced and if reasonable, long and loyal service has been given by a group of people in the company, they are entitled to be considered if there is a commitment to the company continuing in existence with the remaining workforce.</P>
    <P>The offer of redundancy is small by comparison with figures paid, even by State companies, in the Cork area.  However, if it is dependent &mdash; and I hope it is not &mdash; on those 100 jobs being lost, then there must be reasonable and meaningful negotiations.  If agreement cannot be reached, the workers should not be blamed for any tough measures which may have to be taken.  It must be pointed out very clearly to the Members on the opposite side of the House that by voting for the amendment they are saying that the workers must accept the company's offer, that this is the end of the road and that we may hope for more later on.  I say that very respectfully because I thought the Minister's speech last night was very reasonable, although I did not think it was as optimistic as my local newspaper seemed to think in its headline this morning. The Minister said that there may be some assistance forthcoming for unemployed or redundant steel workers from Europe, and I hope that there will be. However, it is all very vague and we need more information in that regard.  Many questions remained to be answered after the Minister's speech last night and one of the most important was in regard to how soon we will know the amounts to which workers were entitled.</P>
    <P>We want to preserve the jobs in Irish Steel and the economic climate which the continuance of Irish Steel means.  Last night Deputy Lyons referred to the contribution of Irish Steel to the balance of payments and to exports.  What happens if Irish Steel is not there?  What about all <Col N="426" /> the imports for our construction industry?  I quoted from <i>Business and Finance</i> last night, and the person who wrote the article from which I quoted went on to say: &ldquo;Thank God, nobody mentioned the strategic importance of Irish Steel&rdquo;.  That was a defeatist approach by the writer of that article because it is essential to produce as much of our own steel as possible.  I should like us to be in a position where we could produce all our steel requirements, but obviously European and world trends dictate otherwise.  Rationalisation programmes carried out over a number of years by successive Governments mean that only certain lines are now being produced here, but my recent visit to Irish Steel indicated that a lot of progress had been made, that modernisation and rationalisation had taken place and that a committed workforce were doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>Last night I pointed out that the major problems affecting them were outside factors beyond the control of Irish Steel management or workers.  Labour costs were referred to as being high, but the responsibility of the workforce and the reasonable absentee rate is an indication of a commitment which is all too scarce in so many other Irish industries.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Deputies opposite that if they vote for the Government amendment they are finalising the nonnegotiable cost cutting measures announced by the chairman.  They should look closely at the unconditional Fianna Fáil motion first.  Our motion is the Government amendment without the dangerous conditions attached.  Government Members should support it.  There is a precedent for such action.  When in Opposition Members opposite voted to nationalise the private enterprise Fieldcrest concern.  They do not have to nationalise Irish Steel.  It is a State company that we should preserve.  We should protect the badly-needed jobs in the company for the Cork region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution I will be appealing that every effort be made to keep Irish Steel open and made a viable <Col N="427" /> proposition in the years ahead.  Our amendment does not put us in a position of voting for the closure of Irish Steel. To say it does is wrong, like many of the statements made last night.  The Fianna Fáil motion will not achieve anything for Irish Steel.  It is an exercise to win votes and influence the electorate.  Opposition contributions last night strengthened my opinion on that, because no suggestions were put forward in regard to how Irish Steel can be made viable except to put in more money and let the company carry on as before.  If we put £24 million in this year and do not seriously consider the position in the company and the options that must be taken, we will be back again next year looking for more money for the company.  We cannot continue to do that indefinitely.</P>
      <P>It is easy for the Opposition to demand more taxpayers' money for the company and say that electricity charges to the company be reduced without taking into consideration their earlier demands for lower taxation.  The money sought for Irish Steel will have to come from the taxpayers and the demands for reduced electricity charges for Irish Steel will have to be offset by higher charges to domestic consumers.  Are Fianna Fáil in favour of lower prices to industry even if that will result in higher domestic prices for electricity? They have not spelled that out to date.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion does not do anything except bring this serious Cork problem into a political arena at a time when talks between management and unions are about to commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they aware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  Some of the workers involved are present for the debate and I have told them that we cannot allow further taxpayers' money to be put into the operation in Haulbowline without examining in detail the reasons the industry has been so uneconomic to date. We must closely examine all the facts involved and then decide if the plant can <Col N="428" /> be saved.  We must also take into consideration, as mentioned by the Minister, the social position in Cork because of recent closures.  Having taken all those factors into consideration the Government must make a decision whether to allocate more money to Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in Irish Steel because I have close relatives working there.  My brother-in-law works at the plant.  The company is as close to me as to anybody else in Cork city and county. I am in favour of keeping the plant open, but serious questions must be answered. If we do not face up to those questions now we will have to face them next year or the following year.  The sooner they are dealt with the better.  There is a serious contradiction between the proposals put forward to eliminate 100 jobs in Irish Steel and the fact that the company paid £2 million in overtime in 1984.  How can we explain that contradiction to the people &mdash; that we eliminate 100 jobs having paid £1.4 million in overtime in 1983-84 and £2 million last year?  In fact, I have been told that the figure this year will be much greater.  There is a need for an explanation in regard to that.</P>
      <P>If the Government invest £24 million in Irish Steel this year, will that ensure the future viability of the plant?  In my opinion it will not.  The future of the plant can only be assured by an in depth study of the operation and following major surgery in the technical management of the plant.  The chairman's rhetoric in 1984, when he said that the position would improve and that the plant would be self-financing within a short time, was seriously misleading.  The problem will get worse before it improves.  There must be a close examination of the management structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that £6 million will keep Irish Steel running until early 1986 and I appeal to the Minister to make a strong recommendation to the Cabinet that that money be made available on condition that by early 1986 proposals will be put forward and agreed to by management and unions in Irish Steel to bring about a more efficient operation.  If the workforce is properly motivated and the <Col N="429" />&ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude which prevails in Irish Steel is reduced and, if possible, eliminated, the company will succeed. Having discussed the matter with workers in recent weeks, I am satisfied that it is possible to do that.  All that is required is time.</P>
    <P>A report was submitted to senior management in December 1983 which, if adopted, would eliminate a lot of the problems for the company.  However, the recommendations in the document were, I regret to say, generally ignored.  We now find Irish Steel seeking further investment to keep the company ticking over inefficiently.  The case I am putting forward this evening is politically dangerous for me and may be represented as such by my political opponents.  I am putting forward the case in good faith because I believe that the improvements required can be achieved by goodwill all around and proper motivation of the workforce.  The mill is one of the most modern in the world.  Targets are being achieved, but only by paying massive sums in overtime.  We have been told that the mill had a down time, that it was not operating at full capacity.  It was operating a total of 97,530 minutes as against the available rolling time of 190,475 minutes in the period January to September 1983.  That means that for 51.75 per cent of its possible operating time it was not operating.  Over half of the available mill rolling time was attributed to the down time.  That is a serious problem and I have been told that the position will be as serious this year.  The latest figures show that the mill's down time, when it was not operating, in 1984-85 was 1,960 hours.  The total tonnage produced in the same period was 170,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>We must question a figure of £2 million for overtime last year.  That could be eliminated if realistic discussions took place and there was proper management at the plant.  The whole emphasis seems to be on obtaining redundancies in Irish Steel rather than trying to make the plant more efficient.  There has been also a question as to how big the lump sum would be.  I accept that that is important to those likely to lose their jobs.  Unfortunately, <Col N="430" /> a monster has been created in the Cork region in recent times &mdash; redundancies. Those who receive a big lump sum will enjoy 18 or 19 months of heaven but, as Deputy Fitzgerald said last night, after that time people face the prospect of not having any income because they cannot obtain unemployment assistance.  However, we must tackle the monster of high redundancy payments.  We should cease talking about job losses and redundancies and look at the real rasons why factories are closing.</P>
    <P>It is untrue to say that the Government are not committed to Irish Steel.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and others and I have detected that they are committed to the continuation of Irish Steel provided the inefficiency and the commitment required from the Government can be reduced.  Consultants have been brought in and reports have issued but even at this late stage there must be a real in-depth examination of the Irish Steel operation and the areas of serious losses must be faced up to and dealt with.  Management and unions would appreciate this.</P>
    <P>Why are Irish Steel constantly looking for more money from the taxpayers? Why is the mill not functioning properly, since it is a modern mill?  Why is there such a long close-down time?  Why is there so much overtime?  Why are targets being met only by a great deal of overtime? These questions have to be resolved before Irish Steel are given an indefinite commitment to future operations, because if we do not face up to these questions now, we are only putting off the evil day of closure and unless major structural changes are made, that day is just being postponed.</P>
    <P>I spent many hours speaking to people at different levels in the company in recent months and one comment that surfaced regularly was bad leadership in the company.  This problem must be tackled first.  There must be leadership because without leadership you cannot motivate a workforce and there must be an elimination of the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to give the <Col N="431" /> company the £6 million necessary to stay open until early 1986.  I say this realising that if the money is given there will still be a risk of failure unless the industry achieves a consistency of production and reduces costs.  I realise that the difficulties facing the industry are enormous, and they were spelled out last night &mdash; the high price of scrap, high energy costs which have to be tackled at some stage and so on.  It would be irresponsible and misleading if I were to minimise these difficulties at this time.  There is no guarantee and the only way out is if the people in the company get their act together, starting at the top.</P>
    <P>However, if we all keep talking about the unacceptable levels of this and that and how this or that problem can be controlled nothing will be achieved.  The objectives must be realistic.  If there are problems &mdash; and I have said there are &mdash; they must be highlighted and discussed openly by management and unions.  The time for platitudes and persuasion is over. There must be agreement between unions and management.  There must be meaningful discussions about the problems, irrespective of who is offended.</P>
    <P>I know from speaking to the staff in Irish Steel that the majority of the workers have a desire to see the plant survive, but what seems to be lacking is a sense of leadership and a sense of urgency coupled with vision and management techniques. The issues of excessive overtime, unacceptable downtime, energy costs and so on must be tackled.  From reading some of the reports it seems that the appointment of new highly qualified senior engineering management in the plant is essential and this must be considered.</P>
    <P>Some of my suggestions might give the impression that I am asking for more money for this management but as an amateur in the steel business I believe there is a need for a different kind of technical management in this firm and that can only be obtained by further investment.  I am asking the Minister to give Irish Steel some time to get over their difficulties, to iron out the problems <Col N="432" /> in the company, and hopefully the economic climate might make the market for scrap more attractive.  I am suggesting that we play for time for a number of months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contrast the wording of Fianna Fáil's motion with the Minister's amendment.  In my view it is not responsible in the present climate to say effectively that we should keep Irish Steel Holdings open at whatever price for evermore.  That, basically, is what is implied in the Fianna Fáil motion.  The Minister is being responsible and sensitive. There are four criteria in his amendment &mdash; commercial viability, the impact which the closure would have on the Cork area, the effectiveness of cost-cutting measures and the question of competing demands for scarce Exchequer resources. I would like to dwell a little on those four points because they are the type of criteria on which every sensitive decision of this kind has to, and should be, made.</P>
      <P>On the question of commercial viability, the first thing that has to be said is that the actual losses for 1984 and 1985 are practically double the projected losses.  There is no doubt that the reasons for that were mainly external factors but, nevertheless the reality is that the company are in a disastrous loss-making position.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister explained in some detail the external factors over which the management and staff of Irish Steel have no control whatsoever, the question of scrap prices and the impossibility of matching the sale price of the product to the escalating cost of scrap. There is no doubt that sympathy has to be extended to a company who find themselves making a serious loss because of circumstances outside their control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also alluded to maximising efficiency in the plant.  Mammoth steps have been taken over the last two or three years improving efficiency but there is still some way to go.  It would be pure nonsense to talk about perfection in the plant with all the problems arising from external factors only.  That kind of situation rarely exists.  In relation to the <Col N="433" /> future and on the issue of commercial viability, the Minister said that currently Irish Steel could not now be considered strictly viable in the commercial sense of the word.  That is certainly a sobering statement and one which must cause great concern and alarm in Irish Steel. There is no doubt that the taxpayer, while he may and we hope will come once again to Cork, will not permanently underwrite losses in that company unless the question of commercial viability is satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>The next criterion in the Minister's amendment is that of the impact of closure on Cork.  This Government have always been criticised for their supposed monetarism, insensitivity and so on but the Minister has put into his statement that the impact of closure on Cork is a central factor in his recommendation to Government.  No Cork Deputy needs to be reminded that the Cork region has been devastated, in particular that the heart has been torn out of the traditional industrial base &mdash; Fords, Dunlops and Verolme dockyard &mdash; and that the survival of Irish Steel is more than a matter of commercial viability.  It would have a disastrous effect on the morale of the people and would add very significantly to a particularly difficult situation in the Cobh area.  Irish Steel spread their influence, of course, far from Cobh.  I am pleased to note that the amendment contains that criterion.</P>
    <P>The next criterion inserted in the amendment is the effectiveness of cost cutting measures.  Last night, the Minister mentioned the necessity of reducing labour costs by at least 10 per cent. Deputy Allen has mentioned issues relating to excessive downtime and excessive overtime and the subject of absenteeism was mentioned.  I bow to the knowledge of Deputy Fitzgerald, former Minister for Labour, but I would not have thought that absenteeism of the level of 8 to 9 per cent was something of which to be proud, even though there may be other industries with a worse record.  I know, for example, that some of the modern computer industries which employ, by and large, very young people and have pretty <Col N="434" /> enlightened management &mdash; which presumably is a factor in all this &mdash; have absenteeism rates in some of the factories down to 1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not comparable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they are not comparable in the sense that the nature of the work in Irish Steel is not pleasant, with hot and noisy conditions and so on.  However, I would not have thought one would be speaking in glowing terms of absenteeism of that level. That is another issue, perhaps not a major one but one which also needs tackling.</P>
      <P>I found it strange for the management to say in their recent statement that they would have to shed 100 jobs and do this and that, and that that was the end of it, that they do not negotiate.  I would regard that as a sign, not of strong management, but of a management that lack the confidence to negotiate their position.  Certainly, they seem to lack confidence in the attitude of those working there who must, in the end, agree to these measures if the plant is to be saved.</P>
      <P>One would question from top to bottom the whole efficiency of the operation because one must.  If you cannot deal with the external factors over which you have no control, then you, at least, must try to deal with the factors over which you have some control.  It would be purely fantasy to say that everything in Irish Steel is absolutely fine, that all the problems are external and one cannot do anything about them.  If that is the case, which I do not believe, then there would be no point in throwing good money after bad.  Clearly, the question of effectiveness of cost cutting measures must be a criterion in the Minister's recommendation on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, the Minister raised the question of seeking funds from the EC to finance redundancy and provide grants for re-employment.  That shows that the Government recognise the problem and are prepared to do everthing within their power to try to alleviate the hardship which may be caused in the event of some <Col N="435" /> redundancies arising, as they inevitably will.</P>
    <P>The last criterion to which the Minister referred was the question of competing demands on scarce Exchequer resources. We live in a climate in which high taxation is crippling people at all levels, particuarly in the PAYE sector; it has become a positive disincentive to enterprise and is certainly holding up the growth and development of the economy.  On top of that, we have very heavy borrowing and crippling debt repayments.  To further aggravate the position, people generally are annoyed by cuts in public expenditure and consequently in services.  In that crippling bind, it would be quite irresponsible for the Minister and the Government not to raise the issue of whether one can justify this order of money when there are so many other competing demands on an overtaxed and overburdened people.</P>
    <P>They are the main criteria and they are important.  There are one or two other issues to which I would refer.  I would like to say something about the recent history of this issue in this House and, in particular, the debate which we had on 28 June 1984.  In that debate Deputy Reynolds, who led for the Opposition, made a most responsible contribution.  I would like to refer to one or two things which he said, as follows:</P>
    <P>We are talking here about £90 million of taxpayers' money and the least the people are entitled to expect is that we will show responsibility in the way we deal with that.</P>
    <P>He chides the Minister for not displaying sufficient commerciality in his judgment of the matter, saying:</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he is not applying the commercial criteria to this decision that he said he would at the outset.</P>
    <P>The whole tone of Deputy Reynolds's contribution is that Irish Steel should be looked upon in purely commercial terms. This Government who have always been criticised for doing just that have made a serious retreat, if you like, from that <Col N="436" /> position in the sense that, in addition to commercial viability, they are prepared, willing and anxious to look at other criteria as well to justify the continuation of Irish Steel, as I &mdash; and I am sure everybody else &mdash; hope will emerge from the Government's consideration in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the annual report of Irish Steel and to the chairman's statement of last year in which he said:</P>
    <P>The decisions of the Government and the Commission to assist the Company are contingent on some rigid conditions. The most important is that Irish Steel must be financially viable by the end of 1985.  In short, there is no question of further funding.  The Company will have to finance operations from now onwards in a normal, commercial manner.</P>
    <P>That is the manner in which the chairman of the company summed up the position last September.  Nobody should be in any doubt that there is a grave anxiety on the part of the Government, as there was previously on the part of the Opposition, that this company must get out of their problems and prove to be commercially viable.</P>
    <P>I visited the mill when I was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1983 and was extremely impressed with everything I saw, although I am no expert in the matter. It was a most impressive plant.  In the company of other Cork Deputies, I met a group of union and staff representatives from Irish Steel recently and was very much impressed by their attitude.  There are very good signs as well as a difficult situation.  I hope that when the Government in the weeks immediately ahead come to make their decision on the basis of the responsible criteria which the Minister has set down, the balance of overall advantage will be tipped in favour of a further and final investment in Irish Steel and that, as we all hope, Irish Steel will respond &mdash; staff, management and board of directors &mdash; positively to that final act of confidence on the part of the Government and of the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>It has become a habit here in the past few months for Cork Deputies to plead for the saving of an industry. I can appreciate that Deputies opposite have to try to establish a case for their Government.  I know this is expected of them.</P>
      <P>The steel industry is a vital asset to any nation, whether in time of war or peace. It is part of the social and economic structure in the development of a nation. Threats and rumours of war can affect the supply of steel for our own requirements and this must be foremost in any decisions made by the Government regarding the future of Irish Steel Holdings.  They must also bear in mind the disastrous impact that any suggestion of the closure of Irish Steel would have on the Cork region which has suffered already from the closure of Ford, Dunlop, Verolme and other smaller industries.</P>
      <P>We must remember that the £98 million received from the Government was used to repay outstanding borrowings but since then there has been a significant advance in the working and efficiency of this industry.  It would be wrong to say the £98 million was given with a clean sheet.  It was a repayment of a debt and we should be under no illusions about it. Credit must be given to the industry for what they have done since they received that cash injection.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in production of an additional 40,000 tonnes of steel as compared with a year ago and I understand the volume should read 200,000 tonnes by next year.  There is no question of not finding a market for this product.  As the Minister knows, at present the British market is very promising and Irish Steel also trade with other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout Europe the steel industry is experiencing difficulties similar to those occurring here.  However, the European governments concerned are making every effort to safeguard and protect their own industries.  It is clear that part of the problem comes from countries outside the EC.  The Council of Ministers must take positive action.  They must introduce restrictions on the export of <Col N="438" /> scrap to countries outside the Community. I impress on the Minister and his Government to do everything possible to bring about a greater realisation in the Council of Minister of the problems of our steel industry.  We are in Europe and we should be protected by Europe.  In his statement last night the Minister told us he raised the matter with the Council of Ministers but to no effect.  We should be demanding this kind of protection.  It is our industry.  We are a member of the EC and they are under an obligation to protect an industry such as Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an EC Commission report entitled <i>General Objectives for Steel, 1990</i> and he said it made depressing reading.  I do not think it was that depressing.  There is some hope in the report, especially where structural and mechanical engineering are concerned.  Irish Steel produce a number of products to meet this kind of development.  All of this is set out in the report.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy to Irish Steel Holdings places them in a disadvantageous position.  For instance, this year their ESB bill will be in the region of £10 million, but a steel industry outside London will be better off to the extent of 60 per cent.  The Minister should meet the Minister for Energy and discuss this problem with him.  He should remove this anomaly so far as Irish Steel are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not usually refer to a speech by another Deputy but I think Deputy Allen said it is very easy to talk about shifting the price to the ESB and that the taxpayers would have to pay.  I hope I am not misquoting him in that.  The question must be asked: who pays for statutory redundancies and social welfare benefits? The answer is the taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>By the closure of Irish Steel we are transferring that liability from the taxpayers to social welfare and statutory redundancies.  It is the taxpayers who <Col N="439" /> have to pay the bill.  We are talking about 650 people employed in the industry, in addition to a further 400 people in other industries who have dealings with Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I hoped last night that the Minister would give us some positive indication regarding the future of Irish Steel.  However, on reading his speech I am afraid of the psychological effect it will have on the workforce.  When we were discussing Dunlop, Ford and Verolme I said that as soon as one starts talking about a factory closing workers lose interest in their industry.  Certainly the workers in Irish Steel have not lost interest in their firm.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister paid a visit to Irish Steel and he saw the situation for himself.  I am confident that in his interview with management there was no question of the industry being overmanned or of any problem other than that of marketing.  However, suddenly a statement was issued most unexpectedly by the chairman of Irish Steel.  Because of the time the statement was made one would assume that some directive was given by the Government to the chairman. He was very positive in what he was saying and I am not for a moment criticising him.  One sentence in his statement read:</P>
      <P>These decisions are the only way to resolve the crisis in our industry and to extend the life of the company.  In consequence they are not negotiable.</P>
      <P>We seem to be drifting from one very important principle regarding labour relations.  It was always understood, no matter how bad things were, that everything was for negotiation.  I fail to understand that statement released shortly after the Minister's visit.</P>

If these countries are making a case for such large sums of money we in Ireland should be making a similar case.  We are not talking of that kind of money.  It would be worth the Minister's while reading the <i>Metal Bulletin</i> of March 1985.  He will see for himself the demands Germany, Italy and France are making for the continuance of employment in their steel industries. This is the kind of case we would expect our Government to be establishing in Europe.  It is of vital importance at this stage and no time must be lost in making our case.</P>

Surely we have a right to know exactly the Government's thinking and the Minister's thinking on the future of Irish Steel.  It was not written into the Minister's speech here last night. I seem to recall that we read something similar in the case of Irish Dunlop, Fords and Verolme.  We were told then that every effort would be made to replace such industries.  There is no replacement for Irish Steel.  It is an essential industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it might be possible to obtain financial assistance from the EC Commission towards redundancy costs.  This is not the case of the German Government, the Italian Government or the French Government. They are not talking about money for redundancy.  They are talking about money to retain their industry.  It is somewhat disheartening that we come again with the cap in hand begging for something to eliminate employment not just for the present personnel in Irish Steel but for their children and their children to come.  This is the importance of this industry.  Generations worked in those established industries in the Cork region. Their sons and daughters in the Cobh area, in the Passage area in the whole Cork area always looked to Irish Steel Cork secure and permanent employment. I ask the Minister to bear in mind the <Col N="443" /> importance of providing this kind of employment for our young people.  Let us all get together and have a meeting with the management, public representatives in the area and everyone else who is concerned.  Let us all work together in the interests of this great industry, because Ireland cannot grow, develop or advance without Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>It is sad that the building and construction industry is practically on its knees at present.  This too is having an effect on Irish Steel.  It has gone through a very lean period.  I have no doubt that every Deputy knows of that.</P>
      <P>The dedication of the management and workers in trying to keep the industry afloat has surpassed everyone's imagination.  I understand that in a radio broadcast last year Deputy Desmond was quoted as saying: &ldquo;Close it.  It is only a white elephant&rdquo;.  I am open to correction on that, but I am informed that that is what he said.  It is sad that a Minister should express himself in such a way where this industry is concerned.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by the Minister of the price of scrap.  We would have our heads in the sand if we did not agree that there has been an increase in the price of scrap.  Scrap is like other commodities in that the price fluctuates.  From all the evidence available there is hope that the price will drop.</P>
      <P>We must look at the employment position in Cork and must make an effort to protect our existing industries.  I am convinced there is no necessity to talk about the closure of Irish Steel.  It is a viable industry and has a highly efficient workforce.  The workers have the dedication that is necessary to ensure the prosperity of the company.  All that is needed is for the industry to be given the necessary encouragement and money to take it through this lean period and the problems which it is facing.  Surely it is not too much for a Deputy representing the Cork area to ask the Government to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What worries me is that we are not getting all the information.  The leader of our party paid a visit to Irish Steel <Col N="444" /> recently and apparently everything was rosy then.  There was no question of the industry being overmanned.  The only problem was in relation to the market.  It was extraordinary that a statement should appear from the chairman of the company contradicting everything that was stated at that time to our leader and the other Fianna Fáil representatives.  I hope the chairman and executives of the company will discuss the matter with the trade unions and the workers' representatives. I hope everyone will co-ordinate their efforts in order to save this industry. It is a viable industry and one which is essential if we are to build up the economy. In war or peace a steel industry is an essential part of any nation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to start negotiations forthwith with the management, trade unions and public representatives to ensure that this vital industry is saved in the Cork area.</P>

      <P>One criticism I have of both the amendment and the motion is that both understate the importance of Irish Steel.  In the amendment it is stated: &ldquo;.... the impact the closure will have on the Cork area;....&rdquo;.  The closure of Irish Steel would not just be of significance to Cork only but would have a detrimental effect on our industrial base.</P>
      <P>The setting up of Irish Steel was looked on as one of the major achievements in our industrial development and it is regrettable that we are tonight expressing doubts and deep concern about its future. I agree that there are factors which would leave us in doubt as to its future, but these can be overcome.  Things happened in the past which did not help in any way and which in fact have led to the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to indulge in an attack on the Opposition because that would be a negative approach, but I must respond to Deputy Fitzgerald who saw fit to launch an attack on the Labour Party <Col N="445" /> position last night.  One of the problems encountered by Irish Steel was the question of providing the raw material.  The Council of Ministers have stonewalled against Irish objections to the export of scrap to Third World countries.  I suggest to Deputy Fitzgerald that he, as a member of the European Parliament, should take the initial step to see that this question is resolved.  It is of vital importance to Irish Steel and to our industrial base.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some things that the Government should do.  I will fully support any appeal in the House for a further injection of capital into Irish Steel.  I would go further than Deputy Allen in this regard.  It is vital that we produce this very basic element in industrial requirements.  We have that capacity, and if the cost exceeds £6 million or £7 million, so be it.  We are not talking merely about 600 jobs.  We are talking about our industrial base.  It is fundamental to any industrial policy that we have the capacity to produce this very necessary element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to reduce energy costs, and the Government can do something in that direction.  I am surprised to hear speakers on the opposite side calling for such a reduction when on 28 June last year, as reported at column 1048 of the Official Report, Deputy Reynolds, for whom I have the utmost respect as a politician and as a man of considerable ability, stated during the debate on the <Col N="446" /> Irish Steel Limited (Amendment) Act, 1984:</P>
    <P>But we would be living in fairyland if we thought somebody would not have to pay if the cost of electricity is reduced to Irish Steel.  If we are to give a reduction of £12 per ton to Irish Steel &mdash; and they are big users of electricity &mdash; then may I ask the Minister what is his and the Government's position as to who will pay?  Will it be an additional cost to the consumer in order to recoup it for the ESB?  I am quite sure the ESB will not be very happy to have to reduce the cost to any particular consumer.  If so they would also find themselves in the position &mdash; if the Government decided to reduce the price to Irish Steel &mdash; that they would have Alcan and other large users knocking at their door the following morning.</P>
    <P>It is dishonest of the speakers on the other side to come here asking for a reduction in the cost to Irish Steel when their spokesman could not foresee any way in which that could be achieved.  The cost of energy to Irish Steel is a major factor at about £10 million per year. Despite what Deputy Reynolds said, the Government should consider very carefully the energy cost factor.  It is of little advantage to have a resource off our coast if we do not put it to proper use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area in which significant savings could be made without any cost to the ESB.  There would be a reduction in income but that would not mean necessarily that the cost would be passed to the consumer.  I would regard it as legitimate to divert some of the massive profits of Bord Gáis, for instance, to supporting some of our other industries, because one safe company should not work in isolation from or to the detriment of other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of the role of <Col N="447" /> management in this whole affair.  Deputy Wyse has suggested that the recent announcement was precipitated by the Minister's visit to Irish Steel.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I would question the motives of the management who are now facing the unions and the staff in an impossible situation.  Management are saying they must effect 100 redundancies but they are not saying whether these will involve manual workers, craftsmen, administrative staff or even management.  They merely say that the figure of 100 is not negotiable.  I would not agree with management in their perception that the primary means of reducing costs is to reduce the cost of labour. Savings can be made in other areas also. It is dishonest of management to suggest to the workforce that in respect of redundancy their only entitlement would be a statutory payment plus payment for one week when two members of the board as senior executives of two other firms who effected redundancies in the harbour area in recent times gave the statutory payment plus four or five weeks payment.</P>
    <P>It is most unjust to adopt that attitude towards people who have served the company loyally, who have undertaken work that is dangerous and which in some cases caused lives to be lost.  I would be prepared to suggest to the unions that they go ahead and negotiate, if that would save the company, but I would not endorse the cry for 100 redundancies if this were the beginning of the end, as happened in the case of Verolme Cork Dockyard.  We would not agree to the redundancies if they were merely a step towards a further whittling down of staff numbers and towards eventual closure. As a Government backbencher and as a member of Labour I would not endorse that approach in any way.  I see this situation as a new beginning and not the beginning of the end.  If the workforce are to negotiate it must be with a view to keeping the company in operation.  No Government backbencher and no Deputy from the Cork area should allow any move towards closure of the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> There is a need for further Government investment in the company.  I am pleased that the Minister for Labour told the management to negotiate with those people whose livelihoods are now at stake.  That is crucial to the future of Irish Steel and to our whole industrial set up. I assure Deputy Fitzgerald that it is my intention to support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am honoured by the presence of the boss this evening.  As an active trade unionist I have been very concerned about the mounting pressure placed on the unions in recent times. They are being asked to play a kind of Russian roulette, to agree to 100 redundancies or else.  It is deplorable that a State company should behave in that manner.  If Irish Steel are to perform in a commercial market the Minister, the Minister for the Public Service or any future Minister in charge of these Departments must ensure that the company conform to commercial criteria.  To this end they must not be subject to the heavy <Col N="449" /> hand of the Department of the Public Service.  They are negotiating in a vacuum with the unions but they cannot agree to anything without first consulting the Department of the Public Service.</P>

      <P>This country has lost its shipping line, a dockyard and many large firms in the Cork area &mdash; Fords, Dunlops, Verolme and many others who did not get the same national headlines.  It is not merely a matter of employment about which we are talking here.  Just as it was two weeks ago in the argument about Irish Shipping Limited, we are talking about a matter of national strategy &mdash; that we have now no state shipping company and no steel works.  Each time some such controversial matter arises it is not acceptable that people just reach for the file containing easy solutions.  We have known for some time that perhaps there were many problems being encountered in the steel industry.  That is known all over Europe.  This House debated that matter on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>It is totally unfair of some Deputies opposite to endeavour to say that in some way my Cork colleagues are expedient or are jumping on the bandwagon of a political issue a fortnight after excellent results in a local election when such matters arises out of the blue and they endeavour to highlight them.  I would remind those colleagues opposite that not too long ago &mdash; three years ago &mdash; when Fianna Fáil were in power the Coalition parties voted to nationalise an expensive towel industry which cost our taxpayers millions.  At that time those Opposition Deputies &mdash; many of whom are here this evening &mdash; saw the Fieldcrest motion, costing millions of pounds, as being more important than saving a shipyard last week or a steel industry this week.

      <Col N="450" /> It is interesting to hear our Labour colleagues support our motions, say how right we are and then vote the other way in the lobbies, remaining in Government, continuing the heartless, spineless policies that create unemployment.  I did not hear mention from the Government side of the House this evening that there are 25,000 people unemployed in Cork whose hardship is worse than that being experienced anywhere else in the country, including Dublin, where unemployment is bad enough.  People are now being conned into accepting redundancy, as has been suggested again this evening by the Minister.  He says that he may go to the European Coal and Steel Fund in an endeavour to root out money to make it more pleasant for people to accept redundancy.</P>
    <P>Redundancy does not constitute a solution to any employment problem.  People ask how it can be rendered more acceptable to be kicked out of the door, with a cheque in one's pocket, which will be spent in a year once tax and PRSI contributions have been deducted.  Every time the question of redundancy arises it should be remembered that these people will then be visited by social welfare officers asking them where they got the Bank of Ireland calendar on their wall and where they have the money invested. That is what is happening in Cork, and I am sorry that Deputies opposite did not say so this evening.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because that is what is happening in their city.  They are coming to us, to our party leader and others to tell us how badly they are being treated.  If anybody in this House allows another major national industry that happens to be based in Cork to go down the tube because of the want of a few millions <Col N="451" /> of pounds of investment as against millions of pounds to be spent on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and redundancy payments, they should remember that that is not being fair to the electorate and to the people of Cork in particular.  The continuous cry is of continued instability on the world steel market, high energy costs, an increase in the price of scrap metal, the level of company cost structures.  Yet the only solution &mdash; and the manager of this company spells it out in his letter &mdash; is that in the middle of June 1985 there are to be another 100 people put on the dole.</P>
      <P>We are merely asking the House to support our motion, to stand behind the large workforce in Cork.  Our motion asks Dáil Éireann to call on the Government to take all the necessary action.  We are not saying that they should pump in £100 million of taxpayers' money or that resources should be diverted from other needy areas.  We are merely asking the House to take the necessary action to ensure the continuance of Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  There is no wild irresponsible action being advocated in that, such as nationalisation of an expensive towel industry when nobody wants to buy expensive towels.</P>

      <P>When Deputies in this House this evening mentioned that we should look at ESB costs it should be remembered that those costs were clearly set out as one of the major factors in this situation.  It is one factor crippling Irish Steel Holdings Limited.  Nobody on this side of the House advocated such costs being taken from large industries and placed on domestic consumers.  We all know the problem of electricity costs; they have been highlighted on many occasions in this House.  Would it not be better to pay an ESB subsidy of £4 or £5 million to Irish Steel Holdings Limited than pay an equivalent amount to redundant workers and have 650 of them marching around Cork feeling rejected and <Col N="452" /> neglected because this House is doing nothing for them?  Each time this happens this Government have the attitude: &ldquo;Well, another 100 workers here or there&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The port of Cork is being decimated.  I know Deputy Allen mentioned that fact. The port of Dublin is closed because they could not obtain another 20 redundancies. They could achieve only 140 while the figure in some report, without any statistical foundation, stated that it should be 160.  Therefore it is a case of closing Cork port, closing Dublin port, doing away with Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
      <P>If Deputies will not vote in favour of our motion &mdash; although some of them speak in favour of our motions week after week &mdash; at least we would ask that they pressurise their Ministers rather than resort to redundancy.  Indeed, the headlines in their own paper this morning was &ldquo;A Better Deal at Irish Steel&rdquo;, the implication being that this modern steel company would now receive resources to help them ride out the recession and to get them back on to their feet.  But, when one reads down the paragraphs, the fine print, one sees the better deal is to throw 100 more people onto the dole.  That is what it was all about.  There is nothing about saving those jobs or implementing modern technology.  The Minister will break his neck to get a few more pounds for people so that they can pay more tax, be hassled by social welfare officers and be in receipt of social welfare assistance for the next 18 months, with no future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has now become apparent to anvbody what is happening in Irish industry, that Government policy is that the easiest way out is to blame the problem on the workers and, as somebody mentioned here this evening, on absenteeism.  I understand that 40 per cent of the people who work in this steel works have to travel there by boat.  I understand it is dirty, difficult, heavy work; and a figure of 8 per cent for absenteeism is not a bad one at all.  We should remember that if that steel works was closed down we would then be importing £45 million more goods in the morning.  There is logic <Col N="453" />&mdash; commercial, financial and social &mdash;in ensuring its continuance and preserving its social value for Cork.</P>
    <P>Every argument dictates that Irish Steel Holdings Limited is one industry that should not be allowed go to the wall. When people from this side of the House visited Cork not so long ago, when our party leader led a deputation there, we were led to believe there were no major problems, that this modern industry was doing well in difficult times, that they were hard pressed but that money invested last year was being expended in the right direction.  I know there was £89 million invested.  Before the Taoiseach came into the House I was making the point that surely it is better to expend money keeping people in employment than putting them on the dole.  Certainly that would be the viewpoint of Cork Deputies who came into this House time and time again to warn of the situation at Verolme, Irish Steel, Dunlops, Fords and others in an endeavour to save jobs and to have money invested for that purpose. Perhaps in the end it was commercially possible in other cases.  But surely it is possible in the case of Irish Steel Holdings Limited, a State company of strategic importance?  We say: Save all of those jobs.  If 100 jobs cannot be maintained in one section of the industry, do what every other western country is doing &mdash; redeploy them in some side industry. <Col N="454" /> That has worked successfully all over Europe.  Do not take the easy option.  Do not close the book and put those people out on the dole like the Government did in relation to the port and docks last week, and do not say &ldquo;if 100 workers do not accept redundancy we will close down the whole lot&rdquo;.  Because of 20 jobs in the Dublin port and docks 200 people are out.  Nobody believes that the manning levels put forward were acceptable.  This is a tactic where by the whole emphasis is to pressurise the unions because they are at their weakest and to say to them that they can take it or leave it or we will close up because there are not enough funds. The same line has been used in every company.  Are the workers being asked to increase productivity or to work longer hours or to do anything reasonable?  They are not.  They are being asked to accept that they lose their jobs so that they can go back to their families having given their lives to the industry, having done all they can to sustain it, having agreed to flexibility, to modern technology, to switching hours, to reduced holidays and to pay freezes to no avail.  They are being asked to agree to redundancy or else the company will close.  That is an unacceptable policy and the sooner it is stopped the better for this country.</P>

This provision includes an amount of £2.5 million for the commissioning of new units. A further £2.5 million is included for services development in the community area, £0.5 million of which has been allocated to the Health Education Bureau. Further provision will be required to meet the cost of implementation of approved pay awards.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> The level of non-capital expenditure in 1985 which can be approved on the basis of the subhead provisions in the Estimate is about £1,195 million in gross terms, or £1,122 million taking account of income which is received directly by the health agencies such as payments for maintenance in private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals.  The gross estimated expenditure of £1,195 million represents an increase of £66 million on the corresponding figure for 1984.  It comprises £740 million in respect of pay, £393 million in respect of non-pay, excluding cash allowances, and £62 million in respect of cash allowances.  About 86 per cent of the gross expenditure will be met from Exchequer funds.</P>

    <P>The percentage of overall expenditure in general hospitals is noteworthy in relation to the possibility of gradually shifting expenditure from a hospital to a community setting, as envisaged in the national plan.  Indeed, if all institutional costs were combined, they would amount to about £838 million of the gross 1985 Estimate and represent up to 70 per cent of total expenditure.  It is thus not unrealistic to envisage the possibility of a shift of some expenditure from institutions to the community.</P>
    <P>I am aware, as most Deputies are, that there are institutional services provided in the country which are neither essential to the system of health care delivery nor indeed to the state of health of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> No major speech in relation to the health services can omit a reference to the considerable growth in expenditure that has occurred on the services, particularly in the last decade.  In 1973-1974 net expenditure amounted to about £143 million, representing about 5.2 per cent of GNP.  In the current year it will be of the order of £1,122 million, representing about 7.2 per cent of GNP.  While this percentage is high, it has in fact declined from a peak of around 7.9 per cent in 1982.</P>
    <P>The factors responsible for the increase in expenditure over the years are pay and price inflation, extension of eligibility for certain services, and improvements and developments of services.  In recent times the range and depth of our services have grown rapidly, embracing many new technological advances as well as considerable expansion in the area of personal social services.  Not unexpectedly these improvements gave rise to significant extra costs.</P>
    <P>Health agencies, including health boards, public voluntary and joint board hospitals and homes for mentally handicapped persons were notified in December 1984 of the approved non-capital allocation levels for 1985.  Prior to that &mdash; on 16 November 1984 &mdash; I met with the chairmen and chief executive officers of health boards and dealt in some detail with the difficulties and opportunities in the health services over the next few years and the necessity to develop plans in accordance with the thrust of the national plan.  I alerted the health boards to the need to produce action plans for 1985 spelling out in detail the measures proposed to contain expenditure in 1985, in particular, within approved allocation levels.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the furore in certain quarters about the levels of allocation approved for 1985 and unnecessary and alarming references to the alleged suffering and even deaths which are likely to arise because of measures needed to achieve budgetary targets. I have accepted that the financial situation is difficult.  It will call for the exercise <Col N="460" /> of skilful and unrelenting management of resources throughout the year.  I am firmly convinced, however, that the funds available are sufficient to enable vital services to be maintained at a satisfactory level and I am also convinced that efficient management of that resource would ensure that the community would be guaranteed the health services essential to its wellbeing.  I regret the extreme and irresponsible comments on the situation which are not helpful. They are related to political exigencies rather than to realities.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that I have obtained a capital allocation of £58 million &mdash; of which £57 million will come from the Exchequer and £1 million from other sources &mdash; for the coming year. This will allow me to keep major programmes of improvement of facilities on stream and to make progress in the planning or building of all projects which I consider essential to preserving the fabric of the health services.</P>
    <P>In the general hospital services area, the major schemes at St. James's, the Mater, Cavan and Mullingar will continue. Tenders have been invited for the development of Castlebar General Hospital.  In the case of Ardkeen Hospital, I have approved urgent improvement works to go ahead in advance of the overall development of the hospital.  Planning of proposed developments at Tallaght, Kilkenny, Wexford, Sligo and Naas will continue.  The Midland Health Board have devised an excellent rationalisation programme for general hospitals in their area, including a regional orthopaedic service at Tullamore, and I will be supplying the necessary capital resources for the implementation of the programme.  In addition, smaller improvement works &mdash; for example, improvement of out-patient and day hospital facilities &mdash; will be undertaken at other hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the psychiatric service it is intended to continue improving standards in the major psychiatric hospitals, to build or plan a number of new day hospitals and day care centres and to commence development of small psychogeriatric units to <Col N="461" /> improve standards at St. Brendan's Hospital, Dublin.  On the mental handicap side, the commissioning of the new centre at Cheeverstown House, Templeogue, commenced last year and when completed this centre will provide 130 residential places and 154 day care places.</P>
    <P>Other developments in the mental handicap services include the allocation of £700,000 towards the end of 1984 for innovative recreational and community-based facilities and for minor improvement schemes.  In the current year I intend to introduce a planned programme of maintenance works in centres for mentally handicapped people.  I am also making special provision to develop a small number of residential facilities for the physically handicapped in line with the recent Green Paper on services for the disabled.  In this connection also developments will occur at St. Laurence's Cheshire Home, Cork, and the Barrett Cheshire Home in Dublin. I have just approved the acceptance of tenders for new residential accommodation at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf in Cabra.  Construction on this project should start almost immediately. Another major development will shortly commence at St. Mary's School for the Deaf, and planning will proceed for developments at St. Mary's School for the Blind.</P>
    <P>Building or planning for essential developments to cater for the needs of the elderly will also continue.  Construction of the new geriatric unit at St. Oliver Plunkett hospital will proceed.  The building of the new 100 bed replacement geriatric unit at the Sacred Heart Home, Carlow, has just started and planning for other major projects at Dungarvan and elsewhere will continue.</P>
    <P>I will also be providing funds to build or plan a number of new health centres and clinics, and to improve existing community care premises.  Tenders have been accepted for Blessington health centre. In the case of the proposed health centre for Athlone planning is at an advanced stage and it is hoped that the scheme will go to tender before the end of the year. In addition, community-based treatment <Col N="462" /> and rehabilitation facilities for drug abusers will be developed and the youth development centre at Dundrum is now virtually complete.</P>
    <P>All these projects represent the commitment of additional investment in the health services in building up a modern infrastructure suited to today's needs.</P>
    <P>As a broad guide to the ways in which resources are applied I would refer Deputies to the 1984 edition of <i>Statistical Information Relevant to the Health Services</i> which I circulated some time ago.  This volume contains a wide variety of useful information in the fields of vital and health statistics.  It gives a very good view of the range of activity in the health service and the framework within which the services function.  It also contains a section on vital statistics and the trends in this area have, of course, a significant bearing on demand for health services. The sections of the population aged under 15 years and over 65 make particularly heavy demands on the health services. The high proportion of our population in these dependent age groups relative to other developed countries is a noteworthy feature of Irish demography. The number of elderly people is of particular relevance since much increased utilisation of health services is a feature of advancing years.  While people aged 65 and over represent about 11 per cent of the population, they occupy on average about 40 per cent of the beds in our acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>Other points of interest in our demographic trends are the increase in life expectancy, the continuing decline in infant mortality and the decline in births in recent years.  The decline both in the number of births and the birth rate is quite marked.  For example, the annual number of births declined by more than 7,000 between 1980 and 1983.  Looking at that figure, and bearing in mind the demand for extra staff, one wonders what the talk is all about.  However, the point is relevant and one which is difficult to get across to people.  The collation and <Col N="463" /> publication of these statistics and identifying the trends they imply are an important element in the planning of future health policies.</P>
    <P>The strategy for health services over the next three years has been set out in the national plan &mdash;<i>Building on Reality.</i> The future objectives of health policy have been shaped by a continuing increase in demand at a time of general financial restriction.  The main elements in the development of policy will be a shift towards prevention of disease and an emphasis on community care, ensuring that scarce resources are directed more specifically at those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>While there will be a modest decline in real terms in the resources available for health services over the period of the plan, the very fact of knowing the parameters within which we must work over the three years facilitates a planned and orderly approach to the allocation of resources.  I am confident that we will not only be able to preserve the essential fabric of our existing services but to re-deploy resources as necessary to develop other essential services in the health area. At the same time we have set ourselves the challenge of delivering in each of the years 1985 to 1987 a more cost-effective service to the public.  At the end of the day this theme of &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; must be the goal at a time of financial scarcity and in this respect I think I would have the agreement of the providers of services as well as the general health economists and other commentators.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the dependent relationship between the commitment of health staffs and achievement of the objectives set for the health services.  The strength, efficiency and effectiveness of the health service is largely dependent on the skills, training, motivation and overall competence of its personnel.  In the public mind the perception of the health services is of doctors and nurses attending to the needs of the sick and the dying.  However, they are, of course, supported by a whole range of staff, services and equipment &mdash; for example, in <Col N="464" /> the areas of catering, housekeeping, maintenance and administration.  One is talking about close on 60,000 persons in the service.</P>
    <P>In the current economic climate the health service is being asked to increase staff productivity by maintaining the overall quality of services while reducing the number of man hours worked, broadly in line with the level of reductions sought in the Civil Service.  This, of course, is not an easy task.  But since restrictions on staffing were first introduced in 1981 &mdash; they were introduced by the Opposition although there is not a peep out of them now when it comes to the implementation of the policy, but that is another fact of life we are facing&mdash; the health service has generally managed, with some exceptions in 1984, to live within its pay allocation.</P>
    <P>Much, however, still remains to be done to ensure that expenditure on staff resources is tightly controlled and that the resources are used in the most effective manner.  The bulk of health employees work in hospitals which are organisations of considerable complexity. The hospital and other institutional settings provide the greatest opportunity for planned changes in personnel productivity because of the large concentration of personnel within individual physical facilities, the interaction between the many different categories of staff in the delivery of a total service and the pace and extent of technological development, particularly in the acute hospital area.</P>
    <P>Very little research or study has been conducted here in identifying areas for decreasing costs and improving the performance of hospital manpower. Between 1978-79 the Department of Health, under the direction of the Minister of the day, inquired from health boards why they were not employing more staff and demanding that they take some more on.  Health boards replied that they did not need them, but they were directed to take them on and ensure that returns were sent to the Department so that the new employees, whether needed or not, could be informed of how <Col N="465" /> wonderful it was that they could be given jobs.  The taxpayer is paying for that ever since.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of this objective of identifying areas for decreasing costs and improving the performance of hospital manpower must become a matter of major priority in the coming year and in the years ahead.  It is a task to which each agency must address itself and in which all the necessary support and assistance from my Department will be made available.</P>
    <P>The way in which health personnel perceive their responsibilities is critical to the control of expenditure and the achievement of value for money.  The employing agency controls the amount of resources made available; the resource user determines, to a large extent, the value obtained for the expenditure.  It is this reality which makes management in the health services particularly difficult; but there are proven means of coping, provided there is the willingness and ability to invest heavily in information systems and in the development of people as managers.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to what is being done in these areas by the Department.  In the health services, we have embarked on a major programme to improve various facets of information. We are doing this during a period in which resources will continue to be scarce and existing resources must be creatively managed in order to maintain the required quality and quantity of those services deemed to be most essential. We must give far greater attention than heretofore to what outcomes the service produces as well as looking at all aspects of cost.  In many respects the challenge to the health services in the next few years is to move smoothly from administration to management of resources.</P>
    <P>The first objective of the programme for the improvement of systems is to provide a better service for patients and clients. It is hoped that good systems will lead to safer, quicker communication between professionals and will also lead to quicker throughput of patients, particularly in large general hospitals.  The <Col N="466" /> provision of additional more rapid information on patients and clients will help to frame more effective policies and procedures on admissions to hospitals and institutions.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to support the development and implementation of accountable devolved management throughout the system.  The ultimate aim is to enable resource users to become budget holders and provide them with accurate timely information not only on what has happened but what is happening. We must provide an early warning system at various levels of management so that corrective action can be taken quickly when budget targets are not being met or agreed outputs are not being achieved.</P>
    <P>The third objective is to improve the quantity and quality of information available for policy formulation and review, for planning and resource allocation. Better information on what is being achieved in the service and at what cost will provide an improved basis of resource allocation at national level.  It will also help to provide more reliable comparisons between different parts of the service and it will provide a scope for increased use of modelling, helping managements to predict the likely outcomes of various policy alternatives.</P>
    <P>Finally, the improvement in information systems, properly adapted, will provide a better basis for research.  The availability of more and better information on both outputs and inputs should aid both services research and epidemiology, both of which are crucial to the maintenance of good standards and the taking of correct policy decisions.  I was amazed at the lack of detailed effective information when I took office.  A lot of the inadequacies were identified and action taken.  I have no doubt that we will have greater aspects of critical information available to us in 1985 and the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for medical cards is normally determined by the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board by reference to agreed income guidelines.  I was pleased to be able to announce the revision <Col N="467" /> of these guidelines with effect from 1 January 1985.  The new guidelines compensate fully for changes in the cost of living during 1984.</P>
    <P>Included in these guidelines is an age allowance for persons aged 66 years and over.  This age allowance was introduced from 1 July 1984 and amounts to £5 per week for a single person aged between 66 and 80 years and £8 per week for a person aged 80 years or over.  The allowance is doubled if the individual is married. The introduction of this allowance marked a significant improvement in the position of people aged 66 and over.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the guidelines a married man aged 66 years or over can have income of up to £100.50 per week &mdash; £106.50 if over 80 years &mdash; and be entitled to a medical card.  This limit will be higher if he has outgoings in excess of £10 per week in respect of his house. At 31 March last, 37.2 per cent of the population were covered by medical cards as compared with 36.75 per cent on 31 December 1984.</P>
    <P>The income ceiling for hospital service cards which entitles the holder to free hospital consultant services was increased to £13,500 with effect from 1 June 1985.  This revised figure applies to income earned in the year ending 5 April 1985.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for collection of current contributions from farmers was transferred from the health boards to the Revenue Commissioners on 6 April 1984. The collection of arrears outstanding on that date remains the responsibility of the health boards.  In the 12 month period ending on 31 December 1984, a total of £2.3 million was collected by the health boards as farmers' health contributions. The boards will continue their efforts to recover these arrears, taking legal proceedings if necessary, in a selected number of cases.  As an incentive to the boards I have arranged, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, that the boards will be given the benefit of arrears of health contributions which they collect from farmers in the course of the year commencing on 1 January 1985.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Because of the limited time available, I will shorten my speech.  In my circulated script I have said how these contributions will be credited to the Exchequer and then I said that the regulations to give effect to the proposal to apply an admission charge of £100 to any person presenting for hospital treatment who is in arrears with health contributions came into operation on 1 June 1984 and I went on to clarify that aspect.  Regarding legislation, my Department have in hands the preparation of a range of legislation designed to improve a variety of aspects of the health and welfare services.</P>
    <P>As regards the Children Bills, one of my primary objectives as Minister for Health is to reform the law in relation to the care and protection of children.  Our present provisions in relation to children are based largely on legislation dating from 1908.  Much of it is now outdated and is not sufficiently in keeping with current concepts in regard to child care. In the next part of my speech I deal with the first of the three Bills now before the House and set out the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>On the question of adoption, my Department are in the process of preparing the scheme of a Bill to amend the Adoption Acts, in the light of the recommendations of the Review Committee on Adoption Services.  I hope to be in a position to circulate this Bill towards the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, for his part, has circulated for discussion the draft text of a Status of Children Bill.  This aims to eliminate as far as possible the differences that now exist between the way in which the law treats children born inside marriage and those born outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The Government are also committed to bringing forward revised measures in regard to juvenile justice.  This will be the subject of a further Bill.  I am confident that these Bills taken together will give us a solid body of enlightened and up-to-date legislation in relation to children.</P>
    <P>Under the new Dentists Act, 1985, I expect the new Dental Council to be set up and hold their inaugural meeting early in November next.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> Members of the House will be familiar with both the purpose and the detail of the Nurses Bill.  This major legislation will update and replace existing legislation to restructure An Bord Altranais, to improve the arrangements for the regulation of the profession and to give statutory effect to the EC directives.  The Bill was passed by the Dáil on 22 May, and hopefully will complete its passage through the Seanad in the early autumn. I am glad the Seanad will be taking the Second Stage of this Bill later this month.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will provide a very good statutory framework for the future development of the profession and the further enhancement of its contribution to the health services.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the work which has been undertaken by the current board and by its chief executive in not only dealing with the problems of today but in doing much of the groundwork necessary to quickly implement the provisions of the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Today I circulated the Health (Amendment) Act, 1985, to amend the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970, to enable health boards to charge for services provided for victims of road traffic accidents.  Charges had been made for these services under Article 6 of the Health Services Regulations, 1971, but the Supreme Court has ruled that the provisions of this sub-article were <i>ultra-vires</i> the powers conferred on the Minister for Health.  I have rectified the position in the Bill circulated today.  The loss in revenue to health boards and hospitals resulting from this decision is estimated at £4 million to £5 million in a year.</P>
    <P>I now come to the registration of hospitals and homes.  For a considerable time it has been my view that there is a glaring omission in our legislation in that there was no control or statutory regulation governing the establishment of most types of hospitals and nursing homes outside of those administered by health boards or corporate bodies.  Such statutory regulation, I believe, is essential and long overdue.  I have drawn up detailed proposals for appropriate legislation in this area.  A considerable <Col N="470" /> amount of work has already been done and I would hope to have my proposals completed in the very near future.</P>
    <P>For some time past it has been evident that there is need to up-date certain provisions in the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, to take account of significant changes which have occurred since the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was originally set up.  These changes include the remarkable growth in membership of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's schemes which now exceeds 366,000 and covers a total of over 1,000,000 persons. Other factors are the considerable expansion of health service facilities over the last two decades and in more recent times proposals by entrepreneurial interests to establish a number of private hospitals in which treatment costs are likely to far exceed treatment costs in the existing range of hospital facilities.  I hope to introduce the necessary amendments to the VHI Act during the course of the current year.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware of the decision of the Supreme Court regarding maternity services at Monaghan Hospital.  I have considered carefully the implications of that decision and have come to the conclusion that an amendment to the Health Act, 1970, is necessary.  Otherwise we would be faced with an absurd situation in which it might be impossible to discontinue any hospital service no longer required.  I have recently submitted proposals to Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding family planning, Members of the House will be aware of the significant improvement in access to family planning services marked by the recent passage of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985, by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Act will be to spare people of mature years and, indeed, in many cases young years the inconvenience and unnecessary expense involved under existing legislation in obtaining a medical prescription for condoms.  It will also extend the outlets from which non-medical contraceptives may be purchased <Col N="471" /> to include doctor's surgeries, health centres, licensed family planning clinics and voluntary hospitals providing maternity services or services for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting of the age limit at 18, all parties in the Oireachtas had already decided last year, with hardly a dissenting voice, that the age of majority should be reduced to 18 years and this change has been duly effected by the Age of Majority Act, 1984.  This Act essentially confers full adult status upon each citizen at 18 years of age with regard to rights, duties and responsibilities in general.  It would have been quite ludicrous to have ignored this recent Age of Majority Act in the context of setting the age limit in the amended family planning legislation.</P>
    <P>I am currently examining the measures which need to be taken to give effect to the objectives of the new legislation, including an up-to-date survey of the present availability of services around the country.  On completion of this examination, I will bring the 1985 Act into effect. I anticipate that I will be in a position to do so shortly.</P>
    <P>I now come to the care programmes. Quite apart from the introduction of new legislation, my Department are continuing their efforts in the development of health policies and in making the services more responsive to real needs.</P>
    <P>Regarding community protection, as indicated in the national plan, a major growth in emphasis can be expected in the future in the whole area of preventive health care.  While we now live longer and enjoy better health than any previous generation, we still suffer from much preventable death and illness by the standards of comparable countries.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement that lives could be saved and active life prolonged by an effective programme of health promotion throughout our community. Health promotion is both the responsibility of the individual and of society at large.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau have had considerable success in getting the <Col N="472" /> message across to people that health is a limited resource which can be husbanded and protected by pursuing a lifestyle which gives health every chance.  They have placed particular emphasis on encouraging young people not to smoke and to drink in moderation.  I made an additional £500,000 available to the bureau to develop their promotional activities in this field and there is evidence of that in our community.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I have a responsibility to encourage a more responsible attitude to smoking in society.  My aim is to encourage an environment in which the pressure to smoke is reduced and in which the entitlement of non-smokers to a smoke-free environment is respected.  To this end, I have the agreement of Government to strengthen existing controls on tobacco advertising and to introduce new legislation to restrict smoking in certain public places and to impose a levy on the advertising budgets of tobacco companies, the proceeds of which will assist the Health Education Bureau to extend their activities in counteracting the harmful effects of smoking.  A range of other initiatives is also being taken in the preventive area.</P>
    <P>Regarding infectious diseases, I will be launching a measles vaccination programme in the autumn as part of my Department's recommended programme of immunisation and vaccination.  Contrary to the popular perception, measles can be a serious illness.  It gives rise to expenditure in the health services which is avoidable if an effective immunisation programme, which can be established at considerably less cost, is in operation. The necessary arrangements to ensure the success of this programme are now well under way, including the arrangements to involve general practitioners for the first time officially in the Department's recommended programme.</P>
    <P>In the area of sexually transmitted diseases, a review of my Department's control measures is now under way.  The 1981 Infectious Diseases Regulations are being revised to make provision for the notification of certain non-specific diseases <Col N="473" /> which are becoming more common in the community.  The Department's circular on sexually transmitted diseases is also being revised and up-dated to ensure that an adequate STD service is being provided in all health board areas.</P>
    <P>Regarding the acquired immune deficiency syndrome, known as AIDS, this is a relatively new illness which was not recognised as a disease entity until 1984. In July 1984 my Department established a detailed monitoring system identical with that used by the World Health Organisation and the EC.  The primary objective of this system is to facilitate the regular dissemination of up-to-date information regarding AIDS and to ensure prompt reporting and surveillance of cases of the syndrome in this country. Six cases of this disease have been seen in Ireland since 1981.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been voiced at the danger that this disease might be spread through blood products.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board have taken steps to minimise any risk to Irish patients in this regard.  All necessary measures are being taken to guarantee the purity of the products supplied by the board.</P>
    <P>Regarding drug abuse significant progress has been made in this area since the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984 was brought into operation.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, a set of five video films was developed by the Department of Education, in co-operation with the Health Education Bureau, for use within the context of &ldquo;Life Skills&rdquo; type programmes in second level schools, youth club settings, or with parent groups.  The HEB also produced, in conjunction with the City of Dublin VEC, a new booklet entitled <i>Understanding Drugs.</i>  This is being made available on a limited basis during the current year. Also a lecture series has been organised to accompany the release of the booklet. In addition, I made funds available to Trinity College to enable them to provide a diploma course in addiction studies.</P>
    <P>In the area of research, the Medico-Social Research Board were asked to carry out a number of surveys on specific <Col N="474" /> aspects of the drug problem among adolescents. These surveys were completed towards the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>The Government Task Force on Drug Abuse recognised that the treatment and rehabilitation facilities currently available for drug abusers were inadequate.  In response to this, my Department expedited the planning of an appropriate unit and a suitable location for this has recently been identified and negotiations are now in progress for its possible acquisition.</P>
    <P>Additional funds were made available to the Coolmine Therapeutic Community to help them meet the increasing demands being made upon their services. The Coolmine Community also submitted proposals for the expansion of their existing induction centre in the inner-city area of Dublin and the establishment of an induction centre in Dún Laoghaire.  I was pleased to be able to make funds available to enable them to proceed with these proposals and, in fact, I recently opened the new centre in Mulgrave Street in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, the task force also recommended that a new national co-ordinating committee should be established to replace the existing inter departmental committee which was set up on an informal basis without specific terms of reference.  I established this new committee earlier this year.  This committee now have the responsibility for monitoring progress made in implementing all of the recommendations of the task force and they will be obliged to submit a report to the Minister for Health annually.</P>
    <P>Two meetings of Health Ministers of the EC were convened during the Irish and Italian Presidencies in 1984 and 1985 to discuss health questions, including that of drug abuse.  A very wide and fruitful exchange of views took place on the drug problem and it was agreed that the EC had an important role to play in this area. The Commission are actively pursuing this at the moment.</P>
    <P>Regarding clinical trials, I have completed consultations on an outline of my proposals for the legislative control of <Col N="475" /> clinical drug trials and I have obtained Government approval to the preparation and introduction of a Bill for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Regarding the licensing of non-proprietary medicines, in October 1984 I introduced the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984.  The purpose of these regulations is to control the marketing of medicines for human use.  The control is effected by means of a common licensing scheme which applies to all human medicines, both proprietary and non-proprietary, namely generic.  The regulations replaced the European Communities (Proprietary Medicinal Products) Regulations, 1975, which related only to proprietary medicines.</P>
    <P>Regarding milk and meat, a number of Deputies have raised this issue on a number of occasions in the House. Health boards are continuing their food sampling programmes at retail outlets and pay particular attention to meat and milk.  The system of severe financial penalties introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, which applies to producers of liquid milk who supply milk contaminated with antibiotics has proved to be a very effective control measure.</P>
    <P>The condition of slaughterhouses supplying meat for the home market has been a continuing cause of concern to both the Minister for Agriculture and myself over the years.  The Government have now decided that the standards of meat inspection and hygiene at these slaughterhouses must be brought up to the standard which already applies at our meat export factories.</P>
    <P>My Department are in close touch with the Department of Energy concerning the discharging of radioactive waste from the nuclear processing plant at Sellafield. Following on the report of the Independent Advisory Group set up in the UK under the chairmanship of Sir Douglas Black on the investigations carried out into the possible increased incidence of cancer in West Cumbria, my Department set up an epidemiological study into the <Col N="476" /> incidence of childhood leukaemia in this country.  This study is well advanced.  It is only when this study is completed that it will be possible to establish whether or not there is an increase in these cases on the eastern seaboard.  This study will also examine the available evidence relating to the hypothesis that there is an excess of Down's Syndrome on the eastern seaboard.</P>
    <P>There is a growing awareness of the environment and a developing awareness of the influence which the environment can have on the health of our people.  I am anxious to foster this awareness of what we call &ldquo;environmental health&rdquo;. Incidentally, the air conditioning system in Leinster House could do with a little &ldquo;environmental health&rdquo; from time to time.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been spoken and written about the environment in recent years.  However, sometimes there can be a tendency in the debate and among the various bodies dealing with environmental issues not to give due attention to the environmental health aspects.  I think it is not always appreciated that a concern for environmental health is intrinsic to, and cannot be separated from, a concern for the environment generally.  It can be readily seen there are implications for environmental health in the activities of a wide range of Government Departments and agencies and I am anxious that there should be a general understanding between them of their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>The inner city of Dublin is in dire condition and any Minister for Health who survives a number of years in the Custom House which is in the centre of the city deserves a medal and the staff who work there deserve certificates.  I hope that in the immediate future the Minister for the Environment and I will endeavour to make some improvements with regard to air pollution in the centre of Dublin.  The situation is extremely bad and there is urgent need for stringent action.</P>
    <P>Regarding the report of the working party on the GMS, I have outlined data well known to Deputies here.  Negotiations between my Department and the <Col N="477" /> IMO arising from the report commenced last December.  These discussions are at an advanced stage and I hope they will result in significant improvement in the operation of the GMS scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost of pharmaceuticals such as drugs and medicines is a major and readily identifiable component of overall costs in the operation of our health services. We are spending £115 million per year in this area.  My Department are examining several aspects of the matter, including the degree to which further economies and savings are achievable.</P>
    <P>The overall position of the public health services in this regard has improved significantly under the terms of the present agreement between the Department of Health and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  The present agreement has effectively controlled the prices of drugs used by the GMS scheme and by the various publicly funded health institutions.  The savings to the taxpayer effected by the terms of this agreement are estimated at about £12 million for 1984.  That is not to say I will not be taking a rigorous look at the agreement which expires at the end of September.  Negotiations have commenced already with a view to drawing up terms for a new agreement to take effect from 1 October next.</P>
    <P>The general review of public dental services which commenced in 1982 is continuing. The parties to the review are the Departments of Health and Social Welfare and the Irish Dental Association. Although the present financial situation will not permit the implementation of any modification to the existing services which would involve additional funding, the review is being continued on the basis that it will provide a blueprint for possible future developments when financial circumstances permit.  A national survey of the dental health of children was undertaken in March-June of 1984.  Approximately 7,500 children were examined.  It was an extremely valuable survey and, at a cost of £120,000 which was financed by the Department of Health, it was money well spent.  I was very pleased at the exceptional competence of that report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> In the context of the commitment to community services in the national plan, the provision of an effective home nursing service, especially in regard to the aged, is a priority.  To be fully effective, a home nursing service needs to be complemented by an expanded home help and meals-on-wheels service.  The plan recognised that the integration of medical and social services holds the potential to ensure a comprehensive and planned response to the needs of vulnerable groups.  I will do everything possible to expand that service.</P>
    <P>The last major review of services for the elderly was the 1968 report.  We are now embarking on a further major review and I hope to have that report published within 18 months.  The Department have been exceptionally busy with their work. The reappointed National Council for the Aged have published valuable research papers on matters affecting the aged and they, with the Department, have done a great deal of work in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> announced that special attention would be given to the needs of travelling people.  My Department have a particular responsibility in this area.  A monitoring committee was established in September last to review progress towards the Government's objectives.  I am pleased to say there has been satisfactory progress in the key areas of health, accommodation, labour and education.  There have been monthly meetings and reviews and action has been taken on the matter.  My Department have issued comprehensive guidelines on a number of essential health services for travellers.  The important additional point I would bring to the attention of Members is that following discussions between the Eastern Health Board and the Department a pilot mobile health clinic for travellers in the Dublin area was scheduled to operate from early July.  It is in operation this week.  If any Deputy wishes to see the clinic he is welcome to make the arrangement.  The clinic will provide developmental services, anteand post-natal care, immunisation and <Col N="479" /> health education for travellers.  It represents potentially one of the most significant advances in the provision of health services for the travelling community.  I expect to visit it next week.  This has been particularly useful.</P>
    <P>Regarding the homeless, I am glad to say that the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee was completed in December, 1984.  The report sets out the guidelines to be followed by statutory agencies with responsibility for the care and accommodation of homeless people.  I hope the local authorities and the health boards will be able to respond quickly and decisively to the problem of the homeless.</P>
    <P>The work of the National Social Services Board has continued apace.  It is doing excellent work and I want to commend that board which was appointed last July for the exceptional work they have been doing for the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>I now come to the psychiatric services programme.  I have received the report of the study group which was established in this area.  I have circulated the report to the various parties concerned and I will be pressing for early implementation of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The study group report envisages a gradual transition from a service provided mainly in the larger psychiatric hospitals to one which is largely community-based and where in-patient treatment is only one component in a network of services. The steps needed to bring about this major change are described in the report and quantitative norms are set out for the provision of the various services.  In particular, these services include day services and workshops, out-patient clinics, hostels and other forms of residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>I will be pressing forward with work in this area.  For example, out-patient clinics are now well established in all of the health board areas.  Day care services are also on the increase, while there are now some 1,000 places in hostels for the mentally ill.  I am confident that there is potential for placing many more patients in this form of community-based accommodation and this will be given special attention <Col N="480" /> in future.  Equally, I made a substantial sum of money available in the last three years to carry out improvements in the living conditions of patients in these hospitals.  I have been around to a number of the hospitals.  The improvements are visible.  They are certainly well overdue and they were badly needed but the work is being done and I would invite Deputies who want to see particular aspects of the work to visit the hospitals concerned.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Services for Disabled People was published in April of last year.  One of the aims of the Green Paper was to stimulate a debate among disabled people and the various groups specifically interested in this area.  I have now received a number of detailed submissions on the paper.  I shall be arranging for officers of my Department to meet with the organisations and I intend to hold a conference in the near future to discuss certain key areas in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>Regarding the physically disabled, as assured in the Green Paper, I am making provision in the capital programme for the introduction of a number of improvements in the residential care area for the physically disabled.  I recently announced that I was making funds totalling almost £10 million available for the developments in St. Mary's Home for the Blind, Merrion.  These improvements will include new accommodation for the adult blind to replace the existing out-dated facilities, as well as a new children's residence. Planning of both of these projects are proceeding and I expect building of the children's unit to commence this year.</P>
    <P>I was also pleased to make capítal funds available for the Barrett Cheshire Home, Dublin and the St. Laurence's Cheshire Home, Cork.  I am providing a grant of £200,000 this year to the Barrett Cheshire Home for an eleven-room ground floor extension.  I am also making £500,000 available to the St. Laurence's Cheshire Home over a two-year period for the provision of 28 single-bed units to replace existing unsatisfactory accommodation.  I have made £80,000 available for the running costs of a new short term hostel for <Col N="481" /> ten to 12 people which is planned for the Cork area.  I was down there recently. The hostel will be run by three voluntary organisations for the physically handicapped operating under the group name &ldquo;ABODE&rdquo;&mdash; Association for the Benefit of the Disabled in the Environment.</P>
    <P>Finally in this area I recently announced that I had accepted tenders for the provision of residential accommodation and ancillary facilities for 96 boys at St. Joseph's School for the Deaf, Cabra.  The Minister for Education has approved tenders for educational accommodation at the school.  Both elements of the project will go ahead in tandem.  The total cost of the development will be about £5.2 million of which my Department will be providing about £3.7 million.</P>
    <P>Regarding the mentally handicapped services &mdash; and here I hope that those who were so busy circulating the parents of the mentally handicapped before the local elections will bear with me when I make the point that I am conscious that much remains to be done before our total needs in the mentally handicapped area are met &mdash; I strongly hold the view that in the past two years if I have done anything in the Department of Health I have made very substantial additional resources available in this area.  I made additional funds available to supplement resources at the end of 1984 in order to assist them to meet the cost of those projects.</P>
    <P>The findings of the census of the mentally handicapped, which was recently published, give rise to questions on the planning norms contained in the 1980 Working Party Report on Services for Mentally Handicapped People.  These may need to be reviewed.  I have asked senior officials of my Department to report to me on the planning implications raised by the census findings.  I can assure Deputies that that area has been a particular priority.  In the past year I visited a number of centres and the outstanding work being done in those centres continues to impress all of us enormously.</P>
    <P>I now come to the general hospitals programme.  In the area of general hospital services the process of rationalisation <Col N="482" /> and development initiated some ten years ago continues to progress.  It is ironic that when a Labour Party Minister for Health holds office progress tends to accelerate and they get very little thanks for doing it but the work must be done in the national interest and certainly the work I have managed to do in the last two and half years in this area will I think be accepted in the years ahead as quite exceptional.</P>
    <P>In regard to the rationalisation of services, perhaps the most radical changes will take place in the greater Dublin area. The future hospital system in Dublin will be centred on six sites namely, Beaumont, the Mater, St. James's, St.  Vincent's, Blanchardstown and Tallaght. These projects are all at various stages of planning and construction.  I have been disappointed with some of the attitudes I have encountered particularly in the transfer of Jervis Street and St. Laurences Hospitals to the new Beaumont Hospital. Because of the impasse which has been reached in negotiations with the consultant medical staff of the two hospitals, I have now informed the boards of the two hospitals, Beaumont Hospital Board and the Royal College of Surgeons, that I no longer consider it feasible to transfer the services of Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospitals jointly to the new hospital in Beaumont.  I have decided consequently that, on a date to be agreed, St. Laurence's Hospital will cease to be funded as a general hospital and all of its services will from then be provided in Beaumont Hospital.  I have also decided that the services in Jervis Street Hospital will remain in their present location to the extent and in the form to be agreed with the management of that hospital and will be funded to that extent.</P>
    <P>Faced with the responsibility of ensuring that the massive financial resource of £37 million capital cost and approximately £2.5 million so far of equipment which has been put into the construction and fitting out of Beaumont Hospital is utilised without further delay and without further obstruction, I was reluctantly obliged to take these decisions in the light of the protracted but unsuccessful <Col N="483" /> negotiations which have taken place over the past number of months with the consultants concerned.</P>
    <P>A substantial number of the consultant medical staff were in favour of changing over but it is the old story of vested interests ruling the roost.  I regret that the staff have refused to co-operate with the very reasonable arrangements which have been made to ensure the opening of this hospital.  I assure my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, that I will not be resigning over this issue.  I will be accounting to the electorate on the last Thursday in October 1987 or perhaps the second Thursday as it would be better if it was not too late into the winter, when presumably there will be a general election.  The hospital will be open by then.</P>
    <P>I have offered the consultants 70 beds in the hospital which has been built and additional beds for acute specialities where these might be required, for example, intensive care, dialysis and so on. There will be a sufficient number of private beds to cover their private practice. As I have already stated there are 750 beds in the hospital.</P>
    <P>The money from the beds will go into the hospital budget and no VHI money will go into the coffers of any private company.  That is the critical division.  It is a public hospital with private beds in it.  One must cater for those who are over the income limit and entitled to avail of public or private bed facilities and private consultation.  Many more people avail of that than is necessary but that is the position. I have offered to make that space available within the hospital but I assure Deputies that under no circumstances will I agree to give public land on a leased basis to any private company of medical consultants to establish within the campus of the hospital yet another framework of a hospital.  I want to see an integrated service, public and private, within the one building.</P>
    <P>Where they may want to have private consultations on an outpatient basis, such facilities will be made available within the hospital.  I have offered that the totality of <Col N="484" /> the two budgets of the hospitals and all that this entails and all the staff from the two hospitals will go to Beaumont and work there in a very large hospital which will replace the appallingly bad physical conditions in the Richmond and Jervis Street hospitals, conditions which are bad for the staff and particularly bad for the patients and the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know that for some reason or other my predecessor caved in when people wanted to lease a slice of land belonging to the taxpayer in order to build another private hospital.  I have no objection to people building private hospitals but not on public land and not in the framework of a public hospital.</P>

      <P>Given the scarce resources in the community the money from the 70 beds will go into the ordinary hospital budget of Beaumont.  There will be one budget on the site.  Presumably the consultants will be paid a private fee for treating patients on a private basis. They would be using public facilities but, as is currently the system, an arrangement would have to be made in that regard.</P>
      <P>We have an excellent major new teaching hospital.  The design is not as good as I would have wished but then I was not involved in that.  My predecessor, Deputy Haughey, was so busy, having it built quickly that he forgot about having an up-to-date design.  However, the hospital has now been built and it is of a high standard.  The contractor was excellent.</P>

      <P>I assure my colleagues that I will enter into urgent consultations with the board of the Richmond Hospital and with the trade unions there with a view to effecting the transfer as a matter of urgency.  I do not suffer from any anti-consultant attitudes or any obscurantist ideological viewpoints.  My intention is to provide an acute hospital service without complications to the people in the catchment area which number approximately 200,000.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> In the Southern Health Board area the opening of the Cork Regional Hospital in 1978 and of the new Tralee General Hospital in 1984, provided a very firm foundation for a modern general hospital service.  My intention is to build on that foundation.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I announced a very significant development in the area in the establishment of cardiac surgery in the Regional Hospital, Cork.  The detailed arrangements are now being worked out between officers of my Department and the Southern Health Board and the service is expected to be in operation later this year.  The generous contribution of £250,000 by the Ford Motor Company will be of considerable help in getting the new service off the ground.  In that regard I wish to thank Mr. Patrick Hayes of the company.  On behalf of taxpayers generally and more particularly those who will benefit directly from the new service I want to put on record my thanks and the thanks of the Department of Health to this company for their gesture.</P>
    <P>It has been quite clear for some time that there was an urgent need for rationalisation of the services being provided by the Cork voluntary hospitals.  While the long term plan for the voluntary hospitals was that they should be replaced by a new general hospital, it is obvious that because of the level of resources required this is not feasible for the foreseeable future.  I know my predecessor had an obscure plan for another major general hospital in Cork city.  That is not on as there are plenty of hospitals in Cork.  The problem is to integrate the services there and the rationalisation of existing services is now being planned in consultation with the hospital authorities. Already, the South Infirmary and the Victoria Hospital have agreed to amalgamate their services and operate as a single hospital complex.  I wish to thank the boards of those two hospitals and the consultant staff of both hospitals coming as they do from a different ethos in many respects for their outstanding co-operation.</P>
    <Col N="487" />
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the odd reasonable consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Where Cork leads, Dublin will follow and Ardkeen will follow also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my doubts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been agreed also that a central pathology laboratory should be based at Mercy Hospital to serve the requirements of all the voluntary hospitals.  Discussions are taking place about the future organisation of ENT services in the area and it is hoped to finalise those without delay.  My Department have commenced discussions also with the Mercy Hospital and the North Infirmary to consider how an association between the two hospitals in the provision of services could be achieved. I hope to have the co-operation of public representatives and of the consultant staffs of these two hospitals in these basic co-operative discussions on association and that people will restrain themselves from instilling fear into the populaton regarding the North Infirmary and that we can proceed towards the delivery of the services in the Cork area. At the same time discussions have taken place with the Cork Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and I have decided that the ophthalmic service will be transferred from that hospital to the Cork Regional Hospital and the ENT services to the other voluntary hospitals.  While the Cork Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital has for so many years provided a significant service to the people of Cork and its catchment area, I believe everyone accepts that the rationalisation of the services it provides is a logical development which can only advance further the level of treatment available to the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Southern Health Board area, regardless of what other problems there may be, I have received outstanding co-operation in the Cork area from all of these hospitals.  This is a measure of what can be done.  Where rationalisation is taking place it is being implemented quite rapidly and there has been <Col N="488" /> no great furore.  This is an indication of what can be done on a cost effective basis. Equally, I commend the Midland Health Board who have an outstanding record in their efforts to rationalise and simultaneously to improve services and now there is the decision to concentrate the maternity services for Laois-Offaly in Portlaoise where a paediatric service will also be established.  That question broke the heart of Brendan Corish and of all his successors since.  The decision has not been reached without some pain and some controversy but it is now being implemented.  Portlaoise will have the maternity services while Tullamore will have the regional orthopaedic service and later services in ENT and opthalmology as resources become available.  I am pleased that the recruitment process for the two consultant orthopaedic surgeons is well in hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the funding for the paediatrician?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a source of acute embarrassment that the midlands is the only major area of the country not to have paediatric cover but I have spared no resource in having a paediatric service provided for the area as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Has funding been agreed for a paediatric service for Portlaoise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a paediatrician <i>in situ</i> so the Deputy need not be concerned on that account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister has not agreed to the funding in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Local long stay units <Col N="489" /> for geriatric patients in Edenderry, Tullamore and Birr have been established. The plan envisages also an enhancement of the role of Athlone District Hospital in the establishment of an industrial medical and nursing unit in association with local industrialists.  Envisaged also is a 24 hour accident and emergency service to be provided by a rota of local general practitioners.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the plan offers the most realistic prospect of a comprehensive high quality hospital service for the midland area.  I should like to pay tribute to the board of management and to the CEO for their ingenuity and realism in formulating the plan and to the members of the Midland Health Board and to their Chairman, Tom Keenan, who has done outstanding work in that capacity.  While some may be unhappy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When he is unhappy, I am unhappy, too.  I am confident that as the implementation of the plan proceeds, the vast majority of people in the midland area will appreciate the wisdom of the approach adopted.</P>
      <P>I had hoped in so far as possible to cover the work of the Department which in the past 12 months has been very intensive but I must have regard to the time element.</P>
      <P>I have been giving particular attention to the service requirements for the elderly and I have allocated substantial resources for the replacement of totally inadequate facilities and the development of new facilities as required.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board area, a medium term programme for the development of institutional geriatric facilities has been prepared jointly by my Department and the Eastern Health Board.  In the next number of years, I will be making capital funds available to enable this programme to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already a major scheme of development has begun in the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook.  Up-grading schemes are <Col N="490" /> also being implemented at Brú Caoimhín and Leopardstown Park Hospital.  A unit for the young chronic sick is also being provided at Saint Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere a new geriatric hospital is under construction in Dundalk and a similar project is about to commence in Carlow.</P>
    <P>A great deal needs to be done to bring our geriatric services up to a reasonable standard.  I intend to pursue the agreed programme of development as quickly as possible.  At the same time, it is clear to me that the existing regulations governing the minimum standards in nursing homes are inadequate and should be revised.  I have examined this in detail and will be finalising my proposals for revision of the regulations very shortly.</P>
    <P>While all of this represents a considerable achievement in terms of health service provision for a country of our size and state of development it would be short-sighted to think that there is no more to be done or no improvements to be made in the way we currently operate our services.  I am daily reminded of the many unmet demands for social services generally in our society and would freely acknowledge the need for improvement in many areas.  I am equally conscious, however, of the tight constraints on resources for the foreseeable future and this imposes an obligation on us all to do things in such a way that the available resources are used to the best effect.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that a great deal of energy is already devoted to this in the health services.  One example is the valuable work undertaken by the National Health Council.</P>
    <P>In March 1984 I appointed members of the National Health Council.  This is a statutory advisory body who were first established in 1948 but the membership of which was allowed to lapse in 1978.  I have appointed 36 members of the council for a two-year term ending in March 1986.  They are representative of the main interests involved in the provision of the health service and also of the consumer.</P>
    <P>It is useful to have a body such as this who, because of their composition, should <Col N="491" /> be able to give advice to me from a broadly-based perspective.  Already the council have given their views on a number of draft regulations which I referred to them.  They have also made an important and constructive submission to me in advance of the preparation of the national plan.  They are now doing additional work in other areas.</P>
    <P>Though health research tends to attract little public interest it is potentially of great importance.  Changing economic and social conditions have brought with them a change in the spectrum of illness. Research must, therefore address itself to the demands and hazards of our changing environment and life-styles, particularly those that may be peculiar to this country. I am anxious, therefore, that the publicly funded research structure should be such that it can best meet the requirements of these changing conditions.</P>
    <P>State-supported research of a medical or medico-social nature is at present carried out by two separate bodies, namely, the Medical Research Council of Ireland and the Medico-Social Research Board.</P>
    <P>With a view to a more efficient management of research resources I have proposed that all research conducted by these two bodies be brought under the management of a single statutory authority. I am determined to bring about this change without further delay and have, on Monday last, appointed an Assistant Secretary of the Department to the Chairmanship of the Medico Social Research Board to complete the process by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me refer to a topic to which I have repeatedly made reference, especially in the past 12 months or so and indeed in the House on many occasions and at meetings and seminars throughout the country, namely, the structures by which our health delivery care system is run.  I have reviewed the administration of the service comprehensively.  I am convinced that it is far too fragmented and, indeed, complicated for a country of 3.5 million population.  I am convinced that the separation of major hospitals and indeed mental handicap services from the <Col N="492" /> health board system is an inherent weakness, particularly in resource distribution. I am convinced that the local health committees as at present structured do not reflect the immediate health needs of the local areas they purport to represent and that, in short, the structure needs to be drastically overhauled and streamlined. I am therefore at this time preparing a submission to Government arising from all of the above on my clearcut conclusions with suggestions as to how the situation can be remedied and more efficient results can be obtained from the considerable sums of Exchequer moneys being made available to the health services.</P>

      <P>While the Minister has gone through 52 pages of a script I would be prepared to give him another five or ten minutes to explain what he means by the last paragraph he read out.  It appears to me that it can mean a lot of things.  It appears that what he intends is that the <Col N="493" /> health boards would take over all the services, the voluntary hospitals, the lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the script I should say it is very far removed from the reality of the health services as they obtain at present.  While I know the Minister would not have attended health board meetings, although he would have met representatives of the health boards when he met the CEOs and the chairman of health boards, I do not belive that reports of health boards were even read. The Minister's script does not deal at all with what has been the major feature of the health services over the last 12 months, which is the effect of the cutbacks since the last Estimate for this Department was moved.</P>
      <P>The Estimate about which we are speaking this evening is for a sum not exceeding £1,070,828,000 which in effect constitutes a 5½ per cent reduction in the moneys allocated to the health services since the present Government came into office.  That has had very serious consequences.</P>
      <P>I might quote two short passages from the early part of the Minister's remarks. He said:</P>
      <P>I am firmly convinced, however, that the funds available are sufficient to enable vital services to be maintained at a satisfactory level and I am also convinced that efficient management of that resource would ensure that the community would be guaranteed the health services essential to its well being.  Extreme and irresponsible comments on the situation are not helpful.</P>
      <P>The Minister later had this to say:</P>
      <P>I am confident that we will not only be able to preserve the essential fabric of our existing services but to re-deploy resources as necessary to develop other essential services in the health area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is totally removed from the reality of the situation because any member of <Col N="494" /> the executive of any health board in the country will tell the Minister, or any Member of this House, that they cannot provide the services they are statutorily obliged to do.  Certainly, there is no way in which any health board can re-deploy resources for the provision of new services. Everybody in this House, apart from the Minister &mdash; and presumably the Government &mdash; would accept that that is the reality.  All of the health boards had a deficit last year which they have had to carry into this year and they will encounter further difficulties with their financial allocations in 1985.  Therefore, far from health boards being able to re-deploy resources from one service to another and provide for new services in their areas, they will find themselves in a very serious state of crisis before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In answer to a question I put down to the Minister in the House on 19 February 1985 about the cutbacks he made much the same comments as he did this evening. When I asked him if he was aware of the concern in health boards that services would be reduced to an intolerable level in the current year and if he would make a statement on the matter he replied as follows:</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties involved for health boards in containing their non-capital expenditure in 1985 within approved budgetary levels. Unfortunately, in some instances, exaggerated statements have been made concerning the implications of the budgetary situation for patient care.  I am pleased to say that a number of health boards have developed a strategy for 1985 which has, as one of its main objectives, the containment of expenditure within approved allocation levels while at the same time preserving the essential fabric of the services.  I am satisfied that it should be possible for all health boards to chart a similar course.</P>
    <P>What I should like to know is which of the health boards succeeded in developing a strategy for 1985 which will contain <Col N="495" /> expenditure.  I am unaware of any and from my reading of the reports of all eight health boards, I am quite satisfied that that is not a realistic answer to the question. The Minister did say here this evening that exaggerated statements were being made and for political reasons.  Perhaps the Minister would tell that to a woman in my constituency who had a lump on her breast and had an appointment with a surgeon.  In the same week her child had an appointment with the paediatrician.  She was unable to provide transport on both occasions so she hired a taxi to take her child to the paediatrician, neglecting to have the lump on her own breast attended to.  Or the Minister should ask the consultant who told me about a patient who came to his outpatients department with a very serious illness.  When the consultant went to the matron to ascertain if he could have the patient admitted to the hospital the matron told him he could not have the patient admitted &mdash; although there were 40 empty beds there.  The Minister should tell him, the people on this side of the House, and people outside who are complaining about the serious situation that they are doing it for political reasons.  Or he should tell it to the consultant who found it necessary &mdash; a consultant who, as far as I know, does not acknowledge any political affiliation &mdash; to write to <i>The Irish Times</i> complaining about the fact that 12 patients waited in a casualty department for admission to hospital; or tell it to a patient with a coronary, of whom I am aware, who waited 15 hours in a casualty Department for admission to hospital.  Tell those people that it is playing politics to come into the House and say that a serious situation exists.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that less than 2 per cent of the Estimate is devoted to prevention. That is an area where we would all agree there should be some development. We welcome the plan to have a major measles vaccine programme in the autumn and also the increased allocation to the Health Education Bureau.  I would ask the Minister to look further at what else the Health Education Bureau can <Col N="496" /> do in promoting good health and good lifestyles.  In the Estimate last year the Minister told us that he would circulate amending legislation to the Tobacco Bill, before the summer recess of 1984 and this year he has told us that he will be introducing legislation but not when.  Is there any reason why it has been delayed? In the Children Bill, the Minister missed a great opportunity to update the legislation in relation to underage drinking.  The 1908 Children Act had a provision to cover under-age drinking.  It is a pity the Minister did not take the opportunity to update that legislation in relation to what has become a very serious problem in certain areas.  It is unfortunate that we did not have one comprehensive Bill in this area rather than the three measures promised by the Minister.  While we know the Minister introduced the first phase of that legislation dealing with fostering, glue sniffing and other aspects of child care and that he will introduce legislation on adoption, all we are told about the Juvenile Justice Bill, which is a very important aspect of child care legislation, is that the Government intend to introduce legislation.  My concern is that this important legislation will be introduced for instance by the Minister for Justice. That would prove the point that we have been making that we should have one major comprehensive Bill dealing with child care.</P>
    <P>The GMS Working Party report has been published and we welcome it and the fact that negotiations are proceeding. There is a serious crisis developing in the general medical service.  On 5 June, 1 asked the Minister the estimated over-expenditure of the GMS in each health board area in the current year and if it was intended to correct the deficit and if he would make a statement on the matter.  The Minister said that the provision in respect of the expenses of the GMS payments board was £93 million in the current year.  My question as to the estimated deficit for each health board area was not answered.  I wonder why my question was not answered in view of the fact that on 29 May the GMS payments board had circularised each of the health <Col N="497" /> boards with the information I requested and could not get.  The total estimated shortfall in the GMS this year is £8,429,000.  The letter gives a breakdown for each health board area.  I will not go right down the list because of the time constraint but in the correspondence circularised at the health board meeting was a letter to the secretary of the Department from Mr. Long the administrator of the payments board, dated 16 April 1985.  I will quote two paragraphs from it:</P>
    <P>The amount allocated by the health boards to the Payments Board is £93 million.  The Board has been informed by health boards that payments to the Board will not exceed the amount allocated to them by the Department for this purpose.  Expenditure in the first two payment months of 1985 represents 20.7 per cent of total allocation. Expenditure in the same two months of 1984 represented 18.7 per cent of the outturn for that year.  On the basis of this trend it is estimated that the Board's allocation will be exhausted not later than November 1985 and the Board will not be in funds to make payment for services given in October and payable in December 1985 unless appropriate steps are taken in the meantime to avoid this situation.</P>
    <P>The question also arises as to whether the Board should only pay each month to the amount which would ensure appropriate distribution of its allocation over the 12 months.  If instead the Board is to pay claims in full until the allocation is exhausted, then should doctors and pharmacists not be informed in good time that the Board may not be in a position to meet claims at the end of the year.  These would appear to be the alternatives that the Board must put to the health boards, for whom its role is to act as agent in paying doctors and pharmacists for the services given under their contracts with the health boards.</P>
    <P>There are very serious implications in that letter and it is no exaggeration to say <Col N="498" /> that a very serious crisis is imminent in the delivery of the general medical service to medical card holders.  The reason for that is a decision of the Government that in future the funding of the GMS should be by the health boards rather than the payments board.  Formerly, the payments board funded that service.  It is hard to predict what that service will cost from year to year because if an epidemic of flu for instance broke out, obviously it would raise the visiting rate and the prescribing rate and it would cost more money.  This year the health boards are for the first time made responsible for the funding of that service and they are caught as the middle men between the Department and the payments board. They are given £93 million which they hand over to the payments board.  They do not have the resources although they were told in a previous letter that they would have to provide their own resources if the allocation which they received for the GMS was insufficient to cater for the needs.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the eight health boards have a projected deficit for this year of over £8 million which will have to be found.  As the House can see from the letter, what the administrator is suggesting is that in November this year no further payment should be made, in other words there will not be a general medical service for medical card holders, 1.3 million of them, for the last six weeks of this year.  That would be a very serious and unfortunate situation.  A fundamental element of health philosophy must be to ensure that no person shall be denied medical care because of his inability to provide it from his own resources.  While I appreciate the difficulty of people in paying high levels of taxation, I am satisfied that the people are prepared to pay for that very service that will ensure that nobody in this country will suffer because of inability to pay for a health service.</P>
    <P>The Government are falling down very badly in regard to providing that level of service at a time of recession and increasing unemployment.  The number of medical cards is being reduced in a number of health board areas, the Midland, the <Col N="499" /> Mid-Western, the North-Western and the Western.  The number of persons covered by health cards between the end of December 1982 and the end of March 1985 has seen a considerable reduction. That should not be so at a time of recession when more and more people are becoming unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that negotiations were proceeding with the representative bodies of the general practitioners in the scheme, and I hope that these will have a successful outcome.  The visiting rate has increased and again this is to be expected, first of all at a time of recession and unemployment but, more importantly, because of the cutbacks affecting the hospital services.  People are being discharged earlier because accommodation is not there for them.  People have to wait longer to go into hospital, and this inevitably will lead to an increase in the visiting rate by the family doctor outside, and nothing can be done about that.</P>
    <P>On the question of generic prescribing, all things being equal, where a generic product is equal in quality a doctor should prescribe it, and doctors must be conscious of the economics of providing medical care.  However, one difficulty is that if a doctor writes the generic name of a product he does not know what brand of product is being prescribed.  The Minister needs to look at that because going back to 20 years ago when generic products were being brought in by county councils who were administering the health service then and by the health authorities, some of the products did not measure up in terms of quality and bio-availability, and many doctors had no confidence in the generic product.  Therefore, if we are to have more generic prescribing we must in some way be assured that if we write the basic name of a product the quality measures up to standard.</P>
    <P>The working party report on the GMS contains some suggestions about the inducements to cut the cost of prescribing. I am a little concerned about inducements. I hope that any professional group would do the correct thing medically first and then have the economics of the situation <Col N="500" /> in mind.  It should not be necessary to give inducements and there is always the danger that one or two by taking the inducements would perhaps reduce the level of service to below what it should be.</P>
    <P>I welcome since our last debate on the Estimate here the establishment of an Irish college of general practitioners.  An academic body such as is the college will certainly improve the quality and standard of medical practice.</P>
    <P>We have talked about the funding and the difficulties in which the health boards find themselves.  It is interesting that a recent report stated that over the last four years there has been no percentage increase in the money allocated to the GMS.  The Minister is responsible for withdrawing medical cards from old age pensioners and from students.  While he stated over the first two years while he was in office that that decision was made in October 1982 before he came to office, he admitted to the House recently that he was the Minister who implemented the decision in February 1983 to withdraw the medical cards from pensioners. These are people in the older age group who are at high risk, and a case is to be made for a more liberal interpretation of the guidelines.  In relation to the guidelines and assessment for eligibility many people face serious difficulties at present particularly in view of the serious crisis situation in the GMS.  All the health boards are now much more stringent than they were in allocating medical cards and it is persons who are just above the guidelines, many of them with chronic illnesses, who would normally get a medical card, who are suffering.  They are a new poor.  These people pay statutory PRSI and income tax which is not taken into account when they apply for a medical card.  A person on social assistance who has a net income will have that net income taken into account, but a person who is working will not have his net income taken into account even though it may be lower than that of the person on social assistance, and these people have to pay for all their acute medical care.  Some of them also must pay all the <Col N="501" /> various levies, 3 per cent of their income, which they would not have to pay if they had a medical card.  They have to pay for a school bus in parts of rural Ireland £3 a week; they have to pay £7 towards their drugs refund if anyone in the household has a chronic illness.  This is serious, and I ask the Minister to look at it because there are people who cannot provide from their own resources for medical care for themselves and these people are not receiving medical cards in the way they would have received them, say, a year or two years ago.</P>
    <P>The Government came into office on the basis that they would review the 900 items which were the subject of a Private Members' Motion here on which the then Government fell.  The 900 items were removed from the GMS list of prescriptions. When the Minister came to office, in fairness to him, he reviewed the list of drugs but, rather than restoring the 900 items to the list, he removed 70 items because they were no longer on the market and 63 items because they were for hospital use only, and 100 items were deleted mainly because they were similar to the items already excluded.  Therefore, he increased the number of items that were removed from the list.  He restored 96 items to the list but a net increase of 223 items were deleted from the list after the Minister's review when the Government came into office.  The Minister's removal of such items as white stomach mixtures and the few remaining cough bottles that were on that list was a retrograde step because many people cannot afford to pay for some of these simple remedies and people with a hiatus hernia or gastritis might need a white stomach mixture.  That should be available because there is a tendency to prescribe a more expensive and more potent drug to ensure that people will have something to give them relief.  The same applies with simple analgesics for the relief of pain. The most commonly prescribed drug is &ldquo;Ponstan&rdquo; which is more potent and expensive than many of the more simple remedies that were available on prescription before the Minister finally removed them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> Regarding the drugs refund scheme, there is much hardship for people, especially those who are just above the guidelines for a medical card.  The sum of £28 is a lot of money for these people.  The Minister should look again at the scheme.</P>
    <P>The long term illness scheme needs to be updated because many incapacitating illnesses are not included &mdash; for example, bronchial asthma.  There is a society now for people who suffer from lupus and they feel they should be included in the scheme.  I would ask the Minister to consider this and to examine the whole scheme to see if some way can be found to provide for people who are seriously incapacitated.</P>
    <P>Last year we passed amending legislation dealing with the misuse of drugs. We supported the Government in that legislation.  We were disappointed that in the task force there was not a representative of the Department of Finance and also that more powers were not given to customs officials at the point of entry. All the heroin misused in this country is imported.  If we could prevent that importation there would be no heroin addiction here.  It is difficult to prevent importation but we should aim at it by giving customs officials more power at the point of entry.  We should also have a representative of the Department of Finance on the task force dealing with the misuse of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say what was happening about the inner city drug treatment centre and what the position will be in relation to Jervis Street, St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Regarding the home nursing service, the percentage change in allocation at constant prices is minus 8 per cent for the four years 1980-84.  Certainly this is not in keeping with the philosophy of the Government, which we would support, of transferring resources and building up community care services.  There has been no significant increase in the home help service.  The number of man hours worked in my health board area has reduced over the last two years.  With hospital closures and ward closures there should be a significant increase in the <Col N="503" /> number of home helps.  In some health board areas a home help can be provided for a patient only by removing the service from someone else.  In the Western Health Board area there are 300 beds out of use because of closures.  That is the area of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Donnellan.</P>

      <P>The dental services have, perhaps, suffered more than most areas of the community care service since this Government came to office.  Over 80,000 people &mdash; 40,000 children and 40,000 adults &mdash; are waiting for dental service.  While the children may get service in 18 months, some of the adults will never get a service because the health board public dental service has been abolished for adults in certain areas.  Yet the Minister can tell us tonight that not only is he satisfied and quite confident that there is enough money to provide the necessary services but that the health boards will be in a position to redeploy money to create new services.  At the same time the statutory service which the health boards are obliged to provide, namely a dental service, is not being delivered. I have suggested in my area that the health board should announce publicly that they are not in a position to deliver the health service and should advise people, certainly the parents of young children, to sell something in the house and get a child's tooth filled rather than put that child on a waiting list and wait until the tooth is so carious that it has to be extracted.  A widow came to me at my political clinic who had two children, one of whom, a 15-year-old <Col N="504" /> daughter, had carious teeth but could not avail of a dental service because no such service was available due to the rundown over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The position regarding orthodontists is the same.  There were advertisements for five orthodontists for five health boards. I recognise that there were not applicants for them all but nevertheless I do not understand why there were not advertisements for the eight health boards.  Perhaps that would have been more successful.</P>
      <P>The sight-testing scheme is in much the same state as the dental scheme.  An elderly person living alone who uses spectacles to watch television or read a book is in a very serious situation if he or she breaks the spectacles and cannot have them repaired because there is no service. This is the position.  Yet we are told there is money to maintain the essential fabric of the services.</P>
      <P>There are long delays in the hearing services.  In conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister might consider introducing legislation to deal with the high level of noise.  I have no doubt that there is a diminution in the level of hearing of many people as a result of noise.  I wonder if the noise level in such places as disco halls has ever been assessed and if any thought has been given to legislating to control that noise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest a maximum number of decibels above which it would be illegal to make sound.  I am satisfied that hearing is being damaged by high levels of noise.  It is possibly one of these areas where there is a difficulty because it is not directly a responsibility of the Department of Health and more the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.  Nevertheless it would be unfortunate if something were not done simply because two Departments were involved.  It is a question which should be tackled fairly soon.</P>

      <P>The community welfare services account for approximately 8 per cent of the Health Estimate.  It is important when talking about the cost of health services and the proportion of GNP spent in this area to recognise that this figure is not included in other EC countries, so we would have to reduce that figure from the GNP to find a comparable figure with other EC countries.  I would ask the Minister to see if the mobility and domiciliary allowances could be applied a little more liberally, particularly in families where there are hardships.</P>
      <P>The free fuel scheme is not the responsibility of the Minister for Health. Nevertheless the health board operate the scheme on behalf of the Minister for Social Welfare and he should look at the system of appeal, because the Ombudsman will be very busy unless a proper system of appeals is introduced into the health board system.  It appears that the superintendent community welfare officer who makes the decision on the first occasion is also the appeals officer and it is important, now that the Ombudsman has assumed responsibility for certain functions of the health boards, that the health boards should have a proper appeals procedure.</P>
      <P>Voluntary bodies have suffered over the last few years because they have not got increases to keep them abreast of inflation.  This is a tragedy because it is important socially to encourage voluntary bodies to look after the less well off in their communities.  The National Council for the Blind and the Social Services Council, who provide meals-on-wheels, should get support; but unfortunately, because it is a non-statutory service, it is the first to suffer at the hands of health boards who do not have money and, as I said earlier, all the health boards are in deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly make up 369,000 persons over 65 years of age and of course the <Col N="506" /> ideal environment for them is in their own communities.  We should be making some effort to develop the community care services.  The housing scheme for the elderly operated by the health boards is also worthy of support and much good work has been done through that scheme, which should be continued.</P>
    <P>I should like to see physicians for geriatrics as part of a community care team rather than as part of a hospital team. Perhaps there could be limited home visitations because I am concerned that the system of admission to many of the residential care centres for the elderly leaves a lot to be desired in that the people making the decision never see the patients and work on the basis of information supplied on a form.  It would improve the service considerably for elderly people if the geriatrician was a member of the community care team.  Perhaps someone &mdash; not necessarily a person with a high qualification &mdash; could be appointed to the larger homes for old people.  These could be doctors working in the GMS who could provide the service on a part time basis.  Perhaps too doctors could be appointed who do not work in the GMS but who would pay domiciliary visits to the elderly when requested to do so.</P>
    <P>We would certainly support the development of more day hospitals and day care systems.  Has any thought been given to setting up a school of chiropody because one of the most important ways in which we can help the elderly is to keep them mobile.  One way of doing that is to ensure that there is a proper chiropody service.  Many people are incapacitated by poor foot conditions as a result of reduced circulation, diabetes and so on.  If we had a properly developed chiropody service available there would be a saving in terms of the number of persons who suffer serious incapacity, including amputation, as a result of bad circulation.  Recently I visited the Mater Hospital and I was amazed at the numbers of persons chronically ill in one ward who were taking up acute medical beds, the most expensive in the country.  They had had amputations because of poor circulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> The Minister told us that the Government would be providing some resources for projects for the elderly and I should like him to tell us what these are.  There is a serious problem in relation to residential places for adult mentally handicapped and I should like to know if the Minister has any plans for these people.  I know that he improved the services for the mentally handicapped but there are still many problems.  For instance, the mentally handicapped are discharged at 18 years of age and often go home to elderly parents who are not able to look after them.  There are no places which cater for these people.</P>
    <P>With regard to community care, it is sad to see so many buildings left unopened because of insufficient staff.  I refer to Cootehill in my own constituency where there is a hostel for 12 mentally handicapped children who would benefit from attendance at the school for mentally handicapped in Cootehill but unfortunately the hostel has not been opened. It has been built for over two years but the health board are not in a position to staff it.  It is a sad reflection on our health services that we spend capital money on providing these facilities without bothering to staff them.</P>
    <P>In relation to the European Social Fund, I should like to ask why the allocation to the health boards has been reduced so considerably this year.  Apparently the Minister or his Department did not have an input into how the money would be spent.  It appears that the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance made the decisions on this occasion and that the health boards will get approximately half of what they received in previous years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report on the psychiatric services and the emphasis on the shift to community care.  However, there are 6,000 psychiatric nurses and only about 150 of them work in the community. More could and should be done to have these nurses working in the community. We welcome the idea of smaller psychiatric units in general hospitals and the idea of sectors of up to 25,000 as outlined <Col N="508" /> in the report.  If we are going to develop community psychiatric services, it is important to recognise that it will not save money.  It is a myth that if you provide medical services in the community it will cost a lot less than in hospitals and people are now beginning to realise that it is just as expensive to provide services in the community.  There would be a spin off to other people in the community if more services were available.  It is important that we do not start discharging people from psychiatric hospitals into community care services that do not have the facilities for them.  A lot has been written about the experience in Italy and the United State where the discharged people are now congregating in areas of the big cities and are not being adequately looked after.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to look at the whole question of nurse training. At St. Davnets there has not been any nurse training for the last three years.  A serious problem will arise if too much time elapses before nurse training is reintroduced. Another area that needs to be dealt with &mdash; it is similar to the problem of noise &mdash; is the whole question of alcoholism and excessive drinking.  There are so many Departments involved that at times it is difficult to get the right policy organised and implemented.  Since the Estimate was debated last year there have been reports by the Irish Management Institute on absenteeism.  The problem is quite frightening.  The Department, in conjunction with other Departments, should formulate a proper policy to ensure we save people from the serious problems created by excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>With regard to the acute hospital side, we have referred to the closures, reduction in staff numbers and in weekend and locum cover, which are all creating problems.  Every day we read in our newspapers of more problems.  According to today's newspapers the International Missionary Hospital in Drogheda has, for the first time since it was opened, closed 50 beds.  The authorities at the hospital are concerned about that.  They have written to consultants and asked them <Col N="509" /> to reduce their clinics by one per week because of overcrowding.  Inevitably, this must have an effect on the level and quality of health care to be provided. Those with access to health care will be all right but others will be denied access to the health care they need.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent some time on the question of Beaumont and transfers to that hospital.  I do not have any doubt that there is a fundamental ideology at the back of this.  The Minister's predecessors, the leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, and Deputy Woods, agreed to allow the consultants have a private hospital on the grounds at Beaumont. The Minister suggested that they succumbed to pressure from vested interests. I suggest that they had a very positive approach to the problem.  They had concern for the public patients who would be attending Beaumont Hospital.  I do not have the slightest doubt that it is in the best interest of the public patients that the doctors should be on the campus for as long as possible during the day. Tonight the Minister told us that he did not mind where the consultants erected their private hospital as long as they did not build it on publicly owned land.  I would be very concerned where they build it.  I want to avoid what happens in some parts of Dublin.  If I were a public patient in Beaumont and had surgery this morning I would not want the consultant to be operating in the private nursing home at St. Michael's Dun Laoghaire, in the afternoon.  I would like to think that the surgeon was across the lawn on the campus at Beaumont.  That makes very sound sense by whatever standard one judges it.</P>
    <P>At no stage did the consultants ask that they be provided with a facility out of public funds that they were not prepared to pay for.  They were prepared to lease or buy the land and erect the private hospital themselves.  It is important to recognise that we do not have a full and free comprehensive nationalised health service.  There is a section of the community, approximately 20 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister is not doing anything to get rid of the two-tiered system because if he was he would be advocating a nationalised health service similar to that which operates in the UK with everybody having a free comprehensive service.  The integrated system of private and public health care has served the country very well.

      <P>Public patients will suffer.  There is a clinic in Blackrock and if the Minister succeeds in polarising public and private medical care consultants, particularly those in specialties where they are in short supply, will opt for private medical care.  Who will suffer? If the cardiac surgeons opt for private medical care who will suffer?  The private patients will not suffer but the public patients will lose access to those top consultants who are in scarce supply.  It is important that we do not do anything to damage what has been a very successful system in the interests of public patients. The private patients are able to provide for themselves and will be able to follow the consultants for their private treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position because there is no doubt that it is in the interests of the public patients who will be occupying beds in Beaumont Hospital that the consultants be on the campus as long as possible every day.  There would not be any loss to the Exchequer.  In fact, there would be an income to the Exchequer from the consultants building their own private hospital.  The Minister should allow them do that.  He would also save a further 70 or 80 beds which he intends to give away in the public hospital.  Those beds would then be available for public patients.</P>
      <P>When one considers that only one major hospital is available on the north side of the city one will realise how essential it is that sufficient public beds are available in that area.  Blanchardstown was to be developed into a major hospital but, obviously, the Minister has not any plans to deal with that matter in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister met the medical organisation on the question of charges to consultants for the use of equipment in public <Col N="512" /> hospitals.  That will put an extra charge on the consumer because if it is implemented, which I doubt, the consultants will transfer the charge to the consumer. Many of the consultants are already paying a contribution towards the use of the equipment in hospitals.  The equipment has been paid for out of taxpayers' money but the public will be asked to pay extra money for the use of that equipment if they are hospitalised.  A person has a right to private health care if they wish.  By introducing all these charges, and because of the massive increase in charges for accommodation in health board hospitals, more and more people who are prepared to pay for their own health care are being forced back into the public sector.  That sector is already overcrowded and, with a reduced allocation, is barely able to cope with the people they have full responsibility for. It is not the time to force this decision.  It is interesting to note that the Minister met the professional organisations but was unable to reach agreement with them.  He then gave a direction to the health boards to get in touch with the consultants, at a time when the consultants, like all the other health board staff, are doing their best to live within the reduced allocation.  They are to be complimented for the way they have co-operated over the last two or three years.</P>
    <P>We have the largest admission to hospital per 1,000 of any EC country.  I have no doubt this is related to the poor development of our community care services and our hospital outpatient services.  I ask the Minister to have a serious look at the outpatient facilities.  In the North Infirmary in Cork there is only one room and the surgeon and patient are in that room. The surgeon is a highly paid technical person and if there were two or three dressingrooms he could increase his throughput.  I would ask the Minister to look in terms of capital expenditure at improving the outpatient facilities and the range of services available in hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an examination of return visits to hospitals, combined care, <Col N="513" /> which is a feature of the maternity hospitals. If such a scheme were implemented it might reduce the number of people going back to outpatients departments. Many health boards will not pay for pathology services for persons who hold a hospital services card, if the test is sent by the family doctor.  This means that if a person cannot afford to pay £30 for a test to be carried out, he will be sent to the outpatients department of the hospital and many tests will be carried out at much greater expense to the health boards.  We must ensure that the patient gets the proper level of services.  This area needs to be looked at because it should not be more attractive financially for patients to go to hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that hospitals develop their information and management information systems in the interest of more efficiency.  What is happening in the computer controversy?  Has there been a change of decision in the Department? The Minister referred to the Supreme Court decision on Monaghan Hospital. The health board received a letter telling them they would have to close and dispose of the hospital before the Minister would sign the contract for Cavan. The health board held firm and said they wanted to retain the Monaghan Hospital. In my view, they were in the best position to judge what was right but the Minister took the board to Dublin and informed them he was going to close the maternity unit.  I ask him to reverse that decision. It may be necessary to change the legislation in some areas but it should not be necessary to change it in relation to Monaghan. It would create a great deal of goodwill if he accepted that the maternity unit should not be closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister closed the maternity hospital in Bantry and promised the people they would have ante-natal clinics in Bantry with consultants coming from Cork.  Now two years later, they have no ante-natal clinics and people in Castle-townbere are 110 miles from the nearest maternity hospital, the same distance from Nenagh to Dublin except that the roads are not so good in West Cork.  This <Col N="514" /> is totally unacceptable.  I want to know why the Minister did not honour his commitment to provide the ante-natal clinics in Bantry.  I know the consultants would not go from Cork to Bantry, and I would have to agree with them, because while an orthopaedic consultant does not have a contract to be available if somebody breaks a leg, an obstetrician has a contract to be available if a women is in labour.  He cannot be 60 miles away at an ante-natal clinic.  I ask the Minister what he intends to do about the Bantry problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister wrote to the health boards and told them they could retain any further health contributions they collected. Over the last year they made an effort to collect the outstanding health contributions but, unfortunately for them, they sent them to the Department. Would the Minister return the contributions they collected for last year?</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the Minister is amalgamating the Medico Social Research Board and the Medical Research Council.  I have reservations about that amalgamation and about bringing them directly into the Department of Health.  Those bodies carry out two different functions.  The Medico Social Research Board over the years have built up a confidence with professional people who are committed to confidentiality.  I believe that if the board are brought into the Department, that confidence may be eroded and the same type of information may not be forthcoming.  That board are a semi-independent, semi-State body and have the confidence of the professional people, but they are not subject to the direct influence of the Minister for Health.  I believe that by bringing these bodies into the Department the Minister may have a direct influence.  It could happen that an assessment they were going to carry out might not be politically right and the Minister might not give his approval.  I wonder if this is a wise move.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board is a consumer organisation with about 330,000 subscribers.  I wonder if, <Col N="515" /> in any contemplated changes in the legislation, the Minister will take their views into account.  Chapter 3 of Comhairle na nOspidéal's last report makes sorry reading.  It deals with their difficulties with the Minister and what they believe was an infringement on their statutory obligations because the Department of Health have to be informed and have to give sanction for appointments.</P>
    <P>We are still concerned about the appointments system of trainee student nurses whereby the training hospital would not have an input into their selection.  This is a matter of concern to many of the training schools.</P>
    <P>Certainly the food and hygiene regulations need to be updated.  I should like to see a public slaughterhouse run by some public Department, where all slaughtering would be carried out under proper control.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister when the study on leukaemia and the effects of Sellafield, formerly Windscale will be completed and available.  Also, what talks or contact have the Minister's Department had with the various local authorities in relation to settling the travelling people and what sort of co-operation is he receiving?  What positive arrangements have been made for the homeless?  In previous Estimates, the Minister told the House that a Green Paper on the health services was imminent. In this Estimate he has not mentioned that.  Can we expect a Green Paper on the whole future of the health services and, if so, when?</P>
    <P>From the document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> I quote as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government remain fully committed to fulfilling the social obligation which society owes to all who may find themselves in need of health care. Health services will be available either free or at tolerable levels of cost to all those who need them.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is very far, indeed, from the reality with which we are faced today, where services, and indeed statutory services which should be available, <Col N="516" /> are not available.  People who are unable to provide services for themselves are being denied them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has alienated himself from many of the health boards.  In fact, one, the Western Health Board, went so far as to call for his resignation.</P>

If any Minister were to close a hospital which contained such a brain unit, that Minister should resign.

Would he also try to restore the morale among the personnel working in the health services by admitting that Government policies have failed and by calling a halt to the present dismantling of the health services?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1985, net expenditure on the health services will amount to £1,122 million.  In <Col N="518" /> addition, there will be capital expenditure of £58 million to develop hospitals and other facilities.  This massive provision represents almost 20 per cent of the entire Exchequer provision for non-capital public services.  The health services now employ in the region of 58,000 people and provide a wide and sophisticated range of services.  Given the limited resources available, our health services are by and large very good, both in facilities and in the competence of the staffs employed.</P>

      <P>The present serious constraints on the growth of public expenditure have drawn disproportionate attention to the adjustments now necessary in our health services.  This is understandable, given the legacy of inflated expectations arising from the major growth which occurred in the range and scope of these services over the last 15 years.  It also deflects attention from the very real and steady progress which is being made, in spite of the financial constraints, in improving and developing the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality with which we are now faced is that public services generally must be provided within certain limits. We have passed the stage where Government can be irresponsible about spending targets and simply expand the volume of spending to accommodate every special interest group looking for this or that concession.  To have continued down that path was to invite economic disaster and <Col N="519" /> ultimately the possibility of much more stringent controls on public spending.</P>

      <P>What this Government have set out to do &mdash; and succeeded in doing, to judge by the recent returns on Government spending, is to cut their cloth according to their measure.  We have decided, given the many pressing demands for public services and the limits on our available resources, what the maximum appropriate spending on health services in 1985 will be.  Since the beginning of the year, considerable efforts by the Department of Health and the health agencies have been devoted to ensuring that spending will not exceed this level, while at the same time maintaining essential standards of service to patients and clients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the amount of money available is limited, let us be quite clear that it is still an enormous investment of resources.  We are talking here of a level of net non-capital expenditure corresponding to almost £22 million each week during 1985.  This huge investment is a clear demonstration of this <Col N="520" /> Government's commitment to maintaining the high level of health service provision which this country is fortunate enough to enjoy.</P>
      <P>There is a disquieting over-emphasis on the Opposition benches on the negative impact of what they see as cutbacks in health services.  Yet, where is the evidence of the negative impact on health of the tighter management of health services? After all, this is the primary objective of our health care system.  Despite the callous shroud-waving, the critics of this more responsible approach to health service management have been singularly unsuccessful in producing any hard evidence to support the general accusations and allegations they make.</P>
      <P>There is, in fact, a very positive side to controlling the growth in health spending. In a large and complex organisation which grew so rapidly and in so unconstrained a fashion during the late sixties and early seventies there was undoubtedly scope for efficiency improvements. There has been a major effort in the last couple of years to eliminate inefficiencies and by so doing to ensure that the best value is obtained for every pound of taxpayer's money which is spent on the health services.  This process of seeking out and eliminating any remaining areas of inefficiency will continue, at least while this Government are in office.  If by some accident there is a change of Government, I presume we will go on a spending spree again.  Given the limits on total resources and the obvious need for development of services in some areas, few will disagree with the logic of cutting out any waste and redeploying resources to worthwhile developments.</P>

      <P>In this context, then, new or extended services can only be provided by way of redeployment of resources from other areas either by way of saving or reducing and eliminating services which are perceived to be of a lower priority.  In future, then, agencies will have to identify and specify the resources which they are in a position to redeploy when they are considering plans for developments.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable controversy of late about opening some new units which have been completed in the recent past but which have not been opened.  In my own area, for example, we have had the long running saga of the new maternity unit at Galway Regional Hospital.  This unit was provided to relieve overcrowding in the existing unit and, while it will be dealing with the same number of births as the old unit, the Western Health Board were looking for 75 additional head staff and in excess of £800,000 per year to open it.</P>
      <P>In the present difficult budgetary situation there simply is no way that additional resources could be provided on such a scale.  The board were asked repeatedly to re-examine their request and to identify resources which they could redeploy to open this much needed facility for the mothers of Galway but I regret to say that the response was very disappointing. In a genuine and very sincere effort to relieve the situation and to assist the board in the obviously difficult task which they had, the Minister made available £2000,000 last May to enable the unit to be opened.  I regret to have to say that despite this the unit is still not opened nor is there any indication about when it is likely to open.</P>

      <P>There is little doubt that this facility is needed.  It will bring considerable medical benefits to the people of the west and will result in some financial savings to the board.  We have again asked the board to see if some resources could be redeployed for this purpose and to quantify the savings which would accrue by bringing the scanner into use.  Again, I regret to say the response has been very disappointing and negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputies wish to know a little more about the CAT scanner I will give them some information.  In 1981 it was No.4 on the priority list.  A member of the Fianna Fáil Party made the decision to provide a sum of £750,000 for its purchase. What the public, this House and the press do not know is that the agent who sold the scanner was an election agent for a very prominent Fianna Fáil <Col N="523" /> man in Dublin, now an ex-Member of Leinster House.  To pinpoint it a little more, he is a Member of the European Parliament at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board have numerous plans for developments and extensions to services but they will have to realise that these plans cannot be implemented unless resources can be redeployed to finance them.  There is no point in having grandiose plans that we cannot afford.  The board should consider seriously and re-evaluate all the services they are providing to see if they could be provided more efficiently, or if all of them are needed on the present scale.  I would not be at all surprised if such a review indicated several opportunities for savings and perhaps even the closure of a hospital.</P>

      <P>I am concerned regarding the Department having second thoughts about the withdrawal of grant aid for farm development work.  The grant aid was withdrawn in 1983 but now the Department have decided to pay for the work but in a restricted way.  They have not taken account of many of the hardship cases that followed the withdrawal of the aid.  It was in the budget of 1983 that the Minister decided to withdraw grant aid in respect of farm buildings and fixed assets.  He decided that that would bring about a saving of £10.3 million but it was the most expensive saving ever because it totally disreputed the farm development service and development in agriculture generally in addition to eroding confidence in the advisory staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there was in excess of 14,000 applications for aid.  Prior to then there had been a directive from the Department to the effect that from then on written approvals would be required. From the time of the introduction of grants many years ago there had been always good working arrangements and a good relationship between farmers, agricultural advisers and agricultural officers.  In those early days the grants were very small but there was the minimum of red tape and the various schemes operated very satisfactorily and in a commonsense way.  Unfortunately, the directive relating to the requirement of written approvals damaged greatly those good working arrangements.  At that time farmers were spending substantial sums of money on development work and they had had to arrange to borrow those sums. It was at a time also when about 50 per cent of cattle were wintered and when there was a severe loss of profits on the <Col N="531" /> part of those farmers who did not have proper housing for their cattle.</P>
    <P>The system which pertained then was that an ACOT adviser would call to the farmer and draw up a farm plan.  The plan would relate to the farmer's requirements and to his projections, whether he intended intensifying or increasing production. The adviser would take into account also the amount of money the farmer would have to his credit and the extent of credit which he would be in a position to secure.  Subsequently the plan would be dealt with in the ACOT office. For years prior to 1983 when a plan had been approved and when the notification was being sent to the farmer it would be accompanied by a form known as an FM8 which the farmer was required to complete and return to the farm development service.  However, the ACOT office discontinued sending out those FM8s and the result was that many farmers, when they got a notice from ACOT setting out their projections for a certain number of years and their proposals to construct various buildings, slurry tanks and so on, believed they could go ahead with the work and this resulted in many people commencing work without having the required written approval.</P>
    <P>In many cases farmers believed they had approval from their agricultural advisers and the farm development officers, and these officers would know that the farmer intended to carry out the work. Up to then farmers were going ahead with the work and then applying for approval but the written approval requirement changed that.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department are making available about £2,500,000 for farm development work but the letters that applicants are receiving from the farm development service are similar to the letter that was sent by the Department to the ACOT and the various agricultural offices.  This letter states that it was decided recently to process applications for grant aid under the farm modernisation scheme for buildings and fixed assets which had been received from farmers but which had not been <Col N="532" /> approved prior to the suspension of part of the scheme in the budget on 9 February 1983.</P>
    <P>An important clause in that letter is the stipulation that an application for grant aid for farm buildings and &mdash; or fixed assets on form FM8, dated 9 February 1983 or earlier must have been received by the farm development service not later than 9 January 1983.  That means that those whose applications were processed will now receive the grant aid to which they were entitled long before now but those who, through no fault of their own but because of an error in assuming that the farm plan was sufficient approval for them to commence work, will not receive the aid.  Even if an application has been in the ACOT office and perhaps only semi-processed or had not been sent to the farm development service, the applicant will not qualify for aid.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that in the period from 9 February 1983 to 1 January 1984 those farm modernisation grants were not processed or approved and that those people who had not received written approval will not be considered or receive any grant aid.  This will inflict hardship on many people.  I could list at least a dozen farmers of whom I am aware in that category, farmers who did everything according to the rule book but who, because they had not received written approval, will be discriminated against. Two years after they had borrowed large amounts of money they have not repaid even half of it to their banks and are now dependent on getting approximately one-third of the overall cost of the projects they had undertaken reimbursed by way of grant aid, which it would now appear they will not receive.</P>
    <P>There is still time to amend this decision which would be the best day's work ever for the development of agriculture. It should be remembered that farmers accepted the word of their ACOT advisers and farm development officers. Indeed, I should like to pay tribute to both those groups who did so much for the development of agriculture.  I worked closely with them in a co-operative for many years.  They are fine, understanding <Col N="533" /> men who approach the matter in a common sense way.  There are very few farmers who would not take their word and who, if they received back a development plan would be inclined to blame a departmental official.  After all, a man's word should be his bond.  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he re-examined the position of those people because it would not entail giving people something unofficially &mdash; the plan and the work proposals exist for all to see.  It is my belief that in practically every county there are hundreds of farmers who will not qualify under the conditions of this circular and there will be many parliamentary questions and representations from public representatives about the matter over the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of saying a few words, courtesy of Deputy J. Leonard, to support him in his attempt to get the Minister to look in a liberal fashion on this new move as far as the farm modernisation scheme is concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to do something I have already done in this House, that is, emphasise the strides made as far as the farming community is concerned.  Not too long after the war a firm of consultants were brought into this country to assess productivity in manufacturing industry and in agriculture.  They were Americans. They said nothing could be done to increase productivity among the farming community.</P>
      <P>Since 1973, through the work of Macra na Feirme in educating young farmers and so on, agricultural productivity here has increased by leaps and bounds.  The House knows that and the statistics are available.  I do not think that this House or various administrations have given sufficient credit to the farming community on that achievement.  It is for that reason that these people who had applied for grants under the farm modernisation scheme have been let down badly.  They were encouraged to produce more but their efforts were slighted, made little of, by the decision taken and announced on 9 February 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> It is against that background I appeal to the Minister to look in a liberal fashion on the new scheme.  Deputy J. Leonard referred to the FM8.  I know of one particular individual in the Kingscourt area of County Cavan &mdash; I will not mention any names &mdash; who filled out all his forms and did all that was required of him.  He had submitted those forms in 1982 but those forms were received on 10 February, the day after the announcement. Obviously there was a slip up in the office. I do not see why that man should suffer because of pressure of work in the office, pressure on officials.  I am only quoting this as an individual instance.  It is an example of many of the hardships suffered as a result of this decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. Leonard made the very important point that the people were undertaking these projects with the general approval of the Minister's officials.  I said in this House already and elsewhere that, if those people banded themselves together and took a case to court, the Department of Agriculture, in its role as a corporation sole, could be held responsible for paying these grants, seeing that their officials are agents.  I endorse the remarks of Deputy Leonard about those officials who had advised individual farmers to go ahead with these projects.  It constituted a very serious inroad into the financial position of small farmers in my county.  There are 243 altogether in the country involved in this <i>débacle.</i>  While to people in this House borrowing £7,000, £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000 might seem a trivial matter, to many of those small farmers, industrious and ambitious, it was a colossal sum of money to have borrowed for projects which they thought had the approval of the Department of Agriculture and which would earn grants for them.  Furthermore, there was the rebate of VAT which was considerable in many such cases and which was not covered either.</P>
    <P>I have said &mdash; and in think the Minister of State present took the point I made previously as far as the legal position was concerned &mdash; that I am sorry those people did not band together, employ a legal team at solicitor and senior counsel level, <Col N="535" /> and push their case in that regard.  However, that will not be necessary if the Minister decides now that, for example, the stamp on the original form when it came into his office should count as the relevant date and not the final stamp of reception, say, on 10 February. Obviously something that arrived on 10 February arrived as a result of panic in the office and officials falling down for one reason or another, perhaps through pressure of work.  However, I do not think any individual citizen should suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard mentioned the purpose behind the decision &mdash; to save a mere £10.3 million.  It is against the background of high productivity achieved by our farmers &mdash; it having been said that nobody could make them produce more &mdash; and the background of the development of educational facilities that the Minister should consider all of this.  He does not have to be over-generous or over-liberal.  He should just pay the people who, in good faith and acting in accordance with the advice of his officials, embarked on what for them was a major investment in agriculture in order to increase productivity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced by me on 6 June, applications for grant aid under the farm modernisation scheme for farm buildings and fixed assets, which had been received from eligible farmers but not approved prior to the suspension of part of the scheme in the budget on 9 February 1983, will now be processed.  To be eligible for payment the works involved must have been undertaken before the introduction of the revised farm modernisation scheme on 3 January 1984 and must have been completed in accordance with proper specifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this is the decision taken in the 1983 budget to suspend grants for farm buildings and fixed assets pending a review of the farm modernisation scheme.  That decision was implemented by withholding the issue of <Col N="536" /> approvals in cases where farmers had made application to the farm development service for items of investment in buildings and fixed assets on their farm plans.</P>
    <P>The review of the scheme was carried out during 1983 and a revised scheme was introduced with effect from 3 January 1984.  This revised scheme concentrated the limited resources available on providing aid for investment on high priority items such as livestock housing and storage for agricultural produce.  It also confined grant aid to the &ldquo;development&rdquo; and &ldquo;other high&rdquo; categories and it also provided aid in the form of an interest subsidy for &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; farmers.  Those applicants who had been affected by the suspension of aid were then free to reapply under the revised scheme, provided that they remained eligible for the items in question and I understand that a large number did so and have in fact, been paid grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Off hand, I do not know, but I will find out for the Deputy. To facilitate development farmers who have a limited time in which to carry out investment under their plans, it was arranged that time would be added on up to a limit of 11 months to enable them to carry out works included in their plans.</P>
      <P>In response to repeated representations on behalf of farmers who had made application to the FDS prior to 9 February 1983 and who undertook building work before the revised scheme was introduced in February 1984, I undertook to seek the necessary funds and I am glad to say that I finally succeeded in getting the agreement of the Government to processing those applications which had been received up to 9 February 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local offices of the FDS are at present processing the applications.  This will take some months as it involves identifying those who come within the terms of the decision, that is that application was made to the FDS not later than 9 February 1983 in respect of investment on the applicant's farm plan and that the <Col N="537" /> work was undertaken before the revised scheme was reintroduced on 3 January 1984 and completed to specification.  An inspection will need to be carried out in each such case.</P>
    <P>This will take some time and until the necessary investigations have been carried out, it will not be possible to establish how many farmers are involved nor how much money will be paid in grants.  I can assure Deputies that the work of processing the applications will be pushed ahead vigorously and it is my intention that all grants due will be paid without avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard now proposes that the decision be extended to include cases where applicants had certain developments on their farm plans but had not made application to the farm development service.  I do not see how I could accede to this request.  I understand what the Deputies are getting at but, I would make it clear that on the morning after the Government's decision of 9 February 1983 there was not a single farmer who was unaware that there was not a grant form from that morning on unless he had already applied to the FDS for it.  There is no point in telling me that people did not know because the Deputies opposite made sure that everybody knew even without any other information service being made available.  I do not accept that some farmers genuinely believed that a grant was available after 9 February of that year and that they went ahead and built on that basis.</P>

      <P>As a person who drew grants over the years I could never countenance a situation where a farmer expects to get a grant for a building, through the Department of Agriculture, without the Department official being on the scene to discuss matters with him.  In any system it would be very important for a Departmental official to be in on the ground.  If either of the Deputies has specific instances I will take them up. Deputy Wilson mentioned a farmer from Kingscourt and 10 February.  I would like to have a look at that file.  I am most sympathetic to farmers and over the past two years I have always said that I did not want to close that stable door because a lot of people were genuinely caught.  I am making a genuine effort to try to cut down on red tape between ACOT and the FDS.  It is proving more difficult than I had anticipated but I will be able to eliminate some of the red tape.  If either Deputy has a problem, like for instance the Kingscourt farmer, I will have a look at it to see what I can do.</P>

    <P>To qualify for inclusion in the scheme, borrowers must (a) have loans under BIM's marine credit plan, (b) have made repayments during 1984 amounting to at least 50 per cent of the revised instalments which would apply to them under the terms of the scheme, or make repayments in either of the 12 month periods ending 30 April 1985 or 31 December 1985 amounting to at least 50 per cent of such revised instalments, (c) to be considered capable of <Col N="346" /> returning to viability as a result of their participation in the scheme and (d) make a statutory declaration of their assets and liabilities with a view to assessing whether their arrears could be eliminated or reduced through disposal of assets.  Eligible borrowers whose existing repayments are fully up to date do not qualify for an extension of the loan repayment period but do not have to make the statutory declaration referred to and are eligible for the increased interest subsidy and for a transfer from the straight line basis of calculation of repayments to the annuity basis.  Vessels under 40 feet in length are not excluded from the scheme. However borrowers whose annual repayments are less than £2,000 are eligible for the capitalisation of arrears and extension of the repayment period on the annuity basis but are not eligible for the increased interest subsidy.</P>

      <P>With regard to the upgrading of Kilmore Quay, I assume that the Deputy is referring to the possible designation of the harbour as a fishery harbour centre under the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts.  As I explained to the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 31 January 1984, the position is that, having considered a report on fishery harbours in this country by an internationally recognised harbour consultant, the Government decided in 1967 that five fishery harbour centres should be established. Dunmore East was the location chosen in the south east region.  The <Col N="347" /> Government decision was given statutory effect by the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts, 1968 and 1980.  I have no proposals to increase the number of fishery harbour centres.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to a further question by the Deputy on 6 December last, plans for major improvements at Kilmore Quay harbour have been prepared by the Office of Public Works and are being examined in my Department in the light of the costs involved and the funds available for fishery harbour works generally.  I am not in a position to say at this stage what the outcome of that examination will be.</P>
