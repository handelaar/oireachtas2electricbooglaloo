      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking yesterday about allowances and I pointed out that the alterations in relation to tax means that there is no gain to the PAYE worker.  They receive more money in their wage packages but when one takes into account the increase in petrol, insurance, fuel and so on, the increase they receive is wiped out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you allowed me to explain it in great detail.  Since the budget, these allowances have been well and truly eroded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach of the Minister and the Government to tax allowances clearly demonstrates an anti-family attitude which is evident in their failure to increase allowances to encourage income earners to take responsibility for their families.  Instead of encouraging people to be self-reliant and to provide for their families, especially for dependent relatives, there is a determination on the part of the Government to allow no incentive or adjustment because of family obligations.  There is no increase in the tax allowance for children and according to <i>Building on Reality</i> there will be a child benefit scheme instead. This means that the basic responsibility for the family will be referred to the State, which is quite the opposite of what we support and maintain.  Instead of involving the State in greater expense <Col N="466" /> through administration of a scheme, we believe that the established way of encouraging people to look after their families is much more effective and welcome to parents.  It is not suprising that, in recent times, there has been a growth in organisations such as Family Solidarity.  Among other things, they are very actively engaged in the question of income tax allowances.  They say &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; that the Minister's approach, far from strengthening family solidarity, is doing the opposite.</P>
      <P>There is no increase in the dependent relative's allowance although, if they fall ill, there is a marginal increase in terms of the allowance for disabled persons. People should be encouraged to provide for their dependent relatives at home.  I was appalled to see recently that the cost of a hospital bed in some institutions is £1,000 per week.  In these hospitals, people are receiving no other treatment than being on a permanent drip because of chronic illness.  Justice and social obligation argue that instead of allowing that situation to develop further we should increase the allowance of £112 per annum, which is a nonsensical amount. This would create a happier social environment and would reduce the cost to the State of hospitalising old people.</P>
      <P>The Government seem to be totally sold on schemes of all kinds and can be described as the scheming Government. The cost of administering all these schemes has grown to such an extent that those who are meant to benefit from them are questioning their purpose.  The taxpayer, in particular, is worried about the cost and, instead of expanding schemes it would be much more appropriate to increase the allowances for children and dependent relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great concerns of the bona fide taxpayers, the Minister and the officials in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, is the growth of the black economy.  The black economy is growing as a result of the penal levels of taxation.  We will encourage a further growth in the black economy if we do not allow those who look after their families and parents a reasonable <Col N="467" /> allowance.  It is all very fine to say that money received under benefit schemes will be liable for taxation except that it adds another layer of administration, but what about those who do not make tax returns but yet will benefit from the scheme?  In time we will find that another scheme introduced by this scheming Government will encourage this trend, which is already a matter of considerable concern.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government propose to take over responsibility for the family from the family.  If so perhaps they will tell us.  Instead of encouraging people to provide for their dependent relatives and children in their own home the State is determined that it will look after them when they become ill.  Many more people will become ill and go into the institutions on this basis at a great cost to the State. In many cases the cost is of the order of £150,000 per annum even though the necessary medical personnel are not provided in the hospitals because of the cutbacks. This is the kind of nonsense the Government promote.  The Government apparently cannot extricate themselves from the consequences of their ill-thought out and ill-advised schemes.  That is bad enough, but I am much more concerned with the fact that the community at large cannot extricate themselves from the cage in which the Government have locked them and the burden which the Government have imposed on them.</P>
    <P>For some, this debate is presented as, and is, from time to time, rather technical. It goes on for hours on end.  It is not very exciting stuff or very sexy or the kind of thing that would warrant a good row in the House.</P>

      <P>I did not say for the Minister.  We go through each section of the Bill and it is not very exciting. However, each section is of vital importance, and the kind of arguments we make for amendments to the sections are based on our concern for what is happening in the economy, in our family units and the penalties being imposed on employers <Col N="468" /> and employees by a Government who have only one concept of economic management &mdash; to bridge the deficit by increasing taxation.

      <P>Take the case of the personal allowance for widows.  Out of their generosity the Government will increase the allowance by 4 per cent. Some of them cannot meet their normal day-to-day expenses in terms of food, clothing, accommodation and so on.  As a result of that and because they cannot afford to engage someone to look after them they turn to the State, to the health boards and the institutions most of which are not developed to the point of providing adequate geriatric care, particularly in view of the health cutbacks.  There is no increase in children's allowances.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be generous towards widows.  The allowance will be increased by 5.5 per cent in the year in which the bereavement is suffered.  That is a major concession to a widow, an extra 1 per cent.  That is the kind of generosity the Minister can provide out of the goodness of his rich heart.  There is provision in respect of people employed to care for a taxpayer or their spouse either of whom is totally incapacitated.  The allowance will be increased to £2,500.  I should like the Minister to reflect on the kind of care and attention a totally incapacitated person needs.  He should reflect on the cost to the State if such a person was transferred to hospital.  He is doing the big thing, increasing the tax allowance from £2,000 to £2,500.  Those facts speak for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendments have proposed some adjustments.  They are not nearly adequate, but they are at least a step in the right direction.  It is time the Minister told us his views on children's allowances, dependent relative's allowances, care for the disable and widowed people who are dependent in a variety of ways and have to call on the social services, neighbours and friends.  They should be <Col N="469" /> entitled to call on the permanent assistance of paid employees.  If the Minister's strange interpretation of fiscal rectitude is that he will increase taxation and reduce any possibility of tax allowances even if the consequences are that he has to pay out one thousand times more in State services, in institutions, in hospital beds of wherever and that he will penalise those at work and drive them into the black economy, then no arguments of mine will convince him that the facts speak for themselves.  Those who are concerned for the general well being of the economy and for a healthy and responsible social environment would wish to see some beleated response from the Minister at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil amendments are intended to increase the amount of the increases in the Bill.  I did not hear Deputy O'Kennedy give any estimate of the cost of these amendments. Perhaps one of the other Deputies who stood in for him yesterday gave the cost.  We would like to increase all the allowances by 100 per cent if we had that sort of money.  We have not got that sort of money.  It is unrealistic, naive and dare I say irresponsible for Deputy O'Kennedy to imply to the public that there is an endless amount of money to enable us to increase every allowance by 100 per cent, or by a bigger percentage than the percentage in the Bill.  The thrust of the section is to increase the allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to see more encouragement given to relatives to look after their sick dependants.  Deputy O'Kennedy's argument would be more credible if he had put down an amendment on the dependent relative allowances. The whole aim of changing the children's allowances scheme to a child benefit scheme is to make the scheme more equitable and more administratively satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's arguments do not carry the weight he is trying to put behind them.  He is trying to imply to the public that we are doing something underhand, that in some way we are getting rid of children's allowances.  In fact, we are trying to tidy up the taxation system as it exists now.  The people have been looking for a rationalising, a tidying up and a sorting out of the different tax systems.  They want uniformity in the system.  Of course it is valid to say we should increase the dependent relative allowance.  We are not increasing it in this budget but we are increasing other allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made very little of the fact that the allowance in respect <Col N="471" /> of a person employed to take care of a taxpayer of a spouse who is totally incapacitated is being increased by £500. That is a substantial increase, and people who might have ended up in an institution will now be able to stay at home.  I accept that there is a great deal of cost involved in keeping people at home, but it would cost more if they were put into an institution. In many cases the State is already helping those in another way by the provision of medical cards, health services, nursing services, and so on.  I should like to see an increase in community care.  We should encourage relatives to maintain their dependents and look after them. The Minister for Health is working hard to increase community care.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's arguments leave me cold, because he is trying to imply that the thrust of the section is to take something away when, in fact, we are increasing these allowances, granted not by an enormous amount except in the case of the allowance for somebody minding an incapacitated person.  If we were to follow Deputy O'Kennedy's argument to its logical conclusion we would have a free for all and get rid of schemes.  He referred to us as schemers and a scheming Government.  We must have an administrative system for our taxation system.  By the sound of it, if he ever becomes Minister for Finance again he will do away with everything and nobody will have to sign forms or send in documents.  He seems to be arguing that we should not have children's allowances and that if people are good parents they will be able to provide for their children.</P>

      <P>There were two conflicting points of view in what Deputy O'Kennedy was saying.  On the one hand he claimed that it is wrong that there is no increase in the child tax allowance and that that is an anti-family measure.  On the other hand, he criticised me for apparently wanting to transfer responsibility for giving assistance to provide for children from the family to the State.  On the one hand he wants the State to do more and on the other hand he wants the State to do less.</P>

      <P>If the Opposition would sort out which side of that argument they are on, we could have a discussion and perhaps Deputy O'Kennedy's interventions on the Finance Bill might be a little more sexy and the oratorical flourishes might have a little more scintillation than they have had up to now.  I want to refer to the child benefit scheme in the context of its being an alternative to allowances we are discussing now.  We intend to take the existing children's allowances, the child tax allowance and the other allowances for dependent children which are built into our social welfare code, and unify them in one system, and pay them in a way which will tailor the net amount going to each family to the family's circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is perfectly legitimate, desirable and a socially equitable way of going about it.  It is nonsense for Deputy O'Kennedy to try to present that as being anti-family.  It is nonsense for him to present it as being another layer of bureaucracy, because we are reducing the bureaucracy.  Above all, we will be targeting the expenditure more closely to people who need it most.  I do not think <Col N="473" /> Deputy O'Kennedy could argue against that.  To the extent that there is any thinking about these things in the Fianna Fáil Party, they would generally tend to favour a concentration of benefits on the people who need them most, rather than, as Governments have done for many years past, taking what I call the scatter gun technique to the distribution of benefits with the result that everybody gets the same and you are not sure that the real needs of the people most in need are met.  The increase we propose this year in the allowance for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No &mdash; for the care of an incapacitated person &mdash; is the biggest increase since it was introduced.  In 1984 the increase in this allowance was the biggest, so far as I remember, since the allowance was introduced.  I am very conscious of the real need to assist, to the extent we can assist, people who want to care for their incapacitated spouse in the home.  We are all agreed that that is a legitimate objective and that this allowance is a means of helping people to do just that.  I heard a young lady say on a radio programme this morning that the Finance Bill debate seemed to be a point scoring contest.  I am not particularly interested in that but I find it difficult not to refer to the view I hold that in using phrases such as, &ldquo;anti-family&rdquo;, Deputy O'Kennedy is merely engaging in cant. He is using code words to which he thinks there will be a particular kind of reaction and then goes on to be inconsistent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not a bad acolyte himself.  What we have done here in relation to these allowances is to strike a balance in the system of tax reliefs for which we had room in the budget.  We decided how much was available to relieve tax but on each occasion we had to decide where the balance should lie as between changes in allowances or bands <Col N="474" /> with the changes in rates.  This year we considered it was important to bring into effect the changes in rates that we have discussed on a previous section and then to consider what we could do in terms of allowances.  The total effect is more than the effect of indexation and these allowances have their place in that total scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the incapacitated and I should like a definition of that term.  Does it include the geriatric cases referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy or has it another specific meaning which excludes those people? Deputy O'Kennedy made a good point. The philosophy of the Minister for Finance is to save public expenditure in so far as possible.  It is well known and accepted generally among politicians that the allocation of a certain amount of money for the care of old people in the home would save the State substantial sums. Therefore, in that area there is an opportunity for the Minister to save money for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is that among people who are close to the citizens, people who conduct clinics, there is a belief that we cash in on the natural affection of Irish people for the old.  There are people who argue that this approach to life and to the old is weakening.  Many of us would be very disappointed if that were to happen but at times people are shocked to find that services may be available if a place can be found for an old person in a hospital but services that cost substantial sums of money per week while money can not be paid to an in-law, a daughter-in-law for example, for providing those services for an old person at home.  I am talking mainly about the areas I am familiar with, about rural life particularly.  The hardship that young women especially endure in this field is unknown.  These women are usually rearing their children while trying to cope with old people who are becoming increasingly feeble and who may becoming a little testy.  It is a serious weakness in our social legislation that by our rules and regulations, the State precludes old people from being looked <Col N="475" /> after at home.  I am not point scoring in this matter.  Other Deputies, too, will have experienced many cases of the kind I am talking of in the context of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The bank of goodwill we are drawing on is not inexhaustible, I trust that the dedication to looking after the old will last.  There have been problems in parts of Ireland already in this regard and there have been very much accentuated problems in other countries, particularly in the US.  The late Brendan Behan on being asked which country he would prefer to be in jail in, replied, &ldquo;as an old man, There is a great deal of truth in what he said and it is something that can be applied to the point I am making here.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to an aspect put forward by the Minister, that was, that he would expect all of us to agree that benefit should accrue to the most needy.  Everybody would be in general agreement with that but there is an aspect of children's allowances to which the Minister has not admitted and to which Deputy Owen has not admitted either.  We all know that children's allowance are paid to the mother in the home.  I know of many households into which adequate money is going but where the women are not receiving an adequate proportion of that money.  In such cases the children's allowances are as important to those mothers as they are to women who receive an adequate amount of money.  I am sure the Minister would allow that I would know of such issues but it is a matter to which he has not adverted in his reply.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to clear the minds of people like Deputy Carey.  I do not wish particularly to associate Deputy Owen with him merely because she happens to be sitting beside him.  Deputy Carey's remark that it is a great achievement for the Government to be able to pay the present levels of unemployment benefit to so many people while avoiding a revolution, speaks for itself.  The Deputy seems to follow in that confused way by saying that I advocated the abolition of children's allowances.  I have never suggested anything of that kind.  My attitude is quite the opposite. While I do not wish to accuse the Minister of trying to abolish children's allowances, I would make the point that he has not increased them either this year or last year.  If Deputy Carey had been here during the budget debate he would have heard me criticise the Minister in that respect.</P>

      <P>We have selected our amendments in this case.  Our whole approach is in favour of proper allowances, either by way of the tax system or in terms of children's allowances for parents so that matters will be less onerous for them.  I repeat that the extent of the allowance for a dependent relative is shameful, being of the order of about £110.  If Deputy Owen, Deputy Carey or <Col N="477" /> the Minister suggest that this amount is adequate and that it promotes good social policy, let them say it.  Deputy Owen and Deputy Carey confused what I said and misrepresented it.  It is vitally important to encourage people to maintain dependent relatives, not necessarily incapacitated relatives in this instance, to the point where they will not suffer for want of care and proper attention and will not in time come into the institutional care of the State.  By encouraging people through the taxation system or allowances to care for children or dependent relatives at home we will be doing a much better job and saving huge sums of taxpayers' money because the alternative institutional care is not socially desirable where it can be avoided and is grossly expensive.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke will have an opportunity later to speak about the question of incapacity.  Regarding the definition of &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo; in respect of the allowance for a person employed to look after an incapacitated taxpayer or a taxpayer's spouse, the provision applies where the person is totally incapacitated by physical or mental infirmity.  While the provision refers to &ldquo;total incapacity&rdquo; it does not require that the incapacity should be such as to prevent the incapacitated person from being able to maintain himself or herself.  Where a doctor, a psychiatrist or a psychologist certifies that <Col N="478" /> the individual is totally incapacitated or where the incapacity is evident, this relief will be granted.  It is available in respect of the employment of a person to look after the incapacitated taxpayer or incapacitated spouse.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, other means of assistance where people suffer from disabilities of various kinds.  There is the social welfare prescribed relative allowance and a taxpayer getting the benefit of that allowance would have it taken into account in calculating the amount of this allowance.  We also have the scheme of health board home helps.  Occasionally the person being assisted is asked by the health board to make a contribution. Since that person is not the employer of the home help the provision of this section would not apply.</P>
      <P>In spite of everything that has been said by the Opposition, I notice that they have not proposed any amendments in relation to the allowance for incapacitated children, a housekeeper taking care of an incapacitated person or the allowance for a blind person or spouse.</P>

    <P>This PAYE workers' allowance was first introduced in 1981-82.  It does not apply to all income taxpayers and is a recognition of the special place of the PAYE worker in our financial and taxation system.  It is an indication of the reliance of the Exchequer on the dependability of income from PAYE workers since it was seen that deductions were less costly, coming in regularly from these employees without delay.  As soon as the money is earned, the tax is paid.</P>
    <P>In other areas of income tax claims are constantly being pursued, with a consequent increase in the number employed in the Revenue Commissioners.  There are special complaints tribunals and long <Col N="480" /> drawn out processes for deciding how much should be paid.  Of course there is a further delay before the money is actually paid.  Every month and every year of the delay the person who owes the tax has the use of that money while the Minister is at a loss.  I think it was in recognition of this factor that a special allowance of £600 was given to PAYE workers in 1981-82.  If I am wrong in this assessment, perhaps the Minister would explain the reason.  That allowance has remained static ever since, while every other allowance has been consistently increased.  In this Finance Bill all other allowances have rightly been adjusted and increased in line with the cost of living, inflation etc.</P>
    <P>However, this allowance of £600 has not been increased since 1981-82.  When we were debating the Finance Bill last year we put down a similar amendment that the allowance be increased to £1,000 and the Minister's reply was the usual one that he gives whenever there is any amendment proposed to the Finance Bill, namely, the cost.  He said the cost would be £84 million in 1984 and £140 million in a full year.  I hope the Minister will be as particular about giving the cost of all the other adjustments and exemptions in taxation.  I hope he will give us details of the cost of the various adjustments in relation to capital acquisition tax and so on in this budget.</P>
    <P>This allowance was given for a specific reason and in recognition of a special position.  The allowance of £600 that was given in 1981-82 was a considerable loss to the Exchequer but, at the same time, there was recognition that that loss from the PAYE sector was infinitesimal compared with the loss to the Exchequer from all other income taxpayers in terms of delay in payment and the processing of claims, in addition to the cost to the Exchequer of those who do not pay at all.  It was a recognition that this was a small cost to pay in giving that allowance to employees who have no say in the matter.  In fact, there is a question mark about the whole matter of the constitutionality of the PAYE system.  People are questioning the constitutionality of <Col N="481" /> everything these days and getting away with it.  Most things are found to be unconstitutional because of their conflict with the section dealing with the right to private property as set out in the Constitution but as yet nobody has tested the constitutionality of the PAYE system. Nobody has questioned the constitutionality of a wage structure where the person who works and earns a particular wage never gets it into his hands, even though the only asset an employee has is the work he does.  Part of this money is taken by the Minister for Finance before the employee is paid.  The constitutionality of the PAYE system has not yet been tested in the courts but if it were a Minister for Finance and a Government could be in enormous difficulty and danger in the future.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the fact that the PAYE workers are in a special position and are of such enormous importance to the Exchequer &mdash; they carry the burden, they are the permanent feature of the income of the State and are the backbone of the whole financial structure &mdash; the allowance of £600 was given in 1981-82 but there has been no increase in that amount since then.</P>
    <P>This year we are again putting down an amendment that the allowance be increased.  On the basis of the 1981 figure of £600 we calculate the appropriate amount in 1985 would be £1,000.  If I am wrong in that, will the Minister please tell me what would be the equivalent of £600 in 1981 in present day terms.  If the Minister will not accept this amendment, I ask him to give a more justifiable reason other than saying this would mean a loss of so much to the Exchequer.  Every adjustment made means a loss or a gain to the Exchequer.  If you lose one way you gain another way.  We will be putting forward many ideas that could result in gains for the Exchequer.  I ask the Minister to give some reason for not accepting this amendment other than saying it would represent a loss of £84 million or £90 million.</P>
    <P>Our amendment, which was ruled out of order, also proposed that we would have a top tax rate of 70 per cent.  The <Col N="482" /> Minister cut the existing top rate of 65 per cent and this was at a loss to the Exchequer.  However, he did not use that argument then.  We advocated a 70 per cent rate.  In this instance now we are asking that at the bottom of the scale the Minister should increase the allowance to £1,000.  If the Minister does not accept that amendment, I hope he will at least examine the matter and suggest an increase he would consider reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me to give the figure of the cost to the Exchequer as a result of acceptance of his amendment. It would cost £85.9 million this year and £143 million in a full year. Although the Deputy does not like to hear this, I would have to say that on grounds of cost alone I have to oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>The allowance in question was introduced in 1980 and it was then £400.  It was introduced then to take account of the fact that the self-employed had a different system of taxation, specifically that they pay tax on the basis of the proceeding year.  The allowance was increased to £600 in 1981.  The total cost of the allowance at its present level of £600 is about £214 million for a full year.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for bringing in the allowance was the difference between the tax situation of the self-employed and the PAYE payer, particularly in respect of assessment on the preceding year.  That can be held to produce an advantage for the self-employed, particularly in periods when inflation is fairly high.  The advantage has been lessened substantially in the past few years because we have brought inflation down to a much more moderate level than we experienced during the earlier years of this decade.  In addition, in the Finance Act of last year we increased the specified amount provided for in the taxation of the self-employed so that where an assessment of income tax is under appeal the taxpayer must make a payment on account equal to 85 per cent of the tax payable on termination of the appeal, rather than 75 per cent as was the case up until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking those two factors together, that <Col N="483" /> is the reduction in the rate of inflation, which takes away some of the relative benefit of a preceding year basis of assessment and the fact that we have made changes to the level at which self-employed must pay specified amounts, would seem to me to change the balance somewhat by comparison with what it was when this allowance was first introduced. Incidentally the present day value of £600 in 1981 we calculate would be approximately £920 in May of this year. If we were to increase the allowance from £600 to that figure of £920 the 1985 cost would be approximately £63 million and, in a full year, £107 million.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 46, to delete &ldquo;£286&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£400&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the allowance for employees paying the high rate of PRSI.  Even if a person does not come within the income tax bracket he must still pay for insurance.  In 1982 this allowance was £312 and it was reduced to £286 in 1983.  We want this allowance raised to at least £400 for the lower paid workers, who are paying the highest rates of PRSI.  The Minister will probably say that this will be a loss to the Exchequer, but I am thinking about the gain it would mean for those who cannot afford these deductions from their pay packets in PRSI, income tax, income levies and so on.  A £400 allowance would be reasonable <Col N="487" /> today and it is not much more than what was allowed in 1982, three years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance introduced in 1981 was £312 and it was reduced to the current figure of £286.  In relation to the impact of the PRSI contribution generally, as the Commission on Taxation have pointed out, as far as every wage earner is concerned the only important issue is the net income after tax.  Whether the tax is deductible through income tax, PAYE, an income levy or PRSI contributions is not a major consideration for the worker except &mdash; I must make the distinction &mdash; that in the PRSI contribution he is contributing to the pay-related scheme which in turn on social welfare benefit will accrue to his &mdash; or her &mdash; advantage.  Nonetheless, it is fairly clear that the high marginal rates of tax, the imposition of the income levy and the level of PRSI contributions are having a disincentive effect on employees, particularly at the lower income level, as has been pointed out recently in many reports from objective economists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point in connection with PRSI contribution is that, apart from the disincentive effect it has on employees, it has a major disincentive effect in terms of employment on employers.  The rate of PRSI contribution on employers in this year will be 12.2 per cent by contrast with 12.1 per cent last year.  From that I want to bring to the Minister's and the Government's attention the fact that when employment generation must be the major priority and when the incentive to work should be encouraged, these levels of PRSI levies in addition to the levels of taxation which we are dealing with are having the opposite effect. Especially as far as employers' contributions are concerned in labour-intensive industries, employers are constantly pointing out that the tax system is acting as a disincentive against employment. Moneys invested in equipment, from <Col N="488" /> office equipment, wallpaper, chairs, tables, typewriters and computers to capital equipment generally, get very considerable tax breaks to the extent that the ratio between £100 invested in equipment and £100 that will have to be invested in extra employment is as 2:1 against investment in employment.  That is a very serious distortion in our system which encourages investment in equipment against investment in employment when clearly the needs of the economy must focus above all else on generating employment particularly in the labour-intensive industries, and they are fairly obvious to all.  Incidentally, most of those are the old, Irish based, domestic industries including the construction industry which has taken a very severe hammering from this Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to try to persuade the Minister to review this approach.  I have argued for that constantly in the House in the course of the budget debate and I have been making statements on it publicly over the last two and a half years.  I saw the trends.  Nonetheless, I see no response up to this point from the Minister to get rid of discrimination against labour costs in favour of equipment costs. That is vital to the State.  Let me take in conjunction with it the legislation which was introduced about 1976 by a then Labour Minister &mdash; and I note that the Labour Deputies are still absent from this House.  Is any one of them going to come in at any time to make a contribution on this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, because we are discussing the Bill and apparently the Labour Party have no interest in discussing it in any event.  I wish they had.  What prompted me down that track &mdash; it will not happen again &mdash; was the fact that a former Labour Minister who is now a member of the Fine Gael Party introduced legislation about 1976 the intention of which was to promote and protect the interests of employees.  I am talking about the unfair dismissals legislation and so on.  When you take the present day impact of that legislation with the levels of PRSI contributions that employers have to pay, the consequence is that employers in every direction they turn take the view that taking on extra employment is (a) too costly and (b) too restrictive in terms of their rights at another stage, say in two years time, if they find that they need to take action to reduce their employment force and will not be allowed to do so.  In some cases they may feel that even where there has been improper conduct they will not be in a position to do so unless they go through all of the procedures of the unfair dismissals tribunal.  I am not arguing against that, but I am saying to the Minister <Col N="490" /> that because of the impact of both of those factors I am sure that most Deputies in this House have been made aware by many employers who might consider expanding their total employment that they are not prepared to do it.  They find that the labour cost as a proportion of what their total tax contribution would be under corporation tax for employers is now four times what it was about 1964 or 1965.  Deputy Mac Giolla may have a reasonable point in saying that that total tax contribution is nothing like what it might be in comparison with PAYE.  Our tax code, our PRSI code associated and allied with other matters is in the event being seen by employers as a clear signal against taking on extra employment.  I would like the Minister to reflect seriously on this.  In respect of the employers' contribution which I have been allowed to argue, this is not covered in this Bill.  It is probably a matter for social welfare legislation, but the two are interlinked.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I must sympathise with what Deputy Mac Giolla is arguing.  I anticipate that the Minister would not be able to respond to the case in view of the cost involved.  If the Minister cannot respond to the case being made by Deputy Mac Giolla, he might consider at least restoring the level of the PRSI allowance for PAYE taxpayers to what it was in 1981 which, in money terms, would be considerably less having regard to inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Deputy Mac Giolla wished to make another intervention. The cost of the retention of the allowance at the present level, £286, provided for in the Bill would be roughly £55 million this year and £91 million in a full year, and we are already making provision for that in the Bill.  Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment would add a further <Col N="491" /> £15.6 million to the cost in 1985 and £26 million in a full year.  Again on cost grounds alone I am afraid the amendment could not be accepted.  The equivalent today of the £312 level in 1982 would be about £396.  This means that Deputy Mac Giolla's proposals would amount to an updating of the allowance on that basis. However, I am not sure it is valid to argue about this allowance in that way.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what many people and many Members of this House argue, social security contributions in Ireland are not high compared with other EC countries or the wider group of OECD countries.  If we compare our total social security contributions to GDP, the 1982 figures would rank Ireland in seventeenth place out of 21.  Our social security contributions would represent 5.95 per cent of GDP; the EC average is 11.88 per cent, almost double our level, and the OECD average is 9.18 per cent, but the OECD area includes countries which have more comprehensively developed systems than we have as well as countries with less developed systems.  If we compare social security contributions to total revenue, again we rank seventeenth out of 21, with a percentage of just over 15 per cent compared to an average of 29 per cent for the EC as a whole.  On that comparison, our social security contributions are only half as important in the context of total revenue as they are in the EC generally. As Deputy O'Kennedy recognised, our contributions to the operation of the social insurance system do not cover the full costs.  Speaking from memory, I think the latest calculation made is that the contributions cover about 78 per cent of the cost and the Exchequer provides the remaining 22 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the result of a number of factors and Deputy O'Kennedy is just picking one of them.  The fact remains that in comparison with many other countries with which we trade our level of social security contributions is not high; <Col N="492" /> in fact it is rather low, and the contributions do not cover the full cost of the system.  Bearing those factors in mind and the financial angle to which I referred a few moments ago, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that our level of payments of social security are not high by European standards, and I am not advocating an overall reduction in benefits.  We believe we should be looking for an increase in jobs and incomes which would result in an increase in contributions and an increase in benefits.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the argument the Minister trots out every time about the cost to the Exchequer.  He has not told us why the lowest income group should be penalised to save the Exchequer money when other income groups are not penalised to make up the deficit of £55 million, £95 million or £105 million.  That is not an argument if he is allowing people with higher incomes to get away without paying the contributions which would bring in that money.  He must base his argument on why he thinks it is right that the lowest income groups who do not have sufficient income for even the Minister for Finance, who grabs at everything, to suggest that they pay income tax. These people must pay the highest rates of PRSI despite the fact that their income is so low that they are not paying income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent report of the ESRI on this question recognised that the PRSI system still hits the poorest hardest while virtually sparing the rich.  It goes on to say that revenue could be maintained while relieving the lower paid by abolishing the upper earning limits on which PRSI is levied and by exempting from PRSI those who are already exempt from income tax.  These are specifically the people in the lower income groups that the Minister should bend his mind to and argue why he thinks the present system should exist rather than an alternative system where they would be paying very low rates or nothing at all while others pay higher rates.  He should argue for one <Col N="493" /> system as against another and not say we cannot do this because it will cost the Exchequer so much.</P>
    <P>I would go along with Deputy O'Kennedy that at least the Minister should consider restoring the allowance to the £312 which existed three or four years ago, whatever the cost to the Exchequer. He should make whatever adjustments are necessary to make sure that the cost to the Exchequer does not occur, but we are arguing that the £386 allowance, which was a reduction from a previously existing allowance, should be increased. I ask the Minister to put his arguments for not doing that rather than using the argument about the cost to the Exchequer. The whole basis of the Finance Bill is in regard to income to the Exchequer and every allowance costs so much.  That should not be part of the Minister's argument. Let him argue this system as against another one which would bring in the same amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not attempt to present the argument the Minister may want to present to Deputy Mac Giolla, but I may present some facts which the Minister might use against any suggestions from me or Deputy Mac Giolla.  I was in government when this formula was introduced and the late Ceann Comhairle of this House, Deputy Joe Brennan, was then Minister for Social Welfare.  He mentioned to his colleagues in Government that the fund was so buoyant that he had a surplus available which he could lend to other Departments on attractive terms.  It was self-financing then and was intended to remain so.  The level of unemployment was very low and a greater number of people were at work contributing towards the necessary benefits for those out of work either through unemployment or ill health.  That was the position which obtained up to the late seventies.  Because we had an adequate number at work we could keep down the level of the PRSI imposition on the lower paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would endorse what Deputy Mac Giolla said about the ESRI report.  The poorest are the hardest hit.  The employers' <Col N="494" /> contribution actively discourages employment.  As unemployment continues to grow and the figures are of the order of 230,000, excluding 30,000 involved in various schemes&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining why the level of PRSI is as high as it is and why the Minister cannot make adjustments bringing back the level to what it was even three years ago.  It is because unemployment is so high, and until that problem is tackled the revenue implications will be such that he will not be able to respond to the case made.  The diminishing numbers at work are having to support a system where more and more people are out of work.  It is not a self-financing scheme.  The taxpayer is having to contribute to the financing of this fund to a greater extent with each passing year. The level of taxation is itself the problem. It is a disincentive to employment, leading to greater unemployment and a greater burden on those who are contributing. This vicious circle will continue until we tackle the problem of the level of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the taxation aspects of the Finance Bill and specifically about the PRSI allowance.  I would be exceeding my brief if I were to deal in more than a passing fashion with the generality of this scheme.  To increase the allowance in the way proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla would not be of any assistance to those PRSI contributors who are not in the tax net.  An increase in the allowance is of no value to somebody who does not have a tax liability.  That same increase in the allowance would benefit people further up the income scale.  The amendment is not well designed to meet the concern.  Deputy Mac Giolla has expressed.  He went on to suggest some changes in the structure of the social insurance contribution scheme.  He suggested that we should exempt from contributions those who do not have a <Col N="495" /> tax liability and that we should bring into liability for social insurance contributions those who have higher incomes.  I would suggest that Deputy Mac Giolla might think it out a little further and look at the implications for the eligibility of contributors for benefits.  While the scheme is not directly comparable to any other insurance policy, it still has the character of an insurance payment against a risk that might arise in the future.  Deputy Mac Giolla has not thought out the logic of this suggestion.  It is perfectly legitimate to point to the Exchequer implications of an amendment such as this because the contributions do not cover the total cost of the payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is a typically technical one which we pass each year without having the implications of the section properly teased out.  Our tax law consists of having various headings and schedules of income which are treated in a different way for tax purposes whether in relation to the year in which the income falls to be taxed, on an actual basis or a <Col N="497" /> preceding year basis and also in relation to the type of expenses allowed against the income in question.</P>
      <P>The traditional position has been that under the Income Tax Acts and under case law the courts decide under what schedule income falls for tax purposes. This section brings about a radical and fundamental change.  The net effect of the section is that the courts are being usurped and it is up to the inspectors of taxes to decide that income which the courts might decide would fall into one category should fall into a category designed by them.</P>
      <P>Whatever the Minister's intention is in bringing in this section it tips the balance very much against the taxpayer and, to an unfair extent, in favour of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the position of people who have different portions of their income falling to be treated in different ways.  The section of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which is to be amended by this section applies the PAYE system of tax deduction to all emoluments from an office or employment assessible to tax under Schedule E.  It makes some specific exceptions to that.  The accepted ones are ones in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners have notified the <Col N="498" /> employer that they are emoluments to which it is impracticable to employ the PAYE provisions or that they are emoluments which are or which will be taken into account in computing the profits or gains of a profession.  I propose to provide that from 1986-87 emoluments will be excluded from the operation of PAYE only where the operation of PAYE is impracticable having regard to the circumstances of the office or employment or to the amount of the emoluments.  As from that year the inspector of taxes will have the statutory authority to decide whether emoluments should be so excluded from the operation of PAYE.</P>
    <P>That amendment takes account of the reality of the present position where while the nominal authority is that of the Revenue Commissioners that authority, in practice, is exercised by the inspectors. I am also providing that emoluments excluded from the PAYE system by exclusion orders made in the past may be brought within the system if a change in circumstances would warrant a change in treatment.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to cast any aspersion on the Minister or his predecessors. All I am saying is that the time available to us to debate the Finance Bill is insufficient to tease out all the technical implications of the various provisions. Perhaps it should be done in a different way.  The Minister should not conclude from my remarks that I am attacking him personally.  My original comments still stand.  The categories into which income falls should not be a matter for the inspector or the Revenue Commissioners but the courts.  They can adjudicate and balance the situation as between revenue on the one side and the taxpayer on the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision, which proposes to grant relief from income tax in respect of certain income derived from the leasing of agricultural land.  My party have been trying to encourage greater mobility in land tenure to ensure maximum productivity. I can see why there are certain limitations imposed on the people who qualify.  The income is derived for a period of not less than seven years, but to qualify for the exemption the lessor must be aged 55 years or more or be permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider the age limitation.  What we all want to ensure is that agricultural land will be in the hands of those best equipped to get maximum productivity from it and encourage those who are not equipped either through age, infirmity or lack of ability to farm, to lease their land.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to oppose this section. The Minister should give serious consideration to the age limit of 55 years and over.  Many farmers younger than 55 years are not able to get an adequate income from their farm holding.  In some instances they may have reasonably substantial farm holdings.  The Minister must have some experience of this in his constituency as I have in mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not everyone who inherits land can get the maximum return from farming.  We should encourage mobility of land and the transfer of land from those who are not getting the maximum return.  I do not see why we should exclude above 55 years of age.  Many single people could benefit greatly if they transferred their land because they have not got the capacity as farmers to get the maximum return from their land.  What the Minister is proposing is a step in the right direction.  We all support this kind of development.  Any <Col N="500" /> age limit has to be arbitrary.  I know that we can make a measured judgment and decide that at 55 years of age a person's physical capacity to work is reducing somewhat.  The same could apply at 50 or 45 years of age.  In some cases it could apply at 40 years or less.  The intention is to encourage people to transfer land to others who could make better use of it. Why does the Minister see a need to introduce an age limit?</P>
    <P>Subject to that I support this proposal. It is very much in line with the thinking of all parties for some time.  Now that the Land Commission are being abolished it will be very important.  I will not get into a debate on the Land Commission.  I have strong views about that.  It is very important to encourage much greater mobility of land tenure than we have at the moment.  Perhaps the Minister would let me have his observations on my comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Kennedy I welcome section 10.  I welcome any concession.  I have been speaking to members of various farming organisations in my constituency about this matter over the weekend.  A great deal of disappointment was expressed by them about the restrictions under which the concession given in section 10 will have to operate.  First, there is the fact that the lease must cover a period of seven years. It was pointed out to me by both farming organisations in my constituency that, in the present state of uncertainty, people are most unwilling to have their land tied up for seven years.  That is too long.  A three year period was recommended by the County Limerick IFA.  That would be far more appropriate in the present uncertain economic circumstances, particularly in the farming sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the ceiling of £2,000 was also brought to my attention.  In my part of the country and in Deputy O'Kennedy's part of the country, £2,000 would represent the letting of 18 acres of farm land for a full year.  As the Minister knows, in the vast majority of cases <Col N="501" /> where people let their farm, their entire holding, which is what the Minister envisages, they are letting an amount of land substantially in excess of 18 acres.</P>
    <P>The age limit of 55 years or over is also a severe handicap to the proper operation of this legislation.  The reality is that many people wish to get out of farming even on a temporary basis for various reasons: social reasons, psychological reasons or financial reasons, for example, where a cattle herd has been affected by disease or due to some other financial constraint. In those circumstances it seems ludicrous that relief should be confined to people aged 55 years and over.</P>
    <P>The only people under 55 years who can qualify for the relief are those so permanently incapacitated by mental or physical disability that they are totally unable to carry on farming again.  That restriction is far too severe.  If the Minister is serious, he will look at this again with a view to easing it.  If I understand the intention behind the section, it is that land should be handed over to more productive farmers.  We are leaving out of account the international position.  Due to the failure of the Minister for Agriculture in Brussels the market for the produce of more productive farmers is narrowing.  If the Minister feels this section will result in massive transfers of land from non-productive farmers to more productive farmers, I am afraid he is doomed to disappointment.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the sort of measures introduced by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice and other members of the Government over the past two and a half years.  They get a good idea from someone, sell themselves as implementing the idea, and hedge it in with so many restrictions that, in effect, it is quite useless and unworkable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>From what Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Dea have said it appears that they agree that the purpose of the section is not simply to give an across-the-board tax relief for lessors of farm land.  That is not the intention.  It has a much more specific aim, that is, to <Col N="502" /> assist in mobilising land which is not being fully used.</P>
      <P>Deputies will agree that the greater part of under-utilised land is held by older people.  In most cases&mdash;and this is true in my own constituency, in Deputy O'Kennedy's and in part of Deputy O'Dea's&mdash;where you find under-utilised land, you tend to find that the owner is a fairly elderly person, or possibly a fairly elderly married couple who for a variety of reasons no longer have the capacity or the interest to really develop the land. For that reason I pitched an age limit on it.  I agree that 55 years is an arbitrary limit.  That would cover the majority of cases where there is serious under-utilisation of land.  It does not cover them all. I am perfectly prepared to agree with that.  I do not intend to make this section an across-the-board relief for income derived from the letting of land.</P>
      <P>On the question of incapacity the notion of incapacity will be interpreted very widely.  I do not intend that it will be limited to simple physical incapacity. For example, a widow with family commitments who is not able to run the farm would be defined as coming within the terms of incapacity.  A child under 18 years of age would equally be considered to come within the concept of incapacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I have a feeling that we could end up with a three page section if we were to try to cover all those cases.  I would far perfer to be able to use judgmentº and flexibility in deciding on cases of incapacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the leasing period is concerned, I appreciate the concern of Deputies on the other side of the House. From one point of view we can say that seven years is rather a long period.  I am quite sure Deputies opposite are familar with the kind of case where the owner of <Col N="503" /> land aged 65, 66 or 70 years may be reluctant to enter into a lease for a period as long as seven years.  When we get to that age many of us do not bank on too many things being within our control for a full period of seven years into the future.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we must have regard to the position of the person who is leasing the land.  It is accepted generally that our aim is to mobilise land into the hands of younger trained farmers who would be able to develop it.  We all know that there are substantial costs involved in developing land.  Land that has been under-utilised for a period requires a fair amount of work usually to put it into full production potential.  One would have difficulty in conceiving of a situation in which the person taking the land would consider himself in a position to enter into the kinds of commitments that would be required to develop the land properly if the period was as short as three years. Perhaps even a period of five years would present difficulties in that respect.  Therefore, I consider a period of seven years to be the minimum for which the lessee would need to have some kind of guarantee of control of the land before he would be prepared to undertake any significant amount of development.</P>
    <P>In a sense there is a conflict of interests here.  One could argue from the point of view of the lessor that the shorter the period the more attractive the idea of letting the land, while from the point of view of the lessee the shorter the period the less attractive the leasing becomes. With those kinds of considerations in mind we have fixed the figure at seven years.</P>
    <P>The exemption is a separate relief of up to £2,000 in respect of letting income. It is conceivable that for the kinds of people who would be letting land, that relief would be available in addition to other reliefs, for example, reliefs in respect of age exemptions.  These could apply in a number of the cases we discussed yesterday.  Other reliefs, too, that are already in the tax system could apply to the income, so in any case we are not <Col N="504" /> talking simply about a relief of £2,000. Therefore, the total picture is not nearly as restrictive as Deputy O'Dea seems to think it is.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the length of the lease, it would be useful if Deputies opposite would consider the other side of the coin, the person who is leasing the land.  He should be in a position to develop the land and think about the period of the lease from that angle also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Minister has said in endeavouring to explain and justify the provisions, I would point out that first he would require to amend the legislation.  I say this because in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 10, the provision is confined clearly to people aged 55 or upwards or to people who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity and who are consequently not capable of carrying on the trade of farming.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he will ensure the provision will apply to widows who are too busy looking after their children to be able to carry on farming, but the Minister cannot apply the provision to widows as the Bill stands.  No court could possibly interpret the section as applying to widows in the circumstances I have outlined.  It would be open to anyone to bring a declaration of proceedings before the courts to ensure that the provisions as passed by the Oireachtas are being implemented.  I appreciate that to achieve the intention is not always in legal terminology as it might appear but to meet the intentions of the Minister as indicated in respect of widows with young families the legislation would have to be changed.  Therefore, the Minister should consult again in that connection with his officials and with the parliamentary draftsmen.</P>
      <P>The Minister has analysed the case we have made but has not answered it conclusively. I wish to make it clear that we are in support of this general principle. Deputy O'Dea has honed in more precisely than I have done on some of the limitations which by definition, when beginning something, must be arbitrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> However, I have not been convinced by the case the Minister is making as to the selection of these limitations.</P>
    <P>I assure him that we would not propose either that there be total exemption from all moneys derived under the provision, because clearly that would have a built-in inequity in respect of a person who was in full health and so on and who was letting land but who had another source of income.  But as Deputy O'Dea has pointed out, we are talking about the letting value of perhaps 18 acres of land. That is too low.  The Minister for Agriculture must be getting the same feedback as we are getting from the farming organisations&mdash;though that is not to say that whatever they advocate is to become either the position of the Minister or of this party&mdash;but in conjunction with them and with the advisory services the direction being proposed was higher than the limit of £2,000.  I am not suggesting what the limit should be, but I would have thought that for a start £3,000 would have been more reasonable.</P>
    <P>So far as the period of seven years is concerned, I accept that one must take account also of the lessee.  However, the lessee will have his rights within the terms of the lease in any event.  He will be protected by those rights, so I would have thought that a five year lease would have been reasonable, even having regard to the cycle of production in farming and to the necessary development in terms of fertilising, drainage and so on.  But I cannot claim to be an expert in this area other than in terms of what I have observed from representing a rural constituency for more than 20 years and living in it for somewhat longer.  I would consider the seven year period to be somewhat arbitrary.</P>
    <P>No matter what figures any Minister for Finance brought in here, it would always be open to the Opposition spokesman to say that they were incorrect. However, I hope in this case that we have argued convincingly that the Minister's figures here are too limited.  The age limit is particularly arbitrary.  Deputy O'Dea has put his finger on something quite important, because I know of a number <Col N="506" /> of farmers in their late thirties or forties who want to get out of farming.  Are we not anxious to encourage these?  It is a very good means of livelihood for those who are both interested and able.  There may be very many at present who cannot get employment in our towns and cities and would be very happy to turn with a new drive and purpose to farming.  Equally, there are some in farming&mdash;and not such a small number&mdash;who are not suited to the whole farm activity and they are not all over 55 years of age, either. Regrettably, I know quite a number of such.</P>
    <P>I recall visiting the ACOT offices in my town of Nenagh some time back and having discussions about the level of productivity in agriculture.  Without wanting to quote the figures, I must say that I was appalled at their measure of the low productivity generally, in terms of the percentage breakdown in the farm population. There are many under 55 years of age who are not capable of generating sufficient income for themselves, much less for their families, even sometimes on 50 or 60 acres of adjusted land.  It is a fact that the more their commitments to the bank from investing, particularly in machinery, for the purpose of increasing their productivity the greater a burden the greater acreage becomes.  It is not always a measure just of how much land they have.  Quite frankly, it is a measure of their capacity to farm whatever land they have in as intensive a way as possible.</P>
    <P>In the light of that, we should encourage the advisory and educational services in the agricultural field to make every farmer as modern, well equipped and in tune with the needs and potential of today as anyone engaged in any other activity. The farmer is managing a very important enterprise which has a capacity for productivity, provided we create the market outlets&mdash;and I shall be tabling an amendment later in that regard.  However, we are not doing that.  I welcome this move, which is in the right direction and is more than a small step.  However, we might have taken a bigger step, and I hope that the Minister, on reflection, could <Col N="507" /> consider an amendment on Report Stage, after consultation with his colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, when that Minister comes home&mdash;and I am not making any comment on his absence because that job has to be done, also&mdash; and with the other representative organisations to see if he can make some further adjustment.</P>
    <P>This is the first year.  I hope that the Minister or his successor&mdash;and we shall not take any bets at this stage&mdash;on the next Finance Bill will have at least an open mind as to extending the range of this section, if the Minister cannot extend it on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a few comments on this section, which are in relation to the qualifying lessor.  As the Minister and everybody else connected with farming is, no doubt, aware, many farmers are wiped out by the effects of brucellosis and TB outbreaks.  Some of these have to take outside jobs.  I have known such cases of people who have done so to build up their farm stock again and who have let their land in the meantime. In a particular case of hardship, would the Minister consider it possible to include such people within this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every intention of bringing in the 1986 Bill, I can assure the Deputy.  On the points which were raised, coming back to the income situation, the exemption of £2,000 must be considered in the light of some cases.  Take at the moment a farmer who may or may not be in the tax net as a farmer.  If he or she decides, following this provision, to let the whole farm and has no other profession but has the income from the letting <Col N="508" /> of the land, that person would fall to be taxed on the total of that income, which would be the only income.  That person would then be entitled to the operation of, for example, the normal exemption limit in that case.  For a married person under 65 years of age there is an exemption of £5,300, which we discussed recently.  One can add the new exemption of £2,000, so that with a total of £7,300 that person, as a result of the operation of this provision, would be outside the tax net.  In the case of older people, there would be a different age exemption limit to be added on.  In most cases we are not talking about a simple amount of £2,000. We could be talking about quite a bit more, and, therefore, not talking about the 18 fertile acres in North Tipperary but quite a bit more.  Taking that into account, this is quite a generous relief which will certainly constitute an encouragement for the kind of activity we have in mind.</P>
      <P>In relation to the definition of the qualifying lessor, at the top of page 13 of the text of the Bill, subparagraph 1 specifies that a qualifying lessor is an individual who is of the age of 55 years or upwards or who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from carrying on a trade of farming.  I can assure Deputy O'Kennedy that the kind of interpretation I want to give to that incapacity is perfectly capable of being comprehended&mdash;this mental or physical infirmity can simply be that the person concerned is not capable of doing the work which is required to carry out the business of farming.  It is with that in mind that we will be implementing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the period of release, we have exchanged all considerations on that.  I have been considering this for some time and have a relatively open mind as to the period of the lease.  However, I am concerned to make sure that the person who takes the land will be assured of having it for a period long enough to make it worthwhile to engage in development. We are all agreed that a period of three years would not suit.  I would think a period of five years would also be a little short, particularly when talking of <Col N="509" /> somebody who is, for example, building up a dairy herd or a beef operation.</P>

Perhaps we can then come back to the matter and round off our discussion on this point.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question raised in relation to cases of hardship, I do not think this is an appropriate context in which to deal with those cases of hardship.  If in a particular case the person who has that serious problem falls within the definitions given here, then the use of the section will be open to him.  I do not think I would tailor the section to suit people who might have a case of hardship, because that is not the intention of the section.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that he will look at the matter between now and Report Stage, and that I accept. I would say to him that what he said with regard to the legal interpretation of a person incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from carrying on a trade in farming cannot be correct.  There is no court that could extend that interpretation to a widow who is busy looking after her young family.  That is not included in the definition of mental or physical infirmity.  It would be attaching a new disability to widows that has never been determined by any court.  If it is the Minister's intention to include such people, there must be some way the parliamentary draftsman can find a provision to include it.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister's intention in the matter but I have heard judges say many times that what is said in the Dáil is not of any consequence to them.  They say that their role is to interpret.  They do not look for a copy of the Official Report. They say that their role is to apply the law as passed by the Oireachtas and if the intentions are not expressed properly in the law that is too bad.</P>

It is a long established principle in the courts that so far as questions of interpretation of law are concerned this House has no relevance. If the Minister wants to ensure that the widow be mentioned is brought within the section, I ask him to consider this matter very carefully between now and Report Stage.  He cannot ensure what the courts will do.  The use of the word &ldquo;infirmity&rdquo; really ties it down.  The word &ldquo;infirm&rdquo; has a commonly accepted meaning.

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 33 and 34, to delete &ldquo;5th day of April, 1986&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1st day of July, 1985&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here we are back to the famous temporary income levy which the Minister introduced in his first budget in 1983. Obviously it has become a little more than temporary; it has become a permanent feature of our income tax legislation. This was an extra measure that was dreamed up to raise extra money for the Exchequer.  The levy was not stated to be for any specific purpose.  We already have the youth employment levy of 1 per cent. Last night and the previous night we had a debate here on the effectiveness of that kind of operation and the work of the various agencies who are tripping over each other but who are not producing permanent employment at the end of the day.  However, the youth employment levy at least had a purpose which does not apply in this case.  This is just an income levy to raise more money for the revenue and, as such, we have always been opposed and will always oppose it. We can demonstrate to the Minister that it is having a very undesirable effect.</P>
      <P>Employers have so many extra costs to meet that they are not encouraged to take on extra labour.  This extra 1 per cent is not just the straw that broke the camel's back.  By this time the camel's back is already broken but what the Minister is doing will ensure that the old camel will never get on his feet again, even supposing his back were to be healed in some miraculous way.  I appeal to the Minister to review his position with regard to this levy.  I know the answer will be that because of the revenue implications the Minister cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> This levy is projected to bring in £77 million this year.</P>
    <P>When a Minister brings in some measure here and tells us it will be temporary, he should tell us how temporary it will be.  Otherwise let him say it will be a permanent feature of our tax and then everyone will know where they stand. We were told this levy would be temporary, that it was introduced to cope with difficult problems the Minister encountered in 1983, but now is the time for him to come clean with the House and the public and to tell us just how temporary is that levy.  In any event we are opposed to it in principle.</P>
    <P>There are some worrying features in relation to this temporary levy.  The outturn for 1984 was £78.2 million and the post-budget estimate for 1985 is £77 million, namely, £1.2 million less than 1984. Does not that clearly argue that instead of increased income which one normally gets from any levy or tax, what we are seeing here is that we have reached the stage of diminishing returns because of the extent of the various levies.  I realise we may be told that certain people will be exempt but that is a feature of every Finance Bill; in fact, the exemptions have often been far more generous than what the Minister has conceded this year. When the projections for next year even in money terms show that there will be £1.2 million less&mdash;in real terms that is at least £10 million less than last year&mdash; the question must be asked why that is the case.  The obvious answer has to be that there are fewer people gainfully employed, that there are fewer people self-employed, who can contribute to this income levy.  There are fewer people generating income on which the levy can be imposed.  One of the reasons there are fewer is that the levy itself is penalising them, this plus the tax levels, and preventing them from generating income either by way of employees or employers. As it was in the beginning with us, is now and always will be, we are opposed to this.  We said it then and our case has been proved.  If the trend continues and the Minister maintains the 1 per cent it will be a little bit like the PRSI, he will <Col N="513" /> get less again in 1986.  Please God, his successor will be able to do the right thing in 1987, when all of these levies introduced for tax purposes hopefully will be abolished.</P>
    <P>My amendment does not propose the abolition of the levy for all of this year. We must take into account what has already been yielded, and that must amount to a fair bit in this tax year.  The tax forms have already been issued.  It would take some time to send out new forms taking into account the elimination of this levy.  It is for that reason that I propose that we substitute the first day of July 1985 so that the levy could continue to be collected on a monthly basis up to the end of June 1985 and cease thereafter.  In that way at least the Minister would have something to add to the revenue coffers, perhaps approximately one third of the whole figure he projects for 1985.  Ideally we would seek its abolition but we are moving to a position of acknowledging that at this stage of the year that is not feasible.  It is for that reason I propose that it would terminate with effect from 1 July next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Not much can be said on this levy except what has already been said, that it is a most inequitable form of taxation, representing a percentage taxation on gross income.  While there are exemption limits in operation, these apply to gross income and, as far as the general public are concerned, it is take home pay that counts.  Even taking these exemption limits into account the Minister will still be taking a 1 per cent levy from people who will be exempt from income tax.  Its deduction is not at all based on any question of income tax allowances etc.  There might be some justification were it based on people's ability to pay, as is income tax.  Rather one pays on one's gross income before PRSI or any other taxation allowances are taken into account.  For that reason it constitutes a tax that no Minister for Finance can justify as being a fair or just method of taxation.  Rather it is a simple method of bringing in an extra £70 million <Col N="514" /> or £80 million to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>When I suggested last year that it was a simple matter for a Minister, in grave need of money, to impose a 2 per cent levy the following year and double his take on that without any cognisance of whether it was equitable, the Minister became very annoyed.  I continued to say then that if there was a 10 per cent levy proposed no Minister for Finance could justify that.  It is justified because it is 1 per cent only, in the hope that people will not notice it; that is the concept of this taxation system.  People accepted this youth employment levy; there was no outcry against it.  People were generous, seeing the need to do something for young people, for their children and their future.  They were prepared to give some of their income to this purpose, not that it has been very successful as far as youth employment is concerned.</P>
      <P>Following its success then the Minister for Finance saw the possibility&mdash;without giving any thought to it or its complications&mdash;of imposing another levy to yield money to the Exchequer.  People resent this so-called temporary income levy much more than the youth employment levy.  It constitutes a gross burden on people already over-burdened with personal taxation.  The fact that its deduction is on gross income renders it more inequitable.  I know the Minister would contend that its abolition would mean so much loss to the Exchequer.  Nevertheless, if the Minister has any concept of equity or fairness in the taxation system he would abolish this extra 1 per cent income tax.  No Commission on Taxation, no Minister for Finance can justify it as being equitable or fair.  He can justify it only in terms of its yielding so much money to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of this argument has been advanced before, when it was first introduced, but we discover that the temporary levy is extended.  Last year the Minister for Finance made the point: well, it has to be brought in each year and that will afford Deputies an opportunity of making the same points next year.  This is precisely what we are doing.  There is the one argument <Col N="515" /> only to be made against it, that it constitutes a totally inequitable system of taxation, grossly unjust and, for that reason, we oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputies O'Kennedy and Mac Giolla, that this income levy constitutes a very crude instrument of taxation.  There have been various references on all sides of the House to the Report of the Commission on Taxation.  We all agree with most of the basic propositions advanced in that report.  One of the most fundamental principles referred to by the commission, and agreed by all of us, is that there should be equity in the tax system.  A levy of this type is of its very nature inequitable and unjust.  It is rendered even more so by the fact that it is not deductible from a person's gross income for tax purposes.  Take the average PAYE taxpayer's gross income; there is imposed thereon a 1 per cent levy, leaving him with 99 per cent.  However, PAYE and PRSI are imposed on the full 100 per cent.  In other words, that person is being taxed two ways under the PAYE and PRSI system on income which he does not receive at all.  God knows the rates of PAYE and PRSI are sufficiently high on a person's actual income not to talk about taxing him on income which he does not receive.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the fact that this income levy was supposed to be a temporary measure.  Nevertheless we see the spectacle every year of the Minister for Finance inserting a section into the Finance Bill to continue its imposition for another year.  I would ask the Minister to come clean and tell us whether this income levy will be a permanent feature or, if it is to be temporary, to give us some indication&mdash;more importantly the hard pressed public&mdash;when it will end; how temporary or how permanent will it be.  We should have the answer to that in the public interest.  The public are asking us and we are here only as agents of the public.  Will this be the last year of its imposition or can we expect it imposed again next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> There are a few specific questions relating to this on which I should like the Minister to comment.  It is proposed in the Government document <i>Building on Reality</i> to introduce a land tax for farmers. It is also envisaged that farmers to whom the land tax would apply would not be liable to income tax.  How is it proposed that the income of these farmers will be measured for the purposes of the imposition of the levy?  Are these farmers to be expected to employ an accountant to measure their taxable income for the purposes of knowing on how much they will pay the 1 per cent levy?</P>
    <P>In relation to the technical provisions for the levy, apparently the situation is that if a person's income is £102 a week or less he is not liable but if his income is in excess of that, for instance if his income is £103 a week, he is liable to the 1 per cent levy on the total sum.  What would be the situation where an employer wants to pay an employee £6,000 per annum which is just under £120 a week, can be get around the levy to some extent by paying him £102 a week for 50 weeks and £450 a week for the last two weeks?  If that is done the income levy to be paid will be £9 whereas in the normal way if the person was being paid £120 a week, the levy would be £60.  More importantly, how temporary is this levy?  Is it to be a permanent feature of our income tax system?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that we have had full time temporary postmen for the past 40 years.  This temporary income levy if falling into the same category as the full time temporary postman. Deputies O'Dea, Mac Giolla and O'Kennedy have stressed that the Government have been telling the people over the last number of years that this was temporary.  Once it goes into the income tax law, as far as I can see, it will not be removed.  I am interested to hear the Minister's reply in relation to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an inequitable levy.  It affects everybody whether or not people are liable to income tax once their income <Col N="517" /> is over £102 a week.  This is a strange provision coming from a Government who profess to be concerned about equity in the taxation system.  Farmers who prepare accounts are liable to the levies on their profits before capital allowances. Other businesses under schedule D are allowed to deduct capital allowances and are liable to the levies on their income after that.  Why has the Minister made a distinction between farmers and others? This is a cruel system of taxation, a way of getting badly needed money as I am sure the Minister will acknowledge in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy O'Kennedy's point about revenue from the levy, as he pointed out reading from my budget statement and the connected tables, the provisional outturn for 1984 is £78 million and the forecast yield for 1985 is £77 million.  Deputy O'Kennedy then rushed on to draw the conclusion that that meant that we were into a situation of diminishing returns, a subject about which he talks without really understanding the concept.  The £78 million for 1984 included a carry over of £4 million from 1983 so that the clear revenue for 1984 was £74 million which we would then compare with the forecast of £77 million for 1985.  The amendment before us will abolish the levy with effect from 1 July next, involving a cost of £28 million in 1985 and £63 million in a full year.  That will have to be compensated for in some other way.</P>
      <P>Following the discussions we had here last year on the same question I have been looking at the kind of things that Deputies opposite might be inclined to propose if we were to replace that income by some other means.  We could, for example put a surcharge of 3.6 per cent on all the present rates of income tax or we could reduce the allowances by £280 for a married couple of £140 for a single person.  I do not believe these measures would commend themselves to Deputies opposite.  In the absence of any specific proposals as to how we would replace the revenue there is not as strong a case for their amendment as they seem to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> I am providing for a continuation of the levy for 1985-86 but with an increase in the level of exemptions for those on low incomes.  For those paid weekly the exemption goes from £96 to £102&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is less than inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and correspondingly, forthnightly or monthly payments for those paid annually, that is where income is not solely from employment, the exemption goes up to £5,300 from £5,000 which it was for 1984-85.  Unless I am very much mistaken an increase from £5,000 to £5,300 is a 6 per cent increase, which is the same as the projected inflation rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy agrees with me, as he seemed to be indicating that it is less than inflation.  The expected inflation over the period in question is likely to be less than 6 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputies O'Dea, Mac Giolla and in fact all Deputies asked &ldquo;if this levy is temporary, when will it come to an end?&rdquo; That is a fair question.  This will be the third year of the operation of the levy.  In the second year of the operation of the levy I exempted people at the lower end of the scale.  I improved that exemption this year, so that for substantial numbers of people I have terminated the operation of the levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We pointed out in paragraph 6.8 of the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> that our intention is to phase it out as soon as resources permit.  I will not be more specific at the moment, nor can I be more specific.  The levy will come up for re-consideration every year in the preparation of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked how it is pro- <Col N="519" /> posed to apply the levy to farmers once the farm tax system comes into operation. I do not know; it is not an issue that has yet been considered.  The Deputy also asked in the case of somebody whose income is around £ 6,000 per annum, could his employer get around the levy? I am sure that Deputy O'Dea does not expect me to suggest in the House a means of getting around anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no comment beyond saying that it appears that Deputy O'Dea has the glimmer of an idea. Deputy Ahern claims that nothing goes away once it gets into tax law.  I think I have quoted him correctly.  That is not true.  Quite a few provisions of previously existing tax law have been abolished over the last couple of years.  Deputies on the other side of the House have agreed with some of them and not agreed with others, but tax law is not as immutable as the Deputy seems to think.  As I have said, the Government intend to remove the levy as soon as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from being reassured by the Minister that the Government intend, as laid out in that famous document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987,</i> to phase it out as soon as resources permit, if he thinks that is a reassurance to anybody he is fooling himself. The Government's interpretation of phasing out things has taken on a new meaning.  Remember they were going to phase out the current budget deficit, and they phased that out by increasing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all, but the Minister has referred to an interpretation. You phase out a budget deficit by increasing it, you reduce taxation by increasing it and you reduce unemployment by increasing it.  Those are the kind of things that are in that document.  The <Col N="520" /> Minister must have had an input into that document.  He uses the same phrase when he says that they are going to phase it out as soon as resources permit.  I am afraid that next year &mdash; they will probably stick around as long as that &mdash; we are more than likely to find an increase in the income levy as distinct from a reduction. I am not reassured by the Minister telling us that he will phase it out as soon as resources permit.  He should give an indication of when the Government intend to abolish it, not to phase it out, in the jargon they use in such a contradictory way.  From what we have heard so far the Government intend for as long as they survive &mdash; it will not be too long &mdash; to keep it and perhaps to add to it. Secondly, in relation to costs, I have talked about the diminishing returns.  I gather that in my absence the Minister mentioned that the reason for this was a carry over from 1983 into 1984.  Is the Minister suggesting that there will not be a carry over from 1984 to 1985?  Clearly, the carry over applies in each year, and what carries over from 1982 to 1983 or 1983 to 1984 we get all the time.  That is not the explanation.  The only explanation is the one I gave, that because of the diminishing number of people in employment and the diminishing number of people earning income, even less is accruing to the revenue in nominal terms, never mind real terms, than accrued last year.  If we were to maintain the same revenue as last year for this 1 per cent in real terms we are talking about £78 million plus £6 million or £84 million.  However, we are not going to get £84 million; we are going to get £77 million, and that illustrates the fact that it is having the effect that we have argued here for some time, namely that of reducing employment and as a consequence reducing the number of those who contribute to this ridiculous and unfair income levy.  I do not know if the Minister gave the figure for how much it would cost to accept our amendment in this year.</P>

      <P>It would be a very welcome step for that amount of money, and the Minister will acknowledge that we have been very restrained and responsible in the amendments we put down here.  We have not gone for the top in many ways.  When the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was sitting here and I sat over there he did not seem to be very interested in doing sums on proposed amendments then which would have cost something like £500 million or £600 million.  We know the difficult situation at the moment, therefore we have deliberately confined it.  For that figure the Minister should acknowledge that the case we make is reasonable, but whether we win the argument or not we are unlikely to win the vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with only one point in the Minister's reply. The basis of the argument against this levy by all Deputies has been its inequity. The Minister did not justify it on grounds of equity.  The Minister should tell us if he agrees with what we have been saying, that there is no justification for this type of taxation on equity grounds.  Tax equity is one of the major factors referred to in the Commission on Taxation.  No matter how heavy the burden is, people should be able to see that it is equitable.</P>
      <P>The Minister quoted from what he said last year, that if he was to do away with this he would either have to add the extra surcharge on the existing rates or reduce tax free allowances, etc.  When he thinks of his alternatives he thinks only of alternatives in the personal income area. There is a wide range of other alternatives in the capital taxation area and in wealth and property taxes etc.  Which he has not referred to as possible alternatives to the income levy.  There are other alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, on grounds of equity would <Col N="522" /> it not be better to amalgamate it into the income tax system in which there is some basis of equity and in which we endeavour to have some basis of equity?  What is the Minister's argument for holding on to this levy on gross incomes, which is grossly inequitable, rather than putting it into the income tax system?  If he wants more money, let him put it on the basis of the system which he has, which needs adjustment and is not on an equitable basis yet but at least it has the basis of being an equitable system.  The Commission on Taxation have made recommendations in regard to that.  Why does the Minister insist on holding on to the separate income levy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on what I spoke of regarding the method by which farmers are levied, that is profits before capital allowances as against other self-employed people whose levies are based on profits after capital allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is under a misapprehension.  There is no category of taxpayers who get the benefit of capital allowances before this levy is calculated.  That is an answer to the Deputy's question.  If he wants to follow it up I will listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the Deputy and I are going to disagree, but there is no allowance for capital allowances in the calculation of liability for the levy for any group of taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla wants to know my opinion about the equity or otherwise of the levy and why I would not incorporate it into the income tax system.  This year that was one of the things that I considered when we came to look at the way we would put together the budget proposals on taxation, and I concluded that the changes we made in the structure of taxation and in the hands and allowances were in themselves a sufficiently <Col N="523" /> coherent body of measures and were more important than the reduction of this levy.  A reduction of the levy beyond the further relief I have introduced did not seem as important as the other measures we have taken in relation to the total income tax system.  That might not always be the case and, as I said, it is our intention to phase out the levy as soon as resources permit, and I hope that would be at a fairly early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are not quite related as they deal with very different matters. However, I will deal with this amendment in the first instance.  I have for some considerable time been pointing out that the weakness of our marketing strategy is a matter of very serious concern.  I am glad that I am joined in this by a whole variety of independent economic analysts.  It is very clear that the capacity, particularly in indigenous manufacturing industry, is limited by the fact that we do not have marketing personnel who are sufficiently aware of the market, who do not spend a sufficiently long time in the marketplace outside the country or who are not sufficiently attuned to the realities of that marketplace.  The result is that <Col N="529" /> we are not exploiting the market to any effective extent.  A variety of comments in recent weeks underline what I have been saying for the past two years inside andº outside the House, that you can use a taxation system for incentive as well as to penalise.  My proposal is to provide an incentive for marketing personnel.</P>
    <P>Marketing personnel who are resident abroad for a considerable part of the year are taxed on exactly the same basis as those who live at home and work in their normal place of business.  Clearly, the disincentive effect of that is very serious. If a person spends 100 days in the year away from home in Frankfurt, Bonn, Lagos or South America, it is inequitable and damaging to the economy that his income is taxed as if he resided in Dublin, Tipperary or Donegal.  We obviously need to provide incentives for marketing and to get many more executives into this field and the Government must take action in this regard.  The revenue implications of this can only be estimated at this stage as nobody can put a precise figure on it.  Indeed, my estimate would be as good as that of the Minister.  We will certainly not be talking about a figure in the region of £1 million in total revenue loss, it will probably be somewhere in the region of £500,000.</P>
    <P>We cannot expect Córas Tráchtála to do the job for each and every manufacturing industry who are exporting. Indeed, Córas Tráchtála have acknowledged that, due to cutbacks, they cannot service indigenous industries, particularly small and medium size firms, in terms of expanding the market.  That is why I propose this amendment which builds in an adjustment related to the length of time that the marketing personnel spend outside the country.  We are trying to encourage the right people into marketing and to operate an incentive when such people are abroad for the general good of the Irish economy.  We should grant a tax deduction to an Irish marketing representative who spends in excess of 60 days abroad.  That is not a short period so I am thinking in terms of people spending a considerable time <Col N="530" /> abroad in an income tax year on behalf of their employer to market the employers' products.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have put in three other qualifications.  The period of 60 days must be spent abroad on the instructions of the employer and exclusively in the business of marketing the employer's products in the income tax year.  It would not apply to someone going out on his own behalf. The relief can apply only to a person employed and not to anyone who is a participator, namely, a promotor or an associate of the participator or employer. It is clearly limited to personnel engaged at executive or lower level in marketing the products of the employer.  I am conscious that this might be abused so I thought it appropriate to put in the proposal that no relief shall be granted to any person unless a marketing programme is submitted to and agreed with Córas Tráchtála in advance of the tax year for which relief is claimed.  The bona fides of the marketing enterprise can be established.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that someone has to make an adjudication and, if I were sitting where the Minister is now &mdash; I will be sitting there again sooner rather than later &mdash; I would probably put in the provision as set out in (d) of the amendment which is simple and effective.  The formula can be explained simply.  If you take T as a total liability for tax in respect of the employment, subtract the total liability multiplied by the number of days abroad on an employers business and divide it by the number days in the year that would have the effect of reducing his taxable income.  If, for example, an employee spends 73 days abroad on his employer's business and his tax liability in terms of marketing in respect of the employment is £2,000, the formula will work as follows:</P>
    <P Just="Center">£2,000 - £2,000 × 73/65</P>
    <P>gives £400 and, therefore, it would be £2,000 minus £400 which yields the figure of £1,600.  I would not regard the tax relief in that situation as enormous, it would be a sum of only £400.</P>

      <P>It is in the process of being discussed.  I will not prejudice my position by making any comment here or outside the House.  I am definite about that.  We were working on the basis that there would be quite an amount of flexi-milk available as there normally is up to 2 per cent of national production but because of the super-levy people were very slow to give up milk.  We have not had the same amount of milk freely available that would normally be the case.  We have to bring in schemes such as the cessation scheme.  There are moves afoot to help people in other categories.</P>

They do not all have the same level of efficiency when it comes to returning figures which are requested.  I do not believe that is a major difficulty in this case.

The aid was allocated through their creameries and dairies to eligible individual producers on a graduated scale varying from a minimum of £16 to a maximum of £165.  Details of the scale are given in a tabular statement which I will circulate with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the serious situation which is developing for broiler producers by imports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EC rules there is free trade in poultry meat between here and Northern Ireland.  While I am concerned at the recent increase in imports, I am hopeful that the trade will revert to more normal levels in the near future.  I think that has already happened.  The replies to some of these questions were drafted months ago.  They have been on the Order Paper for a long time and I imagine this reply was drafted when the difficulty was at its worst.  In the longer term the only effective way to withstand competition from imports is through improved efficiency in production, processing and marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>When I tabled this question the situation was very serious. It has eased considerably.  It is not of the same consequence now.  Does the Minister agree that the private producers who are a well organised group are facing a serious problem because Northern Ireland and British suppliers move their unregulated surpluses down here?  This is causing a fair amount of friction in the trade and doing a great deal of damage to the economy of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That would appear to be the case.  When they have over-production of flour it lands down here.  If they have a difficulty in disposing of what they produce, Ireland is an open market as are other countries in the EC.  It is very <Col N="540" /> difficult to prove that dumping is taking place.  We have not attempted to formulate a case because this difficulty is not as apparent as it is with flour.  It has caused serious problems.  About 15 per cent of the poultry consumed here comes from Northern Ireland.  That constitutes virtually all of our poultry imports.  With regard to the difficulty producers in the Deputy's part of the country had, January was the worst possible month for them.  In January we imported 251,000 chickens from Northern Ireland but in March the corresponding figure dropped to 196,000, so there was a steady decline. The March figure is more or less an average figure for recent years.  In any case, the situation is not as bad as it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there should be some effort made at EC level to bring about a levelling off in feed prices as between here and Northern Ireland, since this is a factor in this whole matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors involved.  It is not difficult to do something about the feed prices.  Perhaps the Northern Ireland producers of feedstuffs are more efficient than our producers. About two months ago I had discussions with the junior Minister who is responsible for agriculture in Northern Ireland and I made him aware of our concern regarding these imports.  I pointed out that they were causing us considerable difficulty but there are factors apart from the question of feedstuffs. Energy and other overhead costs are not as high in Northern Ireland as they are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty for us, too, in that in Northern Ireland the insurance stamp seems to be subsidised. I am especially keen that that discrepancy is removed.  I have told the junior Minister so that we will be following up the matter in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that exporters of pigmeat are unable to gain entry to the USA market because the standard of slaughtering and processing premises here will not allow them to get a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Plants engaging in the export of pigmeat to the United States must be approved as meeting the veterinary requirements laid down by the United States Department of Agriculture.  It is a matter of regret that at present none of the pigmeat plants here is approved for the US and so able to take advantage of the favourable conditions for trading with that market, especially having regard to the current value of the dollar.  Veterinary officials from my Department are ready to give information and advice about the standards required to have premises approved.  Generous grants are available from the IDA and FEOGA for modernisation measures provided certain conditions are met and assistance is also available from CTT for market research and development purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that at a time when the pig industry is in such a serious situation, when many of the markets abroad have dried up, it is regrettable that the people involved here, with the aid of the various grants were not in a position to take advantage of the lucrative US market, particularly now that the dollar is so strong?  The only reason for this is that the hygiene levels and so on are not adequate to comply with US requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with the <Col N="542" /> Deputy.  The reason for the rush of blood to the head now is the favourable exchange rate but matters cannot be rectified overnight.  From discussions I have had with various people in the trade, I am aware that a number of people are endeavouring urgently to update their plants in order to meet the US requirements and that is a very desirable development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises the potential in this area but is there not a problem in regard to the level of grant aid in that there is not sufficient incentive for the plants to modernise? Consequently, would it not be of benefit to the economy that the Government make more money available so as to ensure that the plants are updated immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the problem.  So far as I am aware, the level of grants available for new pig slaughtering plants is as high as 50 per cent, taking the IDA and the FEOGA grants together.  If that level of grant is not high enough, the outlook for the enterprise of our businessmen is very poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the difficulty that exists for cereal growers and to the restriction of the potential market for pigmeat, even if the grant aid is sufficient, should a task force not be set up within the Department and involving those engaged directly in the pig industry with the intention of having the matter rectified as quickly as possible?  By and large most pigmeat produced here is sold on the home market but there is much potential for the development of foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that I have not been meeting the people involved.  I have had a number of discussions with the interested groups within the pig industry and these discussions have been on the lines outlined by the Deputy.  One processor who lives not 1 million miles either from Deputy Kirk's constituency or from <Col N="543" /> Deputy Leonard's constituency is competing in what is perhaps the most competitive market in the world and he is being extremely successful.  He is able to export almost everything he produces. If others in the business emulated this processor we would not have the type of problem to which the Deputies are referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the appalling admission that none of our slaughtering and processing plants can come up to the American standards, is it a question of lack of hygiene or can the dirty Irish produce meat that will meet the requirements of the US market?  Surely the Department regulations should be enforced rigorously to ensure that we can produce meat at least up to the standard required by the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is our intention.  It is what we are aiming for.  In conjunction with the IDA we intend having a number of centralised slaughter units accompanied by processing facilities.  This is long overdue.  Such units should have been provided years ago.  I am very much aware of the present totally unsatisfactory position.  I agree with what the Deputies are saying but some people have succeeded and there is no reason for the others not succeeding also.  Our plants are hopelessly out of date.  They are antiquated and not suitable for present day needs but a number of people are making a genuine effort to modernise and improve their plants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that those plants that were grant-aided in recent years should have been capable of reaching the required standards for the American market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but our producers did not consider that market then because the exchange rate was not nearly as lucrative as it is now.  When the exchange rate is so attractive the processors take a different point of view and some of them are working towards meeting the required US standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is pig production not linked to the agricultural economy to a greater extent than any other area of activity?  If the pig industry collapses there will not be the same demand for feed and this obviously has a bearing on the production of grain.  The co-ops depend to a large extent on pig feeders for whey, buttermilk, skim and so on. Therefore, a decline in the pig industry would have a devastating effect on the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally.  The pig industry is perhaps the area of greatest potential for expansion and improvement because of the potential of good foreign markets.  The Dutch and the Danes are capitalising on the American market and on the Japanese market also and we should be doing likewise.</P>

Would he not agree that the problem should be dealt with speedily and a special task force set up to examine all those agencies to see if this problem can be overcome and entry gained into the USA market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>An expansion in pig output depends essentially on the industry being able to make itself more competitive, particularly on export markets.  My Department and the other State agencies <Col N="546" /> concerned will give every assistance possible to help to achieve this aim.  Capital aids are available from the IDA and FEOGA for investment in plant and equipment provided certain conditions are met and assistance is also available from CTT for market research and development purposes.

      <P>Imports of flour amounted to 42,900 tonnes in 1983 and to 46,900 tonnes in 1984.  On the basis of an annual usage of 230,000 tonnes of flour these imports represented about 18.6 per cent of requirements in 1983 and 20.4 per cent in 1984.</P>
      <P>Under EC rules there is free trade in flour between member states and the imposition of restrictions on imports is not permitted.  The question of possible abuse of a dominant position by UK exporters has been raised with the EC Commission, but that body have not accepted that the trading practices being followed by those exporters are contrary to Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for each individual farmer, in consultation with his agricultural adviser, to decide what type of agricultural production suits him best, having regard to such factors as farm size, soil type, market outlets, etc.  Farmers who decide to increase tillage acreage should concentrate on getting the best possible yields of high quality products which can most readily be sold on the open market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that individual farmers working in conjunction with their advisers, could not fill the bill and that it is time there was a complete examination of all farm enterprises?  There must be a wider spread of farm activity, related to ability to sell products abroad.  Would the Minister also not agree that there must be a great market available if sufficient encouragement were given to people to use fresh vegetables and fresh fruit produced here rather than relying on massive imports of canned and tinned fruit?  There is a great potential there if some promotion was done by some of the sales promotion bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in what he says.  In common with all countries in the EC, we have difficulties because of the quota systems being introduced. The member states are looking for alternative methods of farming.  The Deputy will be interested to know that the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Andriessen, has set up six or seven study groups to explore areas where alternative production can take place, that is, alternative to the type of production that has been the basis of agriculture in the Community for so many years.  This is what the Deputy is advocating.  I will let him have a list of the programmes that are being studied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Last year was an exceptionally good one for beet production.  The Sugar Company processed 1.6 million tonnes of beet, produced under contract with growers for which a record £59 million was paid.  On a return per acre basis, this represents a 9 per cent increase on the previous campaign, and consolidates the position of beet as one of our most profitable crops.</P>
      <P>In addition to this contract quantity, about 75,000 tonnes of beet not covered by contracts was accepted by the company, the price being based on the return from the world market for the sugar obtained.  The price and purchasing arrangements for sugar beet are a matter for the company and the growers.  The company, however, cannot be expected to pay the contract price for beet not covered by contracts.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister said that beet was one of the most profitable crops.  Will he not agree that much of the profit farmers could have earned in 1984 was lost as a result of the surplus beet that was not accepted by the Sugar Company at the various factories? Can he give any indication or guarantee that the farmers who are still committed to the growing of beet will have their produce accepted next autumn when the campaign starts in the various factories? Further, can he give us any indication of the negotiations he proposes to pursue <i>vis-à-vis</i> the various quotas during the forthcoming negotiations?</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows that 1984 was an exceptional year.  I am sure he also knows we are restricted by the quota system.  We have a certain A quota, a certain B quota and a certain C quota but after that it is between the devil and the deep blue sea.  I am not going to start talking about who was in office when the quotas were negotiated.  We are having a very civilized Question Time.  Those quotas come up for renegotiation towards the end of this year but I will not make any prejudgment of the result of the negotiations.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister pointed out to the Sugar Company that the losses as certified in Tuam were of the order of £800,000 rather than the £2,500,000 cost <Col N="554" /> penalty that has been continually quoted by the head office?  Will he not agree that the headquarters of the Sugar Company is as much a cost penalty as any of the individual factories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite an argumentative issue.  I know that the people in Tuam say it is much less than the figure quoted by the Sugar Company who give a figure slightly in excess of £2,500,000.  We have been very reasonable in our dealings with the Tuam company.  Some months ago when growers in Deputy Kirk's constituency and others in County Louth, County Meath and north County Dublin were under pressure, particularly with regard to supplies to the Tuam factory, I was able to help them and also to help the Tuam factory.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Tuam factory. We have kept it open and will continue to do so.  We have also demanded that certain cost saving devices be brought in; we are insisting that that happens. It was one of the conditions on which the factory was kept open and on which future funding will be provided.  I am not going behind the bush and telling the Deputy something else.  We have to have the conditions implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with the Minister in what he has said.  I am sure he will agree that the increased acreage in the catchment area and the package of voluntary redundancies contributed in a big way towards reducing the losses.  I am sure he will also agree that the fact that a total of 45 people were let go, between permanent and temporary jobs in the sugar packaging area, is undermining the company and leading to fear among local people that there is a company policy of closing Tuam by a back door method. Would the Minister take up that point with the Sugar Company?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 32a:</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <P>In page 14, before section 12, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;</P>
    <P>That a marketing representative who is based abroad of an Irish resident employer shall have his Irish tax payable reduced by reference to the following formula:</P>
    <P Just="Center">T - (T × f/a)</P>
    <P>where</P>
    <P>T is total Irish liability to tax in respect of the employment</P>
    <P>F is total number of days abroad on employers business</P>
    <P>A is 365 days.</P>
    <P>provided:</P>
    <P>(a) No relief shall be granted unless in excess of 60 days are spend abroad on the instructions of the employer and such days are spent exclusively in the business <Col N="591" /> of marketing the products of the employer, in the income tax year.</P>
    <P>(b)  No relief shall be granted to any person who is a participator, or an associate of a participator, of the employer.</P>
    <P>(c)  No relief shall be granted unless a marketing programme is submitted to and agreed with Córas Tráchtála in advance of the tax year for which relief is claimed.</P>
    <P>(d)  Provided all the foregoing conditions are met, relief shall be given by way of repayment of tax paid on production to the Revenue Commissioners of verification by the employer and employee of days spent abroad in a form prescribed by the Commissioners.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Kennedy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to persuade the Minister of the desirability of adopting this amendment so as to encourage marketing personnel to get out into the marketplace, the consequence of which would be of major importance to domestic industry.  I explained the reasons and indicated that the provisos included in our amendment would guarantee that this would only apply to marketing personnel certified by their employers, subsequently certified by CTT and finally authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to qualify for the tax allowance.  I mentioned that the revenue implications would be few.  If 500 people qualified under this proposal the cost to the Exchequer would be £200,000.  That is the amount of money we are talking about for something that would have a major impact on the economy and something that would give a signal to industry that from now on industry would not be penalised but encouraged to get into the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will demonstrate the need for this proposal from my own experiences.  I have been approached by many Irish <Col N="592" /> industrialists who agree that the weakness in their programmes to maintain viability is their lack of capacity to exploit good markets and even their lack of capacity to maintain existing markets.  I will not use the increasing numbers of liquidations to overstate the case, but liquidations have been increasing at an enormous rate.  The usual problems bringing a company to liquidation are inadequate accounting practices and very bad marketing.  By and large the problem relates to a company's failure to introduce new products to fill the demands of the market.  The multinationals involved in pharmaceuticals and high technology industries know the market and they determine from which point they can supply the market.  I am sure any industrialist and the CII will tell the Minister that what I have stated is the case.  A company in my home town, Castle Brand went under with a great deal of publicity and one of the great weaknesses there was ineffective marketing strategy.  The product was excellent, the workforce were excellent, the skills were beyond compare but marketing strategy was a major problem.  That problem applies across the board.</P>
    <P>This year the Government are providing something of the order of £270,000 for marketing in the agri-food industry, through the Vote of the Department of Agriculture.  That is the order of priority out of a total expenditure allocation of £9,000 million.</P>
    <P>One can travel the supermarkets of Europe and in some of the most sophisticated food presentations one would find anywhere, one will not find one Irish product.  In my time as Commissioner in Brussels I tried to purchase Irish food.  I travelled around the supermarkets and I could not find one Irish product apart from the well known liquid product that I too tried to promote wherever I could. The Minister spent time in Brussels and if the Minister can say that during his time in Brussels he saw many Irish products on the shelves, he must have had a unique experience.  All the marketing surveys demonstrate this fact and it has now been clearly pointed out that although we are <Col N="593" /> a member of the EC and Malta is not, their market penetration of the EC is at the same level as ours &mdash; and look at the size of Malta and the disabilities they have to overcome.</P>
    <P>That is the measure of the problem I am trying to address here, but I am not just addressing a problem.  I am much more interested in the wonderful potential there.  I have mentioned European countries.  Until such time as our people can communicate as easily in French, German, Italian or Dutch, wherever they are selling, until they get into the thought process of the Germans, Italians, French, Dutch or wherever they are selling, until they think and behave like these people, they will not know what the market demand in those countries will be.  We talk about technology and advances, when our real potential is in people. That would also argue that the cutbacks in education, for instance, at second and third levels really are just crazy when we should be promoting people who can begin to communicate and then begin to understand the time in which they live.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the reasons I am proposing this tax adjustment and they should be fairly clear.  This is to be only one debate, and the Minister will respond to it or he will not, on the cost of the implications of perhaps a few hundred thousand pounds.  I stress that <Col N="594" /> if our clothing industry generally, apart from the high fashion designers, is manufacturing for a society who have different habits of dress, people who have different tastes in dress, shoes or whatever else, we cannot supply them.  They will not buy just because we think they should dress as we think they should dress.</P>
      <P>The same is true of the agri-food industry.  Unfortunately, I have seen the very limited, nearly non-existent impact, with very few honourable exceptions, of our agri-food industry in the EC, and I am sure the same must apply elsewhere. I am proposing that people get out into the marketplace.  That is why I put a minimum of 60 days on the right to qualify under this proposal.  Incidentally, for each day after 60 days the qualification under the formula proposed, which I explained before the adjournment, would be that much greater so that at the extreme only a marketing representative who is totally abroad for a year will get total relief, and you will not find many of them.  I hope that appeals to the Minister. There is nothing more I can say in respect of it.</P>
      <P>Of all the amendments I put down on this, having regard to the revenue implications I am so totally convinced of this from my own experience and from consultations with people in industry that I hope the Minister will be able to respond in a positive way.  He will get the credit.  It will be forgotten fairly soon that it was the Opposition spokesman who proposed it.  It will be remembered later that the Minister for Finance of the day, Deputy Dukes, was the man who introduced in legislation this very worthwhile proposal.  Let the credit go that way; I am concerned about the consequences.</P>
      <P>You, Sir, have mentioned that I should move the other amendment also although they are on a totally different topic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be much briefer on this.  It is important although not quite <Col N="595" /> so important as the matter I have been addressing.  The logic of this proposed section is that for many years the Irish individuals who are educated and trained through the Irish system, who cannot find appropriate employment in Ireland and who need experience in certain skills to return to Ireland to utilise these skills must go abroad.  Because of the poor economic climate here at the moment and the lack of employment opportunity more and more of them are going abroad. Only this morning we heard of the experience of some nurses who went to Libya and found that what they went abroad for was different from what they were promised.</P>
      <P>That is another matter, but everyone recognises that a very considerable number of our people are going abroad these days to seek temporary and sometimes more than temporary employment. Their situation has been exacerbated substantially by the current economic recessionary conditions in Ireland, which is clearly evident in the unemployment here.  This means that more and more people are taking work abroad particularly on two or three year assignments in the hope that at the end of the period they can come back and perhaps things will be better then than they are now. Under existing legislation if such individuals &mdash; some of whom are married men and have a place of abode available to them in Ireland, namely where their wives are living and many of them leave their wives and families at home for obvious reasons &mdash; come home for any period at all while their wives are resident here although they are working abroad almost all of the year in Saudi Arabia, Libya or wherever else, they are resident for the entire tax year and capable of being taxed on their total foreign income in Ireland.  They are classed as resident in Ireland.  Their income is taxed as earned in Ireland for the full tax year although clearly they are not resident in Ireland and their income is earned outside Ireland.  They are forced to go, like blind Sheehan in Kickham's <i>Glen of Aherlow.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> I have put in a proviso about the US because it follows a pattern that the Minister has in the section.  The reason for the proviso in this case is that they are not to be taxable in a country with which we have a section 361 agreement or the US, and these are countries with which we have double taxation agreements anyway.  Therefore, if a person were to be taxed in a country such as the UK between which and Ireland traffic is continuous, the provisions of the double taxation agreement would provide that the tax take in such a country would be deducted from the Irish tax liability, which means that the Irish person is getting full credit for foreign tax.  However, in countries outside the double tax areas with which we have no agreement the foreign tax is purely deduction from the gross income and the balance is taxed totally to Irish taxation.</P>
    <P>This can be extremely onerous on individuals and I suggest to the Minister that it is extremely unfair, particularly where because of a casual visit home even for the Christmas holidays with the family they become liable to tax at the full rate in Ireland on the foreign income.  In the early days of going abroad, particularly to most of the Middle East and European countries, it was the younger people who went because invariably at the end of a two or three year assignment they got a gratuity which enabled them to come back home and buy a house, get married and set up businesses or have sufficient experience to get an appropriate job. Now very many people are going abroad, even people with substantial skills and people who are married for some considerable time, to work in foreign countries, sometimes on a temporary basis for two to three years.  Therefore, the proviso that I have at (a) and (b) on this will ensure that the concession which would be available would be available only to people who are basically abroad and would not be abused.</P>
    <P>I want to add another factor to it before the Minister replies.  If they are forced to go and if they are earning their money abroad, at least they can generate capital and foreign currency which can be a significant <Col N="597" /> boost at home when eventually they return.  Should we not encourage people, if they have to go, to save and transfer in the end as much as possible of what they have earned abroad in foreign currency and thereby relieve our balance of payments and so forth in the circumstances?</P>
    <P>That is my case on both these fronts.  I consider them both important but if asked to choose, although there is no reason why I should have to, I would come down in favour of the first as being not only important but absolutely essential. I hope the Minister will respond positively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The general rules of income tax produce a situation under which a person who is resident in the State is chargeable to tax on his income from all sources, irrespective of the source of the income.  If he is not resident in the State he is not chargeable to tax, except in the case of income that arises in the State.  Amendment No. 32a proposes to grant special income tax relief to a marketing representative &mdash; that term is not defined &mdash; who carries out part of his employment abroad on condition that he spends more than 60 days abroad doing his work, and the relief would bear the same proportion to his total liability as the period spent abroad.  That proposed relief is very similar to one provided in the United Kingdom in 1974 and amended in 1977 relating to employment abroad. When it was introduced the Chancellor of the day said the measure was aimed primarily at increasing exports.  We took a different view.  We took the line that the appropriate reliefs to encourage exports should be composed of reliefs to exporting firms engaged in manufacturing and service sectors.  That, in turn, gave rise to the export sales relief scheme and was a big factor in the subsequent decision made on the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax applied to manufacturing and service industries.  The same concern gave rise very largely to the Shannon Airport tax free zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy may not be aware <Col N="598" /> that the United Kingdom relief was withdrawn in 1984.  The main reason given for its withdrawal was that it was being abused.  In the United Kingdom now relief is given only where an employee spends 365 days or more abroad.  I am not persuaded that there is solid evidence that Irish marketing people are dissuaded from carrying out their employment abroad by the lack of a specific tax exemption for their activities. The companies have been provided with a favourable tax system to assist them in increasing exports and that goes into the total package the company can offer to their employees.</P>
    <P>Where marketing representatives of the kind Deputy O'Kennedy has in mind are paid abroad, they are chargeable to Irish tax by reference to section 76(4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, on the amounts remitted to this country out of their total earnings and not on the full income arising.  There is an exception to that in the case of the United Kingdom where earnings in the UK are chargeable in full in this country where the individual concerned is an Irish resident.  In addition, an employee of an Irish company abroad is in the position that his foreign earnings are chargeable under case III of Schedule D&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal Deputy O'Kennedy is making could be reasonably regarded as being fairly discriminatory by other employees of the company, including those involved in the production process.  It could be argued that they, as much as anybody else, make a contribution to the efforts of the company, yet <Col N="599" /> they would not receive any tax reduction of the kind Deputy O'Kennedy is talking about.  It might be argued, although it might be splitting hairs, that under Deputy O'Kennedy's proposal people who had to travel abroad in a purchasing capacity might have the same problems as the people who go abroad on marketing but they would not get the relief.</P>
      <P>I am loath to say this kind of thing but we have to talk about facts.  This proposal represents the kind of unquestioning and uncritical acceptance of a particular point of view which has bedevilled our tax system for years.  I have every understanding of the people who produce another good idea for a tax relief for a worthy activity and persuade a Government to include it, but we find after a period that the system is a mish-mash of a series of reliefs and exemptions which are very difficult to operate.  I am sure somebody, if not Deputy O'Kennedy then somebody else, will represent what I am saying as the &ldquo;Iron Duke&rdquo; being totally opposed to any consideration of these marketing people who do so much for our companies.  I am not.  That is far from being the case, but I want to put this point.  People involved in marketing have special skills and we need them, but I do not think their position is such as to justify a special tax relief.  What about the people involved in production who are needed as much as the marketing people?  What about the people in purchasing? What about the people whose skills are such that they can be exercised on behalf of the company only in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I had discussions with a group of industrialists, all involved in exporting, who were making this point.  I asked them if they were seriously inviting me to visit their factories and go into the marketing department and say to the people involved in marketing and travel that because they travel, and that is a tough job, I will give them tax relief; and then I go down to the factory floor and talk to the fitters or production line operators and say I am sorry for them, that although I appreciate what they are doing <Col N="600" /> for the economy, I cannot give them any tax relief because they are not mobile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Total discrimination. There are many marketing people who spend a lot of their time on the roads in this country marketing Irish products which substitute for imports.  Every £1 million of import substitution is worth just as much to the economy as every £1 million worth of exports.  Why should we discriminate there?  I cannot see an objective reason for that kind of discrimination.</P>
      <P>The real problem is the overall level of taxation.  It may seem strange to hear the Minister for Finance accepting that fact in the debate on the Finance Bill, but nobody is more aware than I of the effects of the present level of taxation.  We will solve that problem only by making headway against the conditions that give rise for the need for high taxation.  I have not found any evidence on the opposite side of the House of any preparedness to deal with that problem.  Deputy O'Kennedy tacked on some remarks about education. I do not want to be misinterpreted in this matter but he said fairly clearly that this is an area of expenditure where we do not want to see any reductions.  I am quite sure there are many other areas of expenditure where he would say the same thing.</P>

      <P>I do not find it defensible to single out one specific group in Irish industry who are making a big contribution&mdash;others are too&mdash;and to give them a special tax relief because they spend much time travelling abroad or have some other special characteristic.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have some doubts about that.  Some of the situations described by Deputy O'Kennedy do not arise in the normal course of events in our tax system.  If he wishes me to go further into that point I will do so; if to pursue that matter would irritate him then I apologise to him and to the House.  I do not think there is a solid case for making the specific amendment he has proposed.  The wording is ambiguous and, if I have understood his intention correctly, we do not need a section in the Bill to deal with that problem because it does not arise in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Had I written a reply to the second part I would have opened with that all too predictable line &ldquo;I do not think there is a solid case&rdquo; and then repeated all the jargon he gave in response to the first point.  He did not address himself to the cost, which is rather important.  He talked about the UK experience and mentioned that the measure was dropped ten years later. Our situation is entirely different, but at least they introduced it.  The provisos that I am proposing here are not those which apply in the UK.  Any Minister who is prepared to say that there is no difference between marketing personnel working to a considerable extent abroad and those working at home is not listening.  He is giving out the predictable line from his advisers, although I do not want to be too critical of his advisers, and proving his capacity to read a formal reply prepared for him.  It proves beyond doubt that he has not given any consideration to the proposal I made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A typical response from the Minister is that he cannot give a concession to people working in the marketing area without giving it also to those in the production <Col N="603" /> area.  It is not just a question of the interests of these individuals.  I am much more concerned about the interests of this nation and its fantastic potential. I am aware of all the reports which tell us that we have a totally inadequate marketing strategy and far too few marketing personnel working abroad on a permanent basis.  That is one of the reasons we are not generating new export markets. Anybody who has a mind which is in any way open to new possibilities will realise that there is a hell of a difference between a person who spends 60 to 120 days away from his own home living and working in a different environment and civil servants who live here and go home at 5.30 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a fraud. There is a great difference between those who work in their own factories or accounting departments and live in their own homes and those who spend over 60 days abroad.  There has to be an incentive to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There already is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not.  There must be an incentive to these people who are spending so much time abroad.  The Minister does not choose to see that he is discriminating against companies who would want to send individuals out into the market.  He seems to suggest that the introduction of an adjustment of the type I am suggesting would discriminate unfairly against those who are living and working at home.  This demonstrates that he simply is not interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time I have been very concerned about the Minister's capacity to do anything to generate a new climate for activity.  I have no doubt of his capacity to deliver the lines pat from the Department of Finance or from the Revenue Commissioners as if they were original.  I have no doubt of his capacity to adhere to the jargon of rectitude, the proper <Col N="604" /> balance, as he has so often called it.  I am sure he will give all the reasons why this proposal would not work but an adjustment of this nature would probably cost something in the order of £200,000 per annum and, even for something as small as this, he does not have the imagination or perhaps the personal authority to say to someone in the Revenue Commissioners that he is going to adopt this proposal.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Minister gave for rejecting this proposal is that there were abuses of the system in Britain and that they got rid of it in 1974, ten years after it was introduced.  I cannot see that there will be any abuses but, if his reason for rejecting it is that it might be abused, then as long as the Minister remains in office there will be even greater depressions in the country.  He should be prepared to open his eyes and his mind and to keep in touch with reality through speaking to workers, business people, promoters and industrialists.  Perhaps I am being personal but, in view of the utterly unreasonable response which I got from the Minister, as long as he remains Minister, God save Ireland because she will need salvation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I really have very little to add to this debate.  It would be impossible to estimate how much this proposal would cost.  Deputy O'Kennedy laid emphasis on the fact that we have generally inefficient marketing strategies but we will not solve the problem by his proposal. I am not sure whether the Deputy made a distinction between people going abroad for employment abroad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the experience of being employed abroad by an Irish organisation and there was no Irish tax liability at all.  Indeed, I remember a long and entertaining correspondence I had with the Revenue Commissioners when I had bought a house here although I was living <Col N="605" /> abroad.  Over a period of six or eight months we had a series of increasingly intimate letters regarding my intentions. However, that is by the way.  Of course, Deputy O'Kennedy is very good at this kind of jargon and cant and he is a fair old hand at reading out lines himself.</P>

      <P>That occurred to me. The two proposals are agreed.  I want to say a few words on this generally.  This is in respect of a scheme introduced last year in the Finance Bill.  This was the famous venture capital scheme which we spent some time debating in 1984.  In the course of that debate, as the record will show, while supporting the idea in principle I expressed to the Minister very serious concern that the scheme would not get off the ground because it was so surrounded by so many qualifications, complexities, conditions and unnecessary restrictions that nobody but the most qualified accountant would begin to understand how it could be operated.  I indicated that, if the intention really was to encourage equity participation in the manufacturing sector to which it was being confined, it should be made as simple as possible so that potential investors could understand it.</P>
      <P>I was talking in particular about small investors and employees of enterprises who wanted to take a share in the enterprise and have a greater commitment to it.  I said it should be reasonably understandable to them.  I said that the people in the Revenue Commission and in the Parliamentary Draftsman's office who drew up the scheme were not likely to invest in it.  If they understood it, they would be the only ones who did.  For those and other reasons nothing in the scheme got off the ground.  Two funds were launched.  I have no idea of how much money was involved in either of those two funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a measure of the Minister's inability to understand the realities for business people and potential investors and <Col N="614" /> those who are interested in taking a stake or a risk, that last year he gave us about 30 pages of the most extraordinary gobbledegook which he justified line by line and at the end of the day we had nothing. Now belatedly the Minister has adopted two of the many proposals we made last year.  That does not go far enough to make any sense or to have any impact on the scheme.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister's attitude despite all he said last year in his calm, confident but predictable fashion.  Constantly during the debate last year he referred to such provision giving rise to abuse, being used for purposes of evasion or avoidance. But all the reasons advanced by the Minister last year were totally artificial and one might say also detached from reality.  He is proposing now to change that.</P>
    <P>Even as the scheme stands it has no hope of achieving the purpose for which I understood it was introduced last year. Having said that, I wish the scheme well. Clearly, there are a number of points to be improved on.  First, investors in non-quoted securities to which last year's relief applies should be eligible for tax relief on their investments on providing documentary evidence of having invested in a bona fide designated fund recognised under the Act.  That is much simpler than the whole paraphernalia of qualification certificates and guarantees that must be produced now.  Why limit investment in designated funds to the figures suggested? If the Minister will agree to the proposed change, even on Report Stage, he would be doing a good day's work because otherwise small investors and anyone interested in the scheme will have to wait until the designated fund is invested in a qualifying company.  The point made last year was that until the fund was invested in a qualifying company, the Minister could not see his way to allowing the investor participate in the scheme.  I am saying that the relief should apply from the time the person invested in a designated fund because how can he know at that point when the investment in the qualifying company would be made?  The small investor, the one we <Col N="615" /> are anxious to encourage to invest, is not in a position to finance the waiting period and consequently he will not be willing to make the investment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the procedures for the granting of the tax allowance should be such that the allowances would be made to the PAYE taxpayer by way of the issue as soon as possible of an amended certificate of tax free allowances, that is, as soon as possible after the receipt of documented evidence of investment in the designated fund.  At that point the investment has been made in the fund and the investor should not be penalised on the basis that at that point the fund has not been transferred for investment in a qualifying company.  That is a matter over which the investor has no control.  There is precedent for this practice in respect of mortgage relief and life insurance policies, for example.</P>
    <P>We are trying to create a climate in which the small investor will have an opportunity to invest, not just in equity participation in companies but also perhaps in companies in which they work. But the period during which the investment must be retained by the investor is too long so far as some of these small investors are concerned.  They should be allowed cash their shareholdings in designated funds after a minimum of two years.  We will not encourage investment in the fund if we say that the fund is to be locked up and that no investment is to be released until after the expiration of the period outlined in the Bill.  This will not encourage people to buy and sell.</P>
    <P>The provision that the tax relief shall apply only when the conditions of the Act are satisfied will also guarantee that the small investor will not be interested, because this would involve engaging an accountant and that would not be feasible if one were investing, say, £400 or £600. Neither would any accountant consider it worth his while taking on such a case, having regard to the guarantees, qualifications and so on that are required.  If as a basis there was the requirement that the managers of the designated funds be required at the end of each income tax <Col N="616" /> year to provide evidence of investments made or investments redeemed during the year the requirement should be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Neither should we penalise the investor because a manufacturing or trading company loses its status as a qualified company under the act because, for instance, it goes public or loses its eligibility for the 10 per cent tax relief.  In such cases the company and not the investor should be penalised.  The company should be required to make good to the Revenue Commissioners any loss of tax revenue and at a rate equal, say, to the composite rate that applies to building societies.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will realise that my efforts are aimed at encouraging the small investor particularly.  Some of the major investors who would have available to them the advice of some of the big houses in the city might be able to work their way through the gobbledegook of the legislation, though the evidence is that not even they are interested. I am talking about creating a climate in which people with upwards of £200 to invest are encouraged to do so.  We need this sort of investment.  As I said last year, any of us who have been to the US has been impressed by the fact that everyone there is a potential entrepreneur.  One sees people there coming from offices and looking up the latest Dow Jones average at the bottom of the Pan-Am or TWA buildings.  These people are all investing but that is not the case here, the reason being that we have made it so complicated and so difficult for them to invest. There is no need for the ridiculous qualifications.</P>
    <P>The managers of designated funds should be allowed invest the funds in equity so as to replace borrowings.  In this instance most Irish companies are overborrowed.  They cannot fund their borrowing programmes.  So long as all other conditions of the scheme are complied with, can there be anything wrong with equity participation to replace borrowing commitments that are sending most companies to the wall?  We must encourage venture capital as distinct from forcing most of these companies to <Col N="617" /> raise funds on the banking market.  Far too many Irish companies rely far too heavily on borrowing and then become seriously undercapitalised.  A stronger equity base would enable many of them who otherwise would be overborrowed to survive and expand.</P>
    <P>These are just selections from a whole series of points that have been conveyed to me and, I am sure, to the Minister also.  Small potential investors have asked me how they qualify for participation in the scheme.  I have to reply that I cannot tell them.  How could you?  No one else can.</P>

      <P>After all the hullabaloo, there were two funds.  There might be two plus another two this year&mdash;some considerable achievement.  The successful operation of a designated fund requires expenditure on promotion in order to attract investment.  There is need to advertise, to promote.  Quite frankly, it requires the employment of expert personnel to assess the applications from companies and monitor the performance of those companies in which funds have been invested.  That is the type of market condition about which we are talking. For that reason, designated funds should have the freedom to apply charges to investors commensurate with the promotional and other necessary expenditure in the fund.  It should not be restricted to the limit of the charge in the Finance Act of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> We had all the limitations on fund managers last year, on the amount which they could charge.  Because of the time restriction on the whole operation of this legislation, I cannot go into all that.  Last year, we told the Minister that those restrictions in relation to fund managers were guaranteed to ensure that they would not be interested in promoting funding.  I do not want to say too often &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  I certainly can say it here, as I said it on other occasions.  Even if belatedly, the Minister might consider what he introduced, which we supported, although it was far too complicated.  We pleaded with him last year to get rid of these unnecessary restrictions and I am pleading with him now on the scheme which, in general principle, we support but which is far too complicated.</P>
    <P>This scheme should be extended to the service sector.  I have had that view for a very considerable time.  I argued about it last year for the very good reason that the employment potential in the manufacturing sector, particularly in the domestic industries, is limited enough.  The growth potential is to a greater extent in the service sector.  As far as anyone outside this House is concerned, a job is a job.  An investment in any sector which provides the jobs so badly needed should not be discriminated against because it is not in a designated sector in this legislation.</P>

      <P>That is one matter which we debated at length last year and to which I have given a great deal of thought in the meantime.  To an extent, I am giving the benefit of the doubt here because I am still not entirely happy that the difficulties which we foresaw last year can be avoided.  However, I have given <Col N="619" /> the benefit of the doubt to the case which Deputy O'Kennedy and a great many others, including my own colleagues on this side of the House, made last year.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of interest in this scheme on all sides of the House and outside it.</P>
      <P>The second amendment proposed, which was already in the Bill as circulated, is to provide that where a qualifying company expends not less than 80 per cent of the amount subscribed for shares on research and development work, which work is required in connection with the trade, the start-up period allowed would be three years rather than two. Thirdly, we have an amendment which removes the obstacles which were in the scheme originally to 51 per cent subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries.  Fourthly, there is an amendment to remove two specific restrictions which were on funds &mdash; restrictions which did not have anything to do with the management expenses of the funds when it was running, but were very specifically stated in last year's Act to cover charges made in connection with the establishment of the fund &mdash; charges made on dividends or interest accruing to those who had invested in the fund itself.  All those restrictions are now removed.  There is no restriction, nor was there ever, of the ongoing management charges that a fund might make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the designated funds are concerned, we have now published the Unit Trust Bill which, when passed, will allow the designated funds to advertise freely so that we will have got over that difficult quite soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputy O'Kennedy that there is no limit for investment through a designated fund.  I do not know where he got the figure he mentioned.  It is quite conceivable that fund managers themselves, for reasons of their own administrative convenience, may set a lower limit, but it should be clearly understood that in cases where that happens <Col N="621" /> that is a decision of the fund rather than one forced on it by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I remain opposed to the idea of giving the relief when money is subscribed to a designated fund, for the same reasons as I gave last year.  The objective of the scheme is to get investment funds into companies where it is going to be used. If we were to give relief before that event took place, the pressure would be off the funds to get the money into companies where it will be used.  Since we are concerned with getting equity funds into companies, that is the appropriate moment at which to give the relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure that I follow Deputy O'Kennedy's claim that the small investor is unable to finance the waiting period, unless that small investor is borrowing in order to provide the investment.  That is a matter for the particular investor.  In most cases, their maximum waiting period would be a year.  The funds are anxious to get the money into use.  There is a provision for giving relief through the PAYE system. I take the point made by Deputy O'Kennedy, but there is already that provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is traditional for a Deputy on an occasion like this to thank the Chair for giving permission to raise a matter on the Adjournment.  I give that thanks with a little more than the traditional gratitude on behalf of all my constitutents, and I venture to say the vast majority of the people of Dublin and Ireland, that attention should be given to the emergency that exists and to the total failure of the normal constitutional process with regard to the penalties a person who is guilty of an offence should serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> Two months ago in this House I raised a question on what was euphemistically called joyriding but what I called death on the road.  In that contribution I referred to the death and the maiming of people and I spoke of the general deprivation of freedom for all our citizens but I was disappointed that the Minister of State acknowledged I had made a case against the hooliganism that prevailed.  From what I know as a civil servant and as a Minister of State, that is part of the customary bureaucratic cover-up jargon when one has no case to make against charges.  To refer to what is happening in this context as hooliganism is the greatest understatement I have heard.</P>
    <P>We know that what we refer to in this city as law and order does not exist.  As the makers of the law, we are taking a secondary place to a small group of thugs who are deciding what will be the law. The sooner we accept that emergency exists the better.  The Government and the Minister for Justice must accept that there is a sincerity on this side of the House with regard to the emergency and what must be done.  The Minister may reply that we had a Criminal Justice Bill in this House and that people expressed reservations about certain matters in it. I, for one, did not express such reservations. I said I would not give to a person who was obviously guilty of an offence the right to silence.</P>
    <P>In my constitutency yesterday a person out on bail knocked down a little girl. Fortunately she was not killed.  What do Mr. and Mrs Beirne, the parents of Fiona who was injured in that accident, and all the neighbours who know and can identify the people responsible, think of the situation that exists when those thugs can have available to them free legal aid so that they can attempt to prove it was not they but somebody else who committed the offence?  Out of taxpayers' money and by the laws we have introduced, those people will be granted free legal aid.  I think free legal aid has become quite a racket.  It is a form of subsidy for the legal profession.  I might allow it once <Col N="623" /> but I would not grant it twice to anybody charged with an offence.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a constitutional provision for the protection of the individual, that my wife, my mother, my brothers and sisters should be able to go about their business, to walk the streets or to stay at home and feel free from attack. That is the essence of freedom.  To me the preservation of their freedom is far more important than any doubt there might be about the preservation of the freedom of somebody guilty of up to 50 offences.  The laws that were appropriate 50 or 100 years ago to guarantee that the freedom of such a person would not be lost have become an absolute nonsense nowadays when it is obvious that it is the freedom of the law-abiding person that is at risk and is being denied to him.</P>
    <P>We have a system that provides for a courts procedure, where people sit in judgment and decide on the evidence as to whether an appropriate sentence should be served.  Let us take the case of somebody who goes before a court and who, in the opinion of the learned people there, is sentenced to serve six months. However, in many cases that person will not serve one day.  We have a new legal system by telephone whereby the Governor of Montjoy speaks with a civil servant in the Department of Justice who asks him the position in the prison.  The Governor may say: &ldquo;Things are tough here.  We have 540 prisoners but really we have accommodation for only 360 or 380&rdquo;.  The civil servant will say that he is sorry but there are 20 more coming and that the Governor had better get rid of 20 prisoners.  This is not an over statement of what is happening.</P>
    <P>In the case of extenuating circumstances where a Deputy might make representations to the Minister, he will look cautiously at the matter and tell the Deputy that he cannot do anything that would make little of the courts.  The Minister will be reluctant enough to do anything in the matter, as a Deputy would be about asking for anything. However, now we have a civil servant <Col N="624" /> and the Governor of Mountjoy deciding for how long people will serve their sentences. We are here making laws and talking about the Criminal Justice Bill but that is the nonsense that exists and the sooner we face up to what is happening the better it will be.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the people in Finglas and in other areas are at a point where they think we have let them down, that we are not capable of handling the emergency.  When this Minister took office I felt a certain optimism.  I expected we would have a Minister who would be tough and who would deal with the situation.  However, I am afraid that for whatever reason that toughness and awareness of what is necessary seems to be disappearing.  I am presenting the facts to him as I know them.  A garda having chased a criminal for months and having brought him to court where he gets a sentence of six months can meet that criminal on the following day without him having served one single day.  All he will get from that criminal is the &ldquo;Harvey Smith&rdquo; sign.  One can imagine what that does to the self-respect of any garda.  That is not Disneyland fantasy, it is fact.</P>
    <P>I know that it is the custom for all Ministers and indeed for Ministers of State to try to put a veneer of propriety on what exists but this situation cannot be covered up with words any more.  The prison officers are very disenchanted at the moment with what is happening. They know they are fighting a losing battle.  The Garda Síochána are giving up the chase.  The Minister may say it is all right for me or for anybody on this side of the House to talk like this.  If the Minister were to reopen Daingean tomorrow he would have my encouragement and support.  As far as I am concerned there is suitable and ample accommodation there.  It is a fine big building.  I had occasion to go down there when I was in the Department of Education. I looked at it.  I know that there are at present there certain artefacts belonging to the Museum.  As far as I am concerned it is far too good for the fellows I would like to send there.  We must move away, <i>pro tem</i> at least, from this whole <Col N="625" /> notion of rehabilitation.  The language most of these people understand is that of your being as tough as they are.  The softer you are with them the more they will chase you, the more they will blackmail and attack you, I have given a certain amount of study to what is called penology, the human behaviour and misbehaviour. There is absolutely no evidence to show that creating holiday conditions in any institution for those who have been guilty of serious crime pays; it does not pay.  They think that is their right.  That is why they are now using Mountjoy as a welcome port of call, they drop in, have a nice meal there, then they are released and go about their unsavoury business the following day.</P>
    <P>I would have no hesitation in recommending that the Minister re-establish a special task force.  I am very ill at ease in recommending that that task force should also be armed.  What in the name of all that is good and holy is the point of sending two unfortunate gardaí out to a road stop to try to prevent passing somebody moving on them in a BMW, armed with a biro and a flash lamp?  It is ridiculous; it is merely wasting the time of the Garda.  The type of people about whom we are speaking here will not stop.  On the other hand, the cowardly types they are, if they felt that the Garda were able to match them, they would stop.  The Minister announced some time ago amidst some considerable publicity &mdash; and I was personally very happy about it &mdash; that he was now making spiked chains available to the Garda.  I am asking the Minister now have they been used, have spiked chains been made available.  What was the purpose of making the announcement? I have not read anywhere of their being used.  The Minister of State told me here on the last occasion that special task forces were being set up here in the city and the Minister said recently that the Garda were on top of this.  I can tell the Minister that they are not &mdash; the hare is now chasing the hounds.  The convicts are on top of them and will continue to be until such time as it goes out from this House that it is proposed to take emergency measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The Minister might ask to me in replying: do I speak for everybody on this side of the House?  Casting one's mind back to the Criminal Justice Bill there might be one or two people who would disagree, people who represent this great luxurious area of courts and lawyers, people who are well paid to tell young criminals to tell lies.  They know they have been guilty of injury, of perhaps killing a person and there is somebody employed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We examine all of this because we see that the traditional courts and practices have let us down.  As I said at the beginning, one has sentence now by telephone, by a telephone call from a civil servant to the Governor of Mountjoy asking: how are we fixed?  Get them out; get a few of them to the open prisons for a few days and we can let them out of there.  That is what is happening.  I am not blaming the Minister; I am blaming all of us.  The unfortunate thing is that the people outside will not tolerate it much longer, when we then will have a new proposition.  As far as I am concerned we should open Daingean or any other austere type of building, deprive these people of the luxury they have at present.  This is as good a way as any of reminding them that the people can no longer afford a bill of £350 million for the Department of Justice, prisons and Garda to protect them and guarantee them freedom, that the traditional, soft measures have not succeeded.  In pursuit of that approach the people of Finglas, indeed every other part of Dublin city, Cork, Limerick and so on will be able to walk the streets, will be able to go shopping, remain in their own homes without have to transform them into prisons. That is what is happening at present.</P>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for having given me the opportunity of raising this most serious matter.  Apart from the Finance Bill or anything else, this is the most serious problem we are confronted with today.  I still have hope that the Minister is the man who will ultimately see that it is solved but I am indicating to him that I am not as optimistic about his anticipated success as I would have been some months ago.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity of speaking on this Adjournment debate, particularly since last night in my constituency an incident occurred when, for the first time of which I am aware, a group of citizens turned on joyriders who had just knocked down a young girl.  I am slow to say it because of all that might be read into it but I am proud of that action <Col N="628" /> by the members of the community concerned. It is not so long since some of that community would have been cheering the joyriders as some sort of light-hearted adventurers.  It indicates the absolute turnabout and rejection of their kind of activity that has occurred in our city, with the increasing number of deaths there have been in recent months.  It is a statement by the communities that they totally reject this activity, that they will not have it, that they will not allow this unwanted minority to destroy the normal freedoms of civilized living.  This is true in particular of working class communities.  There is a myth about, expressed in some popular magazines, that the crime problem is one for the middle classes.  The middle class problem of crime is an occasional one; it is a visit to one's property on occasion. In many working class areas the crime problem is a 24 hour one, one with which they must live day in, day out, with all the pressure that places on them.  Therefore, in a particular way they need our help.</P>
      <P>Having said what I have about the involvement of the community, it must be said that it is a double-edged sword, because if it gets out of hand it can rapidly develop into vigilanteism, to which I would be totally opposed.  It is extremely important that communities are not left to respond to this on their own.  It is extremely important that the progress the Minister has been making in finding extra prison spaces continues apace.  That is why I welcome the fact that Deputy Tunney is highlighting this issue tonight. Progress is being made and it must continue at a rapid pace.  The judges must respond to the deeply felt wishes of the people and their representatives that these problems should be taken seriously. If bail which is a constitutional right, is not to be interpreted in the spirit in which the community would wish to it to be interpreted the legislators will have to look at it again and change the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I will confine my remarks to the terms of the topic raised on the Adjournment rather than to the general <Col N="629" /> debate which has ensued.  I think Deputy Tunney for raising this matter in the House.  The Deputy has been sincere in his support of me since I came to the House.  I wish I got the same support from other quarters in the House.  There is a certain amount of confusion in what the Deputy says and I presume that inaccurate information has been fed to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons why offenders do not serve the full sentences imposed on them by the courts.  The most obvious is the fact that prisoners have a statutory entitlement to one quarter remission of their sentences for good behaviour in prison.  We also operate a system a programmed temporary release for relatively long term prisoners.  This system, commonly referred to as parole is an essential feature of prison administration worldwide and must continue if there is to be any chance to reintegrate long term offenders into society.  In addition, selected offenders are released to the supervison of the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
      <P>The problem of unplanned early releases is one which has concerned many people and particularly myself as Minister for Justice.  This is not a new phenomenon and has had to be resorted to since 1979 when because of pressure on prison accommodation a system of home leave for petty offenders commenced.  It should be clearly understood that this scheme benefits only people who have been committed for relatively minor offences and who, after consulation with the Garda, are considered to be of little or no risk to the community.  If there is any evidence that people benefiting from this kind of release misbehave in any way they are immediately returned to prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offenders imprisoned for serious offences such as attacks on the elderly or so-called joyriding are not released in this way.  It will be clear from what I have said that the reality of temporary release is a far cry from the extravagant and at times ill-informed claims which some people have made about early releases from prisons.  Deputy Tunney talks about <Col N="630" /> people not serving one day.  I have challenged people to produce a name where somebody did not serve one day.  I will produce the file if the Deputy can produce the name.  That is part of the folklore which is propagated in statements from the Prison Officers Association, particularly by their secretary, Mr. McEvoy, who because of an industrial dispute in Mountjoy Prison which gave me and the Department and this House control of the prisons again after they had been run by a trade union for many years, is running a vendetta ever since and he is disseminating incorrect information to Deputies on the other side of the House and to the media.  None of these so-called joyriders and people who have attacked the elderly are released prematurely.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If the Deputy produces the name I will show him the file.  The Deputy is being misinformed. People who make these types of claims no matter how well meaning should bear in mind the consequences of their remarks.  Such ill-founded claims can only have two effects &mdash; to frighten the vulnerable in our society and to encourage the criminal by making him think that he will get away with it.</P>
      <P>That is why I am anxious that a clear message goes out from this House tonight that those who are convicted of serious crimes such as attacks on old people or so-called joyriding are serving and will continue to serve their full sentences in the same way as other serious criminals such as armed robbers and rapists.  I have given that commitment before.  I give it again and I will continue to fulfil it.</P>
      <P>In 1982 the daily average number of people in custody was about 1,200 and, because of measures which were taken to maximise accommodation at existing institutions, and the acquisition of additional temporary accommodation, the acquisition of Spike Island, the acquisition of the educational facilities in Arbour Hill in Cork, it is now near 1,900. That is a huge increase in capacity in a two year period.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talks about sincerity on his side of the House.  I believe the sincerity of Deputies.  I have been looking for temporary accommodation in many places. The House knows that I have been looking for a premises in James's Street. Members of Deputy Tunney's party have behaved disgracefully in relation to this issue.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice welcomed the attempt to provide custodial accommodation in that location in James's Street but the deputy leader of the party subsequently went down to a meeting and assured local residents that it was official Fianna Fáil policy to oppose the move.  It is very easy to speak with forked tongues, to come in here and speak in the national interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of Daingean, I would like it if it was suitable but it is not.  It has been examined and reexamined but it is not suitable.  Some people work on the basis that one can put prisoners into any accommodation and that they will stay there.  They forget that the prisoners do not want to stay.  We must have accommodation from which prisoners cannot escape and that is why Spike Island was attractive.  It is surrounded by water.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Since the subversive prisoners were transferred to Portlaoise Prison in 1983, security there has been maintained at a high level and kept under continual review.  Despite the high level of security, breaches of security have occurred, leading in one case (August 1974) to the escape of 19 prisoners, in another case (March 1975) to a prisoner being shot dead during an escape attempt <Col N="561" /> and (1976) to the escape of three prisoners from Green Street Courthouse using explosives which a prisoner had brought from Portlaoise taped behind his genitals.  Explosives have also been found in the prison regularly up to 1977 and occasionally since then.  On one occasion in 1975 a woman smuggled explosives concealed in her vagina into the prison.</P>
      <P>Security at Portlaoise had to be specially reviewed in the aftermath of each incident of the kind I have mentioned and extra precautions were inevitably seen to be necessary.  The basic principle is that where a high-risk prisoner is about to be or has been in a position to acquire material from or deliver material to any member of the public he is strip-searched in a manner which is as little intrusive as possible in accordance with the best international practice.</P>

      <P>Demand for the products manufactured by Philips in its Dublin factory has in recent years been declining as these products were superseded by new developments. Against that background the IDA has been endeavouring to persuade the Philips Group to allocate the manufacture of a new range of products to its Dublin factory in the interests of preserving manufacturing employment there.  I myself have also pursued this possibility with the parent company which I visited last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently learned from the company that they intend to terminate their existing manufacturing operations in Ireland <Col N="563" /> on 31 December next.  Philips have indicated that they are not in a position at this stage to provide an alternative manufacturing project in Dublin as the group is engaged in a major rationalisation of its European operations from which a significant reduction in overall employment in the group is likely to result.  Philips will, however, maintain employment in its Irish sales and servicing activities.</P>
    <P>I regret the impending cessation by the company of its long established manufacturing operations in Ireland.  The IDA will, however, maintain continuous contact with it in the hope that opportunities for the establishment of a new project could arise at a later date.</P>

      <P>To facilitate access to the US market of Irish manufactured products &mdash; initially in the electronics area &mdash; an agreement was concluded on 8 March 1983 between the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards (IIRS) and the United States Department of Defense.  The agreement provides that, for a two year period up to 20 May 1985, each party to the agreement is permitted to certify conformity to agreed product standard specifications. The US Department of Defense is the US body which establishes such standards.</P>
      <P>The parties have agreed to extend the agreement, without amendment, for a further period of at least one year.  To date certification has been provided for products of one Irish manufacturer.  As I stated on 5 July 1983 in reply to a previous question on the subject, the agreement is of an administrative and technical character. It does not involve any defence or military commitments and essentially it safeguards jobs in Irish industry, particularly in the advanced technological area.</P>

      <P>Applications for assistance from the western development fund are submitted through county development teams and considered by the central development committee which makes a recommendation to me as Minister.  In 1984 the committee considered 18 such applications. Grants were approved in 11 cases, refused in six and one case is still under consideration.  Of the 11 grants recommended five were in respect of proposals to provide industrial workspace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to applications considered by the central development committee, grants not exceeding £3,000 may be awarded under the discretionary grant scheme.  Under this scheme county development teams may, subject to guidelines and supervised by my Department, approve grants without referring the <Col N="570" /> cases to the central development committee. In the 13 counties covered by the western development system 396 such grants were made by county development teams in 1984.</P>
    <P>The western development fund does not operate an industrial development scheme as such.  It is primarily designed to assist worth-while economic projects which are not eligible for assistance under any other State scheme.  So far as manufacturing industry is concerned grants may only be paid in cases which are at a precommercial stage and, as such, not yet sufficiently developed to be eligible for grant aid provided by the Industrial Development Authority.  For this reason manufacturing projects are generally only assisted by way of discretionary grant.</P>
    <P>In 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983 the central development committee recommended the payment of grants in 23, 14, 18 and eight projects respectively.  The number of grants not taken up in each of these years was two, three, three and one respectively.  Because of the number of grants involved the corresponding figures for discretionary grants in the period 1980-83 cannot be made available without considerable research.  Arrangements have been set in train to obtain information and to send it to the Deputy in due course.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit from the Department of Social Welfare at a weekly rate of £67.50 since 28 June 1984. This reduced rate of benefit was awarded to him in respect of himself, his wife and one child, based upon his record of 34 Irish contributions in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>It has recently come to light that he was last insurably employed, prior to his incapacity, under United Kingdom social security legislation.  Under the EC Regulations on Social Security, the claim for sickness benefit and invalidity benefit is therefore the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  Accordingly, the claim, the medical evidence and details of his Irish insurance were transferred to the UK authorities on 25 March 1985.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has been in contact with the Department of Health and Social Security on a number of occasions requesting an early decision on the claim.  Pending a decision the Department of Social Welfare will continue to pay benefit until 27 June 1985. The appropriate reimbursement to the Department of Social Welfare will be arranged with the Department of Health and Social Security.</P>

Arrangements are being made to have him examined by a medical referee of the Department on 20 May 1985 and his entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report following this examination. In the meantime, arrangements have been made to issue payment to him on a regular weekly basis on receipt of <Col N="584" /> monthly medical evidence of incapacity for work.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable to an applicant is reduced after 156 days of benefit, if he does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period.</P>
      <P>The person concerned who is an applicant for unemployment benefit, did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in the seven year period.  Accordingly the rate of unemployment benefit payable was reduced from £70.25 weekly to £60.90 weekly from the 157th day of his claim.</P>
      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable was further reduced to £53.20 weekly on 8 March 1985 as he ceased to be entitled to an increase for his child on and from the date on which the child attained and age of 18 years.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was overpaid children's allowance amounting to £72.30 due to her failure to notify the Department of a change affecting her entitlement.  She is now entitled to payment in respect of four qualified children. The overpayment is being recovered by withholding the allowance due for one child from April to September 1985.  The claimant has been advised of the position and a book covering payment for three children for this period was issued on 7 May 1985.  Payment for her four qualified children will resume in October 1985. The claimant should notify the Department when her eldest child returns to her household and her entitlement will be further reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 13 March 1985.  He was not entitled to benefit at the commencement of his claim as according to the records of the Department he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1983-84, the contribution year governing his claim.  Following inquiries it was established that he had sufficient contributions registered in 1983-84 to qualify for benefit at the weekly rate of £34.50. All benefit payable to 17 April 1985 the date of the latest medical certificate received has been issued to him.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit <Col N="586" /> to the person concerned was disallowed from 29 October 1981 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  Her case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 29 October 1981 to 24 March 1982 the date of the latest medical certificate before him at that time.  The decision of the appeals officer is final.  She again claimed disability benefit from 20 December 1982 and payment has been issued to 29 April 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate received.  Accordingly there do not appear to be any arrears of benefit due to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> On the basis of the most recently available statistics, copy folios, including copy folios with filed plan attached, are being issued by the Land Registry within an average of eight working days, which does not take into account time taken in transmission through the post both ways.  However, there can be significant differences in the time it takes to supply a copy document.  The main reason is that in about 50 per cent of cases, provision of a copy of a Land Registry map entails substantial preliminary work that includes the reconstruction of an existing map (which apart from being on an old six inch scale can at times being very poor condition).  The reconstruction is usually to the latest 25 inch ordnance survey standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> The average monthly output of copy documents in the Land Registry during the first quarter of 1985 was 7,909.  The total arrears of applications on 31 March, 1985 was 1,992.  From these statistics it can be seen that there are in general no significant delays in the registry in the issue of copy documents.</P>
