    <P>Soláthar £25,000 a bhí ar fáil i mbliana le haghaidh bóithre i meastacháin na Roinne.  Níor éirigh leis na comhairlí contae áfach na hoibreacha a ceadaíodh Nollaig 1984 (.i. deontais £39,700) a dhéanamh sa bhliain sin agus tugadh cead dóibh na hoibreacha a dhéanamh i mbliana.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin ceadaíodh deontais bhreise £23,370 i rith na bliana seo rud a fhágfaidh go mbeidh £63,070 le seasamh i mbliana.</P>

      <P>Os rud é nach raibh na comhairlí chontae, go háirithe i nDún na nGall, in ann an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh mar nach raibh sé ar fáil go dtí taréis Nollag, an nglacann an tAire gur rud ró-ghlic a bhí ann gan an t-airgead curtha ar fáil ag an Rialtas ach go mall i mí na Nollag, agus coinníoll ann go gcaithfear an t-airgead roimh dheireadh na bliana?  An gcuirfidh an tAire Airgeadais brú ar an Roinn gan rudaí mar sin a dhéanamh feasta ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní ghlacaim gur cleas a bhí ann, go mór mhór os rud é gur thugamar ar aghaidh an £39,700 nár caitheadh i 1984 go dtí 1985.</P>

      <P>Nach bhfuil dualgas ar an Aire níos mó airgid a chur ar fáil i mbliana, agus go gcaithfear é a chur ar fáil i rith na bliana nuair atá an aimsear feiliúnach chun na bóithre a dheisiú?  Rud tábhachtach, an nglacann an tAire maidir le deisiú bóthar i rith Dheireadh Fómhair agus na Samhna go bhfuil an chuid is mó de na bóitre sin ag dul go dtí tithe ina bhfuil lucht leanúna Fhine Gael ina gcónaí iontu?  An nglacfaidh sé nach raibh bóthar ar bith deisithe sna Rosanna, i gCloch an Fhaolaidh agus i nGaeltacht Lár nó Deisceart Dhún na nGall.  Tá mé ag cur i leith an Aíre agus Roinn na Gaeltachta go bhfuil siad ag caitheamh airgid ar bhóithre ina bhfuil teach amháin agus nach bhfuil siad ag caitheamh airgid ar bhóithre cosúil le a bóthar chuig eastát tionscail na Doirí Beaga.  Tá 800 daoine ag obair ansin agus níor caitheadh fiú amháin pingin rua ar an mbóthar sin.  Tá a fhios agam nach é an Aire anois sa Teach a rinne é sin agus táim cinnte nach n-aontaíonn sé leis.</P>

      <P>Nac bhfuil an chosúlacht ann ón fhreagra a thug an tAire gur cuireadh na deontais ar fáil do dhaoine nach raibh ach muirín amháin ar an mbóthar?  An nglacann sé nach bhfuil sé sin ag teacht leis an Acht féin i dtaobh chaiteachas airgid &mdash; go gcaithfear ar a laghad dhá mhuirín a bheith ar an mbóthar sul ar féidir deontas a cheadú? Nach bhfuil cosúlacht ann go bhfuil rud éigin mí-cheart anseo, más fíor nach bhfuil ach teach amháin ag fáil deontais.</P>

      <P>Bhí £5,600 mar chuid den chaitheachas a cuireadh i gcrích i mbliana i nDún na nGall.  An t-iomlán i dtaobh Chontae Dhún na nGall ná £16,600. Caitheadh an tríú cuid de sin ar bhóithre ag a raibh deontais le fáil acu i mí Dheireadh Fómhair agus i mí na Samhna i mbliana.  Thug mé freagra beacht ar an cheist beacht a chuir an Teachta Coughlan orm.</P>

Níl sé sin de réir an Achta féin i dtaobh bhóithre áirithe sa Ghaeltacht mar caithfear, ar a laghad, dhá mhuirín a bheith ar na bóithre.</P>

Má tá clámhsán le déanamh ag an Teachta faoi seo, tá slí eile aige chun é féin a shásamh. Tá súil agam nach bhfuil sé ag rá nach cóir na deontais sin a íoc.</P>

Mar a dúirt mé, chuir an Roinn ráiteas chuig an comhchoiste a léiríonn na deacrachtaí atá ag an Roinn i dtaobh na nithe sin, agus níl a thuilleadh le cur agamsa leis an ráiteas sin.</P>

Ceist shimplí a chuir mé síos don Aire faoi cad é an dul chun cinn atá déanta chun moltaí Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh.  Ba mhaith liom cúpla ceist dearfa a chur ar an Aire anois agus go dtabharfadh sé freagra dom.  Má thógaimid an chéad mholadh faoin Státseirbhís, lár-ionad forbartha Gaeilge don Stáitseirbhís, coistí forbartha na Gaeilge sna Rannaí Stáit agus oifigeach Gaeilge a bheith tofa i chuile Roinn Stáit.

Tosnaíonn an cur síos ar leathanach 3 den tuarascáil agus críochnaíonn sé ar leathanach 82, má chuirimid san áireamh gach ceann de na rannaí Stáit agus oifigí Stáit: mar shampla, an Chomhairle Ealaíon, Bord na gCapall, boird Stáit and comhlachtaí Stáit, agus tá freagra beacht ar cheist an Teachta tugtha sa tuarascáil sin, agus níl aon eolas níos déanaí ná mar atá san tuarascáil seo le cur agam faoi bhráid na Dála inniu.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is referring to the formulation by the EC of a common forestry policy the position is that no such proposals are under consideration at present.  Nevertheless, various forestry measures have been initiated from time to time on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, for example, the forestry element of the Western Package in Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1820/80 and in the recent amendment of the Structural Directive in Agriculture, certain measures to encourage afforestation by farmers have been included.  Discussions have taken place in the Community on a draft Council resolution proposed by the Commission in 1983 for a Community action programme regarding forestry and forest-based industries.  The draft resolution is <Col N="2403" /> still under examination by COREPER &mdash; the Committee of Permanent Representatives &mdash; and discussions on it have not reached the stage where one could say what the outcome may be.  However, I shall keep the matter under review and press for progress at every opportunity.</P>

It seems that the committees are on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and do not seem to complete their work.  We are pressing for something to be done in respect of forestry and the Government are giving consideration to certain proposals.  When those proposals are completed and decisions are taken, we will go back to the EC.  It would be premature to go back sooner.</P>

In respect of the query by Deputy O'Keeffe about raw material being bought in Ireland and processed in other countries, that is happening but there is little we can do about it.  It is better to have it bought here and processed in other countries than have it dumped in the sea.

That committee is comprised of officials from the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, officials of my Department and of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and all the fishing interests.  That committee have been in existence two and a half years and have been quite successful in securing markets for processed fish.  I should say that the main focus is on processed fish. We have just landed a very good contract on the Canadian market with a Dublin firm.  Once that firm had signed the contract for the fish they could take on 20 extra people the following day.  The contract is for six different species of fish, all processed fish.  We are at present examining the American market, which is very lucrative, and we are hopeful to make a breakthrough there in the next two or three months.  The Canadian, American and German markets are the main ones involved in the buying of fish.  This is the first time the entire industry has been represented around the same table. Therefore we are getting our information from the industry itself.</P>

      <P>To date public inquiries have been held in nine areas with a view to designating them as areas within which it shall be lawful to engage in aquaculture subject to licence.  In two of the nine areas designation orders have been made and the process of licensing has commenced. In the remaining seven areas consultations have been continuing with environmental and industry interests in order to reach agreement as to the extent to which aquaculture may proceed without conflict with these and other interests. A substantial measure of agreement has now been reached.  I am hopeful that it will be possible soon to proceed with the designation of further areas for licensing.</P>
      <P>A number of other suitable areas have been identified and I expect that, subject to consultation with other interests, preparations can be put in train at an early stage for the holding of public inquiries in these areas.</P>

      <P>d'Aire na Gaeltachta an aontódh sé, cé go bhfuil tromlach phobal na tíre báúil le labhairt na Gaeilge, go bhfuil an chosúlacht ann gur ag dul in olcas atá cúrsaí <Col N="2420" /> maidir le labhairt na teanga agus an mbeadh sé sásta a mholadh don Rialtas treoir a thabhairt le misneach an phobail a mhúscailt lena chur ina luí orthu go bhfuil gá le hiarracht speisialta leis an tseoid is luachmhaire dár n-oidhreacht a thabhairt slán agus an dtabharfaidh sé ráiteas sa chás.</P>

      <P>Glacaim leis go bhfuil tromlach phobal na tíre báúil leis an nGaeilge agus glacfaidh an Teachta leis, ceapaim, ní foláir, go gcaithfear an bhá sin a shaothrú i gcaoi go mbeidh fonn ar an bpobal iarracht leanúnach a dhéanamh chun úsáid na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha a leathadh.  Ní dóigh liom, áfach, gur ag dul in olcas atá cúrsaí &mdash; tá comharthaí dóchais ann freisin.</P>
      <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teachta, dhearbhaigh an Rialtas nuair a bhí an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-86 á chur i láthair an phobail go bhfuil de chúram orthu timpeallacht a chruthú a thacóidh dáiríre leosan a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga nó mar theanga bhunúsach ina saol laethúil. Beifear sásta aon deis réasúnta a thapú chun an pobal a spreagadh le húsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Nuair a cuireadh cláir phoiblíochta ar bun ar an teilifís, &ldquo;Part of what we are&rdquo;&mdash; chuidigh siad go mór le labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ach ní raibh aon leanúnachas leis agus níl an t-airgead nó an cuidiú ata ag teastáil ó Bhord na Gaeilge chun an leanunachas sin a chothú agus suim na ndaoine a mhúscailt i gceart.</P>

      <P>Thug mé féin agus toscaireacht ón tír seo cuairt ar an bhFionlainn ó 14-20 Meán Fómhair ar chuireadh oifigiúil ó Rialtas na Fionlainne.  Bhain an turas go príomha le cúrsaí foraoiseachta agus le hiarrachtaí chun tionsclóirí a mhealladh le tionscail fhiúntacha a bhunú sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the action he has taken, or proposes to take, to avert the B &amp; I strike, due to commence on Friday next; and if the Labour Court have yet invited both sides to talks in an effort to avoid the disruption to the travel plans of 40,000 people over the Christmas holiday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand and, indeed I share the Deputy's concern having regard to the seasonal time of the year but the requirements of time in giving notice for a Private Notice Question have probably overtaken events in respect of the Deputy's question.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Labour Court have intervened and that conciliation talks started at 10.30 a.m.  Those talks are continuing. I know the Deputy, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Labour and the Public Service, will be as anxious as I am to ensure that no action that the House may take at this stage prejudices the outcome of these talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned last week when I raised the matter of the CIE dispute, I do not have any desire to prejudge any talks at the Labour Court but, unfortunately, some talks wind up as soon as we stop talking with the result that one does not get anywhere.  I should like to ask the Minister if he will accept that this is one of the most serious strikes threatened here in many years and that if it takes place it will cause great difficulties for tourism and trade?  It will cause major disruption for the many families who have had to emigrate this year.  In 1985 we have had the highest emigration since the fifties and the Minister's Department must be acutely aware of the thousands of Irish people who are working throughout Europe and are anxious to return for <Col N="2424" /> Christmas using the B &amp; I service.  Will the Minister indicate the action he intends to take in the next few days, apart from the talks at the Labour Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recognise that the difficulties that have arisen in a number of areas which have manifested themselves as industrial relations problems are ones that have had a long history with rights and wrongs on both sides. Those difficulties are now in the hands of professional negotiators representing management and the unions.  The House, and Deputy Ahern, will recognise that we have in the Labour Court a very professional team of skilled negotiators whose full time job is that of industrial relations.  Like my predecessors I regard it as my duty to ensure that the machinery for industrial relations is at all times available, properly resourced and kept constantly aware of the concern of the public that it does the job entrusted to it.  There is a very understandable temptation on behalf of all public representatives to try to replace that machinery.  They do so, I suggest, at their peril.  In recognition of the legitimate concern of Deputy Ahern and the service he has done in raising the matter I should like to tell the Deputy that the action he has sought has taken place.  The Labour Court have intervened and conciliation talks commenced at 10.30 this morning.  All we can usefully do is to underline the concern of Members to see a satisfactory outcome to those talks. I suggest, with all due respect to the Member opposite, that anything further at this stage could be counterproductive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope the talks will be successful.  As it is, we are going very shortly into recess.  Could the Minister give an undertaking to make a statement-about the matter in the House?  I might not get another opportunity over the next two days to raise this matter as the House will sit for only 48 hours more.  If the strike has not been averted, will he give an undertaking to make such a statement to the House, so that we can further debate it?</P>

      <P>I am hesistant to make any commitment to a blank cheque which might be cashed some time in the future in circumstances that none of us can divine at this stage.  I am, however, prepared to say that as Minister for Labour I am prepared to make sure that all the machinery for industrial relations, reconciliation and resolution available to me will be made fully available to both sides to find a satisfactory solution to this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, (County Borough of Galway) Order, 1985.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 6th December, 1985. </P>
      <P>The Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, provides a framework for the establishment of Galway as a county borough and as Members of this House will be aware, I propose to fix 1 January 1986 as the day on which the new county borough will come into being.  The 1985 Act, anticipating this new status, broke the electoral link between the city and the county.  The city electorate at the local elections held in June 1985 did not participate, therefore, in the elections to Galway County Council.  The 1985 Act also provided that all rights, privileges, powers and duties of the borough corporation would continue to vest in the new county borough corporation and enabled the Minister by order to make such supplementary provisions as necessary to ensure a smooth transition and to deal with any matters arising in relation to the establishment of the county borough. This is the purpose of the draft order now before the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer now to the more important provisions of the draft order. Articles 1 to 3 are standard provisions relating to citation, definitions and commencement. Article 4 confers a general power on the two local authorities and the Minister to take such actions as are necessary to facilitate the establishment of the county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 5 provides that the county council will continue to provide services for the county borough and on the basis of the same financial arrangements as have applied heretofore; provision is also <Col N="2515" /> included for revised financial arrangements to be agreed locally.  While the new county borough will on its establishment become legally responsible for certain services, including fire services, libraries, and motor tax, which are at present provided by the county council, clearly it would not be practical to have separate city services in place in all respects on 1 January next.</P>
    <P>Article 5, therefore, provides that the county council will continue to provide services for the city on the existing financial terms, or on new terms to be arranged.  It will be a matter for the two councils to decide on the future arrangements for these services.  As I explained in the Seanad last week, they may well decide that there is mutual benefit in continuing some or all of the combined services but provision is made in article 6 for the city to set up its own services in the matters in question if it decides on that course.</P>
    <P>Under article 6 the corporation may at any time in the future agree with the county council to discontinue shared arrangements in relation to any service. Indeed in the event of disagreement with the county council they may decide to assume responsibility for a service and serve a notice to this effect on the county council.  After five years, responsibility for the service in the city would automatically transfer to the corporation.  This period of notice is required to allow the county council to adjust their service.  I would expect that, in practice, the question of the future arrangements for services which are at present shared will be decided by amicable agreement.</P>
    <P>The upgrading to county borough status has financial implications for the revenues and expenditures of both authorities. The city and the county have been wedded together financially, organizationally and administratively for the past 100 years.  It would be impossible, therefore, and undersirable to effect a complete separation overnight.  To do so would cause major disruption.  The net effect of the upgrading will be that the county council stands to lose revenues previously <Col N="2516" /> provided by the borough on a scale which could affect the county council seriously. It is considered necessary and reasonable that there should be a financial adjustment between the councils in respect of this factor.  Article 7 provides for such an adjustment to be worked out locally or, failing local agreement, to be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the Seanad, I am very pleased to be in a position to say that I will be making a substantial contribution to this financial settlement by way of additional grant allocation to the county council.  The addition will cover 50 per cent of the net cost of the adjustment subject to a maximum amount of £200,000 in 1986.  The possibility of additional subvention for a period of years subsequently will be favourably considered: it is recognised that the adverse impact on the county council finances of the upgrading of the city will be a continuing one, though it should be of diminishing significance as the two councils adapt to their new financial frameworks.</P>
    <P>I must stress, as I did in the Upper House, that this commitment to provision of special financial support is an exceptional gesture complementing the Government's decision that Galway city should have conferred on it the status of a county borough.  There is no precedent for such subvention and it will not in itself constitute a precedent in relation to any other adjustments that come about in the course of the local government reform programme, and which are of a different nature.  The commitment to provide special financial support for the county council was warmly welcomed in the Seanad and was generally recognised as a generous step in terms of providing for the emergence of the new county borough.</P>
    <P>I am sure that it will be so recognised in this House as well.  To begin with, the corporation are in a much healthier financial state than the county council. Secondly, if, as it seems to be the case, the county council will be at a net loss which will be in the region of £400,000 as a result of the upgrading and related reduction in county-at-large revenues, it <Col N="2517" /> follows that the corporation, who are already in a relatively comfortable financial position, stand to gain by something of the same order.  Given this situation and the long and complicated financial relationship which has existed for so long between the borough and the county, it is logical and reasonable that there should be this provision for financial adjustments. As I have indicated, I will be making a substantial contribution to the county council, thus reducing by approximately half the amount to be made up by the corporation.  In all the circumstances, and given the limited funds at my disposal and the genuine needs of other local authorities, many of whom are in a much worse financial situation than the corporation, I am satisfied that the course which I have adopted is the sensible one and strikes a reasonable balance between the interests of the various parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Of course representatives of the corporation can argue that there are special problems and needs in the city area and that they need every penny for new services in expanding areas.  This, however, is an argument which every local authority in the country &mdash; and very often does &mdash; put forward.  It is my duty as Minister for the Environment to take an overview of all these competing needs and demands and somehow to match these with available resources.  I feel I have done this in the present case in a way which respects the particular situation of both the county council and the corporation.</P>
    <P>Article 8 will ensure that the county council will be in a position to prevent any undue financial burden falling on Ballinasloe UDC arising from the upgrading. I understand that such an effect is not anticipated at present and the provision, therefore, is a contingency one.</P>
    <P>The schedule to the order contains various technical provisions relating mainly to management and statutory demands.  In so far as management is concerned the 1985 Act provides that joint management will continue.  However, under that Act when the present manager cases to hold office it will be <Col N="2518" /> open to both authorities, if they so wish, to discontinue this arrangement.  The provisions of the schedule are supplementary to this and are technically necessary to enable relevant provisions of the County Management Acts to be applied to the situation.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to statutory demands &mdash; drainage, arrears of supplementary welfare, malicious injuries &mdash; provide in effect for the splitting of such demands between the city and county and on the same financial basis as has applied heretofore.  Prior to the upgrading the county council paid for these demands and recovered the corporation's contribution via the county demand.</P>
    <P>I would like now to say a few words about the extension of the borough boundary.  The extension was agreed between the councils locally and was subsequently recommended by the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission.  The 1985 Act provided that the extension would have effect for electoral purposes and the borough council was, accordingly, elected on the basis of the enlarged area in June. Last week I made an order bringing the boundary extension into effect for all purposes from 1 January 1986.  A copy of that order has been laid before both Houses.  I wish to repeat here what I said in the Seanad, namely that the members of both authorities are to be congratulated on their positive and non-contentious approach to this question.</P>
    <P>The separation of the city and county arising from the upgrading is, of necessity a complex undertaking given the fact that they have been linked for almost a century. Some of the provisions of the order bear witness to this complexity.  However, as I stated in the Seanad, I have no doubt that the transition to a county borough will be a smooth one and that the necessary transitional arrangements will be approached by the elected members of both the city and county in the same positive spirit in which they dealt with the boundary extension.</P>
    <P>Galway city has a long and proud history stretching back almost a millennium. In the present local government era, <Col N="2519" /> town commisioners were established in 1853 and an urban district council had been established by the end of the last century.  By an Act of 1937 the urban district was upgraded to borough status. The present change to county borough status which was announced to coincide with the city's quincenntenial celebrations marks, therefore, the culmination of a long process of civic development for the city.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to offer my good wishes to the citizens of Galway and their elected representatives as the city starts a new phase in its historical development which will take it into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I commend the draft order to the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Galway is one of our oldest cities with a documented history stretching back a thousand years.  Last year, the city celebrated the 500th anniversary of the granting of its town charter.  In 1937 the new Irish Government upgraded the status of the city to a borough and restored the mayoral office.  Indeed, in the early sixties, the mayoral sword and mace were returned to the city from &mdash; I think &mdash; the Hearst organisation in America who had somehow come into possession of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2520" /> The order before the House is significant as it now raises the ancient city of Galway to county borough status alongside the other great cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  From 1 January 1986 Galway city will be an independent, mainline local authority in its own right with full authority to guide its future development availing of the rights, privileges, powers and duties conferred on county boroughs under the various statutes.</P>
    <P>Galway Corporation and the citizens of Galway would wish me to express our appreciation to the Government for facilitating this change of status and in particular for generously providing the sum of £200,000 for 1986 to ease the financial loss to the county authority arising from the change of status and I will refer to that later.  In conjunction with the change of status, the Government have also facilitated a major extension of the city boundary which has been amicably agreed between the city council and the county council.  This extension will involve the city in payment of compensation of an amount not yet agreed although a figure of £588,000 has been identified as the net burden on the county council at 1984 levels excluding loan charges.</P>
    <P>Further meetings will take place between the city council and the county council to try to resolve how the city will pay compensation of this order over a period of years.  Hopefully, that matter can be resolved between both authorities without the Minister having to arbitrate as is provided for in this order.  What is of more immediate concern are the financial implications for the two authorities arising out of the status change proposed under the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, which will take effect from 1 January 1986 and for which this order provides.</P>
    <P>At present Galway Corporation contribute 27.97 per cent of the net county at large charges.  This figure would go to at least 31 per cent after the boundary is extended.  The county demand on the city this year is £1,553,931.40p, or approximately £1.5 million.  The items making up <Col N="2521" /> this demand have been classified under a number of headings: shared services &mdash; that is, services shared between the council and the corporation &mdash; statutory demands which are made under various statutes and which the city council will be obliged to pay, services which can be taken over by the new council from the county council, and major urban roads. In examining the effect of the county at large charge and how it can be divided between the two authorities, both authorities have identified these services &mdash; the shared services which will continue, the statutory demands which they cannot avoid and the services which will be continued by the corporation.  Out of this figure there will remain a sum of county at large charges which would continue to fall on the city were it not for this order, for this change in status, and the city would not see any obligation to continue to pay for services which they were not getting.  That sum was identified as £423,000 and presented a major crux for the two authorities in seeking to reach agreement because other serious financial matters have to be resolved as regards the boundary extension.</P>
    <P>Both authorities went to the Minister, explained the financial difficulties arising from this change and asked him to come to their rescue to facilitate the continuation of the amicable settlement of these matters which had been achieved up to now and which could only be continued if the Government were to come to the assistance of the council, who would lose approximately £423,000 annually.  I am pleased to thank the Minister for meeting that request in some way, although he did not meet it fully or adequately.  The amount was identified as £423,000 and he offered to pay £200,000 in 1986.  The Galway authorities are concerned about what will happen in 1987 and the following years, but I will come back to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>The position facing Galway County Council is therefore a continuing annual loss of £423,000 arising from this status change and the corporation would have to finance services in the large new area <Col N="2522" /> which is being added while at the same time paying a substantial sum in compensation to Galway County Council.  Section 5 (2) of the order provides for the payment of a financial sum in compensation for these matters.  That payment will be greatly assisted by the contribution of £200,000, but the difficulty the corporation identify in this order is as follows.  If they are to pay county at large charges for services which continue to be provided by the county in future years, it would be around 30 per cent of the cost based on the product of a penny in the pound; but there is nothing in this order which will protect the corporation against excessive expenditure by Galway County Council in improving their facilities in future years, knowing that under this order Galway Corporation will be obliged to pay almost one-third of the cost. It was hoped that the Minister, having recognised that the order was faulty in that regard, would have come forward today with an amendment to protect the corporation against such added increase in costs in future years.  These county at large charges, which include the fire service and the library service could represent heavy capital expenditure.  If, for instance, Galway County Council decide to undertake extensive capital expenditure in the towns throughout the county in future years, so long as this facility continues in operation the city would be obliged to pay practically one-third of the cost.  I am sure the Minister will accept that that would not be a fair imposition on the new city council, who would have no representation at county council level and who would get no benefit from any of the services the county council provide for in their own area.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that the city has some obligation to continue to pay a proportion of its county at large charges in regard to those services which have been provided up to 1 January, but it is unreasonable to write the order in such a way that the corporation could become liable to pay such a high proportion of the cost of future extension of these services in the county.  Before the order goes through this House I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="2523" /> amend it by adding a new subsection to section 5 introducing a clause which would protect the corporation.  It could be worded in such a way that no new extensions or major enhancement of the services would be undertaken by the county without the prior agreement of the city council.  If that clause is inserted, it will meet the existing point of contention.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the amount of compensation which the Minister has agreed to pay in 1986.  The Minister said that the possibility of additional subvention for a period of years subsequently would be favourably considered.  They are just words; there is no commitment there.  We have found the Minister very understanding and he responded generously in the amount he is committing for 1986, but there is a great fear that no further financial assistance will be made available.  If the Minister is not in a position to put a figure on it at present, perhaps when he replies he would give an assurance to the House that he is making a commitment to continue providing for at least a further ten years a subvention of the 50 per cent net cost of the adjustment which has been identified and on which he has put a maximum figure of £200,000.  The least the Minister should do if he is not making a provision for this in the order is to give a commitment in the House so that when we come to 1987 the city council and the county council will be able to look to this commitment knowing that the money will be provided.  That is a very important point and I hope the Minister will respond to it in a positive way.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the anomaly which has existed whereby the local authorities in County Galway &mdash; the county council, the corporation and the urban district council of Ballinasloe &mdash; have had to contribute 75.86 per cent of the cost of supplementary welfare to the Western Health Board whereas in other health board areas the amount contributed by the local authorities varies from 23 per cent to 58 per cent.  The local authorities pay 23 per cent to the North-Western Health Board, local authorities in the <Col N="2524" /> Eastern Health Board area contribute only 24 per cent, in the north-eastern area they contribute 29 per cent, in the south-eastern area they contribute 41 per cent, in the mid-western area they contribute 47 per cent, in the southern area they contribute 49 per cent and in the midlands the amount is 58 per cent.  However, in the western area the local authorities are obliged to contribute 75 per cent.  As the Minister knows, a constitutional case is pending in this connection. There will be a continuing liability on the local authorities to meet the arrears that have been built up.  We do not know what will be the outcome of the court case.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that in the new arrangements the anomalous percentages are altered and that the contributions will relate to an average figure. Alternatively, some other satisfactory formula should be introduced.  The local authorities in the Western Health Board region should not lose out because of the anomaly that has existed during the years.  I hope the Minister will take account of that under the new arrangement whereby supplementary welfare will be paid from the Exchequer with a consequential cut in the rates support grant.  We do not want our rates support grant to be cut by that amount and I am sure the Minister will agree that would be most unfair.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his attitude in this matter.  We have found him forthcoming and very helpful and I have no hesitation in offering our sincere thanks and congratulations to him.  We are pleased he has accepted the invitation of the Major to come to Galway on 1 January for this historic occasion, accompanied by some of the officials who have been working on this matter for the past few months.  We hope they will celebrate with us the launching of Galway in its new status into the future years which we hope will be years of growth and progress for the citizens who will benefit in time from the important decisions we are making today.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the <Col N="2525" /> Minister for bringing this order before the House.  I am speaking on behalf of the constituents of Galway city and county in welcoming what is being proposed here. I have not heard one dissenting voice. People have asked a few questions and I was able to explain to them that this is what I would call a <i>rite de passage</i>, a maturation of the city.  As was mentioned by the Minister and Deputy Molloy, Galway is at least 1,000 years old.  It started as a fishing village at the mouth of the Corrib, on the beautiful Galway Bay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I had a horse of that name.  In time Galway received the great accolade of becoming a corporation and today it has reached the status of borough council.  During that period Galway was noted for its commercial activities and as a great trader with Europe and particularly Spain.  For a while Galway descended in the economic scale but in recent times there was a sudden revival, particularly in areas of high technology. It is a recognition of this growth, of the will of the people to work, their commitment to new industry and their ability, that has brought about the change in status.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach who first mooted this idea and announced it on 1 January last year and I should like to thank the Minister not just for bringing in the order but for allowing expansion of the city.  I think the new boundaries have meant that Galway is the second largest city in the south of Ireland.  We do not have the same population as the other cities that are borough councils but I am sure that Galway with its good financial base will be an attractive city for people to live in and to work and that the new areas will develop to the same standards as the existing city.  One of the problems we will have to face is the prospect of having a two-tier system: in other words, that the existing city would have services of a higher standard than the areas outside. The Minister has given us an opportunity to update those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2526" /> Articles 5.1 and 5.2 refer to the provision of services.  I would go a little further than Deputy Molloy in that connection. Joint services basically mean that the county council will run the library and fire services and the motor taxation office and there will be no representation from the borough council.  The American War of Independence started on the note of no taxation without representation. With that in mind I suggest that article 3 be included with article 5 and the wording could be on the following lines: &ldquo;Notwithstanding article 5.2, the borough council shall not be expected to make any contributions to the cost of any additional improvements and services or new works provided by the county council subsequent to the agreement of 1 January other than agreement between the county council and the new borough council&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Article 6 provides that in five years the borough council can decide to opt out of those services.  It was not clear to me when I read the order whether there would be any provision made at the end of the five years if there was no agreement prior to that whereby the borough council would have to reimburse the county council for those services.  If no agreement is reached between the borough council and the county council, the Minister might consider an addendum to article 6.3 on the following lines: &ldquo;In default of agreement between the county council and the borough council, the financial agreement shall be determined by the Minister&rdquo;.  There is nothing unusual or extreme about that.  I am merely pointing out there is no format for such an agreement in the order.</P>
    <P>I would go as far as Deputy Molloy regarding the contribution by the Minister, namely, the sum of £200,000 or 50 per cent.  It should be possible to include an addendum to article 7 to the effect that a minimum of 50 per cent of this adjustment be paid by way of grant from the Exchequer.  I should like a period of time to be given for this.  I am sure we can depend on the goodwill of the Minister but it would be no harm to write it in.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what we <Col N="2527" /> accept is a great honour for Galway city, which has also been recognised by the county council.  This was reflected in the goodwill shown by the county council when I was a member of that body when they decided without any acrimony to extend and allow the areas in question into the city.  I hope this goodwill will continue and that there will be no disagreement. However, if there is the possibility of acrimony there should be a provision to minimise it, if not eliminate it.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for accepting the invitation to join us on 1 January for our day of celebration.  We will be honoured to have him in Galway. I am sure Deputies on the opposite side will agree with me that Galway city and county are honoured by this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for having met the joint deputation from Galway Corporation and Galway County Council on 30 October.  The Minister and his officials listened to the strong case we made and has gone some way to meet our case.  I would like to repeat the point made by the deputation that there was no conflict with the Minister: we were simply asking the Minister to finance the new status of Galway.  It was a Government decision to give the new status to Galway and we were asking the Government to honour that commitment.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has gone some part of the way by making £200,000 available to finance the change in status, and I welcome that as Chairman of Galway County Council.  Originally we looked for a figure of £423,000, made up of pensions, salaries and road works in the county. This figure will be increasing.  When the Minister is replying he might give us an indication that not only will £200,000 be made available in subsequent years but an increasing amount, as this will be recurring every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the order which has been made.  Article 4 is a general provision enabling the corporation, <Col N="2528" /> county council and Minister to take action to establish the county borough. I presume that anything the Minister will direct will be done between now and 1 January 1986.  If the Minister is to direct the council to do something after 1 January we would like to know the nature of the directive.  We would not like to have the local authorities in Galway different from other local authorities. Perhaps the Minister could answer that when he is replying.  Articles 5 and 6 refer to the services which the county council will continue to provide for a period.  I believe there should not be duplication of the major services, for example the fire and hydro services.  The country's resources are scarce enough and I would like to see the sharing of those services continued.  However, if the corporation wish to terminate the agreement it can be done on an agreed basis or after giving five years notice.  We would like to have the services shared to avoid duplication.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the splitting up of the various statutory demands is important, and I welcome what the Minister has said in the House.  As Deputy Molloy said, we in Galway have very large statutory demands and the statutory demand to the Western Health Board will amount to £2.8 million, including arrears.  We are very concerned by the way these arrears have built up and the way this amount has been calculated down through the years.  Galway County Council are paying 75 per cent of the cost of supplementary welfare to the Western Health Board.  This compares very unfavourably with other health boards. We understand that these arrears will be dealt with over a five year period, but if we have to pay back arrears to the Government on the basis of 75 per cent we are going to be treated in a very unfavourable way.  I hope the Minister will look at this.</P>
    <P>As I understand the provisions for the financial adjustments between both authorities, the county council will be getting £200,000 and will be looking to the corporation for the balance of £223,000.  We shall be discussing this, <Col N="2529" /> the extension of the boundary and the financial implications with the corporation over the next number of weeks. We had agreement between the former county council and corporation on the actual boundary extension of the city.  I hope we can reach agreement on the outstanding matters after much tough talking.  Some members of the present corporation were members of the former Galway County Council and they are well aware of the financial problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister has done in article 8 of the order concerning the excessive charges falling on Ballinasloe Urban District Council.  If this provision was not in the order, the county council demand on Ballinasloe could have increased by as much as 60 per cent. Unless we got the £200,000 from the Minister the county council burden would have been further increased by the amount of money provided to Ballinasloe. The Ballinasloe problem will come up when we are discussing the boundary extension and it will have to be recalculated. As a county councillor from the Ballinasloe area, I am glad that this provision has been made.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of Galway County Council I would like to welcome the Minister to County Galway on 1 January.  He will be most welcome in the city and county. The case for Galway will be put more ably by all my colleagues.  Deputy Molloy is in the privileged position of being a member of both the county council and the corporation and it is no wonder we have reached an amicable arrangement. I hope the council and the corporation will be able to resolve the outstanding problems.  The negotiating team are working on those problems but at the end of the day the Minister has the power in this order to make the final decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>As a rural Deputy I congratulate my urban colleagues and the people of Galway city on the new status they have attained.  I wish to thank the Minister and the Government for recognising the development and the historical contribution it has made to Ireland over the years.  I also thank the Minister for <Col N="2530" /> recognising and acting on some of the recommendations made by the deputation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the difficulty being encountered by both Galway Corporation and the new borough council and the county council.  The agreement which has been hammered out between the two authorities is a unique and historic one in that two statutory bodies in the west have got together and agreed to the division of the area.  We hope they can agree to the financial constraints which will be placed on them.  The Minister recognises that Galway County Council sacrificed their greatest revenue base in allowing the industrial estate in the eastern periphery of the city to become part of the borough council.</P>
      <P>I welcome the contribution by the Department of £200,000 to offset the shortfall of £423,000 to the county council. I trust that this level of contribution will be continued yearly on a <i>pro rata</i> basis in order to ensure that the people of rural Galway will not be denied any of the services that have been available to them up to now.</P>
      <P>Ballinasloe is one of the areas that I represent in this House so I am very pleased to note the provision in the order which will ensure that Ballinasloe Urban District Council and the people of the area will not be victims of the extra charge the council will have to carry. However, it appears that article 8 ensures only that there will be a <i>pro rata</i> increase, in the context of the county charges generally, within the Ballinasloe urban area following the change of status.  It is obvious that there will be a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the Ballinasloe area.  That is all the people of Ballinasloe could be expected to carry but this will mean that the county council will have to make up a major shortfall.  I am asking the Minister to reconsider this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the two authorities have come together and reached an amicable settlement in respect of many matters augurs well for their present negotiations being brought to a satisfactory conclusion. Perhaps this development could be used as a blueprint for the Minister to restructure the whole area of local <Col N="2531" /> authority financing.  Perhaps he would institute a critical examination of this area in the interest of bringing forward solutions to the problems and especially matters such as statutory demands being made on local authorities.  When we are giving new status to the city the Minister might use the opportunity to deal with these problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the various levies, such as the AnCO levy, the ACOT levy, the arterial drainage system and the matter of the maintenance of courthouses. In each of these cases functions are being undertaken for statutory State bodies but in respect of each function the county council and the corporation must make major contributions.  We should ensure that local authorities would not be impeded in providing a proper standard of service for the people but the State should carry its total burden in respect of those bodies that are working to the order of and for the State.  That is why I urge the Minister to put an addendum to the order to the effect that he would consider and examine the future financing of Galway Corporation and county council with a view to removing these statutory demands from them.  This could provide the basis of a blueprint for local government financing and reorganisation in the coming few years.</P>
    <P>In the Western Health Board area a contribution at the rate of almost 76 per cent is being made by Galway Corporation and county council in respect of supplementary welfare.  This represents a rate of between 20 and 50 per cent more than the contribution of other local authorities in other health board areas and is putting severe pressure on local authorities in the west.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Galway city on maintaining this status.  Galway is a historic and especially beautiful city.  I trust that the county council and the corporation will continue to work in harmony in the interests of the people of the west generally and of Galway city and county particularly.</P>

Mar a dúirt an Teachta Molloy, is ócáid speisialta é mar go bhfuil réimse maith Ghaeltachta anois laistigh le theorainn na cathrach nua.  Fáiltimid roimhe sin agus creidimid gur chun sochair don chathair agus don chontae a rachfaidh sé sin.  I thank the Government and particularly the Minister, who tells us that he is three-quarters a Galwayman, for their announcement of the change of status of Galway from a corporation to a county borough area and for their swift implementation of the extension that was agreed so amicably between the elected members and the officials of both authorities.  As one who was not an elected member of either body up to June last I wish to compliment the Mayor, the chairman of the county council, the elected members and the management and staff who worked so hard to bring about this agreement.  They deserve our congratulations and our deep appreciation of the many hours they worked to ensure that agreement was reached on an amicable basis.</P>
      <P>We in the corporation appreciate the revenue lost to the county council, but I would not like anyone to take from that that we are getting a present of £420,000 from the council to do with as we wish. It should be appreciated that in the area that is under county council status up to now, but which will have borough status after 1 January, there will be a tremendous financial burden on the corporation to ensure that the services available now in their area will be extended to the other area and that the level of the services &mdash; for example, public lighting, refuse collection, footpaths and so on, will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2533" /> We are very anxious to hear what the Minister has to say and consequently I will move to the order.  In article 5 of the Schedule, which deals with the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Minister proposes to hold at the 1985 percentage level the borough council contribution in respect of drainage.  We are anxious that the same criteria would be adopted in respect of article 5 on page 3 because, after the change in the status of the county council, if the council decide to expand services in the county &mdash; for example, fire or library services &mdash; the corporation would still have to pay the high percentage of the cost without there being any reference to them.  The borough needs to have control, but they are anxious that the corporation, in terms of future expenditure, would cost the services and pay their own share.  In other words, I am agreeing to the amendment suggested by Deputy Molloy, which is that any new works or improvements to existing works or services after the appointed day would commence only with the agreement of the borough council. That is important.  Though article 6 provides that the corporation can at any time in the future agree with the county council to discontinue any shared arrangements that might be entered into now, the notice must be served and the county council will be given five years to make their own adjustments on services. While we have a manager who is common to both authorities and while there has been tremendous co-operation between the elected members of both bodies, we should envisage a future where there might be separate managers in both cases and where perhaps elected members would not be as responsible or as co-operative as they are now and where perhaps the council might take unfair advantage of that five years notice to decide to expand a service out in the county.  As it stands at the moment the corporation will be left paying a high percentage cost.  That should not be done without the agreement of the corporation. If possible we want that sort of amendment inserted not just in article <Col N="2534" /> 5.2 but at any place in the order where reference is made to article 5.2</P>
    <P>We are thankful for the additional grant allocation of £200,000 which the Minister announced in the Seanad last week and in the Dáil today, as an adjustment in 1986 because of this change of status to the county council.  We would like to ensure that there is a very specific commitment by the Minister, if possible written into the order, that that would be done over a period of years to allow for a smooth readjustment.  Like the other Deputies, I assure the Minister of a warm welcome on his official visit to Galway borough on 1 January 1986, as a Galwegian. Maybe we could say that Santa Claus came early to Galway city, though we are not quite happy that he filled the stockings as much as we would have liked.  Perhaps he might make some adjustments at a later stage.</P>

      <P>This has been a very constructive debate in which a general welcome has been given to what the Government have been endeavouring to achieve for Galway in raising it to the status of a county borough which reflects the importance of Galway city as the capital of the west.  I thank all Deputies who have spoken so generously about the initiative that has been taken.  It is only natural on these occasions, even with what has been achieved, that Deputies would say that more should have been done in certain areas.  However, the tenor of today's debate was one of satisfaction generally.  There were a number of queries on how the disengagement will take place.  I hope that the goodwill that has been the hallmark of this debate at local authority level will continue in the disengagement of services over the designated period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy and many others are concerned that the corporation pursuant to article 5.2 of the draft order should not be required to make a contribution to the new services or works undertaken by the county council in the county area, subsequent to the appointed day.  They were concerned that the county council would, <Col N="2535" /> for instance, in respect of fire services, embark on the construction of fire stations in the county to which the corporation pursuant to article 5.2 would have to pay a contribution.  That is very unlikely.  Under article 5.2 the corporation will have to pay the county council for the service which the county council provides in the area of the county borough. Payment will be determined on the basis of what the corporation would have paid for the service, had the county borough not been established.  However, the two local authorities will not be tied to this formula.  They will be able under article 5.3 to agree to different terms and conditions for the provision of the services by the county council.  In the event of the county council embarking on a major programme of construction of fire stations, for example, in the county, it would be open to both authorities to agree on different terms under this subarticle. This is extremely unlikely and it will not happen in the circumstances.  My whole approach to the upgrading of Galway to county borough status has been to assume that both authorities will operate on the basis of goodwill and common sense.</P>
    <P>I would be very reluctant to modify the draft order in any way which might suggest that goodwill and common sense will not prevail.  To do so would be tantamount to insulting one or other local authority and would call into question the goodwill which has existed up to now.  I am happy to argue on behalf of the county council that they will continue to act reasonably and responsibly and that they are unlikely to launch a major programme of expenditure designed to steal an advantage on the county borough.  In the event that genuine changes of expenditure levels arise subsequent to the appointed day, I am satisfied that the county council will be willing to negotiate the terms under article 5.3 from the point of view of the Minister for the Environment who is charged with the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the new status for the city and who <Col N="2536" /> must therefore act in a way which is fair to both authorities.  This is the sensible approach.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the lead in time for undertaking a major expansion programme in any service area is considerable having regard to the necessary planning, site acquisition and so on. In many cases new projects would be subject to sanction by my Department who would have to take account of the needs and concerns of both authorities. If at the end of the day and against all reasonable expectations a major problem were to arise, it would be open to me to amend the present order to deal with the situation.  I have every confidence that this will not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy expressed some concern about Galway's liability in respect of supplementary welfare.  As the Deputy is aware, the local authorities are being relieved of the obligation to contribute towards this scheme and he can rest assured that in deciding on the rate support grant allocation for the year, I will be going a long way towards correcting the anomalies to which Deputy Molloy referred regarding the allocations and I will take account of the concerns expressed by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that, around my part of the world.  Deputy Coogan raised a point in relation to Ministerial involvement in the disengagement of some of the services.  The Deputy suggested that a provision for ministerial involvement be included in article 6 to deal with the situation where the corporation and the county council failed to agree the terms and conditions in relation to services in respect of which the corporation serve notice of their intention to <Col N="2537" /> provide a service themselves.  I cannot accept a need for ministerial involvement. Experience of the co-operation and goodwill that exists between the corporation and the county council suggests that it will be possible for them to agree an operative date for the transfer of any service which the corporation wish to provide and that they will also be able to agree appropriate terms and conditions in relation to any such service.  In the unlikely event of the two authorities being unable to agree on the operative date, it is likely that they will agree terms and conditions in relation to the service in question because it would be in the best interests of both of them to do so. This is because the corporation would have to build up their capability in relation to the services in question while the county council would correspondingly have to scale down their capability. The inescapable logic is that both authorities would come to a mutually beneficial understanding.  Even if it were to happen that the corporation and the county council could not agree on the operative date or on the terms and conditions, article 6 would cater adequately for such a situation. The corporation would not take over responsibility for the relevant service until five years after giving notice to the county council.  That period would give the two authorities adequate time in which to adjust themselves to the new arrangements and effect all the necessary changes for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in such a case, therefore, I would not accept that there is a need to provide for a Minister to adjudicate on terms and conditions.  However, I should say that I foresee the possibility of such a situation arising as a very remote one.  I have every confidence that all matters relating to the provision of services will be resolved locally.  I appreciate the Deputy's constructive concern to ensure that eventualities are adequately catered for in the order.  Article 6 makes comprehensive provision for the taking over of the services in the city by the corporation.  I do not consider there is any need for ministerial involvement in the matter, particularly in view of the goodwill and <Col N="2538" /> good sense demonstrated by the corporation and county council up to now.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would request that the Deputy withdraw his amendment.  As I said earlier, it would be possible to amend the order at a later stage should any unforeseen problems arise.  I would have no hesitation in doing so should difficulties arise in the operation of the disengagement.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kitt, Geoghegan-Quinn and others asked about statutory demands. At present the county council are liable for the demands of the Office of Public Works in respect of the maintenance of drainage works which have been carried out over the last century.  The financing of these demands has been a county at large charge and accordingly the borough has been liable for a proportion of those demands.  Obviously it would be grossly unfair to the county council if the county borough did not continue to make a contribution towards these liabilities which have grown up over the last century. Therefore what the order proposes is that separate demands would be served on the county council and on the county borough by the Office of Public Works and that the county borough should continue to meet the same proportion in respect of which it would have been liable had it remained a borough.  I should add that this arrangement will apply only in respect of works carried out prior to 1 January.  In respect of works carried out after that date the full liability will fall to be met by the authority in whose areas the works are located.</P>
    <P>Regarding the arrears of statutory demands, I should say that substantial arrears have grown up in respect of drainage demands and demands of the Western Health Board in respect of supplementary welfare going back a number of years.  Here the order proposes that the county borough should continue to be liable for a proportion of such arrears on the same basis as if it had remained a borough.  Local authorities are liable for demands for a wide variety of bodies in respect of services provided. Most of these demands are county at large charges and, on the establishment <Col N="2539" /> of the county borough, such demands will in the future be served separately on the county council and the county borough corporation by the bodies concerned. Examples of such demands would include those from the Local Appointments Commission, the Computer Services Board and the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, an amendment in the name of Deputy Woods has been ruled out of order because it involves a potential charge on Revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment which has been ruled out of order reads:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;The number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall not be more than fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 1 proposes that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall be increased from 14 to 15 for a limited period, and the limited period is spelled out in subsection (2) which says:</P>
      <P>This section shall cease to be in force on the day on which a vacancy amongst the ordinary judges of the High Court first occurs after the 2nd day of April, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the High Court is concerned, the Minister is seeking our agreement to an additional post at High Court level being created now, that post to cease on the first occasion after 2 April 1987 on which a vacancy occurs.  In other words, the Minister wants to fill now the vacancy which will occur at that time rather than filling it on 3 April 1987.  I have serious reservations about what the Minister is doing.  For example, if the Minister considered it possible that an election would take place in the next six to nine months, that would afford the Government an opportunity to instal a further judge now <Col N="2541" /> who would continue to be there when the vacancy occurred on, say, 3 April 1987. In effect it amounts to a Government filling a post in advance.  Surely that must be quite an exceptional arrangement.  If there was a change of Government in the meantime it would deny any incoming Government the opportunity of filling a normal vacancy as it occurred.  That must be very suspect.  It was for that reason that I suggested in my amendment that the number of ordinary judges of the High Court shall not be more than 15.  If the Government want to appoint somebody at this stage, for temporary business or whatever, why not increase the number to 15, leave it at 15 and let the Government of the day decide whether they want to refill posts which are vacated at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>I was confirmed in that view by the fact that there are various other things happening which would require the services of High Court judges.  For example, I am sure the Government will pledge themselves to the establishment of a family court.  Certainly we shall be pressing them to do so.  There was all party agreement at the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown on the importance of having a family court established urgently and having a High Court judge specifically allocated to that court.  There are various ramifications in that in relation to the number of judges from the Circuit Court and High Court who might be involved and they would have to be worked out.  If that is to happen it would appear that the Government of the day might very effectively make use of an additional judge in that interim period. There are other suggestions, particularly in relation to family law, which could result in an extra demand on personnel at High Court level.  It seemed to me that the logical thing to do was to increase the number of judges approved by the House to 15 in the way it has been done in the past and then to leave it to the Government of the day to decide whether they fill any vacancy occurring.  Here the Government are filling a vacancy in advance and that, naturally, must raise suspicions about why it is being done in <Col N="2542" /> this way.  Perhaps the Minister will give us his views on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is very unusual to be debating an amendment which has already been ruled out of order.  It is not in the least unusual to be replying to Deputy Woods who seems to make contributions not on the merits of the case; he seems always to look behind a provision and then comes up with some innuendo about the <i>mala fides</i> of the Government or the Minister.  We are putting up a proposal to appoint an extra judge for about 15 months because of the backlog, especially on the civil side, in the courts and we feel the need for an extra judge for about 15 months.  We do not need a permanent appointment and our best estimation at the moment is that if we had an extra judge for a short period that would cut down on the backlog.</P>
      <P>We have done an enormous amount already.  I would like to pay tribute to the President of the High Court for what he has done in cutting down on the enormous backlog in civil cases, which was running up to three years when I became Minister.  Now it is down to about 12 months all around the country in Dublin, Limerick and various other places where the High Court sits, with the exception of Cork.  As late as last spring Cork was still running with lists of 27 or 28 months. It would take almost two and a half years to get a case heard.  Again, the President of the High Court made arrangements, and that is cut down to 18 months.  We think that if we had an extra judge we could bring it down to about 11 months, which is about the appropriate period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kind of case we have in mind will never be heard a month or two months after it is set down.  We are talking about a typical road accident case.  By the time somebody has been treated for the injuries received, has come out of hospital and has recuperated and the doctors are in a position to give a medical opinion of the damage from the injury inflicted on the person, we are talking about nine or ten <Col N="2543" /> months anyway from the date of the accident. Therefore, you cannot push it below that point.  It has come to a point where the civil lists have been cut down enormously on the jury side to about 12 months, with the exception of Cork, and down to three months on the non-jury side, which again is about as far as it can go.  We did this by providing better accommodation both in Dublin and Cork so that there were extra physical courts where judges could sit, but it was done principally by the organisational ability of the present President of the High Court and his immediate predecessor who did a tremendous job in this respect.</P>
    <P>We are not doing anything here which is not straightforward and which is not clear on the face of the Bill.  Our estimation is that if there was an extra High Court judge for 12 or 15 months then the backlog could be cleared totally.  Fewer cases are being set down now than in the past.  The present complement of judges could deal adequately with what is being set down now &mdash; we know that from the statistics &mdash; but if we had the extra man to deal with the backlog, then it would go back again to the complement of judges which is there now.</P>
    <P>We picked 2 April 1987 because there is to be a retirement from the Bench on 3 April 1987.  One member of the High Court will reach retirement age then. Also, a High Court judge must have a registrar, a crier, driver and so on, and the appointment is not just the salary of the judge.  It involves consequential appointments and a certain amount of money is involved in it as well.  We do not want that position to hold permanently if it is not necessary.  If my best estimation of the need is incorrect, &mdash; I or anybody else who is in my job &mdash; can come back in April 1987 with a simple piece of legislation to provide an extra appointment.</P>
    <P>On the implication that somehow or other we are advancing an appointment of a judge so that Fianna Fáil will be deprived of an appointment, if Fianna Fail come into Government and want to appoint 100 High Court judges they are quite free to bring in a Bill saying that <Col N="2544" /> they will appoint 100 High Court judges. We are depriving them of nothing whatsoever. The opportunity is there.  We are doing this now to meet a problem in a particular way.  It is additional to the measures we have taken already and we believe that the extra High Court judge for a period of 14 or 15 months &mdash; I intend the appointment to be made in early January &mdash; will eliminate the backlog, and then the present complement of judges, 14 plus the President of the High Court, would be quite adequate to deal with what is being set down at the moment. There is nothing cute or tricky about this. It is absolutely straightforward.  There is no need to look for motives behind the Bill.  The motive is straightforward. There is a backlog which is particularly bad in Cork.  When one extra judge clears the backlog the present complement of judges will be adequate to deal with the situation from there on in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>From the picture the Minister has painted in his Second Stage speech we see that the waiting period has been cut down to ten months in Dundalk and 12 months in Dublin and now 18 months in the Cork area.  Is the delay now caused by a lack of judges in Cork or by some other reason?  The Bill was circulated on 5 June 1985.  Why is there a rush to take it at this stage and why was there no rush to take this Bill &mdash; a very simple Bill &mdash; and get it under way this year and get to work on the backlog?  The Minister has told us that one of the judges is due to retire on 3 April 1987.  Of course, we must guess at this and look behind the Bill to try to find out.  There was no explanatory memorandum with the Bill. The Minister says that this is a simple, short Bill, but an explanatory memorandum would have made it a little clearer. On replying to Second Stage the Minister of State told us that a judge was due to retire on that date.  Could the Minister tell us when the other High Court judges are due to retire?  I take it that this retirement which is due on 3 April 1987 is the first.</P>

Therefore, there will be a vacancy in January.  I intend to go to Government in early January to fill the vacancy that occurs in January and, if this Bill passes through both Houses, to fill the vacancy which is provided for here. Therefore, I envisage two new High Court judges being appointed.</P>
      <P>We do not appoint High Court judges on a political basis.  They have not been political in their actions.  We are very interested in good judges at the moment.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy asked about Cork and I should like to tell him that one of the problems there was a lack of an extra courtroom to <Col N="2546" /> clear the backlog.  Even if a judge was available there was not accommodation to hold a court.  It is no harm to repeat my view that I do not think the legal profession in Cork organised themselves very well to clear the backlog.  There may have been too few people operating at senior level.  The President of the High Court by going down himself and calling all the cases earlier in the year cut the backlog substantially.  It is not so much a question of the cases that go through the courts, it is getting cases to the door of the court so that people settle.  Most of the cases on the list never go through the court but if there is a backlog of two or three years nobody is interested in settling.  The nearer a case gets to the door of the court the greater the propensity to settle it.</P>
      <P>If insurance companies and others can see that once a case is set down it will be in the court after ten months many of the cases will never get to court because they will be settled.  That is the way to clear the backlog.  It will be up to the President of the High Court to designate a judge to Cork but if one is appointed to that area the backlog will be reduced further.  If we could cut another two months off the position in Dublin it would be an improvement.  I believe that ten months is the optimum and I do not think we can go below that because of personal injuries and so on.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  My information is that the next appointment will be December 1990 and the one after that will be 2000.  I am glad the Minister outlined his concern about the legal profession in Cork in regard to delays because that concern has been expressed to me.  I wonder how much of the delay is due to the legal profession and how much of it would be rectified by the appointment of an additional judge.  I appreciate that the appointment of an additional judge would result in pressure being put on those involved to get things up to date.  Will the Minister tell the House what happens if a person dies early next year?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Subsection (a) provides that the number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court, judges other than the President, shall not be more than 15.  At present there are 12 ordinary Circuit Court judges and two temporary judges.  The intention is that the temporary judges will be made permanent, making 14 permanent judges. There will be one extra appointment and I understand that it is the intention of the President of the Circuit Court to appoint that person to Cork where there are delays on the Circuit Court side.  Deputy Woods will be aware that the practice of appointing temporary judges may not be the best method in modern times.  The Judiciary should be independent and be seen to be so.  The concept of appointing <Col N="2548" /> people on a temporary basis at the pleasure of the Government seems to conflict with that.  That is one of the reasons we are introducing this section.</P>
      <P>It is because of the pressure of business that a change is being made.  Deputies may be interested to know that in 1928 there were ten judges; in 1947, 11; in 1960, ten; in 1961, nine; in 1964, ten; in 1977, 12 and in 1981, 13.  The number has fluctuated over the years.</P>

It is crucial to the operation of the judicial system that the independence of the Judiciary be seen.  What is the position in regard to retirements?  When are retirements expected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One can appreciate that it is desirable to have permanent as distinct from temporary appointments but the Minister will acknowledge that there has not been any sense of insecurity to the Executive of the day as far as I am aware in every case in regard to temporary appointments.  While there may have been one exception some considerable time ago I understand that all temporary appointees were made permanent.  I do not think it is the Minister's intention to leave the implication on the record that the practice is that people hold office at the favour of the Government and if they discharge their responsibilities in a way that pleases the Government they will be made permanent and if not they will not. My view is that the record is quite the opposite; all temporary appointees have been made permanent.  I do not know if that is a matter of major significance and I do not think it was to get rid of any doubt judges might have while temporary office holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who practise in our courts acknowledge the need for additional judges but they also hold the view that extra judges without more adequate accommodation would be unsatisfactory. In many of our courts at every level the <Col N="2549" /> accommodation is entirely inadequate.  I attended Dundalk Circuit Court recently and I was in a position to assess the accommodation available there.  I suggest that the Minister's advisers visit that court which is used on occasions for High Court sittings and view the accommodation which is unacceptable for litigants. I am not so concerned about lawyers but it is not acceptable to have one or two consultation rooms to cope with a variety of cases.  People have to have consultations on matters of great importance to them in hallways and corridors and, on occasions, outside the courthouse.</P>
    <P>I would like an indication of what proposals generally the Minister has to ensure that accommodation will measure up to the standards necessary, particularly in view of the extra appointments. Secondly, judges do not operate in isolation. They require adequate staff in every sense.  I am speaking here particularly in terms of Circuit Court staff and the effectivenes of the staff available to the county registrars.  There are very many cases of which the Minister must be aware and he has mentioned Cork.  In Cork, Kilkenny, Tipperary, or anywhere, there are many judgments of the courts which are not capable of being executed because of lack of adequate staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The Ceann Comhairle will appreciate that a judge does not reach judgments in isolation. It is very important that the decisions of the court are capable of being implemented, otherwise the functions of the court and the Judiciary of whom we speak here are undermined.  It is vitally important that we ensure that there is an adequate back-up staff and, quite frankly, at present there is not.  Even a casual inquiry around the offices of our Circuit Courts here as elsewhere, will demonstrate that we do not have <Col N="2550" /> adequate staff and the decisions of the court are not capable of being effectively executed.  If there is one way of undermining the authority of the Judiciary, that is it.  That would not be what the Minister would want, but that is the reality.  I would like to get on the record assurances from the Minister that the inadequate staffing position at the moment will be corrected.  If the Minister suggests that staffing is entirely adequate, then we are living in two different worlds.  If he acknowledges that it is inadequate, what proposals has he to unsure that the courts can operate effectively?</P>
      <P>In relation to the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts, which is a very important element in the Circuit Court jurisdiction, the truth is that when people have actually being sentenced in accordance with the law of this land in many cases there is not accommodation for them in prisons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that additional judicial services are required. I often wonder if that, in itself, is ever going to meet the needs and requirements for the speedy attaining of justice, which is what it is all about.  At present in many of the courts it is taking far too long to get a trial.  The saying is, justice delayed is justice denied.  There are, however, additional matters which should be looked at very seriously, to try to shorten procedures and to avoid much of the apparent contention between parties on law cases which at the end of the day turn out not to be there.  It very often happens, probably in most cases, that in the two or three years from the time the case starts to when it is finally disposed of, great inter-party disputes are going on into all sorts of issues which, when they come to hearing at the end of the day, fade away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in other jurisdictions a procedure which operates to try to avoid this, at which we should take a long, hard look.  It is at a very early stage of the case that an official of the court &mdash; not a judge. but a subordinate official, a master, registrar, or other official, somebody of that category &mdash; calls the two parties in together and goes through the case to see what is agreed between them and what is not agreed.  In many cases a very large proportion of the necessity for grudgery and witnesses and preparation and so forth and a great deal of expense and trouble are avoided.  We would get far better value for the legal services which are provided at great expense if we used subordinate officials who are capable and able to bring the points to fruition.  The judge would be left to deal only with <Col N="2555" /> those points found to be in contention between the two parties.</P>
    <P>There is another minor aspect where a great deal of time could be saved.  The problem of calling medical doctors as witnesses takes up a great deal of time and for the most part it ought to be unnecessary. Changes in the rules of court should be provided to ensure that in most cases the medical reports on both sides will be admitted as evidence without the necessity of calling the doctors.  This would be a great saving in time and expense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would add my words of welcome to this improvement in increasing even temporarily the number of High Court judges.  This is a follow-on from the 1984 Courts Bill which was the first step.  The Minister was lambasted because the Bill was doing too little and wasting the time of the House.  He made a promise of more to come.  I and other Members mentioned this problem and pleaded with the Minister to apply his energies to speed up the administration of justice in the courts.  What I cannot understand about the problem of High Court delays&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister already has power to increase the number of Circuit Court judges and it has worked far better than the High Court in the past few years. One can get a fairly speedy service from the Circuit Court.  I do not understand why economic reasons are given for not having extra judges.  I do not think anybody would complain if we had even a surfeit of judges or an extra one, two or three.  The cost to the State would not be that much, compared to the awful hardship and the cost to other services by <Col N="2556" /> not having such judges.  I do not see why we cannot have speedy justice in our courts.  The economics do not justify any delay, particularly in relation to road traffic accidents where delays result in severe hardships on people involved. Although it is not intended, we are helping the insurance companies to reach lower settlements with their clients because they cannot afford to wait around.  The recent decision that hospital bills will have to be paid out of any settlement will increase the pressure on people to accept a lower settlement from an insurance company.</P>
      <P>I am glad this area is being tackled and any improvement is welcome.  I should like these appointments made permanent, if necessary.  While I disagree with the provisions in many Bills whereby Ministers can make orders without having to seek the approval of the House, in this case he should have the authority to make any appointments necessary without coming back to the House.  There is no dispute about the Government's intention to appoint two temporary judges.  In the end there may be only one permanent judge.  There will be a general welcome throughout the country for improvements in this area.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Section 14 (1) (b) of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, as inserted by section 2 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1981, provides that in the event of either the President or an ordinary judge of the High Court being appointed to the Law Reform Commission the statutory number of High Court judges may be increased to 15 so that a replacement may be appointed.  No such appointment has in fact been made.  Mr. Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court is chairman of the commission.  The substitution proposed in this section will amend the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, by changing the base number so that the appointment of a High Court judge to the Law Reform Commission may still be made if and when required.  It is simply changing the number from 15 to 16 to allow for a possible appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under European Community rules, member states are prohibited from providing operating or investment aid to steel undertakings after 1985.</P>
      <P>When I moved the Supplementary Estimate in the Dáil last July, I indicated that the Government were not prepared to provide additional funds to Irish Steel unless there was agreement between the company and their workforce on a cost-cutting rationalisation package which involved: (i) a pay freeze to the end of 1986; (ii) a redundancy scheme which would have the effect of reducing the company's present labour costs by at least 10 per cent, and (iii) the elimination of restrictive practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also indicated that the Government were not prepared to support Irish Steel at any price as the taxpayer had already contributed handsomely to the maintenance of employment at Irish Steel.  On the other hand, I indicated that the Government were very conscious of the <Col N="2560" /> adverse impact that the closure of the company would have on the economic life of the Cork region.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the rationalisation measures were eventually accepted by Irish Steel employees and this cleared the way for the payment of £6 million to the company.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision last July to invest an additional £6 million, I requested the board to reassess all aspects of the company's operations with a view to making the Haulbowline plant more efficient, productive and, hopefully, profitable.  I also asked Irish Steel to continue their investigations towards finding a joint venture partner or third party investor.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel had just four months to report back to me about the prospects of the company becoming financially viable. I have considered very carefully the submission made to me by the company in mid-November.  On my recommendation and having regard to the company's financial projections, the Government have decided to invest a further £18 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline to the House some of the main considerations which prompted the Government to approve this additional investment.  There have been a number of positive developments in recent months which resulted in Irish Steel being able to demonstrate that, at long last, there is a real prospect of the company having a long term future.  The most obvious development is the saving which will result following on the acceptance by Irish Steel's workforce of the package of cost-cutting proposals put forward by the board of Irish Steel.  Last July, I said that as a first step towards achieving viability, the company's workforce would have to make sacrifices and should recognise the acute financial position of the company.  Despite a hiccup or two, along the way, a sensible cost-cutting package was duly accepted.  The realism displayed by Irish Steel's workers augurs well for the future but I must emphasise the absolute necessity for the longer term continuation of this realism. By accepting a pay freeze until the end <Col N="2561" /> of 1986 and in accepting 117 redundancies, the company should cut costs in excess of £3 million in the 18-month period to the end of 1986.  In other words, the company's labour costs will be reduced by over 10 per cent on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The second factor which has improved Irish Steel's position is the recent decrease in scrap prices.  As scrap represents nearly 34 per cent of the cost per tonne of finished steel any significant price development affecting this essential raw material impacts quite significantly on the financial prospects of the company. I explained to the House last July that a main cause of Irish Steel's poor performance in 1984-85 was the high price of scrap relative to the sales price of steel.  The fall in scrap prices which was evident in July has continued and while it is very difficult to say if this reduction will be maintained there are some signs that the market has stabilised somewhat.  I would hope the price of scrap will not exceed its current level and allowing for seasonal variations in prices, that the average price Irish Steel pays will not increase in real terms over the years.</P>
    <P>Although Irish Steel have been successful in achieving a gradual build-up in sales volume, they have found it very difficult to increase their prices in the face of keen competition in a depressed market.  There have, however, been some signs of a very modest recovery in prices in their markets in 1985 and it is hoped that this will continue into 1986. Latest reports from Brussels are that the market is relatively stable.  The Commission is, however, very cautious about forecasts for the steel market and its report <i>General Objectives 1990</i> indicates that price increases will continue to be modest in the years ahead.  I should point out that a relatively small variation in the selling price of steel and in variable costs such as scrap could have a substantial effect either favourable or unfavourable, on the company's financial position.  This said, I am encouraged that Irish Steel, so far in their financial year (which ends on 30 June 1986), are achieving the prices <Col N="2562" /> they had projected, which was not the case in previous years.</P>
    <P>The fourth factor which has influenced the Government in taking their decision to invest more money in Irish Steel, is the results of consultancy studies which have been carried out in recent months into practically all aspects of the company's operations.  The board of Irish Steel, management and employees must do their utmost to implement, with an urgency which I could not over-emphasise, the improvements in working practices and operational efficiencies which have been identified by the consultants. Any failure in this regard can only be detrimental to the company's long term interests.</P>
    <P>The final factor which has worked in Irish Steel's favour in recent months is the value of the dollar and a consequential reduction in interest payments.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that a further £18 million should be invested in Irish Steel before the end of the year. This will bring to £24 million the total amount of State investment in the company in 1985.  This is the maximum amount which the Government may provide to Irish Steel in 1985 under the ECSC aids code for steel undertakings.  Of the £24 million, £6 million has already been paid to the company.  The House will recall that a Supplementary Estimate was passed on 10 July this year to enable a grant of £5 million to be paid to the company in the period to December 1985.  An additional £1 million was provided by way of share capital under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the additional investment of £18 million in Irish Steel by way of advance from the Central Fund and to provide retrospectively for the conversion into share capital of the £5 million grant already paid to the company.  The Bill also provides for a reduction in the statutory limit on State guaranteed borrowings bringing this into line with the amount of guaranteed borrowings currently held by the company.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the provisions of the Bill are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2563" />&mdash;to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Ltd. from £120 million to £125 million;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to provide, as a consequence, a similar increase in the value of the shares which the Minister for Finance may take up;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to reduce the limit to which the Minister may guarantee borrowings by Irish Steel from £100 million to £32 million; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; to enable the Minister for Finance to advance up to £18 million to the company from the Central Fund. </P>
    <P>The House and indeed the taxpayer will want to know why such a substantial sum as £18 million is now being provided to Irish Steel.  Deputies might well ask why a sum below £18 million would not suffice.  In answer to this question, I would first of all point out that the £18 million is being provided to the company by way of an advance from the Central Fund.  Certain conditions are being attached to the advance.  For instance, the Exchequer will be able to recoup part or all of these funds in due course, should they at any time become surplus to the company's requirements, which I hope they do.  I should stress that there is no set time for the repayment of the advance and that any demand for repayment will take account of the company's financial position at the time, and their ability to make a repayment.  Given the vast investment which the State has already made in the company, I consider it is not unreasonable to expect Irish Steel to repay the advance to the Exchequer, when the company's financial position permits.</P>
    <P>The additional £18 million will be used by the company to repay one of their State guaranteed loans; to meet increased working capital requirements which will arise as the company continue to increase their level of output; and to cover capital expenditure items.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might explain a very important point.  This £18 million equity is being <Col N="2564" /> used to reduce debt which is already guaranteed by the Exchequer.  This means that if the company were to close we would have to pay this £18 million one way or the other.  What we are doing by converting it into equity is making sure that the company will not have to pay the interest to the banks.  We are not increasing the State's exposure, but simply saying that the State will have to pay the interest, not the company.  That is the essential effect of this transaction. We are not giving them £18 million, we are simply transferring the responsibility for the interest on £18 million because if the company were to close the State would have to find some money since all borrowings are guaranteed by the State. I hope that will be taken into account and that this £18 million will not be seen as a gift to Irish Steel.  We are converting debt, which we already guarantee, into equity on which we hope eventually to get a profit, but not immediately, and the effect will be to reduce the financial charges facing the company and, unfortunately, increase those facing the State. That may not be explained as fully as it should be in my circulated speech and I wanted to put it on record in case tomorrow's headlines screeched a story which may not be entirely in &ldquo;synch&rdquo; with the facts, although I know that rarely happens.</P>
    <P>The main reason why the Government accepted that further investment should be made in Irish Steel was the clear improvement in the company's forecasts and the indication that the company are capable of making a trading profit and a net profit in the not too distant future. The Government would view with grave concern any significant deviation from the company's financial projections, particularly if Irish Steel make trading losses and the additional Exchequer funds were being used to finance such losses.</P>
    <P>For some months now, the company's chairman and chief executive have had discussions, on my instructions, with potential joint venture partners.  I have asked the company's chairman to continue to search for a partner.  I would add <Col N="2565" /> that the Government's commitment to support Irish Steel with additional investment will improve the company's prospect of finding a potential partner.</P>
    <P>It is important that the House understand why I asked Irish Steel to look for a joint venture partner.  It is not that we want to achieve a position where the Government no longer own 100 per cent of the company, but we want to achieve a situation where the company's debt will be reduced, hence the interest charges they have to pay will be reduced.  If somebody buys a share in the company for cash, and that cash is used to reduce debt, then the ongoing expenses of the company are thus reduced and the prospect of the survival of the company is increased.</P>
    <P>The relevance of a joint venture partner is, first, that the money invested would be used to reduce the debt, hence to reduce continuing interest charges and to improve the company's prospects.  The Government cannot invest more than we do because the ECSC rules do not allow it, but if the company can make a deal with another investor, that is not forbidden by ECSC rules.  The effect of that investment would be the same as a further equity injection in the sense that it would further reduce debt levels which, even after this injection, will be too high, and consequently the interest payments would be too high.</P>
    <P>The second reason why it makes sense to look for a joint venture partner is that Irish Steel is a small single plant in a very big and aggressive market-place and association with another company, which is bigger or has other technical or marketing capacities, to bring to the board of Irish Steel and the policy of the company, would be valuable in ensuring Irish Steel's long term survival.  That is why I am glad the company's chairman has spent an enormous amount of time travelling around the world looking for a joint venture partner.  This is an extremely valuable exercise, which, if successful &mdash; and I cannot guarantee that it will be, nor can the chairman &mdash; will further strengthen the position of the company.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to <Col N="2566" /> pay a personal tribute to the chairman. Mr. Kevin McCourt, for the work he has done in the company over the last few months and in particular for the personal effort he has put into this joint venture activity which had to be undertaken, alongside other internal matters.</P>
    <P>The House may be aware that I asked my Department to make an application to the EC Commission to secure funds from the European Coal and Steel Community to assist Irish Steel workers who were made redundant in recent months. When the workers voted on the company's rationalisation plan last August, the availability or otherwise of EC funds for redundant workers was a key issue.  I have been keeping a close eye on developments since the application was lodged with the Commission.  I understand that a decision on the application is expected before Christmas and funds could be paid in the early New Year, all going well.  It will be recalled that we have applied for £832,000 in respect of a package of social measures which includes redundancy lump sum payments, tideover allowances, which are a supplement to unemployment benefit, as well as allowances for early retirement, wage support and retraining.  I am hopeful of a Commission decision very soon though it is possible that we may not get a positive response in regard to all these areas.  If the Commission indicate their willingness to provide funds in the New Year I am sure this will be welcomed by the House and the redundant workers and their families.</P>
    <P>Deputies should appreciate that Irish Steel are trading in a difficult environment. It would be unrealistic to expect a dramatic improvement in the steel market in the foreseeable future.  The surplus production capacity in Europe, combined with the liberalisation of the quota system may well put a downward pressure on prices.  The behaviour of exchange rates and, in particular, changes in the dollar rate, can have a substantial impact on results.  Thus the company's path to viability will, to a very large extent, depend on Irish Steel achieving significant efficiencies and <Col N="2567" /> improvements in productivity and, above all, reducing costs to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to Irish Steel's employees and their union representatives. The realism and co-operation displayed by them in accepting the rationalisation measures clearly demonstrated a high degree of commitment and loyalty to the company.  There is no doubt that they have made a major contribution towards securing the future of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the morale of Irish Steel's employees and management must have suffered because of the uncertainty facing the Haulbowline plant over the past few months.  By committing further scarce Exchequer resources the Government have.  I hope, reassured the company's workforce that Irish Steel have a future and a future that is worth working for.  The task facing Irish Steel in the coming years should not be underestimated. The company and their workforce must do all in their power to produce as much steel as possible and more competitively and efficiently than has been the case in the past.  For example, yield factors can be improved significantly in my view.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it is my view that Irish Steel have the potential to reverse their fortunes and to make a modest net profit in the foreseeable future.  Because of this the Government have done all within their power to assist the company.  Under EC rules, no more money may be made available to Irish Steel from the Exchequer. The success or otherwise of this Cork company rests fairly and squarely in the hands of their board, management and workforce themselves.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend it for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a ongoing measure we were expecting in view of the debates on Supplementary Estimates and indications earlier in the year.  In July 1985 we had a Supplementary Estimate for £5 million for Irish Steel and £1 million in equity was given to them <Col N="2568" /> to help them to survive&mdash;those were the words used at the time.  The money was given to allow the company to meet their commitments to the end of the year and it was said that the question of the remaining money would be considered in the light of what might happen in the meantime in the company.</P>
      <P>In the last part of his contribution the Minister paid tribute to the workers of Irish Steel but I wish to do this at the beginning of my contribution.  The commitment of the workers to survive must be acknowledged by everyone.  One of the main factors in that commitment was the experience gained by other firms in the region who suffered closures and redundancies.  When debating the Supplementary Estimate on 10 July last the Minister said that the Government had considered the option of closure.  This is stated in columns 1394 and 1395 in the Official Report.  We condemned that attitude of waving the big stick over people. The horrifying experience of closure of factories in the Cork area in recent years was the main factor that motivated the workers in Irish Steel to agree to the terms issued at that time for survival of the company.  I am pleased that the option of closure of the factory did not require to be considered further.  The workforce must get our highest commendation. The jobs of 100 people were sacrificed in order that the plant should survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always contended that the steel plant at Haulbowline, the only one in the country, is a national asset and it behoves all of us, the Government Opposition, management, board and workers, to ensure that that asset should survive and thrive.  This Bill gives effect to the financial commitments and arrangements already outlined and it gives effect to the request of the Government to the European Commission in May 1985 for approval to invest additional equity to the amount of £24 million in Irish Steel.  I agree with the Minister that we would not like to read headlines that gave the impression that Cork is getting £18 million to allow Irish Steel to keep going.  I agree that could be <Col N="2569" /> a misleading interpretation of this Bill. We sought from the Commission approval to invest additional equity to the tune of £24 million.  However, it should be said that we were not alone in our request to the European Commission. Other countries were making similar requests; the Germans made a request for £350 million, the Italians for £5,000 million and the French for £250 million.</P>
    <P>We should also acknowledge the benefit of Irish Steel to the economy. Figures I had at mid-year indicated that the benefit to the economy was in the order of £24.85 million and the operations at Irish Steel benefited our balance of payments to the extent of £45 million. In July we were told that the company's balance at 30 June 1985 was £7.5 million. at 5 July it was £3.4 million, by mid-August it was £1.4 million and we were told that by September it would be down to £700,000.  Irish Steel had been given a sum of £89 million, much of the money to pay off the original borrowings that were used to modernise the plant.  I am saying these things so that the rest of the country does not consider we are getting special treatment to recover from the ashes into which we have fallen in recent times.</P>
    <P>I had intended to ask the Minister for the up-to-date position of the Government's application to the European Coal and Steel Commission for aid for redundant workers.  That commitment was given last July.  I note from the Minister's speech that he hopes an announcement will be made during this month.  It is long overdue for the 117 workers who were made redundant.</P>
    <P>This whole exercise in relation to Irish Steel indicates that the cost of employing people nowadays must be examined.  It appears to me it is a more practical and viable proposition to employ a number of people and to pay them overtime rates for many hours of work rather than to employ more additional people.  This is because of the cost factor of employing people.  If any industry is an indication of what it costs to employ people, surely <Col N="2570" /> Irish Steel is such a company.  As I indicated, the company were getting to a break-even point provided they got the necessary equity to clear the old borrowings. We accept that the price of scrap has dropped and that is an essential element in the operation at Haulbowline. It is acknowledged that the market has stabilised because of reductions in the number of workers in other countries and the EC operation to stabilise the market. There has been a small but steady increase in product prices and, as the Minister has indicated, and I concur with him, the value of the dollar against the punt and sterling has helped to reduce our interest payments and to increase the value of the product of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The workers in Cork and their commitment to the survival of the plant through acceptance of redundancy conditions have helped the plant to survive.  Efficiency has been improved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever it is.  I wish to pay a tribute to all concerned, particularly the workers.  The cost of marketing is so high that it is better for an enterprise like Irish Steel to pay larger amounts in overtime than to put in even one more employee and be saddled with all the deductions inherent in employment &mdash; PAYE, PRSI, levies and the rest.  The cost of employing people nowadays must be reconsidered by the Government.  The mill shop at Irish Steel works on a four-shift basis and this causes a good deal of overtime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the consultants' report.  When if ever will it see the light of day?  Will the Minister ever tell us why the report is not being dealt with?  When somebody from the Government benches rises to speak, would he indicate to us why the report is not being published and whether action will be taken as a result of the report?  I hope somebody over there will give attention to that during the debate.  The Minister pre-empted a question I intended to ask about the possibility of a joint venture in Irish Steel. Has he any indication that somebody <Col N="2571" /> would be prepared to participate in such a joint venture?</P>
    <P>In 1984 and this year we heard about the cost of energy in the plant.  We are all aware this matter needs to be addressed. Would the Minister and the Government tell me what is their attitude to the failure of the ESB to carry out the Government's directive to reduce the cost of electricity there?  I am aware what a computer test is being undertaken in the plant in the hope of making a reduction to 37 mega-watts of electricity, but whether that can be brought to a successful conclusion or not.  I suggest that the Government's directive to the ESB to reduce energy costs to Irish Steel should be followed up. As far as I can ascertain, that has not been done.  Section 4 of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Principal Act (which imposes a limit of £100,000,000 on the guarantee by the Minister of the repayment of moneys borrowed by the Company) is hereby amended by the substitution in subsection (3) of &ldquo;£32,000,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;£100,000,000&rdquo; (inserted by section 2 of the Irish Steel Limited (Amendment) Act, 1983), and that subsection, as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P>Is it because the borrowing guarantee is not now required and that £100 million is unlikely to be needed that this provision to reduce the amount to £32 million has been inserted?  We welcome this new finance and the inclusion of further equity in Irish Steel because of the company's strategic importance and the employment it has created and the commitment to the workforce to ensure the continuance of the plant.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister to ensure that the people made redundant will be taken care of through the Coal and Steel Community so that the redundant workers will be retrained to face the future.  They sacrificed their jobs to ensure the continuance of the plant and for the benefit of the nation, and they should not be thrown on the scrap heap like so many other Cork workers.  Long may their sacrifice <Col N="2572" /> be appreciated by us.  Long may Irish Steel be there as the only viable labour-intensive plant in the country.  Let us do all we can to ensure that the sacrifices of the redundant workers will not be forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the Bill.  The money involved and the further investment form a life line for the company.  Irish Steel as an industry is in a much more healthy state than was the case a number of months ago.  This is due in the first place to the dedication of the workforce and secondly to the good sense of the management and the unions in that time.  I wish to pay a tribute to everyone concerned in Irish Steel for that improved performance. With Deputy Lyons I pay tribute also to those whose jobs had to be eliminated. These people made the supreme sacrifice in accepting redundancy so as to ensure the future of the plant.</P>
      <P>The good performance of the company in recent months has been brought about to some extent also by the improvement in external factors &mdash; the decrease in scrap prices, the increase in steel prices, the drop in interest rates and the improvement in the performance of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar.  All these factors will help to ensure that the company will continue in operation.  I trust that in the months ahead efficiency at the plant will continue to improve and in that regard that the performance of the workforce will continue to improve.  I trust, too, that the performance of management, which has been the subject of some hard criticism here in the past, will continue to improve also.  With co-operation all round, I am confident that the plant will survive and will be viable in the years ahead.  I wish the management well in their efforts to find potential joint venture partners.  Success in this area would be a great bonus.  It would be a positive factor in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share with Deputy Lyons the hope that the negotiations in progress in Europe in relation to the redundancy package for those whose jobs had to be eliminated will be brought to a favourable <Col N="2573" /> conclusion within the next month or two and that these 117 people will receive further compensation from Europe for the sacrifice they have made.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an indication of the Government's continued commitment to the Cork region.  This commitment together with other major investments and decisions in regard to Cork in recent months should ensure the revitalisation of the industrial sector in that region.</P>
    <P>There have been dramatic job losses in the Cork region in the past two years as a result of the closure of a number of our traditional industries.  Two factors which contributed largely to those closures were the Anglo-Irish free trade agreement and our accession to the Common Market. However, we must regard this Bill as another bright light so far as the future of Cork is concerned.  Though the Minister says that some of the money being made available will be used to finance loan repayments, a considerable amount will be devoted to increasing the level of output at the plant while a large amount will be used also by way of capital expenditure. Therefore, this Bill is a commitment to the plant itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in welcoming the Bill.  We are all happy to celebrate what has been achieved in this area in the past months but this Bill is a very welcome bonus.  It offers a ray of hope and we look forward to further such initiatives from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past number of years the Cork area has suffered severely in terms of employment losses as a result of the closure of many of our traditional industries. We have not been successful in finding replacements for those industries nor in finding work for those who lost their jobs. Cobh is a very important part of County Cork but in that area there are between 800 and 900 people unemployed.  This year alone the increase in unemployment in Cobh was of the order of 200.  High unemployment detracts from the economic wellbeing of an area because other sectors such as the service industries and business generally depend for success on <Col N="2574" /> employment in any area.  Public houses, shops and hotels all do well when employment is at a high level.  The Cobh area was very buoyant in the past but the loss of employment there has been catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The workforce in Irish Steel have made sacrifices and it was difficult to blame them for questioning the proposal that was before them.  Their jobs were on the line but they have co-operated very favourably in relation to the rationalisation programme and thereby encouraging the Government and the EC to invest in the company.  One factor that must not be lost sight of is that Irish Steel have been our only outlet for scrap so that without the company we would have to export our scrap.</P>
    <P>The total investment in Irish Steel this year will be up to £25 million.  That is very significant for the area.  I am confident that it will result in solving the problems the plant has been experiencing.  I notice that the guarantee of borrowings for Irish Steel is being reduced from £100 million to £32 million.  That is a substantial reduction so perhaps the Minister would elaborate on how he arrived at the reduced figure.</P>
    <P>It was encouraging to read in the Minister's speech that there is no set time for payments to the Exchequer.  That proves that the Minister has confidence in the continuation of that industry and that he believes that the increased working capital will help and will possibly lower the bank interest payments so that Irish Steel will become viable.  Our steel industry is relatively small in the European Community and world context.  We are a small nation trying to build an industrial base.  For that reason the EC should be more sympathetic to us.  It is hard to compare our level of activity in any industry with that of the Germans.  Belgians, the Italians or the Britons.  I hope that the £800,000 in the package of social measures to come from the EC will assist the workforce.  If granted it will be a very welcome bonus.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel are now the largest employer in the Cork area employing about 560 people in the workforce.  There <Col N="2575" /> will be a further contraction in those numbers bringing them down to about 440 employees.  That is something I never thought would happen.  I did not contemplate losing our largest traditional industry. We are back to a situation where a semi-State body is the largest employer in that area.  I welcome the Minister's foresight in continuing this industry in the Cork area.  Irish Steel has come from a substantial loss-making industry to what is now likely to become a profit-making operation, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Joint ventures are a new phenomenon in the private sector, semi-State sector and the State sector generally.  If a project is worth while why do the State have to get a mix of private and State investment? If private investment is provided by a foreign individual, he will only be interested in profit.  When times get difficult he will request the return of his investment and will leave the country, leaving us with our original venture.  If Irish Steel become successful we should not encourage outside venturers.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill.  Coming from Cobh, I am well aware of the trauma that occurred a couple of months ago when the future of Irish Steel was in the balance. It is significant that unemployment in the Cobh area is around 1,200 and not 900 and that it has jumped in the last couple of months mainly due to the number of people made redundant in Irish Steel.  I commend the workforce, the management and unions, who showed great level-headedness and a sense of reality in facing up to their problems. As the Minister said, there has been a turnabout in the returns of Irish Steel over the last number of months due to the change in the value of the dollar and due to the fall in the price of scrap.  This injection of £18 million will reduce the expenses, and the interest charges will now be borne by the State rather than by the company.  It should help the company improve their performance further.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked the chairman of the board to continue in his efforts to get hold of a joint venture partner.  I hope that that will be successful, not that I am in favour of joint ventures in State companies but because, if a private individual or company is willing to buy into Irish Steel it would indicate that there is a feeling that the steel industry is likely to succeed and that Irish Steel in Haulbowline have a favourable future.</P>
      <P>I look forward in the coming months to success in this area.  From speaking to the many people who worked in Irish Steel I detected that there will be a real effort to ensure that Irish Steel will succeed. The workforce feel they can increase their productivity level to ensure that there will be jobs for themselves and their families and that there will not be further unemployment in the Cobh area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2577" /> I welcome this Bill and congratulate all those involved in ensuring that Irish Steel has taken a U-turn and is progressing in the way we would hope other firms would progress.</P>

      <P>I thank Members of the House for the welcome given to this Bill.  There is not a guarantee that this will be sufficient. From henceforth the company will have to act entirely on their own in that no further State aid will be given after 31 December.  They will essentially be in the same position as companies in the private sector.  They will not be able to turn to their shareholder for a further injection of equity.  The company will have to be extremely commercial in their operations. I hope that is fully understood by the board, management and everybody involved.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons paid fulsome tributes to people who entered into what he described as great sacrifices.  I do not want to take away from that, but it is not a great sacrifice to apply common sense. The common sense that must be involved here is that people must realise that, if Irish Steel did not make the economies they made in the past, and if in future, of their own accord without prompting from the Government, they do not make further necessary economies, they will not survive and everybody will lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, what is the choice?  In this instance it is between making a small sacrifice in order not to have to make a greater one.  That is simple common sense.  I hope that attitude of common sense &mdash; which is now perhaps more evident in Irish Steel Limited and other State companies than it was in the past &mdash; will prevail.  It should be said that this was a result of a very firm and realistic approach having been adopted by the Government. In this instance it is fair to say that the Government gave the lead in so far as Irish Steel Limited are concerned, clearly indicating what were the parameters and saying that those would be adhered to.  It <Col N="2578" /> was in response to that firm stance by the Government that Irish Steel Limited have now put themselves on a more sound footing than they might otherwise have been on.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the application to the ECSC for assistance in regard to further help for redundancy.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deeply concerned about the continuing deterioration of law and order, the rising tide of violence, crime and murder, and the breakdown of the prison system; condemns the failure of the Government to take any effective action to deal with this menacing situation, calls on the Government to undertake a comprehensive programme of positive action, to give priority in the allocation of personnel and resources to the protection of the general public and calls on local communities to give full support to the Gardaí in their efforts to combat crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Violence and crime are becoming widespread in the community especially in city areas.  Fear stalks our streets even in broad daylight.  Housewives and the elderly live in fear of bag snatching, mugging and personal assault.  Housewives <Col N="2579" /> and old folk are prisoners in their own homes and increasingly fear rape and assault.  This is a reality in the communities in which I live in Dublin today and I know the same is happening in other parts of the country.  Shopkeepers, small businesses, post offices and banks staff know a new kind of fear and violence, that of being suddenly confronted by thugs with guns or iron bars.  Pharmacists are well accustomed to being attacked.  Dublin jewellers have had to lock their doors. Even some florists and boutiques keep their doors locked and check customers before admitting them.</P>
    <P>That is the sad reality of life especially in Dublin today.  I have been very much aware of the position with regard to jewellers, of the great fears of shopkeepers and the number of them being attacked.  In fact several were attacked in my community over the past weekend, again with iron bars.  But when one discovers that even florists and boutiques have to keep their doors locked and check customers before admitting them, that is a frightening, new development.  Apparently a balaclava and an iron bar are sufficient with which to set out on an attack.  From figures the Minister gave us recently it is clear that the average takings are of the order of £500, perhaps a little less, but the savagery of the attacks is something that is frightening and is a new development.</P>
    <P>Burglaries in private homes have doubled. House insurance premiums have increased 100 per cent this year alone due to the increase in the number of breakins. Many centre city businesses cannot get any insurance cover against burglary and are trading under impossible conditions. Dublin has become a city of shutters; everywhere must be shuttered, barred and locked.  That is the reality of Dublin today.  Even with these bars and locks&mdash;because roofs are more accessible&mdash;many of these businesses are unable to get insurance cover at all.  There is another aspect, that is that there is a general acceptance of crime and lawlessness as a new and frightening reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2580" /> Since 1982 the number of people in the community charged with driving uninsured cars has risen from 62,000 to 107,000, that is from 1982 to 1984, and those without driving licences increased from 54,000 to 100,000.  This illustrates a general breakdown in respect for the law. People seem to know that the law is not working.  Certainly they are working outside the law in increasing numbers.  That is frightening in terms of a general community response.  Even more worrying has been the doubling over the same period of the incidence of aggravated burglary and burglary with firearms.  This clearly demonstrates how violent crime has become.  The indications are that it will be even higher in 1985 because the signs are that this kind of aggravated burglary, burglary with weapons and violence, is one of the increasing features of present-day crime.</P>
    <P>There is need now for a comprehensive programme to reduce crime.  The Government have failed to take positive action in the allocation of personnel and resources to defeat crime.  Admittedly the Minister for Justice has done his best in certain areas.  But when one looks at the overall situation, the overall impact of crime and at the allocation of resources, one finds that the Government have not allocated sufficient resources to this area.  We all know that one of the most valuable methods of providing peace and security to homes, streets and businesses is through an effective Garda Síochána force.  The Garda Sióchána are highly respected and have been very effective in ensuring that law and order prevailed down through the years.  The reality is that this Government reduced the new strength of 12,000 Garda, introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1982, to 11,400. From the very beginning they contended they did not need as many gardaí as their predecessors felt were necessary.</P>
    <P>That was the first step this Government took.  Whether the Minister acquiesced in that decision or welcomed it is another question&mdash;I do not know what way he approached it&mdash;but I do know that the Government considered that the Garda strength provided for by their prececessors <Col N="2581" /> was not necessary.  Consequently there are today 600 fewer gardaí on the streets than we had considered essential for adequate policing from 1982 onwards. In addition, the availability of Garda members and their flexibility in operation have been restricted by massive cutbacks in overtime.  In the Dublin Metropolitan areas overtime was cut back by a massive 38 per cent from 1982 to 1984.  In the country as a whole the cutback was 36 per cent over the same period.  This year the restriction would appear to have been even greater and there was no Supplementary Estimate for the Garda last week.  I was quite surprised at that because the Minister had said that special provision was being made for the autumn period, which special provision I thought might have resulted in a Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps the Minister found money somewhere else, but it looks as if the situation will be even worse in 1986.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Briscoe, put down Questions Nos. 176 and 177 on today's Order Paper and the reply to them was that the hours of overtime for the Dublin metropolitan area for the first nine months of this year are of an order that would bring them to not more than last year's.  If some members have been moved to Border areas the allocation of overtime to the Border areas may reduce it further.  Certainly we have had a massive reduction in overtime since 1982. Now the Minister tells us that more gardaí have been sent to the Border areas to honour the Government's commitments under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Will the streets of our main cities be denuded of gardaí as a result of the Government's decision to send more men to police the Border?  If this is the case there must be an immediate allocation to offset this loss of personnel, especially in high crime areas.  The Minister talked about some arrangement.  We have seen nothing of it.  It did not turn up in the Supplementary Estimates, but if more men are to go to the Border there must be an immediate allocation to offset their loss.</P>
    <P>While the Government continue to delude themselves into thinking that <Col N="2582" /> things are improving, the situation on the ground is disastrous.  People are crying out for gardaí on the beat and around urban shopping centres.  Last week, following a bank robbery and an attack with an iron bar on a constituent of mine as he was lodging money in a bank on the south side, both incidents occurring in broad daylight, I called on one of my local Garda stations, Coolock, to see why a promised patrol in that area had not appeared.  I had contacted them earlier and asked why, coming up to Christmas with the high rate of bag snatching and so on, it did not seem to be taking place this year when it had been done last year on request.  I found that for 70,000 people 17 gardaí and three sergeants were on duty and out of this total only one was available for beat duty for that day, and he had been called away to man broken traffic lights at a busy junction on the Malahide Road.  Therefore, nobody was available in the whole area for beat duty. The other members were on station duty. Two men were on drug surveillance, a new aspect of the work.  We can understand the need for this surveillance, but that took two more men out.  There were mobile units, and of course, some gardaí were at the courts.  One was on sick leave at the time.  The net effect was that nobody was there to do beat duty.</P>
    <P>They were snowed under with time consuming tasks of preparing files and statements either in handwriting or by one-finger typing on outdated machines. They were bogged down under reams of paper and had no secretarial or administrative assistance.  Four units, each with 20 men &mdash; 80 gardaí &mdash; had not a single typist or clerical assistant.  That brings the reality home to the ordinary man's mind. Go to AnCO or anywhere you like, to any business or any Government Department, you will not find 80 men all trained to do specialist work without a single clerical or typing assistant.  This was mind boggling.  A fundamental change is needed in this organisation.  We have talked here about the need for change in the management of the Garda, for new approaches to the management in total, but go to the other end and look at the <Col N="2583" /> workings on the ground.  That one I found quite astounding.  Police should be doing police work and not wasting valuable time as very poor typists.  They will tell you that that is the case, that they are not trained in typing and are working either by one or two finger typing or by handwriting, but the files must be right.  Here we must realise the crucial nature of the files that these men and women have to prepare.  They must give attention to them.  This is paramount in their police work.  If a file goes forward with errors or mistakes in it much difficulty and trouble can result afterwards.  Therefore, these members must sit in for hours on this slow typing process and that is time taken away from crime prevention and from work on the beat.</P>
    <P>The Government have more than enough surveys and reports on administration, yet they do nothing in this area. The Garda cannot give a proper service to the public on this basis.  In London there are 27,000 police members backed by 14,000 civilians.  That is roughly one civilian to each two police members. Here we have 11,400 gardaí and 597 civilians, or one to 19.  Even at that, 36 of these posts were embargoed earlier this year and gardaí were taken off the beat to fill in.  Therefore, in effect probably we have a ratio of 1:20 rather than 1:19. These 80 men need a minimum of three support staff for typing and administration. This whole area needs urgent attention and resource allocation, and priority must be given to protecting the public, to getting out to do the job that is needed on the streets.  When we examine how the system is working and what is happening within it we find that the gardaí are hampered in these ways.  They are taking criticism from the public when that criticism should be levelled at the Government because the Government are not providing the resources.  Indeed, I call on the public to give their full support to the Garda and we will give our full support to the Minister in demanding from the Government the resources he needs to mobilise these Garda members and put them out on to the streets and <Col N="2584" /> let them get on with the work they are trained for.  He will have our full support in pressing that at the Cabinet table.  I bring it up here so forcefully tonight because I believe that if this approach is taken to the administration of the Garda Síochána then tremendous energies can be released out on to the streets to tackle crime and give a new feeling of confidence and security to people in their homes, offices and businesses.  We supported the introduction of the neighbourhood watch scheme and Members on all sides encouraged the general public to support it but it is not sufficient.  We must have more gardaí on the beat if people are to have a sense of security on our streets, in their homes and at work.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take a fresh look at this problem and introduce a programme with a new commitment of resources to tackle crime.  Many other matters need to be considered such as business watch and home beats for gardaí but whatever about those suggestions more gardaí must be put on the streets to give confidence to house wives and the elderly.  I should like to call on the public to give their support to the Garda to encourage them in the work they are involved in on our behalf.  They should be assisted in every way in tackling crime.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government are falling short in their allocation of resources to the Garda.  No amount of juggling with figures, covering up with figures for overtime and so on, will get away from the fact that fewer gardaí are patrolling our streets.  I accept that more gardaí were appointed&mdash;our programme was to appoint even more to the Force &mdash;but the whole point in taking on more recruits was to have more men on the beat and not, through massive cuts in overtime, to reduce the effect of the extra Gardaí.  In practice the additional appointments were not noticed on our streets and the Government must stand condemned for that.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if the Minister were to tell the truth he would say that he would be happy to have extra personnel and permission to allow more overtime so as to ensure that leading up to Christmas <Col N="2585" /> the areas where crime is prevalent can be policed properly.  Last year we found that by providing extra police in some areas in the period leading up to Christmas there was little need for them after the holidays.  The pre-Christmas period was a peak time for crime.  I do not know the reason why the need for the additional police diminished but the system we operated last year worked out fairly well.</P>

The Minister must bear in mind that the branch of a bank closed in my constituency because it was being attacked and vandalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extra gardaí on the beat would make a big difference.  However, when gardaí are bogged down with extra duties as at present it is difficult to expect results. The Minister should provide secretarial assistance in the area I referred to because the crime level is very high. <Col N="2586" /> Resources are not adequate to get more gardaí on the beat.  If it is important that officials in AnCO and Government Departments should have secretarial support, then it is more important that such assistance is provided for gardaí.  The Minister should pursue his Cabinet colleagues to get the necessary resources to give us the security we need on our streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and before &ldquo;and call on local communities to give full support to the Gardaí in their efforts to combat crime&rdquo; and substitute therefor:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the efforts of the Government, the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána and the prison service in the fight against crime and in coping with the unprecedented growth in the numbers in custody&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The motion will now read:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann commends the efforts of the Government, the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána and the prison service in the fight against crime and in coping with the unprecedent growth in the numbers in custody and calls on local communities to give full support to the Gardaí in their efforts to combat crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion, which has been tabled by Deputies Woods and Hyland paints a completely false picture of present trends.  I am sorry to have to say it but it seems to me that their primary concern must be, not to make any constructive contribution to the crime debate, but simply to try to denigrate the considerable effort which the Government have put into tackling crime.  The record, however, speaks for itself.  The overall crime level is not increasing at the present time. Deputies opposite must be well aware that the Garda Commissioner reported a reduction of 2.6 per cent in the level of indictable crime last year.  While this <Col N="2587" /> reduction is not one which should give rise to complacency it was, nonetheless, very significant because it was the first time the crime rate had actually fallen in some seven years.  So far this year provisional figures available to the Garda indicate that this decreasing trend in the overall indictable crime level is being sustained.</P>
    <P>It might be interesting to examine in a little more detail what has happened in relation to crime trends in recent years. Between 1977 and 1981 indictable crime rose by some 42 per cent.  This was a period during which the Justice portfolio was held by colleagues of the movers of the motion now under debate.  In the period which has elapsed since I assumed office as Minister for Justice, indictable crime has, in contrast, risen by a little over 2 per cent.  While I would not claim this as a major achievement &mdash; accepting, as I do, that much more needs to be done &mdash; I do claim that the Government have done far more to address the problem than did the preceding Government of my friends opposite and the figures amply prove this.</P>
    <P>Crime here has increased very rapidly over the last 20 years or so and has now reached the stage where it has become one of the most serious public issues. There is no doubting that there is a widespread concern about crime and that crime and fear of crime is affecting the well-being of our society.  The general public reaction has been to turn to the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prisons and to demand a solution.  This reaction, while it is quite understandable, is to some extent unrealistic in its expectations.  It must be obvious to all that Irish society has changed radically over the last 20 to 30 years and that this change has been accompanied by new patterns of crime and anti-social behaviour.  It is unrealistic to expect the criminal justice system to provide an antidote for this developing poison in our society; to expect it to enforce the standards and <i>mores</i> of the thirties and forties when society at large no longer accepts or applies these standards.  I, as Minister <Col N="2588" /> for Justice, have no magic wand which I can wave to make crime disappear.  But I can strengthen the criminal justice system and improve the criminal law to deal with particular manifestations of criminal behaviour.  I can make manpower, equipment, and other resources available to the maximum extent possible within the limit of our national finances.  I have done this and real progress is at last being made in getting to grips with crime despite what the Deputies opposite would like to suggest.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed at the number of recent murders which sadly have taken place and it has been suggested that this is a symptom of a breakdown in law and order.  Murder is, of course, among the worst of all crimes and there is no level at which it can be regarded as acceptable.  There is, however, no evidence to support the suggestion that this crime is becoming more prevalent.  During the last ten years the number of murders committed annually has ranged from 14 at the lowest to 26 at the highest.  The number of murders recorded last year was 23, exactly the same number as was recorded in 1975.  I make this point not to diminish in any way the awful tragedies which lie behind the figures, but to scotch the exaggerated notion propounded by some that we are now somehow on an accelerating slide to perdition.</P>
    <P>Let me cite some examples of how crime is being successfully tackled &mdash; yes, successfully tackled.  Last winter saw an outbreak of two particularly heinous activities &mdash; attacks on elderly people living in isolated areas and the reckless driving of stolen cars by young hooligans round the streets of our major cities. The Garda put considerable effort into tackling these crimes with very significant success.  With the help of bodies like Muintir na Tíre and concerned local communities, they have reduced the incidence of attacks on elderly people in rural areas.  Likewise, they have been successful in reducing the incidence of joyriding escapades.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to the area of drug abuse the position is that immediately on <Col N="2589" /> taking office this Government set about tackling the problem by setting up the special Government task force to examine and make recommendations on what needed to be done.  The recommendations which the task force produced and which were widely welcomed are now being implemented and there is evidence to suggest that the measures which have been and are being taken are achieving success in terms of stemming the growth of abuse.  The Garda have, I am glad to say, successfully got to grips with this problem in the last couple of years, as evidenced by the quantities of illicit drugs which have been seized and in the numbers arrested and successfully prosecuted &mdash; some being the biggest pushers in the drug trade.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as a result, they have reason to believe that since 1983 illegal trafficking in drugs has levelled off and that the situation is now improving.  In 1984, despite an intensification in Garda activity there was a decrease in the level of drug seizures and in the number of persons charged with drug offences, which is further evidence of a drop in drug trafficking.  However, there will be no complacency and new trends, particularly with regard to cocaine, are being carefully watched.</P>
    <P>During the term of office of this Government, the Garda have been encouraged and supported in developing new strategies to deal with crime. Emphasis has been placed on community policing and in getting Garda and the community into a co-operative and supportive relationship to jointly tackle crime.  I am personally convinced of the importance of developing a preventive approach to crime and it is because of that conviction that I have been very keen to have neighbourhood watch schemes adopted as widely as possible in the community. Earlier this year the Government provided funds for the promotion of the scheme and this has given a tremendous impetus to its expansion.  I am sure that communities which adopt neighbourhood watch will benefit in terms of a reduction in crime and vandalism on their streets, or in their estates.  They will also <Col N="2590" /> have the satisfaction of knowing that they have done something positive, something constructive, to deal with crime rather than just sitting back and throwing brickbats at the Government and at the Garda.</P>
    <P>To reverse the well established trend in increasing crime rates requires a great deal of effort and perseverence.  This Government have been prepared to make the effort needed and, as I said at the outset of my speech, the trend is now being reversed.  Any constructive suggestions which Deputies speaking to this motion and amendment tonight can give me which may lend impetus to a downward trend in crime will be welcomed by me.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the availability of Garda manpower resources is a fundamental aspect of the fight against crime.  As I have already informed the House, there has been a net increase of over 700 members in the strength of the Garda Síochána since 1 December 1982, bringing the current overall strength of the force to just under 11,400.  The national plan provides that the strength of the Garda Síochána will be maintained at 11,400 over the period 1985 to 1987 and this means that despite restrictions on public service numbers generally, recruitment to the force will be continued.  Over the past year, some 250 recruits have been appointed to the force and, while the precise number to be appointed during the next two years will depend on the level of vacancies arising from resignations, retirements and deaths, it is estimated that it will be in the order of 700.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Garda authorities to deploy the available resources in the best possible way having regard to their assessment of needs and demands at any given time.  It is true that in recent months, additional gardaí have been allocated to Border divisions by the redeployment of manpower from other divisions on a temporary basis.  However, the Garda authorities are keeping the policing needs of other areas, particularly cities and areas where the incidence of crime is high, under constant review and appropriate measures have been taken to <Col N="2591" /> ensure that the general level of policing is adequate.  These measures include the provision of extra funds for overtime. Particular emphasis is being placed on Garda foot patrolling as an aid to crime prevention and it is the policy of the commissioner to have as many gardaí as possible on foot patrol duty, having regard to other commitments.</P>
    <P>As far as recruitment is concerned, I have already announced publicly that new procedures will apply to future recruitment competitions.  In this regard, I am at present in the process of reviewing the standards and requirements for admission to the force.  I hope to be in a position soon to announce details of a new competition which is likely to be held in the spring of next year.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy to appoint civilians to clerical posts in Garda offices to the maximum extent possible and at present approximately 430 are so employed.  In addition, in the context of implementing the Government White Paper, &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo;, which provides that a new category of temporary clerical trainee would be established to gain experience of office work at clerical level, a total of 129 temporary clerical trainees have been sought for work in Garda offices.  Recruitment of these trainees has recently commenced and initial assignments to Garda offices have begun.  Steps have been and are being taken to ensure that the Garda have the benefit of the most modern equipment and up-to-date technology available.</P>
    <P>Government commitment to the new Garda national communications network, which is currently being provided for the Garda, is being maintained.  This network, when completed, will provide the Garda with one of the best communications systems in Europe.  The system will mean much greater efficiency for the Garda in the transmission and exchange of information and in the utilisation of manpower.  It will also mean an improved police service for the public &mdash; for example, in terms of a quick response by the Garda to calls for assistance.  The new <Col N="2592" /> system has been installed at all Garda stations outside the Dublin metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>A new network is also being provided for the Garda in the Dublin area.  I placed a £2 million contract in April of this year for this project and it is intended that it will come into operation in mid-1986. This contract covers equipment to be installed in the 43 Garda stations in the Dublin area and in a number of elevated sites in the vicinity of Dublin city.  It also includes equipment for the most modern type of central control room which is being provided in the Garda Dublin metropolitan area headquarters in Harcourt Square, to replace the existing control room which is no longer adequate for Garda needs.</P>
    <P>Computerisation is another area of technology which has been put at the disposal of the Garda.  The Garda have their own computer since 1981 and they are at present operating systems on it which provide fast information when needed on stolen vehicles, firearms, crime and criminal records.  These systems are being continually improved and refined to make Garda investigation more efficient.  My Department placed a contract for over £300,000 last month for the purchase of a new computer for the Garda Síochána.  This will replace the existing Garda computer which is no longer adequate to meet the needs of the force and will facilitate considerable expansion of the service being provided.</P>
    <P>Approximately 60 visual display units and ancillary equipment were purchased towards the end of last year.  This equipment has enabled all the 18 divisional headquarters and some other major stations outside the Dublin metropolitan area and nine of the busiest stations within the Dublin area to have a direct link to the Garda computer.  It has also enabled an improved computer service to be provided from Garda headquarters in Phoenix Part and the Dublin area headquarters. This facility for immediate access to computer records &mdash; for example, to check out stolen or suspect vehicles &mdash; is of great practical assistance to the Garda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2593" /> The greatest asset which a police force have are their own manpower and it is essential, therefore, to ensure that this resource is developed in every way possible by the provision of effective training. The Commissioner, with my approval, established a committee in January under the chairmanship of Dr. Thomas Walsh to undertake a thorough review of Garda training.  The committee, who include people from the private sector and the academic field who are experienced in personnel training and development, have been asked to examine Garda training at all levels from recruit intake stage up to and including the courses provided for senior management in the Garda college and to make any recommendations considered necessary.  I understand that a first report by the committee, which will cover basic training of recruit garda is expected to be ready within the next few weeks.  It is my hope that it will be possible to implement some, at least, of their recommendations in time to benefit the next batch of recruits joining the force.</P>
    <P>An important element in the Government's programme for tackling the crime problem has been the reform of our criminal law and procedure.  The introduction of the Criminal Justice Bill within a year of the Government taking office honoured the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to strengthen the criminal law.  In promoting the Criminal Justice Bill, the Government recognised that the hands of the Garda needed to be strengthened, not only by increasing the physical resources available to them but also by giving them the legal powers necessary to bring offenders to justice.  Similarly, the Government recognised that changes were long overdue in relation to certain aspects of our court procedure &mdash; that the balance between the rights of the accused on the one hand and the community on the other had become distorted and leaned too heavily in favour of the accused.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984 contains important reforms of our criminal law.  It has been described as the most <Col N="2594" /> important development in criminal law and procedure since the foundation of the State.  Many provisions of the Act are already in force; others await the establishment of the new Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the making of regulations on the treatment of persons in custody.</P>
    <P>The Bill to allow for the establishment of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board has already been introduced.  I hope it will be possible for the Bill to receive its Second Stage reading here in the Dáil early in the new year.  The preliminary work on the new regulations on the treatment of persons in custody has also recently been completed.  I will be submitting these regulations to Government for approval in the near future and my intention then is to publish them as proposals, in order to allow all interested groups an opportunity to comment on them in advance of their being laid in draft form before the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an independent complaints procedure and the new statutory regulations on the treatment of persons in custody will contribute significantly to maintaining and developing the confidence and trust between the force and the public which is essential in securing the co-operation which the Garda need if they are to combat crime effectively.</P>
    <P>The effect of all these measures together will be to ensure that the Garda not only have adequate powers to investigate serious crime but also to provide firm guarantees that they will be fully accountable for the welfare of persons in their custody.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the prisons.  The motion before the House suggests that Dáil Éireann should express deep concern at what is called &ldquo;the breakdown of the prison system&rdquo;.  In the amendment which I am putting forward I ask the House, instead, to commend, among others, the dedicated and effective efforts of management and staff of the prison service to cope with the unprecedented growth in the numbers in custody.  The suggestion that our prison system has broken down is so out of touch with reality as to be <Col N="2595" /> clearly absurd and I do not believe it either requires or deserves refutation, but I would remind the House that putting forward a suggestion of that kind can only serve to offer consolation to criminals and undermine the efforts of those involved in the operation and administration of our prisons.  Theirs, particularly in recent years, has been a difficult task and I suggest that some Members of this House would do us all a service if, rather than cynically hyping difficulties which are inevitable given the demands placed upon the prison system, they adopted a sensible and supportive approach.</P>
    <P>In asking for at least that level of responsibility I am not suggesting that the operation of our prison system should be exempt from critical examination or that there is not a need for continuous improvements.  In fact the House will be aware that earlier this year we had the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Penal System, which I appointed.  The committee's analysis and recommendations are far-reaching and are being examined in my Department.  I cannot say that all of the recommendations made by the committee will prove acceptable, but I can assure the House that if any of them are to be rejected it will only be where a thorough analysis indicates that the balance of public interest lies elsewhere. I published the Whitaker report within days of having received it and called for a thorough and balanced public debate on the issues dealt with by the committee which, by the way, was the first of its kind for over a hundred years. I think it fair to say that, at the very least, ill-founded claims about a so-called breakdown of the prison system do not add to the quality of that debate.</P>
    <P>I believe any objective assessment of the operation of the prison system made in the light of the extraordinary demands placed on it over the past three years would show a substantial record of achievement.  Between the years 1972 and 1982 the average numbers in custody increased by 200 from about 1,000 to 1,200.  In the three years since, the population has gone to near 2,000 &mdash; an <Col N="2596" /> increase of almost 800.  So the actual increase over the past three years has been four times greater than the increase which took place over all of the previous ten years.  I have indicated to this House on many occasions that, while that level of increase over such a short period has caused inevitable difficulties, it reflects a conscious &mdash; and, I believe, correct &mdash; decision on the part of the Government that people convicted for serious offences should serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.  The public concern about crime has been so intense that it would be unthinkable that people sentenced to imprisonment for serious offences should not be required to serve their sentences for want of prison space. The Government have a duty to respond to that public concern and they will continue to do so.  They will not be deflected by the efforts of those who seek to exploit the inevitable difficulties which arise.</P>
    <P>That type of opportunism was perhaps most evident after the disturbance at Fort Mitchel on Spike Island.  I hardly need recall for this House the attempts which were made at that time by people who should have known better to gain advantage through the destructive activities of a group of prisoners who abused the type of regime provided at the fort.</P>
    <P>The decision to acquire Fort Mitchel was taken against a background where there was no new purpose-built prison accommodation available.  The Wheatfield project, which I proceeded with as a matter of urgency, could not be completed quickly enough to bring immediate relief to the system.  The alternative to attempting to use Fort Mitchel as custodial accommodation was to let out on the streets people sentenced to imprisonment for serious offences after they had served only a small part of their sentences. In those circumstances only one decision could be taken.  The disturbance at Spike has to be seen in the context of the damage and misery for our community had the prison system not attempted to provide adequate space for offenders committed by the courts.  At the end of the day the important facts are that the fort achieved its purpose and <Col N="2597" /> during the course of the disturbance no one was seriously hurt and no one escaped.  I think that at a time when the prison system is making strenuous efforts to cope with an increase in the number of offenders over the past three years of over 50 per cent it is only fair that, if it is to be criticised, it should be on the basis of what actually happens rather than versions of what might have been.</P>
    <P>That applies equally to the recent attempted escape from Portlaoise Prison. While the amount of contraband material available to the prisoners there was most distrubing, the bottom line is that the escape attempt failed &mdash; and it failed specifically because of increased security measures taken there in early 1984.</P>
    <P>Not only has the prison system had to cope with unprecedented growth in numbers, but it has had to do so at a time when an increasing number of offenders being committed have drug-related problems. At Question Time recently in the House I dealt at length with the difficulties which this poses for the prison system and I do not think that there should be any need for me to repeat now what I had to say then.  I can assure the House, however, that there is no lack of will on the part of my Department to resolve these difficulties as effectively as possible. But, as I have said previously, there are conflicting demands which arise in the prisons and reconciling them fully is not always possible.  For example, the type of regime which might prove necessary to come close to absolutely preventing illegal drugs being brought into prison could be so oppressive as to be impossible to defend.  In fact, the Whitaker report recommends that a special review of all current restrictions should be carried out by the prison authorities with a view to relaxing or removing them for as many prisoners as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised from across the floor of this House for adopting a confrontational approach with the Prison Officers' Association.  I have no desire for confrontation with any staff association legitimately and reasonably representing their members and I do not want to say <Col N="2598" /> anything in this House which would jeopardise the numerous attempts I have made &mdash; and will continue to make &mdash; to achieve a satisfactory relationship with the Prison Officers' Association.  It would be foolish to believe, however, that goodwill and responsibility on one side alone can achieve anything.</P>
    <P>To put the perception of industrial relations in the prisons in perspective, I would refer Deputies to pages 307-310 of the Whitaker report.  There they will find details of 44 instances of industrial action taken by the Prison Officers' Association in the years 1981-1983.  An analysis of those disputes is a frightening reminder of the industrial anarchy which had been allowed to develop in the prisons.  For example, the report cites one occasion where prison officers refused to work overtime at a particular institution when a certain assistant chief officer was on duty because that ACO had reported an officer for assaulting a prisoner and testified against the officer in the resultant court case.</P>
    <P>Since the dispute at Mountjoy Prison in November 1983, there has not been a single instance of any hours lost in the prisons through industrial action and the increase of over 50 per cent in the number of offenders being accommodated has been achieved without any significant increase in the numbers of staff.  I think those facts speak for themselves and I need do no more than record the fact that that situation was brought about, to put it at its mildest, without any help from those who seek now to characterise our prison system as broken down.</P>
    <P>I believe that characterisation will be seen for what it is and that it will not be allowed to detract from the difficult work which staff and management of the prison service are carrying out on behalf of our society.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that I have been able to convince the House that, far from there being any breakdown in law and order and in the prison system, the position is quite the contrary.  There have been tangible improvements both in the areas of policing and custody of offenders.  What is more important, <Col N="2599" /> measures have been taken and will be taken to ensure that the best levels of protection for the public will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be sharing my time with Deputy Ben Briscoe.  I am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  The Minister's scriptwriters have endeavoured as best they could to put an acceptable face on a very serious situation.  I listened attentively to the Minister but I do not think that the public will draw much comfort from his speech.</P>
      <P>Public concern and fear at the growing level of crime and violence is surpassed only by public anxiety at the growing and alarming increase in unemployment. When one recognises that there is a direct and positive link between the level of unemployment and all its associated problems, I am sure the House will agree that the situation which has developed, over the last three years in particular, is a serious indictment of Government performance in these two vital areas of national administration.  Unless the view which I have expressed is written off by the Minister as a political comment, I do not need to remind him that on the debate for the Estimate of his Department last week the Minister was reminded by one of his backbenchers that we are losing the war against crime.  That did more to reflect the continuing serious deterioration in law and order than anything that could be said on this side of the House. Of course the same Deputy went on to say &mdash; as one would expect &mdash; that the Minister is not responsible.  I am the first to recognise that the Minister for Justice is naturally anxious to try to control the deterioration in law and order.  He is a member of a Government who have been entrusted with the responsibility for overall economic management and he is responsible for maintaining law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the confines of the debate I cannot deal at length with the Government's economic and social failures except to say that they are a major contributing factor to the serious decline in law and order.  The fear of the people <Col N="2600" /> and the threat to society generally by the lawbreakers is a symptom of the deeprooted failure of the Government in the area of social and economic reform.  If the Minister has not succeeded in getting his colleagues in Government to recognise this fact then he must accept responsibility for protecting society from the ravages and the worst effects of the Government's failure.</P>
    <P>When one examines the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice which was introduced last week, one must be alarmed at the escalating costs of providing security.  It is perhaps in this area of administration that we can reach a solution to the problem.  The Government must react by providing additional finance to strengthen security but they should have invested in economic development which, of its nature, would result in a reduction in the level of crime.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's good public relations and his efforts in dealing with crime, he and his Department have failed miserably and the failure is reflected daily in the growing level of serious crime, especially crime with violence resulting far too often in the taking of life, the robbing and mugging of old people in their homes, the increasing incidence of rape and the daily threat to the lives of those who have been entrusted with the task of protecting our citizens and maintaining law and order.</P>
    <P>One of the most frightening aspects of the present state of crime is the complacency with which it is now accepted. This represents a depressing lack of confidence in this House and the Government in relation to their efforts to contain this dangerous and threatening situation. This need not be the case and I am extremely disappointed that the Minister failed to bring forward new and realistic proposals to restore law and order.  Such proposals are urgently needed lest we become a nation where crime is accepted as the norm and whose people feel insecure and helpless.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on Justice.  Deputy Woods, referred to the important role which the Garda play in relation to maintaining law and order.  Since I became <Col N="2601" /> deputy spokesperson in this important area I had the opportunity of meeting members of the Garda Síochána and representatives of the Prison Officers' Association.  Despite what the Minister said, I have never seen the morale within the Garda Síochána and the Prison Officers' Association at a lower ebb and despite his assurances in relation to his availability for dialogue and discussion, particularly with prison officers, his contribution contained an element of confrontation. He holds a very important position and he should adopt a different attitude and role and endeavour, as soon as possible, to resume normal negotiations with the prison officers because they do an extremely difficult and dangerous job on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are labouring under the shadow of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Bill.  For the last two months I have been asking the Minister when Second Stage will be taken which will enable us to remove the shadow hanging over them.  This Bill needs to be clarified if morale in the Garda is to be restored.</P>
    <P>In relation to prison accommodation, the Minister insinuated that any reference from this side of the House to the problem in some way undermined security and the situation in relation to the detention of offenders.  It would be a poor day for the country and for this House if Members were to be restricted in publicly expressing their views on such important institutions as the prison system and the Garda Síochána.  Regardless of what the Minister says about the way the prison system operates at present and despite the good presentation of the prison situation in his speech this evening, as far as Mountjoy is concerned, he is sitting on a time bomb in regard to overcrowding.  It is an impossible situation for the people who administer the prison, the prison officers and, it is not often referred to in this House, for the prisoners themselves who are living in atrocious, overcrowded accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the last month or so a tragic incident was reported in the media.  Two young <Col N="2602" /> offenders lost their lives in prison because of drug addiction.  On a previous occasion I asked the Minister to establish a segregation unit, an isolation unit, in the prisons where prisoners with drug problems could be treated and isolated from the rest, but the Minister said he did not accept that that was the correct way to approach the problem.  Yesterday we read in our newspapers the results of the inquest on one of those young offenders. The jury said the Minister should immediately set up a treatment unit in prisons for the purpose of isolating offenders who have a drug problem.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on prison management but it does not take a great deal of forethought to come to the conclusion that prisoners with serious drug problems should not be allowed mix with prisoners who do not have such a problem because not only are we putting the prisoners with the drug problems at risk but we are exposing the other prisoners to such a problem.  The Minister should take note of the recommendations of the jury because there is a need for a special treatment unit in the prison system.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to do something to provide additional accommodation for prisoners.  I hold the view that the decision of this Government to abandon the prison building programme which they inherited from Fianna Fáil was a very grave mistake, and will prove to be a very expensive mistake when one adds up the cost of developing Spike Island and refurbishing it after the burning of that prison, the provision of the new prison block in Cork, and so on.  It is my considered view that this Government would have been far better off if they had proceeded with the advance prison building programme which they inherited from Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The recovery of stolen property is of deep concern not only to me but to many people.  When somebody reports something has been stolen, there seems to be a lack of interest shown by the Garda.  They seem to have a &ldquo;you will never see that again&rdquo; type of attitude and the public come away with the feeling that they will not hear any more about their stolen property, but if the Garda do hear something about their stolen property, people may hear something about it.</P>
      <P>My car was parked in my driveway and somebody broke into it.  They piled everything very neatly on the seat but took my pocket memo and dictaphone.  I went to the local Garda station and gave them the numbers, but nobody came back at any stage to say that the Garda had any luck in recovering my property. We all have an idea who stole from my car because locally we know who does a lot of the thieving in the area, but the Garda should come back to the people whose cars or homes have been broken into even if it is only to say that no progress has been made but that they are keeping an eye out for the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If respect for the Judiciary goes it will be a bad day for law and order.  The kind of statement made by a District Justice in relation to a person who had been prosecuted for urinating in a public road, that this is acceptable by 1985 standards, is not good enough.  Perhaps the Minister should have a word with the President of the District Court about this because I believe very strongly that that sort of <Col N="2604" /> conduct, often done for publicity purposes, brings into bad repute the law courts of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

Maybe this will call for massive changes in the law, I do not know, but a great deal of petty crime could be dealt with at local level.  It would be very interesting if the Minister would have somebody explore this idea to see how it would work.</P>

      <P>There are many other points I would like to make.  I do not want to just score political points, but these are very real fears in the minds of the public.  I am in touch with them at all times and I know they are very worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not anticipate having the opportunity to speak but I would like to join the brethern across the way in suggesting that the greatest problem in the country today is the explosion of criminal behaviour.  Dublin is a veritable cesspool of crime.  The 1984 figures showed that goods valued at £35.5 million were stolen.  This is a horrifying statistic in a country with a population of 3.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traditional answer by all Governments has been to increase the Garda Síochána.  Now we have the highest ratio <Col N="2605" /> of police to population but the crime problem continues to escalate out of control. I was the Deputy to whom Deputy Hyland referred last week who said that we are losing the battle against the criminals despite the tremendous endeavours of the Minister for Justice, who is surely one of our rising political stars.  However, he is powerless to prevent the crime that is manifesting itself in society and despite the best efforts of the Garda Síochána they, too, are being overwhelmed.  The reality is that crime does pay.</P>
    <P>There is no one simple answer.  Certainly it is not merely to increase the personnel in the Garda Síochána or to provide them with more equipment.  The equipment they have is the best available for a modern police force.  The problem is a lack of deterrents, a lack of appropriate sentencing in the Circuit, District and High Courts.  We are now paying the price for the liberal atmosphere that has permeated our society in the past ten or 20 years, so much so that, as Deputy Briscoe pointed out, a district justice dismissed a human animal who urinated in a public street.  Recently I witnessed the same kind of animal behaviour in Grafton Street.  It is symptomatic of the breakdown in law and order.  There is no respect for anybody or anything.</P>
    <P>One answer is to provide deterrents, particularly for hardened criminals who transgress against society and who are terrifying elderly people throughout the country.  There are instances where elderly people living alone in Dublin lock themselves in their homes at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. on winter afternoons.  Recently I met a man who was staying in the same hotel as I who sold his home to move to a hotel in order to have protection and companionship.  That is happening in many cases.</P>
    <P>The breakdown in law and order is the greatest problem confronting our society today.  The prisons should be turned into penitentiaries where people will not be ill-treated but where the going will be so rough that they will make a mental resolve not to go back again.  Statistics show that our jails are full of recidivists. <Col N="2606" /> This proves that jail is no deterrent.  As I have pointed out on many occasions, our prisons are equivalent to Grade 3 hotels.</P>
    <P>I live in a town seven miles from the Border and I want to give the lie to the suggestion that gardaí have been taken from all over Ireland for Border duty. That has been done in a most haphazard and ineffective manner and the cost to the State is inestimable.  Recently a sum of £1 million was made available for overtime duty on the Border.  The gardaí man a checkpoint on the main national primary route between Dundalk and Newry, a most ineffective deployment of personnel.  In the 17 long years of the Ulster troubles a seizure of arms has never been effected by that method. Instead of using the gardaí the Irish Army should be used, thus leaving the way free for the Garda Síochána to try to prevent crime in the cities.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his scriptwriters appear to think that this motion is a personal attack on them.  The Department of Justice deal with the administration of justice.  They are there to protect the people.  Therefore, the Minister of the day is given the task under our constitution of performing that duty. It should not be regarded as a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation.  The Minister appears to think that any mention of crime, whether it be robbery or murder, is to do with Michael Noonan, TD for Limerick City.  That is regrettable because many of the good points put forward in this House are passed over by the Minister.  He seems to think we are trying to get at him but while there might be some merit in that we are more concerned about the crime problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much time is spent debating the matter.  We are told there is no problem, that indictable crime is dropping, that robberies are under control, that drugs have levelled off, that assaults are a thing of the past and that muggings do not happen.  We have been told that the prisons are quiet, that there are no kidnappings and that people are not terrorised <Col N="2607" /> by what is happening on the streets.  However, the reverse is the case.  All of these things have happened.  The insurance industry will not insure people in their businesses, traders are afraid going home, private security companies are making a fortune as a result of the terrorism people are suffering and the Garda are stretched to the limit and are almost helpless in many cases to assist the people.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister is said to be a highly intelligent person and I agree with that. Yet, he just talks vaguely about matters that are being considered and implies we are an irresponsible bunch of people. That is not the case.  Some time ago I walked through the streets of Limerick and found it is nearly as bad as Dublin. At midnight on a Saturday night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in Limerick are very nice but they also have a crime problem.  Even during the day in Dublin businesses have shutters on their windows, they have alarm systems &mdash; even personal alarms &mdash; in operation, there are steel girders and cement on the roofs of their premises.  They put in iron rods that they have taken out of old demolished buildings.  They cannot get insurance in Dublin areas 1, 2, 3 and 7. Some of the bigger shops, some of the best known firms who had been trading for up to 130 years cannot get insurance. They have been robbed so many times that they do not even report these offences to the Garda.  I know banks which are being robbed every day of the week.  A bank was attacked in my constituency four times recently.  Probably the gardaí going to the bank meet the people who have robbed it coming out and the gardaí are lucky they are not confronted with guns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are now being attacked going to morning Mass.  At one time they were <Col N="2608" /> attacked coming home at night from bingo or some other form of entertainment. In the entire north city area people are attacked at any time of the day, going to Mass in the morning, going to a post office.  A neighbour of mine not in a very lucrative business was robbed recently and the three men in balaclavas ignored the alarm and took away television and video sets.  Those people do not care two damns for alarms.</P>
    <P>As a constructive Opposition we want the Minister to use the resources he has. He told us that the public were unrealistic in their expectations that the Minister, the Garda, the courts and the prisons could overcome this problem.  They are the only resources we have who can resolve the crime problem and people must be able to have confidence in them. At present people do not have that confidence.</P>
    <P>In some areas in Dublin the Garda might not have more than one car and they cannot get as quickly to the scene of a robbery as they should.  In many cases when they arrive they ask for descriptions of the criminals and perhaps say: &ldquo;We know him.  He committed three robberies yesterday and he will probably do another four tomorrow, but we have nothing on him.&rdquo;  The people continue to be beleagured.  That is going on in large areas of my constituency.  On three or four occasions in a week recently shops were robbed but people did not bother to ring the Garda.  Perhaps £20 or £30 would be taken and an old person left sprawled on the ground, but what can they do?</P>
    <P>We are told that crime is decreasing in Dublin.  I cannot speak from knowledge about any other parts of the country but I know that in Dublin people do not bother to report crime, though if they are insured they must report them.  I am sure the Minister realises this.  As far as drug related crimes are concerned, the godfathers have been put away in safety and it is accepted that heroin offences are not as prevalent in Dublin as they used to be.</P>
    <P>The crime of joyriding is decreasing because justices began to impose lengthy <Col N="2609" /> sentences on joyriders.  If the Minister is responsible for pushing for longer sentences I congratulate him because that is the only way this type of crime can be dealt with successfully.  This is the only way to deal with those little thugs, many of them from respectable families.  It is the only way this form of crime can be controlled.</P>
    <P>Of course, the liberals say that lengthy periods in prison are not the answer.  To my mind they have been a deterrent and crime has been decreasing.  Apparently there are now acceptable standards for those people.  The liberals speak about people without work or money, people living in hardship.  We had the same conditions in the fifties in Gardiner Street and elsewhere in the inner city, people living in squalor, people without social justice, but they did not have the liberals to hold their hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for constructive suggestions.  One suggestion is to implement to the letter of the law the Criminal Justice Bill.  In doing this the Minister should ignore the liberal element in his party who urge him to be kind and to treat with liberality the poor unemployed people who might commit crimes because of deprivation.</P>
    <P>People say that the Garda need more manpower, more resources generally, that they should not be in offices sitting in front of typewriters.  The Minister should outline his plans in respect of the Garda, his plans for recruitment to the Garda and for improvement in Garda methods. <Col N="2610" /> One of the standard answers of the Garda is that they have not the necessary resources, that they have not got the equipment or the cars.  Deputy Woods suggested the fact that Garda overtime has fallen is one of the reasons for the rising crime rate.  Not too long ago much of the crime in Dublin was drug related. Now there is a hard core of criminals in Dublin who would not take jobs if they were offered them at £300 a week because they could make more in two or three hours.  Teenagers may be involved in crime but the hard core of the criminal fraternity here are those who raid factories and shops.  They can operate whether they are in prison or out of prison and we should not be treated in the condescending way the Minister adopted today.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister trying to imply that we have it all wrong or that we are the ones who are trying to hype up matters.  My parents, who are as tough and hard as any who have lived in the inner city, are living in terror.  At night the doors of their house are secured by bolts and chains.  In my street 31 houses have been robbed since the beginning of this year.  How, then, can the Minister say that crime is being controlled?  The Government should regard what we are saying as support to take action to bring an end to crime in the city and not to run away from the problem.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and which is part of the rescue package for the board decided on by the Government earlier this year. The Minister recently dealt with this matter in some detail in the course of a debate during Private Members' time but, in presenting this proposal to the House, I feel it will be useful to recall briefly some of the events which gave rise <Col N="2614" /> to the need for action by the Government in relation to the port of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Dublin port has been adversely affected by a number a factors over the past few years, such as the common plague of the recession and a drop in the demand for oil due largely to increased usage of natural gas.  These factors alone would have led to a significant deterioration in the financial performance of the Port and Docks Board.  On top of that, as we all know, the port has had to contend with the fruits of the board's decision to become directly involved in stevedoring through the establishment of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited.  The results of this decision so fundamentally affected the financial well-being of the Port and Docks Board as to call into question the board's future viability.</P>
      <P>The disputes which followed the establishment of Dublin Cargo Handling Ltd., including the blockading of the port by one section of the workforce, represented a sad chapter indeed in the long and distinguished history of Dublin port. Happily, that chapter is now coming to an end thanks to the persistent efforts of those truly concerned with the welfare of the port.  As the Minister has said on a number of occasions in the past, a viable successful Dublin port can only be achieved if everybody plays his part.</P>
      <P>The Government have consistently shown a willingness to play their part and continue to do so.  In order to assist the Port and Docks Board, the Government approved a package of measures designed to restore the port to financial viability last March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board later advised of difficulties they had encountered in implementing the measures.  Following a review of the position, the Government agreed in May on a revised financial package for the board comprised of: Exchequer grant assistance of £3 million in each of the years 1985, 1986 and 1987; a state guarantee of borrowing by the Port and Docks Board of up to £7 million; a requirement that the board would take the necessary <Col N="2615" /> steps to resolve their financial problems by cutting costs, increasing revenue and disposing of assets.  The State assistance was contingent on the conclusion of negotiations between Dublin Cargo Handling Ltd. and the dock labour force.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that the major elements of the rescue package have now fallen into place.  Negotiations have been successfully concluded with the dock labour force and the 1985 State grant of £3 million has been paid in full.  The board are taking steps to rectify their financial situation by disposing of assets and increasing revenue.  These are all essential components to the restoration of viability at Dublin port.  The onus is on those who oppose increased charges to show how their approach would improve the prospects of viability.</P>
    <P>Taking into account direct grants, loan guarantees and direct loans, the Government have either provided or committed financial assistance in the amount of £21.5 million including local loans funds borrowing of £5.5 million to the board over the past 12 months.  I am glad to note that the banks have also carried out their role in a responsible manner by making funds available and continuing to support the board.  As regards operations at the port, it is up to those directly involved, both management and workers, to show that they have the skill and determination to make it work.</P>
    <P>The resolution which is now before the House, if approved, will facilitate the provision of a State guarantee of up to £7 million of the board's borrowings and will complete the Government's part of the rescue package for the board.  The guarantee necessitates an appropriate amendment to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954.  It is specifically in this context that this resolution arises. The amendment has already been approved by the Seanad and the approval of the Dáil is necessary in order to complete legal formalities in respect of the guarantee.</P>
    <P>I should point out that a revised borrowing <Col N="2616" /> package has recently been agreed between the Port and Docks Board and its bankers.  The new borrowing arrangements are conditional on the State guarantee being in place not later than the end of this year.  There is, therefore, an obvious urgency about the matter.</P>
    <P>I recommend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little disappointed that the Minister did not, when putting this resolution under the State Guarantees Act to the House, avail of the opportunity of expanding a little more, not merely on the development of the port itself but also on what is very dear to the heart of this side of the House, the development of the port vicinity, the subject matter of a Private Members' Motion before the House in the very recent past.</P>
      <P>I thought we might have had from the Minister a resume of the Government's decisions or the Minister's policy with regard to the conclusions and principal recommendations of the Horgan report. I know that the labour difficulties, the union difficulties, have been at least partly resolved.  Some words that the Minister used when speaking in the Seanad would indicate that he is not wholly satisfied that those problems have been resolved permanently.  Indeed a letter I received from him indicated that the numbers of workers in the docks are not the ones that were &ldquo;ambitioned&rdquo;&mdash; to use a horrible word &mdash; by the Horgan report.  The Horgan report, at page 41, starts with regard to the position of the Dublin port and the deep sea section, makes a financial review, talks of future labour requirements and indicates that, in the opinion of the Horgan Committee, 120 would be the optimum number.  That has not been achieved.  I presume that the decision to employ more is in keeping with the general thrust of making the deep sea port a paying commercial proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was wondering what had happened the proposals with regard to the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  One of the fundamental <Col N="2617" /> recommendations as far as the board are concerned was that a new port authority should be established to replace the Dublin Port and Docks Board, that port authority should comprise eight members only and that they should be paid in line with rates for directors of other semi-State boards.  An important recommendation, one which I had accepted as Minister for Transport with regard to the Dublin Transport Authority, was that those members should be chosen who had not a direct vested interest in any decision of the authority, that they should be chosen solely on the basis of their expertise in that area.  Perhaps the Minister of State, in replying, would indicate what is the present thinking of the Government and Minister on that point.  Horgan did say that there was no implication that the present or past members of the Dublin Port and Docks Board had failed to act responsibly in the performance of their duties.  From my study of that situation I believe that to be true also.  As those were fundamental recommendations, and as the recommendations with regard to the Dublin Cargo Handling Limited have already been put into effect, I should like to know what is the thinking of the Minister and the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should also like some information on the present debt position of the Port and Docks Board and of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited.  In his remarks the Minister said that the first £3 million &mdash; the first £3 million of a set of three &mdash; has already been paid to the board.  To what purpose has this been paid?  Has it been paid to reduce the debt which I think stood at £7 million to £9 million earlier this year? The Minister mentioned in the Seanad a £2.5 million Local Loans Fund grant and this £7 million guarantee.  Has some of this £3 million been borrowed already on the strength that this resolution was coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas? Was there a letter of comfort or has all that £7 million yet to be borrowed? In the course of his remarks the Minister paid a tribute to the banks.  I should like to know when the borrowing has or is to take place and what kind of rates the <Col N="2618" /> Dublin Port and Docks Board succeeded in getting for that £7 million.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad debate the Minister mentioned all the old reasons why the port had suffered over the last few years. He mentioned the recession, the drop in the processing of oil cargoes in the port as a result &mdash; of course very good for our economy &mdash; of the use of natural gas. He mentioned the serious difficulties that Dublin Cargo Handling Limited got into as a result of their involvement in the stevedoring side of the business.  He mentioned also that the Local Loans Fund was going to be attacked, so to speak, in the interests of the board.</P>
    <P>A little more teasing out of the financial situation would be pleasing, but I would like to refer to what the Minister says about the disposal of the assets and the increasing of revenue.  I understand that by &ldquo;increasing of revenue&rdquo; he means increasing tariffs for the use of the port and that the board or whatever authority or group will replace this board will have to make realistic decisions taking into account competitors etc. in reaching conclusions about the tariff.  Dublin's charges have not been out of kilter with charges generally for similar sized ports with similar sized facilities.  What is the situation with regard to tariffs now?</P>
    <P>The Minister had a double think about the sale and lease back of the port centre. At one stage he indicated publicly that he was prodding the board into selling and leasing back the centre, then he went back on that, did a complete about turn, and said that he did not approve of it, that the conditions were not right for it. I would like to know what the present thinking with regard to that is.</P>
    <P>That takes me on to the other aspect of the port area.  When discussing a Private Members' motion in this House we had a run through of all the facilities which we hope will be available in that area. This side of the House approved of a plan for the port development, for what Deputy Gregory called the vital 27 acres on the Port and Docks Board site, and the Fianna Fáil Government were committed to the nationalisation of that site and <Col N="2619" /> developing it along lines geared to the needs of centre city communities.  It was with that purpose in view that Fianna Fáil put the Private Members' motion calling for a detailed plan for the development of the port of Dublin to attract lost business and revitalise the undeveloped dockland area for industrial, commercial, housing and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>When bringing before the Seanad what is before this House now the Minister dealt with that aspect of the development of the port, and I am a little disappointed that there was nothing in the speech by the Minister of State in that regard here tonight.  To deal with it briefly, there is general agreement that it is a unique site, and I will take the first word that came before the House then which was &ldquo;industrial&rdquo;. Our hope is that the site belonging to the IDA in Cork near the Ringaskiddy deep water facility will develop for industrial purposes.  Nothing could be more appropriate than a strong scheme for industrial development in the port of Dublin.  The House would have welcomed some indication in the speech tonight about that objective.  Most of what we have heard has been in relation to the port business, which of course is important, and the Minister mentioned the various factors that he and this House in general hope will lead to a very vibrant and vital port of Dublin.  The finances and tariffs must be got right.  Apparently we are well under way to having the industrial relations side of the port properly developed and rationalised, and I gather that a three year peace plan is in operation in 1985.  We could move on from there to the industrial development side which was very much at the heart of our reasoning when in 1982-83 we advocated the revitalisation of the port area.</P>
    <P>The second word in the motion was &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;.  Again I do not have to emphasise to this House that it is a more than appropriate place for commercial development.  As is well known, we are an export led industrial country; in other words our industries depend greatly on exports and most of the packaging prepared by the IDA to attract industry to this country has had extra incentives <Col N="2620" /> inserted in order to encourage exports. Therefore, the industry in the port geared to export is appropriate, and having commercial enterprises in the port is equally appropriate because of the volume of activity which it has developed and the potential which is much more important for development in the future.  The Minister gave the volumes for Dublin port in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that for the ten years 1970-80 the projected tonnage development was roughly correct although it fell somewhat short of the projection.  Therefore, if we are thinking in terms of development of the port for ten years ahead we could allow for a volume development which would be reasonably modest and rational and would take up the little bit of slack from the 1970-80 period.  As the Minister said, rightly, during that period there were problems for the port which now, we hope, have been solved, and that should make for development in the volume of trade.</P>
    <P>In 1982-83 we emphasised strongly the importance of having housing development in the port area.  Apart from anything else, it gives a better environment for all kinds of activities if suitable housing is provided in the area.  There are all kinds of suitable housing for such an area. There are flat developments suitable for commercial premises.  There are, of course, the beautifully designed houses which Dublin Corporation have already built on City Quay and at Ringsend and over near the Liberties.  That type of development, which has been praised and is highly deserving of praise, would also be a great boon to the port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The final words I am picking out are leisure activities.  During the course of the debate in Private Members' time on the development of the port I quoted the president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce who obviously had traversed the area.  What impressed him more than anything else was the size of the area and the realisation &mdash; I do not recommend that this should happen &mdash; that he could put a full 18 hole golf course into the area without it swamping the place.</P>

      <P>I dare say that some people on both sides of the river would be at risk, depending on the skill of the people using it.  That proposal would be a bit far-fetched but the president of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce used it as an example to indicate the size of the area for development.</P>
      <P>The huge success of sports centres, spoirtlanna as they are called in some parts of the country including my own, in recent times has come about because many young people have availed of the facilities in them.  A well organised sport and leisure centre for young people, incorporating recreation facilities for old people, would be a great boon to the area.  We do not intend to oppose the motion for the application of the State Guarantees Act to an upper limit of £7 million borrowing for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I would have liked to have heard a more expanded speech by the Minister that would indicate the thinking of the Minister, and the Government, in relation to new structures in the port, whether of the board or the existing board being kept on and to indicate the plans the Minister and the Government have for the general development along the lines I have mentioned.  The Opposition support what the Minister is doing and I hope we get some enlightenment on future development.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board it is appropriate that I should make some comment on the factors which brought about the precarious financial position in which the board now find themselves.  The most fundamental matter which concerns the board is the trade of the port and the provision of appropriate facilities to handle that trade.  In 1979 trade of the volume of 7.4 million tonnes was taxing the facilities of the port to its limits.  New and upgraded facilities were required in order to cater for the needs of the fast growing volumes of trailerised freight, the new mode of transport.  These needs <Col N="2622" /> were met initially by the provision of the second ro-ro ramp at the B &amp; I freight terminal and the longer term solution was the construction of a new deep water ro-ro berth south and east of the car ferry terminal.</P>
      <P>A further growth area was the lo-lo container trade and here the board provided an additional 35 tonne container crane at the south quays.  This terminal was again extended in 1982 giving a total of eight hectares for container cargo handling.  The already excellent facilities for handling bulk cargo at the south quays was further enhanced by the provision of a second 10 tonne crane in 1981.  Heavy capital expenditure was also incurred in rehabilitating some older sections of the port and in reclaiming more land for terminal transit storage.  Also included were associated developments including surfacing new and upgraded roadways, ancillary services, plant and equipment and, of course, the new port centre.</P>
      <P>Virtually all of the development envisaged in the five year development plan has been completed and in all the board have expended in the region of £18 million on those works.  While those developments were in progress the international recession set in.  Hand in hand with that oil imports declined to such an extent that the board now handle only 50 per cent of the 3.1 million tonnes of oil products they handled in 1979.  Despite this dramatic fall in oil imports and in the oil trade the port held up remarkably well and has had a throughput of 4.5 million tonnes in 1984.  Another heartening feature was the fact that exports in 1984 were the highest on record.  That was achieved against a background of industrial stoppages and unrest.  The ESB policy, while welcome from a national point of view, of switching from oil to natural gas was one of the main reasons for the decline in oil imports through the port of Dublin and has had a big impact on the board's revenue earning capacity for goods dues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two most significant decisions taken by the board in recent years concerned the disposal of the 27 acre site at the Custom House docks.  As a member of <Col N="2623" /> the board I can say that from the time of the intervention of the Gregory deal the fortunes of the Ports and Docks went into decline.  That was their collateral for the capital programme in which they had engaged.  It was a viable project at that time because the economy was more buoyant, the construction was healthy and there was a demand for such an area. However, the Gregory deal put a stop to all that and brought about the financial demise of the Port and Docks Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder about that. However, that is all a matter for history but the Port and Docks Board paid heavily for it.  Stevedoring was also presenting a problem and the deep sea section of the port was in trouble with its work force.  The media have covered those matters adequately.  A start has been made to right the problems of the deep sea section of the port and the financial position of the board can only improve from here on in.  The years ahead will require complete dedication and commitment from all sectors of the workforce. Deep sea dockers have indicated their acceptance of the present difficulties by signing a three year industrial peace agreement.  They have endorsed that by providing an excellent outturn of cargo since the resumption of work.  That has been favourably commented on by shippers and agents and augurs well for the future of the port.  The board are launching a marketing strategy in an effort to recover lost trade and to entice new business to the port.  At last week's meeting we heard of several new inquiries about the port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facilities offered by Dublin port are second to none on this island and there is not any question about that.  This city grew because of the facilities at the port and it behoves all Governments to help those who are endeavouring to make the port a viable proposition.  In this respect the Minister for Finance could help us by declaring a free zone warehousing <Col N="2624" /> area.  That would mean that goods coming into the port for re-export &mdash; as a large volume does &mdash; would not be liable for VAT at that stage, which would make the port very attractive for many who do not use it at present.  This is common practice in many EC countries and I am pleading with the Minister for Finance to give the matter some consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Communications who stepped in at an extremely awkward time when there were difficulties with the workforce and the board could not realise money on their only asset and, generally speaking, there was an air of tremendous gloom and doom about the whole port area.  I am very happy that the tide has now turned.  The last meeting of the board was held in a spirit of optimism and I am certain that their future is sound.  There is a willingness all round to work towards success.  I am pleased that the Opposition do not intend to oppose this motion.  I am hoping all Members of the House will endorse this sum of £7 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As another person with a vested interest being a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, I should like to say a few words.  It is one good thing from 1985, coming to the recess, that we can talk about good news from Dublin port.  There were during the year numerous debates, Private Notice Questions, questions on the Adjournment and motions in Private Members' Time. Deputy Wilson and I in various ways have tried to highlight the problems of Dublin port and to argue for its viability and its future.  We have tried to bring it back to profitability.  As Deputy Wilson has outlined, the solution will be supported by us, but it should not be forgotten that it was the Minister for Communications who earlier in the year closed the port. There were difficulties, arguments and staffing problems and a long drawn-out battle and, as Deputy Glenn has said, a feeling of gloom and doom.  There was dejection among the community that live from the port area activities and fear that this Government would sell out the <Col N="2625" /> assets.  We went through strikes and counter strikes and I know from the Department Officials that it was not easy for them to keep negotiations open in difficult circumstances from time to time.</P>
      <P>The port of Dublin is just too important to the capital city and we are very lucky to have such a port.  For generations it has led to the expansion of the city.  It is regrettable that in recent years it has been run down.  Nobody should run away from the difficulties there, but business has been lost to that port and gained by other ports up and down the coast.  They may have been able to undercut, but the main reason was a secure service being offered without fear of industrial action.  At last we have industrial peace.  The management at the last two meetings have said that the workers have shown tremendous productivity and that there is a new life and enthusiasm in them and it is hoped that we will win back much of the business which has gone to other ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that the difficulties have had nothing to do with the various arrangements under the Urban Development Bill of 1982, as Deputy Glenn has alleged.  That Bill had set out to pay market price for the 27 acre site but in 1982 that site was not ready for sale.  There was a substantial number of warehouses there at that time and there still is.  The Department of the Environment had been instructed by the Minister of the day, Deputy Ray Burke, that there would be negotiations to pay market value, or something of that order. To use that excuse is regrettable and that lie should be firmly laid.  During 1982 the Urban Development Bill never passed even Second Stage.  There was no question of the management of the port being able to sell that site at market price.  They were in no position to do so, or to put a package together.  There may have been a few telephone inquiries and some written ones but for management to say that the difficulties of 1982 to 1985 originated from a decision of a previous Government to buy the site cheap and develop it is an excuse and a very poor one which would not stand up to scrutiny from anybody with the slightest knowledge of <Col N="2626" /> figures.  The management do themselves damage by using that excuse.  It does nothing for their credibility.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister when concluding will inform the House of the moves the Government now propose to make and the action which will be taken in Dublin port.  What type of commercial structure will be in place by this time next year?  It is reliably learned from inspired leaks that the legislation is ready and will be circulated during the recess.  If that is true, will the Minister confirm that? Would he give us details, as requested by Deputy Wilson, about the formation of the board?  I totally subscribe to that Deputy's views that to make the port successful the vested interest lobby must be removed.  They can give their advice in the same way as any other board in any area, but the board have outlived their usefulness.  What is necessary is a commercial market-orientated board with modern management and techniques, to encourage proper activity and use of the land and very valuable assets which are now lying dormant.  At a recent board meeting I looked out of the window and in the middle of the working day could see cranes lying idle, warehouses closed and the port virtually at a standstill. Thankfully in recent weeks it appears to be moving again, as Deputy Glenn has said, but it is a long haul.  That important site, if co-ordinated and used properly by a good board in the business interests of the whole country, not alone the surrounding Dublin area, would help employment.  That area which Deputy Glenn and I represent has the highest unemployment.  There is a vast number of warehouses readily available; all that is needed is a change of locks and one could use them for storage.  There are serviced sites, with no need for the IDA to start from scratch. Some organisations which I will not mention are prepared to give them to voluntary groups at 50p a year to give them some use, which is very commendable, but it is a pity that the whole area cannot be used to regenerate the employment given for generations.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take this opportunity to tell us his proposals, because <Col N="2627" /> there is confusion.  Some people say the legislation will be out shortly, but the Green Paper issued last week appears to be putting the development of the port on the long finger.  It we are to make a success of the port area we badly need a new board and I am doing myself out of a job here.  One of the reasons for my going on to the board, which I would like to put on the record of the House, was to highlight the fact that it was a talking shop, achieving very little.  My views have been confirmed.  I am not saying that the members do not serve the board well and have not the interests of the port at heart but there is a far more efficient and effective way and it would be a pity to lose an opportunity to further that.  If the staff are given assurances that their pension rights and jobs will be protected and that agreements entered into will be adhered to, they will be glad to see a change.  The remaining staff and their families can see that only a commercially viable port can be of benefit to anybody.  The difficulties and strikes of the past 20 years have done no good.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's proposals for the special development authority?  The 27-acre site and many other areas are connected with this.  I understood from a statement made on the first day of this session that the Bill was to be published before Christmas but that has been changed.  The Minister of State responsible has unfortunately been in hospital and if that is the reason for the delay then it is fully understood.  The Minister might say what arrangements there are to hand over this site to the special development authority.  It is very important for the port.</P>
    <P>There is some concern that under the Spain package for B &amp; I sections of Dublin port could be run down while Dún Laoghaire would be expanded.  Capital investment would be put into Dún Laoghaire, to the detriment of Dublin port.  I hope that will not happen.  We must consider the whole port area, not just that part of it which is in the hands of the Port and Docks Board.  All the <Col N="2628" /> activities of the port must be under one board so that they can be properly managed. The problems which resulted from the diabolical decision to set up Dublin Cargo Handling are patently obvious. Whatever legislation is enacted must be concerned with the development of the entire port for the benefit of the city.  It must not be dealt with in any piecemeal way.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure.  It brings an end to the difficulties of the port this year. I hope that 1986 will see an expansion in the port.  Legislation setting up a new board would help bring that hope to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address two issues, the first of which is how we set about providing reasonable protection for the taxpayers' pound in contributing to the rescue package for Dublin port.  The second is the broader issue of the development of Dublin port and bay in the round, not just for shipping and trading uses but also for wider amenity and recreational uses.</P>
      <P>This is the first time Dublin port has had to call on the taxpayer for State funds in the form of grants and guaranteed loans.  In dealing with this measure it is very important that we put Dublin port on a proper footing at the outset regarding access to State funds.  Too often in the past we have had an excessively tolerant attitude towards semi-State bodies.  We failed to set down clear enough objectives for them and when difficulties have been met the taxpayer has been drawn in without proper control or knowledge of what has been happening.  It is important on this occasion when Dublin port are coming to the State for the first time for assistance that we should get the ground rules right from the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the National Planning Board issued in April 1984 dealt at considerable length with the issue of how we protect the taxpayer as the shareholder in various State bodies.  It is worthwhile for this House to reconsider the things said then as to the ideal we should be approaching.  One of the proposals was that there should be very clear objectives <Col N="2629" /> agreed for any State body and that we should set up performance indicators as an aid to the taxpayer in seeing that we are getting proper return on money invested.  The board talked about the need to develop measures of productivity, manning, efficiency of the use of assets like vehicles, etc.  It is important in dealing with Dublin port that we set about having a board responsible for meeting performance indicators under headings like those.</P>
    <P>Too often in the past customer requirements have suffered in the Dublin port area.  There have been definite question marks over the availability of the service and its quality and reliability.  There has been a high level of complaints.  It is up to the State and the board acting on the State's behalf to make sure that once and for all we set indicators of what we regard as good performance by a board on these various counts.  We should get yearly accounts of how they fare relative to those indicators and we should make Dublin port subject to scrutiny by the Oireachtas committee in the same way as other State bodies.  It is not at present one of the bodies subject to such scrutiny and we should set about altering that.</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board drew attention to the fact that there should be a concerted effort to move costs of services towards the levels obtaining in competing EC countries.  This is especially important in the major port in this country.  Although Dublin is regrettably losing trade, it handles almost one-third of our trade.  It is crucial that we should be in a position to offer in Dublin rates of service in line with those in competing countries.  We should set targets for the board in moving towards keen competitive rates over a period of years.</P>
    <P>The other issue that must be addressed is the need for a proper restructuring of capital liabilities of State bodies.  The National Planning Board advocated that we should decide on what level of capital liabilities can be serviced by an efficient running of the assets by Dublin port so that we write off any other liabilities that exist and put the port on a clearly commercial footing.  Too often in the past <Col N="2630" /> we have been dragged increasingly into giving subventions by way of equity injections because we did not set clear objectives and commercial operating procedures for State boards at the outset. It is crucial that Dublin port should be given a proper start so that we do not find ourselves in a situation where, year by year, the board are not on a proper footing and we are drawn into a further enabling guaranteed loan or grants in the years to come.  We must be very careful to see that the board are conscious that that is their brief.</P>
    <P>One issue in relation to the board which causes me concern is the feature that Dublin Port and Docks Board, like many other State boards, do not have a funded pension scheme.  I know many people were very concerned and anxious during the difficulties which Dublin port experienced this year in regard to their pension entitlements.  It is regrettable that so many State boards do not have pension schemes and it is an issue which we should be tackling.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the broader context of the development of Dublin's port and bay which must also be considered when dealing with Dublin port and docks and future developments of the board in their commercial activities. This is an important opportunity to review some of the options outlined by the Minister in his Green Paper and I welcome a statement by him when he spoke in the House on a Fianna Fáil motion in regard to Dublin port, that he would envisage the new port authority taking a wider role than simply the operation of their port activities.  They should also take a wider role in the protection of amenities and the development of non-commercial activities.  However, I am worried in the Dublin context that it is the intention of the Minister to split ports rigidly into a three way classification of commercial, fishing or amenity ports.  It would not do Dublin a favour to establish such a sharp dichotomy between a commercial and an amenity port.  If Dublin was designated as a commercial port, which it undoubtedly would be, and the amenity side was played down we would <Col N="2631" /> suffer in the long run.  There is a need for a much broader context in which Dublin port and bay should be developed.  We do not have a forum at present in which the orderly development, balancing commercial interests with other users of Dublin port, can take place.  It is crucial that there should be such dialogue between commercial activities and others.  I am fearful that we will now build in a further scattering of responsibilities for the port.  At present Dublin Corporation are responsible for the sort of industries which go into the port area and, obviously, in the light of recent experiences with the proposed LPG development in the port area, we need a proper planning context for Dublin port which would prevent hazardous industries being located there.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the water quality management aspect will be hived off to a separate area, namely, An Foras Forbartha and the corporation, to be separate from the commercial side of the port activities.</P>
    <P>We are now welcoming the proposal for a development authority for the site of 27 acres on the city quay but it is worrying that it should be seen as purely a land development issue.  The potential for using the water resource is in danger of being put on a back burner compared to land development.  We need a broadly based approach to the port as an asset with many purposes.  I am fearful that the only agency now looking at that, the Eastern Regional Development Organisation, do not have the sort of teeth to ensure that there is a proper balance between the various demands on the port.  I should like the Minister to examine carefully, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Dublin Corporation, how we can develop a forum where there is orderly planning development for Dublin port, recognising the Port and Docks Board commercial brief but also recognising the crucial nature of the recreational and other uses of Dublin port area and the quays.</P>

      <P>Deputy <Col N="2632" /> Wilson and Deputy Ahern spoke about the reconstitution of Dublin Port and Docks Board and the vital part they would play in the future of the port.  I thoroughly agree with them.  The Government considered the structure of Dublin Port and Docks Board in the light of a number of factors including the Dublin docks review group and decided, in principle, that legislation should be prepared to provide for a more efficient management structure.  The Minister said that he will disband the Port and Docks Board at the earliest opportunity and will create a new Dublin ports authority.  This requires legislation and the necessary provisions will be included in an enabling provision in the Bill dealing with harbours. The Bill will deal primarily with the Shannon port authority and the Minister said that he expects to circulate the Bill during the Christmas recess and that he hopes it will be enacted early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this will provide the <Col N="2633" /> enabling legislation to do this.  Deputy Wilson mentioned borrowing by Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Following the successful completion of negotiations between Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the docks labour force and in order to enable redundancy payments to be met by the company, a revised borrowing package, which includes State guaranteed borrowing, was agreed between the Port and Docks Board and their bankers in early October.  The bank loans are conditional, <i>inter alia</i>, on the State guarantee being in place by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The total bank borrowing facilities of the board are just under £20 million of which £7 million has been covered by this guarantee.  In view of the non-disposal for the present of the port centre, the Minister has consented to a Local Loans Fund loan of £3 million to the board on the understanding that this will be used to reduce existing bank borrowing.  The board also drew down a Local Loans Fund loan of £2.5 million in February of this year in respect of a new ro-ro berth. As Deputies are aware, responsibility for all the borrowings of Dublin Cargo Handling has been taken over by Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>But they have not reached the £20 million yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand their commitments would total a little less than £20 million.  As regards the number employed by Dublin Cargo Handling Limited, the Horgan report suggested 120 dockers. The actual number of redundancies to October 1985 was 106 leaving the present establishment at 162.  That is less than the target set by the Horgan report but I am optimistic and if everyone works together it should lead to a satisfactory situation. As regards the Custom House docks site, <Col N="2634" /> I agree with all that has been said about its importance and its commercial potential. The future of the Custom House docks site has been considered by the Government in the light of the report of the interdepartmental working party who had examined the matter.  The Government decided that the Minister for the Environment should have a Bill drafted to provide for the establishment of a new authority to direct and control the redevelopment of the Custom House docks site.  Details of the transfer of the site from the Port and Docks Board will be addressed in the context of the drafting of the Bill.  As Deputies are aware the Government accepted the working party's recommendations.  The principal features included the establishment of a special statutory authority which will be introduced by the Minister for the Environment, the provision of a range of financial incentives to attract developers and occupiers to the site, and the incentive to provide a 100 per cent capital allowance for non-industrial building, section 23-type allowance for owners of residential property on the site and double rent allowance for traders to offset against taxation and rates remission for ten years.</P>

It must be a top notch authority because of the job they have to do, especially in the initial stages before setting the structure in motion, and also on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Glenn mentioned a free port being introduced at Ringaskiddy.  The Second Stage of this Bill has passed through the Dáil and during that debate the possibility of introducing free ports in other areas was mentioned.  I repeat what I said during that debate, that there is a need for caution and we must make <Col N="2635" /> haste slowly because if we have too many free ports they might be counterproductive. We have a lot to learn from the experience of the United Kingdom in this area, but I maintain that despite claims by other areas, the best way to proceed in this area is to learn from the experience of Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern and Deputy Wilson spoke about the proposed sale of the port centre.  As Deputies are aware, the Minister withheld his consent to a proposal by the Dublin Port and Docks Board for the sale and lease-back of the port centre because he did not regard the terms as being satisfactory from the board's point of view.  Of its nature the board's sale was the subject of much controversy and I would like to take this opportunity to explain the circumstances in which my Department requested the Port and Docks Board to take steps to secure a sale and lease-back arrangement for the port centre.</P>
    <P>The Government rescue package included a provision that the Port and Docks Board would take steps, including disposal of assets, to rectify their financial situation.  As part of a comprehensive review by my Department of measures needed to restore Dublin port to financial viability, the board had, at the request of my Department, identified in December 1984 a number of possible disposable assets including the Custom House docks site and the sale and lease-back of the port centre.  Subsequently, in March 1985 in the course of their financial review of the affairs of the board and their subsidiary Dublin Cargo Handling Limited, Coopers and Lybrand referred to asset disposal possibilities, again including the Custom House docks site and the port centre, which had been identified by the finance subcommittee of the Port and Docks Board.  Apart from the Custom House docks site, the single most valuable disposable asset identified was the port centre.</P>
    <P>It was in the foregoing context that my Department, in conveying to the board in May last details of the Government's revised rescue package, requested the <Col N="2636" /> board to take steps to secure a sale and lease-back arrangement for the port centre and to report back on the outcome. It is entirely a matter for the board to select assets for disposal and then to seek the approval of the Minister for Communications in each case.  Consent was withheld on this occasion because the terms were not satisfactory.  I hope this will set the record straight on the controversial issue.</P>
    <P>Non-implementation of the board's proposal, for the present, for sale and lease-back of the port centre has had implications for the board in so far as the level of bank borrowings is concerned. Having considered the position in consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister has given favourable consideration to an application from the board for a Local Loans Fund loan of £3 million on the understanding that such a loan would be used to reduce existing bank borrowing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton mentioned the performance indicators and monitoring of the situation.  He can rest assured that the performance of the Dublin Port and Docks Board will be monitored by the Department of Communications on a regular basis.  The new authority will introduce a major change, along with the package now on the ground.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the welcome they have given this motion, with various reservations of course, but there was a considerable degree of optimism in all the speeches about the future of Dublin port. That was based on solid fact, not on seasonal goodwill or anything of that nature.  Because the package has been put in place, the year 1985, with all its difficulties, will be looked on as a good year for the re-establishment of a viable and thriving port.  The propects for 1986 are considerably better because we will see progress.  I believe the problems of the past year have been put behind us. Dublin Port and Docks Board have a bright future provided the board, the management and the employees work together in a spirit of co-operation.  I do <Col N="2637" /> not think any of us, irrespective of whether we come from maritime constituencies, would disagree with the primacy of Dublin port and we now have an opportunity of restoring it to its former glory.</P>
    <P>Industrial peace is very important and the lack of industrial peace has been a real problem in the past.  For the future there must be industrial peace and we must provide a good service for the customers, otherwise they will go to the very good alternatives which are available. Given goodwill between all the parties, I am confident that Dublin port will return very quickly to viability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this important item on the Adjournment. It is timely to raise this matter on the eve of the meeting of the EC Commission when they are about to bring forward proposals for a substantial change in the EC intervention scheme and a radical reform of the system.  I understand that on Thursday there will be a meeting of the Council of Ministers when the proposals will be put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's proposals, if implemented, will be drastic and have serious consequences for the country.  When we exported cattle on the hoof there was much criticism of the farming community and those involved in the export business.  Since then we have carried out a system of slaughtering which has developed progressively and has been well managed.  It is important that we retain the intervention system and export refunds in an open-ended way.  The export of beef is a very valuable export earner &mdash; it is somewhere in the region <Col N="2638" /> of £1 billion.  It runs hand-in-hand with dairying which is also a major earner. Both are the basis of our agricultural economy and they make a significant contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>The EC are introducing the proposals as a panic measure.  They introduced the super-levy and the quota system in 1984. The surplus of beef was created mainly by the slaughter of surplus dairy cattle and that led to a substantial increase of beef in intervention.  The stock figures are as follows: at the end of 1984 the figure was 408,000; in 1985 the figure is estimated at 672,000; in 1986 at 712,000; in 1987 at 612,000 and in 1988 at 462,000. That shows there will be a substantial reduction at the end of a three-year period.  If the proposals get the unanimous approval of the Commission it will be very hard for the Council of Ministers to veto them.  It is vital that we strengthen the hand of our Minister for Agriculture if he is to defend our interests.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 per cent of our beef is exported and that is something of which no other country in the Community can boast.  To compensate farmers for the replacement of the intervention system by an income supplement is an insult to them because it is a new form of dole.  If the intervention system is removed beef prices may drop in value by 10p to 15p in the pound.  In addition, because of the artificial devaluation of the dollar in recent weeks the value of export refunds will drop by 20 per cent.  To date the shortfall has not been made up by the EC.  If they tamper with the export refund system it will have serious consequences for us because of our level of exports to third countries, and it will sound the death knell of our exports to third countries, mainly to the Middle East.</P>
    <P>We must look for a total derogation in respect of export refunds and intervention. The attractiveness of the intervention system which gives a floor price was one of the main factors for our entry into the EC.  Our agriculture is not developed fully and we are trying to build up our beef herd.  If we succeed in this we will be the envy of Europe in three or four <Col N="2639" /> years and we will be able to compare our herd with the best in the world.  If the proposals are carried they will grossly interfere with that development and will spell economic ruin for the island.  We must defend our position and fight all the way.  It is much more serious than the quota system imposed on milk production.</P>
    <P>Our beef exports are 10 per cent of our total exports and are 43 per cent of agricultural exports.  Approximately 180,000 farmers are involved in the production of livestock.  All our farmers are under tremendous pressure, economically and otherwise.  Small cattle farmers in the west, the farmers in the southern dairy areas and the beef producers along the eastern seaboard are the life blood of the processing industry.  That industry has grown over the last few years, and especially this year where there has been a major change in the method of sale of cattle from live to dead meat.  There are now some 15,000 jobs in the processing sector which is growing.</P>
    <P>In downstream or added-value processing the vacuum pack market for beef is growing.  From the figure of 10 per cent at the moment, it is expected to rise to 20 or 30 per cent in the next few years. That is proof of our commitment to develop the beef industry.  In the EC context it is proof that we are committed to marketing and selling our beef in processed form.  For those reasons, it is in our interest that the EC Commission and the Council of Ministers should retain the intervention system for us.</P>
    <P>It is expected that in the period 1985 to 1990 cattle sales will grow from 1.6 million to 1.85 million or higher.  That will be a valuable increase and will provide increased moneys in foreign currency, particularly in dollars &mdash; very valuable from the point of view of purchasing power.  Therefore, it is important that we would retain our third country market.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the new arrangements would be gradually introduced with phased premiums for specialised beef production.  There will be <Col N="2640" /> restrictions, possibly involving quotas. That will retard production at farm level, and income supplements built around that are not the answer for Irish farmers. We have been told about the headage premium for suckler cows at the rate of £15 per cow.  Such a scheme should be open-ended and, if so, it would be very attractive on its own.  It should lead to increases in our beef herd which, as I said, should be expanded to reach the targets I have given.  We have sufficient room for greater development there and it is important from the point of view of farmers' income to make a sufficient income to maintain comfortable standards on family farms.  We must have more intensive production and we cannot be seen to be tampering with existing mechanisms.</P>
    <P>Thirty per cent of our cattle are presented for slaughter, because of seasonality, in the early part of the year.  We are a grass producing country and therefore it is much more practical to produce beef in the later part of the summer than in the early part.  Thirty per cent of cattle slaughtered are presented early and therefore there is the high cost of production because they are fed on imported grain.</P>
    <P>The recent introduction of the quota system has started the same process in dairy farming.  Farmers have been getting out of seasonal milk production and that had begun to grow, particularly in the later autumn, in November, December, January and February.  We had begun to see later calving because our farmers want to maximise on the cheapest form of beef production, grass.  In future we will see a lesser proportion of our cattle presented for slaughter in the off season months.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Commission will phase out intervention in the next two and a half years and in that time there will be a substantial reduction and a levelling out.  Therefore, I cannot understand the panic in the Commission. The country that will suffer most is Ireland and therefore we must make a strong case in Brussels.  I have no doubt that the Minister will do that but he must <Col N="2641" /> hit the table much harder so that we get a derogation for intervention buying here for a considerable time.  It must not be based on a percentage and must be open-ended. We can produce milk cheaply and the same can be said of our beef production. We should be making our case as strongly as we can for flexibility, particularly because of the suitability of our climate for grass production.</P>
    <P>We are disadvantaged in many ways in regard to animal feed.  We have to import grain and we do not get the same concessions as other EC countries.  I have no doubt that the Minister will heed what I have said.  I again emphasise strongly my suggestion that he should make the strongest possible case in Brussels for derogation in our case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out at the beginning that no proposals regarding the curtailment of intervention for beef have been forthcoming from the Commission.  Therefore, the question is basically incorrect. There have been rumours and inspired information leaking from the Commission that some measures are being considered, but there have not been any firm proposals.  Consequently, there will not be a discussion on the matter, as suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe.  There would not be any point in having a discussion in the Commission on something that had not been before the Council in the form of a proposal.  I am referring to all 14 members of the EC, not just those in the agriculture committee.  There is no doubt the Commission will look for ways and means to cut the cost of the CAP and to curtail intervention for beef would be an obvious target.  It is common for the Commission to float ideas now and again for saving money and this latest suggestion emerging from some sources in the Commission is not anything particularly new or revolutionary.  It is a continuing process.  If the Commission discover that it has a fair amount of acceptance, they will latch on to it.  We would be giving credence to these suggestions if we were to take it for granted that they would be implemented, but no such proposals have <Col N="2642" /> been put forward.  However, should there be proposals on those lines, the Deputy and the House may be assured that such proposals would be opposed vigorously by the Government and by myself as Minister.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what Deputy O'Keeffe has had to say about the importance of the beef industry.  Any meddling with the intervention system would have a very detrimental and serious effect on that industry.  By virtue of the fact that by and large we are seasonal producers of beef, that the bulk of our beef comes on the market in the autumn, intervention is essential for us.  What has been suggested, according to the leaks from Brussels, is that intervention would be replaced by direct income aids by way of a premium paid directly to the beef producers.  I would find that unacceptable. We must consider the background to the problem and the difficult conditions under which the Commission are working.  We have in intervention approximately 500,000 tonnes of in bone beef and almost 200,000 tonnes of boneless beef.  The cost of storing the beef is astronomical and obviously the Commission are looking for ways of reducing that vast cost.  If intervention were eliminated or were diluted in any way the cost, too, would either be eliminated or reduced considerably.</P>
      <P>Apart from intervention, there are other schemes which help our beef producers. For instance, there is the scheme of aid to private storage and the scheme of export refunds but all such schemes cost considerable amounts of money and so the Commission are seeking ways of reducing these costs.  We must appreciate that they have a job to do.  They are proceeding to do that job and that is all right with us so long as it does not affect us to any serious degree but the elimination of or a reduction in intervention would affect us very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems in the beef industry have been compounded by the milk super-levy to the extent that one million additional cows have been slaughtered in Europe in the past 12 or 18 months.  Much of the beef that resulted from that has found its <Col N="2643" /> way into intervention.  That is an abnormal occurrence but it is expected that when the effect of that slaughtering has sorted itself out, the beef mountain can be brought under control.  As opposed to any restriction on intervention, we would be demanding that the inflow into the Community of beef from third countries would be restricted first.  There is an annual inflow of beef from these countries to the community to the extent of approximately 500,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>It would be exasperating for beef producers in the Community if their conditions were to be eroded seriously and that importation of beef continued. There is vast scope for the Community to put their own house in order and to ensure that the Community beef producers are given preference over the third country exporters.  If there is a serious problem there is no need for it to continue. Part of the problem is due to the slaughtering of the cows while a large part of it is due to the importation of beef from third countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2644" /> Another factor that has caused difficulties on the market is the weakening of the dollar.  This has resulted in a reduction in the price paid to Irish exporters.  Another more recent factor is the weakening of sterling.  That caused a flutter on the beef market last week.  We hope that these difficulties will only be temporary because should they prove to be long term they could have very damaging effects.  However, they are factors that are outside our direct control.  If they were to be added to by way of a curtailment of intervention, there could be considerable difficulties for those in the beef trade.</P>
    <P>The House may be assured that we will oppose strongly any austere measure that may be proposed by the Commission but, as I have said, up to now there has been no such proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two hundred fishermen have qualified for the special aid package. Since the purpose of those provisions of the aid package relating to the restructuring of loans, capitalisation of arrears and increased interest subsidy was to assist fishermen in difficulties under the BIM marine credit plan, fishermen who had no loan accounts with BIM or BIM loan guarantees do not qualify for benefits. However, all fishermen benefit from other elements of the aid package such as the removal of excise duty on fuel oil and the allocation of funds for the markets developments, exploratory fishing and harbour improvement works.</P>
      <P>Fishing vessels repossessed by BIM are returned to fishing activities under new ownership.  This gives an opportunity for these vessels to make an improved contribution to the fishing industry and to increased landings.  In addition young fishermen are afforded the opportunity of acquiring such boats.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to quantify the benefits of the scheme on the lines requested at (d) since each case differs depending on the amount of the loan outstanding, the rate of the interest at which it was borrowed, the period of the loan still to run and whether the loan was from a bank or from BIM.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally, including county roads, in County Limerick.  The State grants for roads allocated to Limerick County Council for 1985 amounted to £4,275,000.  This grant represents an increase of 28 per cent relative to 1984. Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of improvement works on <Col N="2435" /> county roads rests with the local authorities. The expenditure involved falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources which may be supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department.  The block grant may also be used, in the case of county councils, for the improvement, maintenance and management of nonnational main roads and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The disposition of the block grant, including the extent, if any, to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is a matter for each local authority.</P>
      <P>The block grant provision to Limerick County Council for 1985 amounted to £456,000 which represents an increase of over 33 per cent on the 1984 provision. In addition, since 1981, Limerick County Council have benefited from funds provided specifically for the improvement of county roads under the European Community western package.  Funds provided to the council to date under the package total £97,900.  In accordance with established practice under successive Governments, State grants are not provided for maintenance works on county roads. Expenditure under this heading falls to be financed from the local authorities' own resources.  The block grant allocation to individual local authorities for 1986 will be determined following the settlement of the budgetary provision for road grants for 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Loans to Ireland by the European Investment Bank are not made available on a county basis.  Generally speaking they have been raised by the Exchequer itself or by State-sponsored bodies such as the <Col N="2442" /> ESB or Irish Telecommunications Investments to help finance the main programmes of economic infrastructure such as telecommunications, energy, roads, water supply and sewerage etc.  Since our accession to the European Communities in 1973, loans to Ireland by the European Investment Bank have amounted to IR£1,690 million of which IR£260 million came from the resources of the New Community Instrument.  The programmes partly financed on foot of these loans are by their nature widely dispersed and cover every county.  The loans are related to the total cost of the programmes and it would not be practicable to give a county breakdown of the amounts involved.  Indeed certain programmes such as telephone subscriber connections, electricity distribution, arterial drainage etc. are not amenable to being classified on a county basis.  Generally speaking only projects carried out under the auspices of local authorities can easily be provided on this basis.  In the case of County Limerick 14 such projects have been partly financed by EIB loans &mdash; seven road projects and seven water supply and sewerage projects &mdash; but the county has also benefited from loans for investment in all the main sectors of economic infrastructure.  Additionally a specific EIB loan was made available for the construction and equipping of Phase 1B of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees provides that an employee who is discharged on the grounds of redundancy shall be eligible to receive a lump sum payment under the scheme provided he/she has the necessary qualifying service.  The scheme makes no provision as to when this lump sum should be paid.  The policy of the commissioners is to make the lump sum payments as quickly as possible after the date on which the redundancy takes place.  This policy will be followed in the case of the 87 employees who are due to be made redundant on 15 January 1986. Accordingly the matter of payment of interest does not arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees makes no provision as to when lump sum payments should be made to employees on <Col N="2444" /> becoming redundant.  While it is the policy of the Commissioners of Public Works to pay redundancy lump sums as quickly as possible it is usually not possible to pay them at date of termination of employment.  Recent payments of lump sums to workers made redundant on the Boyne and Corrib-Mask schemes have put into arrears the normal working of the pension section.  Any attempt to improve on the target date in this case would result in unacceptable delays in payments to other persons entitled to pensions, pension lump sums and pension revisions.</P>
      <P>The drafting of extra staff even if available into the pensions section for a short term would not improve matters.  Processing of each of the 87 pension lump sums entails a very considerable amount of careful and meticulous calculation which can only be carried out by experienced staff.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 9 October 1985.  His claim was allowed at the appropriate rate in his case of £93.70 weekly, from that date.  However, he applied for permission to sign retrospectively as unemployed from 2 August 1985 to 8 October 1985.  Having considered the explanation furnished by him, permission was recently granted to him to sign as unemployed during that period.  All arrears of unemployment benefit due for the period in question were paid on 6 December 1985.  Further weekly payments of £93.70 will continue to be made as they become due.  A reply to the Deputy's letter on behalf of the person concerned was issued on 13 December 1985.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that, by failing to furnish particulars of his means he failed to establish that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  He appealed against the disallowance but an appeals officer also decided that he had failed to establish that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  The person concerned was notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was interviewed on three occasions by the social welfare officer in connection with his claim and <Col N="2473" /> the last occasion was prior to the submission of his case to the appeals officer. On the three occasions he failed to disclose details of his means.  According to the Department's records, only one letter was received from the Deputy on behalf of the person concerned and a reply to that letter was issued on 30 August 1985. Following the recent disallowance of the appeal, a further letter was issued to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Regulations provided for the payment of a Christmas bonus in week ending 6 December 1985 to certain categories of persons in receipt of a payment from the Department of Social Welfare or a health board in that week.  Persons in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance were among the categories entitled to the bonus.  However claimants in receipt of disability benefit in the determining week were not entitled to payment of the bonus.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a married man with four dependent children who claimed disability benefit on 26 November 1985 after having been in receipt of unemployment assistance since 14 December 1982.  He was in receipt of disability benefit during the week ending 6 December and accordingly payment of the bonus could not be made to him. Weekly payments of disability benefit are being made at the rate of £102.45 as they fall due.</P>

      <P>Where a person has less than 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks. According to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 117 contributions paid on her behalf since entry into insurance.  She was paid disability benefit to 11 February 1985 after which date her 52 week entitlement became exhausted.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disablement benefit in respect of occupational asthma.  The claim was disallowed on the ground that he was not employed in an occupation prescribed in relation to occupational asthma.  The claimant appealed against the decision, and the appeals officer allowed the appeal.  The appeals officer considered that the decision to disallow the claim in respect of occupational asthma was correct; he decided, however, that the claimant was suffering from the prescribed disease inflamation or ulceration of the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory passages or mouth produced by dust or liquid or vapour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claimant was referred for examination by a medical referee to assess the degree of disablement resulting from the <Col N="2476" /> prescribed disease.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 154 and 155 together.  There are no special provisions in the Community regulations for producers who participated in the non-marketing schemes.  Thus those whose non-marketing period expired before or during 1983 are entitled to a quota based on their actual 1983 deliveries if they had re-commenced deliveries by that time.  Those whose non-marketing period expired after 1983 are in the same position as a producer entering milk production for the first time and as such are dependent on a temporary quota allocation from any flexi-milk available in their cooperative-dairies, after the priority categories have been dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the FEOGA scheme of grants for projects relating to the processing and marketing of agricultural and fish products under Regulation (EEC) No. 355/77 and under its predecessor, Regulation (EEC) No. 17/64 which provided for grant-aiding water supply schemes also.  Details of projects awarded FEOGA aid under these regulations are set out in the following table.  Of the total of £568,296 awarded under Regulation (EEC) No. 17/64, £147,190 has been renounced or underclaimed due to non-implementation or non-completion of the relevant <Col N="2486" /> projects.  The corresponding amount renounced or underclaimed under Regulation (EEC) No. 355/77 is £315,472.  Any amounts renounced or underclaimed by Irish concerns are immediately reallocated to other Irish projects.  A total of £1,487,873 has been paid so far under the two regulations leaving a balance of £665,444 still to be claimed.  While this situation is not entirely satisfactory, it is to be borne in mind that £405,936 of this balance relates to projects approved only within the last 18 months.  Approved applicants are allowed four to five years to complete their projects.  It is the policy of my Department and the IDA to encourage firms to submit their claims as rapidly as possible and the take-up of funds under the scheme has improved significantly in recent years.</P>

The Department understand that, in addition to this person's own off-farm income, his wife had an off-farm income from outside employment.  To substantiate his claim that his wife had no income for the last four years, it will be necessary for him to submit a statement from the appropriate inspector of taxes confirming that his wife had no off-farm income in the four income tax years ended 5 April 1985.  Until this is done, my Department cannot conclude its review of the case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 162 together.  As some 90,000 applicants have been received under the feed voucher scheme it has been necessary to adopt a simple and straight-forward scheme with minimum on-farm inspections so that vouchers can be issued as quickly as possible.  It would not be feasible to carry out individual on-farm inspections as this would delay the issue of vouchers for some months.  However, in calculating the individual allocations a generous allowance has been made for the generally poorer feeding value of hay this year.</P>

      <P>The number of warrants awaiting issue in the Limerick District Court office is 3,500 with a face value of £140,000.  The number of warrants in respect of the same area in the hands of the Garda awaiting execution is approximately 4,500 with an approximate face value of £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics relating to petitions are not kept in the form requested by the Deputy <Col N="2494" /> and their compilation in that form would involve a disproportionate amount of staff time.  Figures in relation to the number of cases mitigated and refused are available on a county by county basis only.  The percentage of mitigations on foot of petitions dealt with during my term of office for Limerick, Dublin, Cork and Galway (city and county in each case) was 62.6 per cent, 53.9 per cent, 69.8 per cent and 54 per cent respectively.  The number of mitigations in relation to Limerick was 301.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 177 together.  As regards the number of hours overtime worked by the Garda in the years 1982 to 1984.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 719 and 720 on 30 April 1985.  The corresponding particulars for the years 1978 to 1981 and for 1985 up to 30 September are set out in Table No. 1.  These figures do not include Garda headquarters, DMA headquarters and the Training Centre, Templemore.  Table No. 2 gives the relevant figures for those offices.  Figures for hours of overtime worked in the years before 1978 are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compilation of the detailed information sought in Question No. 177 in relation to overtime payments, in so far as it is available, would involve diverting Garda manpower from other more pressing duties and I consider that this would not be justified.  It is reasonable to assume, however, that the payments <Col N="2495" /> would be &mdash; for all practical purposes &mdash; proportionate to the hours worked and, as the total amount paid in overtime each year is published in the relevant appropriation <Col N="2496" /> accounts, substantially accurate figures of payments made may be calculated from the figures of hours of overtime worked.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is normally only in cases where the perpetrators of an armed crime have been apprehended that the ownership of firearms used can be determined and even then this may not always be possible.  However, the experience of the Garda Síochána strongly suggests that nearly all firearms used in the commission of crime are unlicensed.  For instance, a special check related to last year has shown that 229 firearms, known or believed by the Garda to have been used in the commission of crime, came into the possession of the Garda and all were unlicensed.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme which was launched in February, 1985 is aimed at helping the large number of productive and energetic people over 25 who have been unemployed for an extended period to make their contributions to social and community development.  Since the first projects under the scheme commenced operation in May 1985 over 5,400 positions have been filled in 1,373 projects under SES.</P>
      <P>The response from among the ranks of the long term unemployed, at whom the scheme is aimed, has been heartening. The large numbers who have indicated their wish to participate in the scheme and make a contribution to environmental, cultural and social development in their communities, has ensured its success. In each of the last three months over 1,000 persons have taken up employment under the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at present to give details of employment under the scheme in County Limerick as statistics are compiled on a regional basis only.  However, in the mid-west region of the National Manpower Service which encompasses Counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary (North Riding), 407 persons are employed on 110 projects at present.  The social employment scheme qualifies for assistance from the European Social Fund at a rate of £13.20 per participant per week.</P>
