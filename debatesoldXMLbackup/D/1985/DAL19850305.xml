    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government will mark International Women's Day, 1985, by signing the United Nations Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason the Government have not yet ratified the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1979 and opened for signatures in March 1980; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are mindful of the desirability of becoming party to this UN Convention in 1985 the final year of the UN Decade for Women.  The question of Ireland's accession to the convention is at present under active consideration, in particular the question of the extent of <Col N="1246" /> legislative change necessary to ensure its observance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the then Government in 1980 promised in Copenhagen that the convention would be ratified, can the Minister of State indicate how soon she expects the necessary changes in legislation will be implemented to enable that to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that we will be able to ratify this convention this year with the minimum of reservations.  As the Deputy is aware, there are certain reservations held at present relevant to this ratification but I have every confidence that we shall ratify it before the end of 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell the House what legislative change is required in order to enable the Government to accede to the convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the obvious one of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill and others such as domicile and citizenship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Government hoped, with reservations, to be able to sign it by the end of the year.  Could the Minister outline those reservations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be possible because the ratification of this convention will be in the form of a report.  It is the hope of the Government that we shall have minimum reservations.  Some countries have not ratified and some have very grave and serious reservations.  We are hoping that we shall have minimal reservations but I cannot outline them at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the 30 articles of the convention can the Minister say how many of those reservations would relate to which articles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible to give that kind of information at <Col N="1247" /> present.  The report that will be laid before the international conference in Nairobi in July will set out all of this information and it will be ready by then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Justice are working on this legislation which is regarded as a matter of great urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, there is a provision actively discriminating against women in the Aliens Act, 1956, whereby a male citizen who marries an alien can confer citizenship on his spouse.  However, the reverse is not the case and, if a female citizen marries a male alien, she does not confer citizenship on her spouse.  Will the Minister review that discriminatory provision which has great significance in terms of the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that legislation to correct this anomaly is being seriously considered at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why that discrimination exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>What discrimination?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>It exists because successive Governments have done nothing about it.  This matter was covered under citizenship legislation introduced in the fifties.  I am very interested in the concern expressed by the members of the Opposition because that is one of the first issues I took up soon after I was elected in 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government completed and returned the detailed questionnaire which was issued to all participating governments by the Preparatory Committee for the 1985 World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women; if the Government will publish their replies to the questions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>This comprehensive questionnaire has been substantially completed and forwarded to the Secretary-General for the 1985 World Conference to review and appraise the achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women.  A small amount of additional material will be furnished from my Department in the very near future.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to publish the questionnaire separately.</P>
      <P>In accordance with usual United Nations practice the information contained in the questionnaire will form the basis of the report on the achievements of the decade to be presented to the 1985 conference, which will be generally available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the questionnaire has been &ldquo;substantially completed&rdquo;.  Could she indicate what parts of the questionnaire have not been completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which <Col N="1249" /> has yet to be furnished relates to communications, industrialisation and rural development and I hope to expedite this within the next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the progress the Government have made in implementing the recommendations contained in the Report of the Mid-Decade Conference on the United Nations Decade for Women held in Copenhagen in 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's national report which will be submitted to the Secretary-General of the 1985 End of Decade World Conference will be a full study of progress made in implementing the recommendations contained in the Report of the Mid-Decade Conference held in Copenhagen in 1980, and indeed will report on the implementation of the recommendations for the decade as a whole.</P>
      <P>The members of the committee established to prepare for the World Conference, representing both governmental and non-governmental groups, have furnished much useful information for incorporation in the finished report.</P>
      <P>It is my expectation that the national report will be completed and forwarded to the Conference Secretary-General by mid-May, in accordance with UN guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Recognising that presumably the report will be very detailed could she give any indication as to what progress has been made towards the implementation of the objectives set out in 1975 and again in 1980?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any details at present but the report to which I referred in a previous question will contain all that information.  I should like to remind the Deputy that this report covered a wide area of issues relating to women, such as migrant women, women in the Third World, childbirth, post-natal care, nutrition, equality of rights and so on.  We will be able to present a very <Col N="1250" /> good report on the basis of the themes of the United Nations end of decade conference in terms of education, health and development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To reduce the dimensions of the question, could the Minister say what specific steps have been taken by the Government since 1980 to implement or effect the action plan as they affect Irish women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is contained in the report and it would take far too long for me now to identify the many areas in which progress has been made since 1980.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the <i>Programme for Action in Education</i> and to proposals by the Minister for Education to eliminate sexism in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be more specific in regard to the proposals for education which have led to the elimination of discrimination against women which she has cited as part of the general report to the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should put down a separate question in that regard to the Minister for Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have any plans to assist and encourage the participation of Irish women's groups in the United Nations World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks about <Col N="1251" /> the official conference in July.  I would point out that this conference is for Government delegations only &mdash; and Ireland will have a representative delegation attending.</P>
      <P>Perhaps what the Deputy has in mind is the non-Governmental Forum taking place prior to the conference.  I believe that the Council for the Status of Women who were grant aided to the sum of £80,000 this year will be making decisions on attendance of Irish women's groups.</P>
      <P>In order to involve as many women as possible in activities to mark the year, I will be allocating funding to groups of women throughout the country to undertaken projects at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I wish to ask may not be directly related to this specific point but it does relate to the whole question of the decade for women. In view of the huge area involved and the work which needs to be done, will the Government support a proposal that a second decade for women should be declared by the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>That proposal was made in 1980 but a decision has not yet been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate whether she feels that a second decade would be advisable in view of the fact that most of the work of the first decade has yet to be done?  Very little progress has been made and, outside Ireland, there are still wide areas of basic discrimination against women.  Does the Minister agree that it will take at least another decade to make progress in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The consciousness that the conference created was worth while and productive.  There are interest groups who believe we should be looking forward to and planning for the year 2000. There is validity in the suggestion made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Is the Minister aware that in 1985 a male pensioner can qualify for ancillary allowances such as free electricity if his wife is living with him but a female pensioner is deprived of them if her husband is living with her? There are many such discriminations in our code at present.  Has the Minister reviewed these and, if so, before we come to the year 2000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>Prior to the introduction of the scheme for the retention of cheques by the banks, representatives of the Irish Banks Standing Committee called, at the request of the Revenue, for discussions with officers of the Revenue on the implications of the proposed change.  For the present, at least, paid cheques will be retained at the bank in original or microfilm form for a number of years.  A particular cheque, or a photocopy of it, will be sent to a customer on request.  There is no reason to believe at present that a need arises for special measures to be taken to guard against fraud on the Revenue with regard to proof of payment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for giving me the figures in the form of an oral reply rather than in the form of a tabular statement.  How does he justify a figure of £58 million in expected revenue buoyancy this year when last year the figure was more accurate at £15 million?  What does the Minister expect to emerge from the budget to justify a buoyancy figure of £58 million which is far in excess of any buoyancy figure provided in any previous budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis for the figure is an analysis of the impact of the budget on the economy which, having taken account of the dynamic effects of the budgetary measures, gives a buoyancy figure of £58 million.  I have examined this figure with the closest of attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Minister described the budget as being neutral. In other words it would not raise extra revenue.  In that, he provided for a buoyancy figure of £15 million to balance the books.  This year's budget has raised an extra £400 million in taxation over last year.  How can the Minister put in a figure of £58 million and stand over it as being reliable and accurate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right to point out that I characterised last year's budget as neutral in its overall effect on the economy.  That is why the buoyancy figure was small.  By contrast this year's budget will have a more stimulatory effect on the economy and that is one of the reasons for the difference in magnitude between this year's and last year's buoyancy figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The central development committee which operates under the aegis of my Department is engaged in a process of consultation with the relevant Departments and State agencies with a view to determining whether expenditure on the improvement of landing facilities on Inishturk would be justified.  According to the most recent estimate of costs provided by the Office of Public Works, harbour works on Inishturk would cost £276,000.  It must be said, however, that having regard to the state of public finances, it is unlikely that funds will be available for work on Inishturk in the foreseeable future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My remit covers only cases where there is a need to co-ordinate the work of Departments and State agencies in relation to inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands.  In such cases, the central development committee evaluate the case for carrying out work which could not be justified by reference to a single requirement such as, for example, the level of fishing activity.  In the circumstances, I consider it best to evaluate each case on its merits rather than to devise a general scheme of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the tendency in relation to the development of harbours and islands appears to be that the criterion used on the mainland is always applied to islands and that expenditure will not be <Col N="1258" /> allowed unless it is proved that fish landings are sufficient to warrant State expenditure?  This is an unfair criterion as far as islands are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the point that where it could be shown, for example, that the level of fishing activity was sufficient to justify the work, I would not be answering the question because it would not fall within my remit.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy is putting a question to me about my involvement with the matter, I have explained that the work of the central development committee relates to co-ordination and evaluation and arises only where the work proposed cannot be justified by reference to one set of criteria but by taking into account a number of different factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that generally speaking the position regarding harbour development on most islands is serious?  The tendency among islanders now is to have bigger and better boats but for these vessels they need harbour facilities.  Would the Minister not accept that the Department of Finance are guided by the Department of Fisheries in regard to harbour development, whether on islands or on the mainland and that it appears to be unfair to islanders that there is no other way of assessing their requirements in respect of harbour facilities?  The only means by which islanders can have access to their islands is by way of harbour facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said the opposite. If development were justified solely by reference to fisheries, the central development committee would not have a function in the matter.

      <P>The Minister will be aware that the lack of harbour facilities is hampering fishing activity and that for this reason there is difficulty in establishing a case for developing a harbour. Obviously, there will be very little fishing activity when the only harbour available is a very poor one.  Can the Minister give any indication of the extent of the problem the committee are considering? He indicated earlier that they were considering a variety of cases and I presume these relate to the west coast.

As both my colleagues have been arguing, harbour development is much more important to the whole life of an island than would be the case of the mainland.  Is there a special provision for extra support for what one might refer to as the main avenue of development on an island, that is, the harbour?  Is there not special support available from the EC for such works and have the Government sought such support?</P>

I pointed out to the Deputy also that he should beware of taking in excessively facile a fashion the ráiméis that the leader of his party gave out on the radio last Sunday week when he spoke about the increase in the IR£ value of outstanding dollar borrowings and compounded the gaffe by asking what we might not do with that £400 million if we had it.  We have not got it.  It is not a cost that arises, it is unrealised exchange loss.  The amount of any actual loss will depend on respective exchange rates of the currencies in question the moment the loans come to maturity.</P>

Also, I remind the House that Deputy O'Kennedy appears to be familiar already with the information. If I took a different view of the matter I might have prepared a tabular statement to circulate with the Official Report of, for example table 25 of the finance accounts which gives the main part of the information requested by the Deputy which runs to a page and a half of fairly close typing in the finance accounts and covers a large number of loans.  On a certain approach it might suit me extremely well to stand up here and go through this table in detail, but I do not think that that is what Question Time is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>He is Minister for Finance who regulates and controls the economy.  Can he even in general terms explain and justify to the public the deliberate switch in strategy from mixed borrowing particularly in EMS currencies and Deutsche Mark domination within that to dollar borrowing?  Will he acknowledge that if £420 million is the cost today but the increase since that figure was calculated at the end of 1984 is in excess of £420 million, perhaps when <Col N="1266" /> we come to pay back dollars we will be talking about paying £700 million extra, not £420 million?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems to be either ignoring or else completely out of touch with the course of financial markets over the last few years.  I am sure he knows perfectly well that over the last few years the rising strength of the dollar has attracted more and more mobile investable funds into the dollar market. Most lenders want to lend in that market. As I said to the Deputy last week, there would be absolutely no point in my saying that we are going to conduct our foreign borrowing programme this year in escudos for example, or in a currency that is softer than those that are habitually available.  I could very well do that and find myself at the end of the year with one arm as long as the other because nobody wanted to lend in those currencies. We have to take account of the situation on the markets.</P>
      <P>Regarding the other currencies, we as a deliberate policy measure have a higher proportion of our foreign borrowing denominated in EMS currencies, as I told the Deputy last week, than most other EMS countries.  However, access to a number of those markets is limited by a series of different arrangements on different markets.</P>

Is not the figure in 1984 for US dollars £3,048 million according to a reply he has given in this House?  Is not the figure for DM in 1984 £2,332 million?

      <P>In view of the fact that all of the staff at Carrickcarnan are not on at the same time, as they have to work on a rota basis, will the Minister provide adequate staff for that post and also for Dundalk?  This would ensure that there would not be a minimum of a one mile back-up from Carrickcarnan to the North and on some occasions all the way back to Newry as has happened.  It is not reasonable to expect our customs officials to try to cope with such a flow when they have such small numbers of staff.  If the Minister visited the area he would see what the situation was, one that Deputy McGahon knows very well.  It is impossible for the officials to do their job.  They stop about one car out of 30 &mdash; that is all they can do.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been criticised for undertaking a major consultancy of RTE at this time.  I would like to repeat and to elaborate on my reasons for commissioning this study and for doing so now.  I want to say at the outset that never before has there been such a confluence of events in the history of broadcasting, every single one of which is likely to impact on RTE in a major way.</P>
      <P>Three critical developments have occured in the past few months: first, only in December last had agreement been reached at the International Telecommunications Union to greatly expand the frequency spectrum available to this country.  Second, the consideration of the proposals for an Irish satellite network is now moving into its final phase and decisions can be expected within the immediate future.  Third, the Report of the Cable Systems Committee was received recently and published a few days ago.  All three of these very recent developments indicate that we are now moving towards a completely new era in broadcasting on which I wish now to elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been trying for many years to secure additional broadcasting frequencies and so enable more local and national radio services to be provided.  These efforts have been rewarded recently when at an international conference last December under <Col N="1279" /> the auspices of the International Telecommunications Union the VHF frequency band allocated to broadcasting was replanned.  As a result, this country has secured extra frequencies which, over the next six years, will allow of five national VHF sound broadcasting services, including the existing two VHF networks and the third network currently under construction; in addition, during this period low power frequencies will become available progressively for hundreds of local and community broadcasting stations.  That obviously is going to change the structure of sound radio broadcasting in this country.  These extra frequencies now put into a completely new context the development of national, local and community radio.  The implications for radio development for RTE and for the Local Radio Commission &mdash; the membership of which will be announced this week under the chairmanship of Professor Colm o hEocha &mdash; arising from this new development are enormous indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson when Minister for Posts and Telegraphs established a committee to examine how this country could benefit from developments in satellites. The committee which reported to me in 1983, recommended that proposals should be invited for the concession to provide a hybrid broadcasting and telecommunications satellite in this country's orbital slot.  The proposals received in response to the Government's invitation for proposals have now been examined and it is expected a decision on the awarding of the concession will be reached in the immediate future.  Direct broadcasting by satellite clearly will open up areas of great opportunity and challenge for this country.</P>
    <P>The opportunity, if we are in a position to seize it, will be for Irish television and Irish programme makers &mdash; given the necessary creativity and leadership &mdash; to capture audiences far beyond our shores. As things are developing in the overall satellite world, not alone could the vastly bigger market of our sister island be within our reach but clearly further east into continental Europe and further west <Col N="1280" /> into east coast USA become real possibilities for the future.  Let no one underestimate the new situation that this creates for Irish television.</P>
    <P>Likewise, those developments pose an enormous challenge at home.  For if the opportunity for us exists to look beyond our shores likewise our shores will be open to television programmes from overseas.  A greatly increased competitive situation for our domestic television services is about to dawn.</P>
    <P>In regard to cable systems, concurrently with the invitation of proposals for a direct broadcasting satellite system I established a committee under the chairmanship of Mrs. Margaret Downes a little over a year ago to examine and report on how cable systems here should be developed.  That report has now been received and was published last Friday. It raises many issues in relation to the future development of cable systems in this country leading to a greater choice of TV programmes as well as interactive services.  I am now allowing three months for comments on the recommendations in the Downes report.  Thereafter I will be making my decisions on the future of cable systems in this country.</P>
    <P>All these developments which are now coming to a head are bound to affect RTE in a fundamental way whether or not RTE are directly involved in the provision of some of them.  But that is only part of the picture.  RTE were established some 25 years ago to provide one sound broadcasting and one TV service.  Since then the service has expanded to a point where staffing has more than doubled; the organisation is providing two TV services and three national radio services, as well as being the major shareholder in Dublin Cablesystems, the organisation that has the concession for cable TV services in Dublin and, through its subsidiary. Waterford Cablesystems Ltd., the concession of cable services in Waterford. A fourth national radio service &mdash; this time on long-wave &mdash; is at present under consideration.  These developments pose enormous organisational and financial questions for RTE.  They come at a time when the terms of office of both <Col N="1281" /> the existing Authority and the Director-General are due to expire.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons &mdash; major developments in prospect and changes that have taken place in RTE over the last 25 years &mdash; I concluded that the time was not alone opportune but compelling to have an in-depth study carried out for the Government by independent consultants.  It can hardly be claimed that I have acted in a precipitate way in arranging for this study for the first time in 25 years.  I want to make it clear that this study implies no criticism of RTE's performance in the past.  Indeed, given their resources and the regime within which they hitherto operated, they stand comparison with broadcasting services round the world.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised in some quarters for the decision to carry out this study and in others that it took over two years to decide on this study.  I have no apology to make to any of my critics on this issue. I believe the events I have outlined justify both the study itself and the timing of it. Indeed, if more studies of this kind had been undertaken in many of our semi-State bodies perhaps some of them might have escaped the harsh experiences of recent years.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored bodies have appointed consultants for the purposes of their examination of RTE.  I am satisfied that the scope of the consultancy being commissioned by the joint committee will not meet my requirements or those of the Government in relation to determining the suitability and adequacy of the existing structures, organisation and financing of RTE for the future.  The cost of the committee's study is, I understand, about £5,000.  But even if the committee were to spend their entire consultancy budget on this study &mdash; £70,000 to £80,000 &mdash; it would not cover the cost of the in-depth study I have in mind.  I might, incidentally, point out that this is not the first time that the Oireachtas Joint Committee and a Government Department commissioned independent consultants at the same time.  When the last major study of CIE was undertaken in 1979, the Oireachtas <Col N="1282" /> Joint Committee had also commissioned a consultancy assignment at that time.  It was recognised then, as it is now, that both requirements differed.  I believe the Oireachtas Joint Committee do an important job but my needs and theirs are different.</P>
    <P>I will be greatly surprised if the outcome of the consultants' examination will not result in changing both the requirements of the post of Director-General in the years ahead and the qualifications for the post.  It is conceivable that the consultants may make recommendations which, if implemented, would fundamentally alter the existing structure of RTE.  Against this background I would be failing in my duty if I did not ask the Authority to suspend action on the selection of a candidate to fill the post of Director-General.  Otherwise, the profound changes in the nature and requirements of the job, arising from the various developments I have outlined, would not be taken into account in the selection of the person to lead RTE in the coming critical years.</P>
    <P>I advised the chairman of RTE five weeks ago that I would be making a major and comprehensive statement on broadcasting and related matters in a matter of weeks and that in those circumstances it would be inadvisable to proceed with the selection of a director-general for now and that I proposed to meet the Authority as soon as possible after the statement was made.  I informed the Authority of my intention to commission a consultancy examination prior to my announcement last Friday, and again reiterated my intention to discuss the consultancy examination and other related matters with the Authority.  I explained to the Authority that in the light of the consultancy examination it would, in my view, be inadvisable to make an appointment at this stage since the requirements of the post and the qualifications needed to fill it could be changed.  I tentatively suggested that we might meet at the next monthly meeting of the Authority.  In response to the Authority's request for an earlier meeting I agreed yesterday to a meeting on Friday next, 8 March.  Contrary to <Col N="1283" /> some media reports.  I was not invited to meet the Authority yesterday.  I was informed last night by the RTE Authority that they were unable to accede to my request that they should suspend action on the selection of a candidate to fill the vacancy for a Director-General occurring next month.  I greatly regret that the Authority should not have agreed to this.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to stress again that far from wishing to intervene politically in the appointment of the Director-General, I am greatly concerned that not only this sensitive appointment but major appointments of State-sponsored bodies generally should be distanced from the political arena.  I have been concerned to do this from the time I took up my appointment as Minister for Communications and I stand on my record of having made appointments to the boards of those bodies strictly on the basis of merit and not by reference to political affiliations.  In this connection, it is very disturbing that there should be media speculation on the alleged political preferences of some of the candidates for the post of Director-General in RTE. The task of Director-General, which is never an easy one, would be impossible to perform if there was any suggestion that the occupant of the post had a political profile.  Clearly the arrangements for selecting a Director-General in such a politically sensitive area as RTE should be, and be seen to be, above politics.</P>
    <P>Given the media attention which these developments have received, the appointment when it comes to be finalised will be subjected &mdash; and quite rightly so &mdash; to the full glare of public scrutiny. The House can rest assured that the end result will be, as intended, to diminish not to increase political interference in RTE.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the terms of section 11 of the Broadcasting Act 1960 which specifically states that:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall from time to time appoint a person to be the chief executive officer of the Authority, and such person shall be known, and is in this Act referred to, as the Director-General.</P>
      <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Section 11 of the 1960 Act specifically makes it mandatory on the Authority to appoint a Director General. Is the Minister not in breach of the specific provisions of that Act by directing that the Authority should not appoint a Director-General?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition is aware of the full text of the Broadcasting Act, 1960.  Section 11 of that Act is conditioned by section 13 (4) which gives me a role in the appointment of a Director-General of RTE.  I have also a wider responsibility to ensure that the State companies under my aegis are run in the best possible way and given the major developments of broadcasting that I have outlined, the House or any neutral observer will accept that what we have done is appropriate at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I still direct the Minister's attention to the very clear and specific terms of the Broadcasting Act, 1960 which places an obligation, a solemn <Col N="1285" /> legislative obligation on the authority to appoint a Director-General.  To that extent the Minister, I trust, will admit that his direction is certainly <i>ultra vires</i> and outside the scope of the legislation which he has been entrusted by this House to administer.  Will the Minister comment on the implication in what the Taoiseach said &mdash; and by the way, we all noticed the alacrity with which the Taoiseach rushed in to involve himself in this situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to comment on the implication in what the Taoiseach said in Sligo and which has been reiterated here in reference to there being less rather than more political interference in RTE?  Does the Minister infer from that that the present RTE Authority have not been impartial and is he prepared to make such an allegation about such members of the Authority as Mr. Con Murphy, a past President of the GAA, an honoured and respected member of the business community in Cork, the newspaper proprieter Mr. Crosbie, and the President of the ITGWU?  Are the Taoiseach and the Minister inferring that the RTE Authority have been politically motivated in the way they endeavoured to appoint a Director-General?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition will be on his own if he wants to cast any aspersions on anybody in RTE.  All I am doing is confirming that there will be less rather than more political interference in RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely to this that I have been addressing my questions. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister have inferred that either the Authority or the outgoing Director-General have had political motives in their mandate.  Is he prepared to make that case here?  If he is not, both he and the Taoiseach should withdraw their allegation.  Secondly, may I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that in following out their obligations under <Col N="1286" /> section 11 of the 1960 Act both the Authority and the sub-committee have been impeccable in the way they have handled the appointment of a new Director-General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Haughey wishes to cast aspersions on anybody in RTE he will not attract support from this side.  I am not in a position to comment in any detail on the way the sub-committee conducted this matter.  All I am concerned with is that the RTE Authority have chosen to ignore my request, and I must consider that seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister refuses to answer in any kind of substantive way the questions I have put to him, I take it he is standing over the remarks made by the Taoiseach, to his discredit and shame. Is the Minister asking the House to accept that he does not know step by step what has taken place in regard to the Authority and the sub-committee since the latter sat impartially to select the new Director-General? Is he asking the House to believe that he does not know every move made and will he not confirm to the House that the members of the sub-committee behaved in an impeccable manner which will stand up to any examination? Will he be man enough to admit that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask one more question.  The Minister said that he is not prepared to come clean with the House, that he is not prepared to answer for the action he has taken, which is clearly in breach of the legislation with which he is entrusted by this House to administer impartially.  In view of the fact that section 11 places this clear statutory obligation on the Authority to appoint the most suitable person as Director-General, there is now widespread public belief that <Col N="1287" /> by taking this action the Minister is doing nothing more or less than seeking to get his own man appointed and that this is but a further step by the Government to assert complete control over the RTE Authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been trying to defend the indefensible.  He stands guilty in the eyes of everybody and I am not surprised to see him shaking in his legs and knees and elsewhere.  Now that he accepts that he has no statutory basis for the instructions he gave to the Authority, will he tell the House the manner in which he communicated those instructions, the nature of the instructions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My straight question was: will he make those letters public, place them on the Table of this House, read out the communications he conveyed to the Authority so that we can all judge whether he gave advice, made a request or gave an instruction?

      <P>Now that the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Reynolds have raised the question of the legal position, the fact of the matter is that there is a precedent for not appointing a Director-General for a very prolonged period during at least part of the time when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for making the letters available to me and to the general public.  I will now put another question to the Minister. While his lovely fairy tale here read very well and in depth I might ask him what changed his mind between 4 November 1984 when he gave an interview to <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> when he said, and I quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time the Minister said it would be absolutely wrong for him to interfere with the selection, that he would go along with his predecessors and what had been done before him in accepting the nomination of the RTE Authority.  That was on 4 November 1984.  All of what the Minister said today was well known to him &mdash; he has been in office since 14 December 1982 &mdash; and all <Col N="1289" /> the changes that were going to take place were well known to him.</P>
      <P>Therefore, why did he wait until the eleventh hour to issue his instruction for which there is no statutory basis?  Why will the Minister not now accept what he said on 4 November 1984, do the decent thing and not be destroying that station out there and all it stands for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds talked about an eleventh hour intervention. He spoke in similar terms on the radio this morning.  As I told the House, and as the chairman of the Authority has himself announced publicly, I spoke to him several weeks ago and asked for a deferment of any appointment.  I have already said in my statement that in December last the International Telecommunications Conference was concluded, when we knew we were getting all these extra frequencies.  That was the first change.  Second, the cable systems committee report has become available since then.  Third, we are now at a much more advanced stage in relation to satellite television.  These are major developments. We are now at a confluence of events which has never occurred before in broadcasting.</P>

      <P>A final supplementary in two parts.  First, will the Minister accept that at the end of all his investigations, call them what he will, the office of Director-General will be there either in that name or in that of chief executive and that, for the reasons he endeavoured to give to the contrary here today, a <Col N="1290" /> Director-General is needed in these difficult times in RTE, and that that office will remain?  Surely the choice of the Authority to put forward a name to the Minister, if the Authority are good enough today, will be equally good in six or nine months time when the Minister has had his opportunity of appointing his politicised RTE Authority in an endeavour to get the Minister's own man in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put three questions to the Minister?  First, does he really expect Dáil Éireann to believe that only in the past fortnight or so did he become aware that frequency spectrums, satellites and cable systems would be major events of the future when everybody else seems to have been aware for a long time that they were major events of the <Col N="1291" /> future?  I am surprised the Minister discovered only in the last few days that these were major events and suddenly needed examination when every amateur in the country knows that they have been major future events for a long time.  My second question is, does the Minister expect the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies now to withdraw their consultants in view of the fact that the Minister is putting in his consultants on top of ours?  May I ask the Minister quite bluntly, in view of our experiences with him and his Department with regard to Irish Shipping Limited, and the way in which the committee were treated at that time, are Deputies and Senators wasting their time week after week working on these committees when every time we endeavour to do some work &mdash; and our time is valuable, as is the Minister's &mdash; when we endeavour to spend some State funds in a sensible way we are completely ignored?  If that is the situation we might as well give up these committees altogether. I put those three questions to the Minister: first, was it only recently that the Minister became aware of these three things, second, are we expected to withdraw our consultants and, third, has the Minister any faith in these committees, and if so, would he perhaps give us some more money to carry out our work?</P>

Second, in relation to consultants, the Deputy's Government, back in 1979 &mdash; when his committee had consultants in CIE who were about to complete their studies &mdash; ordered a much deeper study of CIE.  There is nothing different in this except that we are doing it at the same time.  It is a matter for the committee to decide whether they should go ahead with their consultancy.  I do attach great importance to the work of the committee but we must realise that their work, as a parliamentary committee, is quite different from that of mine as a Minister of a Department.</P>

      <P>When the Minister decided to appoint these consultants, was he aware that his colleagues, the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance, had already approved of the appointment of consultants to investigate the affairs of RTE and report to the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies?  Is he further aware that those consultants had been appointed with the approval of members of the Government?  Can he not see that the role of the joint committee is seriously undermined by this action as well as his previous action in regard to Irish Shipping when he pre-empted the role of the committee, particularly in view of the <Col N="1296" /> fact that the committee represents this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was so aware.  Deputies opposite are carrying on as if the role of the Committee on Commercial State-sponsored bodies was the same as that of a Department of State.  In relation to CIE, the same committee had commissioned a report which was almost completed when the then Government in 1979 decided to appoint McKinsey Consultants to carry out a more detailed survey than that of the committee.  Therefore, there is ample precedent for my actions.  There is a different role for the Department and the Government to play compared with the joint committee, although I consider that that committee do very important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a smokescreen. At that time there was no question of consultants being appointed as a device to block the board of CIE from appointing a chairman or chief executive to that body as is the case at present.  Is the Minister satisfied with procedures adopted so far by the RTE Authority in processing the various applications for the post of Director-General?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that there is something very odd about a situation where we now have three separate sets of consultants involved with RTE?  In view of the efforts of the Minister for Finance to restrain public expenditure and to effect cutbacks in vital services, does it not seem slightly lavish to have three sets of consultants involved in the affairs of one semi-State body? Would he confirm, as Deputy Molloy pointed out, that the RTE Authority proceeded in an impeccable, above board way to make this appointment in pursuance of their statutory obligation to do so, a mandatory obligation placed on them by section 11 of the 1960 Act? Would he confirm that every procedure they followed was correct, down to bringing in this consultancy firm to help them in their choice lest there be any suggestion of personal preference or anything else involved?</P>

There are three sets of consultants involved, every step taken by the Authority was in accordance with statute and the best principles and practice of semi-State body behaviour.

I <Col N="1298" /> am asking the Minister to confirm a simple thing, which everyone concerned is entitled to know, and that is to confirm that the RTE Authority in all aspects of this matter behaved impeccably and that they followed the proper procedures in pursuance of their statutory duty?  I ask the Minister to confirm that they called in management selection consultants to help them in their choice.  Apparently this morning many people in RTE were oblivious of that fact, whether deliberately or not I do not know.  If the Minister refuses to answer these questions in the way a responsible Minister should, will he admit to the House that in this matter what is really at stage is simply this.

      <P>I am mindful of the fact that Deputy Woods was in possession on this Bill on 29 January when the debate was adjourned but he is indisposed and I take this opportunity of wishing him a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to amend the law in relation to the impounding of animals and to the liability for damage done by animals.  In framing the legislation the Government were mindful of the report of the Law Reform Commission on civil liability in respect of damage caused by animals.  That report was published in 1982.  In general this is a very difficult area of law.  The main provision in the Bill abolishes the present immunity enjoyed by owners and occupiers of land in respect of their animals straying on to or wandering on public roads.  The Bill imposes strict liability on owners of dogs for any injury or damage caused by their dogs, regardless of the disposition of the animals.  The Bill effects to give increased powers to the Garda in respect of the impounding of animals and these powers are being conferred also on local authorities. From now on animals may be impounded by the Garda or by local authorities even in cases where the owner of the wandering animals is known.  These powers of impounding are now to extend beyond public roads to places of public interest and public ownership such as State parks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the main underlying provision of the Bill which changes the attitude of all of us towards this problem is that the common law rule that occupiers of land <Col N="1419" /> had very little liability for damage caused by animals from that land is being abolished.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that so much time has elapsed before tackling a matter that is of basic commonsense and basic justice. We are all aware of the appalling injuries and carnage that have occurred on our roads to motorists and pedestrians as a result of accidents involving animals.  This problem is especially serious in rural Ireland, though in certain urban areas it is a growing problem in so far as straying horses are concerned.  Section 3 imposes a strict liability on the owners of all dogs for injuries and accidents caused by these animals.  Up to now if a dog owner was in a position to prove that his dog had no vicious tendencies or was not generally considered a danger, he was not liable, in most cases, for damage or injury caused by the animal.  Perhaps the great omission of the Bill is that the Minister was unable to include further measures to encompass the whole problem of marauding dogs in terms of our sheep population.  The National Action Committee on Dog Control, who were set up some years ago, have reported since, as have also the inter-departmental committee set up to inquire into the same problem.  I do not know why the Minister has not included the recommendations of both those committees in the Bill.  We are changing the liability in respect of accidents or injuries caused by dogs by re-enacting section 1 of the Dogs Act, 1906.  This section imposed strict liabilities where dogs injured cattle and extended it to attacks by dogs on persons. I do not understand why it could not have been extended further at this point to include sheep as well as people.  It would seem a simple matter to extend the provision to sheep also.</P>
    <P>Every county, including Dublin and all the major urban areas, has a problem in regard to marauding dogs attacking sheep.  The dog population is going out of control.  Perhaps one could say it has been out of control for some time. Though the licence fee for a dog has been increased from £1 to £5, there has not <Col N="1420" /> been implemented any effective provision to ensure that all dogs are licensed. There is bandied about a figure of 12 per cent in terms of the dog licensing, but one might ask: 12 per cent of what?  I do not think that the authorities have any idea of what the dog population is.  Speaking generally we are not a very civic-minded people.  We are not a nation of animal lovers and neither have we any special care or concern for the environment. When one puts the three aspects of our tendencies together one wonders why the Minister did not encompass in the legislation the final major problem in relation to animal control &mdash; the problem of marauding dogs attacking sheep.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow has a dog warden system which has proved extremely effective. Other local authorities are under pressure from members to implement such a scheme, but in view of the present state of local authority financing we in Wexford are not in a position to implement such a system.  If the Minister had been in a position to extend this section of the Bill on impounding, there might be no need for further dog warden systems as an effective measure of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for increasing the impounding powers of the Garda and local authorities.  At present the Garda can impound animals only where the owners are not known to them; but this Bill will mean that, regardless of the ownership status of the animal, it can be impounded by reason of being a nuisance in a public place or on the roadway.</P>
    <P>One major issue in this, as in all other legislation in relation to pounds, is that there are very few members of local authorities or of the Garda who can handle animals, expecially horses.  From time to time a rather amusing scenario develops in all parts of the country where one finds urban reared gardaí stationed, for example, in Wexford, chasing around public places and on the roads doing their best to corral and lasso animals wandering in these places.  There is no proposal in the Bill that would deal with this difficulty, but until such time as we devise an effective way of physically curtailing <Col N="1421" /> wandering animals the Bill will be less than effective.  It is much easier to turn a blind eye and to hope that the problem will go away; but there is a big problem in relation to rounding up perhaps up to ten horses that have been wandering around all night, having been released from some field and who may be grazing the long mile.</P>
    <P>The section relating to impounding refers only to bovines, equines, sheep and goats.  Some speakers have made the case that the section should be extended further to include wild animals that are held in captivity.  Deputy Yates has pointed to the problem that arose in Wexford in relation to circus animals.  This sort of case may be the exception rather than the rule but there would not appear to be any legislation to deal with the escape of lions from circus cages.  That is but one example and I am sure that Members can come up with others.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for increasing the existing penalties for turning out any animals on to roads or public places.  It is incredible that at present the penalties are only 10p and 30p or thereabouts for different offences in this regard.  The 10p fine for turning out animals on to the public road is being increased for the first offence to £150 and to £350 for subsequent offences.  Perhaps pound owners, local authorities or the Garda should be in a position to refuse to release animals unless these fines are pre-paid.  At the moment the fees for getting animals released from the pounds are insufficient even to meet the economic undertaking involved.  They are £13.20 per day for horses and £4.05 a day for cattle.  This is generally reviewed and is fixed under the orders of the Pounds (Provisions and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  The last order in this regard was in July 1984.  Small as this figure is, if the authorities could refuse to release animals until fines are paid, even if this pound fee is offered, this legislation in general will be far more effective.</P>
    <P>The effect of the legislation generally will be to increase the impounding power and greater effectiveness of the impounding procedure.  In 1971 similar legislation <Col N="1422" /> was brought in in this regard in Great Britain.  However, the major changes in relation to this legislation relate to the whole powers of impounding and liability of ownership of the animals concerned.  I appeal to the Minister to include in the Bill the one omission which in my view prevents this from being excellent legislation. As it stands it is extremely welcome. It is amazing that it has taken so long even to get to the House because it is based on commonsense and basic justice, but perhaps the Minister on Committee Stage will look to the possibility of including a provision for extending the Dogs Act, 1906 in relation to dogs marauding on sheep.  If this is done there can be no queries or questions about the effectiveness of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the effectiveness a little thought might be given as to whether the Garda or members of local authorities should be trained in the handling of some of these animals, particularly the bigger animals involved.  Unlike the situation 30 or 40 years ago, there is no doubt today that the vast majority of our gardaí and members of local authorities have no experience of handling cattle or horses.  I commend the Bill as it is to the House and I look forward to a response from the Minister on Committee Stage to the few points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue and necessary.  It proposes welcome changes in the law to deal with the many problems of straying animals. Over the years we have had loss of life, serious injuries, damage to properties etc., due to the failure of different Governments to face up to and tackle the serious problem of stray and wandering animals.  Before this Bill was introduced it was obvious that the Garda and local authorities had neither the power nor the necessary regulations to tackle these problems.  However, the Minister with the introduction of this Bill made a serious error in not having as part of the Bill provision for the control of dogs.  I understand that he intends to introduce later a new Dogs Bill, but now is the opportune time for its introduction or a <Col N="1423" /> widening of the scope of this Bill to cover the problems of dog control.  At present there is a growing demand from farmers' and other organisations for the introduction of legislation to deal with this.  The ISPCA are doing their utmost to bring in some aspect of control but, being in the main a voluntary organisation, they have not the resources, the finance or the manpower to tackle this problem seriously. In the past local authorities have tried to make help available to the ISPCA, but with their serious financial problems they cannot do so at the moment.  The time has come for the Minister to become more involved in the grant-aiding of dog shelters and to provide 100 per cent grant aid to organisations interested in the provision of such shelters.</P>
      <P>The implementation and collection of dog licences are totally inadequate with fewer than 20 per cent of dog owners holding licences at present.  The collection of dog licences should be transferred to the local authorities with possibly the revenue collectors taking on this task on a commission basis or new collectors being recruited.  This project would be self-financing and would mean a substantial amount of extra revenue to the local authorities to provide and finance such projects as pounds and dog shelters. However, the provision of dog shelters and pounds may not be easy.  I can imagine strenuous objections from people living in urban and rural areas because of the fear of devaluation of their houses etc.  Recently we had a typical example in my town, Enniscorthy, where it was mooted that a dog shelter would be provided, and uproar arose.  I see difficulties for the Minister, the local authorities, the Garda and the ISPCA in providing such shelters in built-up areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wexford farmers in particular have suffered serious financial loss due to killing of their sheep by marauding dogs. Many farmers have had 60 and even up to 100 sheep killed by such dogs.  The subsequent financial loss has caused serious hardship and poverty for some families.  In 1984 over 1,500 sheep and lambs were slaughtered by marauding <Col N="1424" /> dogs, at national level.  Farmers are not in a position to claim compensation for such losses.  I would like to see the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Justice and the farming organisations coming together with a view to providing a compensation fund for such farmers possibly with grant aid from both Departments and a small levy from the farming organisations or the farmers in general paid through the co-operatives and the marts.  Many farmers have suffered severe hardship and at present are living below the poverty line.  Different Ministers in different Departments should make some effort to compensate farmers and provide a fund for this.</P>
    <P>Wandering horses have become a major problem in rural areas and, indeed, in urban areas.  With the introduction of this legislation the Garda and the local authorities will be given additional powers to deal with this problem, but additional powers are useless unless the finance and the facilities also are made available.  I would like to ask what finance and facilities the Minister will make available. At present the Garda and local authority workers spend hours trying to round up wandering animals throughout the urban and rural areas and bring them to pounds that are in poor condition and badly fenced, and more often than not the animals will break out or the owners will come along at night, break the fences and remove the animals without paying any fine whatsoever.  It is laughable to see gardaí trying to act as cowboys rounding up horses etc. in urban areas.  An effort should be made to remedy this situation, and this can be done if the Minister provides the finance, the manpower and the support to tackle it.  Surely it is not right that gardaí spend hours of their time rounding up horses.  They should be using their valuable time in combating crime and looking after the problems of the ordinary people.  Urban areas have not adequate or proper pounds to hold such animals.  I would like the Minister to make finance available to local authorities to enable them to provide better pounds and better back-up facilities. <Col N="1425" /> Section 2 (1) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>So much of the rules of the common law relating to liability for negligence as excludes or restricts the duty which a person might owe to others to take such care as is reasonable to see that damage is not caused by an animal straying on to a public road is hereby abolished.</P>
    <P>As a layman I find this section confusing and cloudy.  Does the Minister mean that, regardless of what happens, the landowner will be responsible?  For example, if the landowner's gates are left open or if the fences are broken down by another party, if the landowner can prove this will he be granted immunity from charges preferred by the Garda?  Another matter that needs clarification is that of guard dogs.  With the rising crime rate of vandalism particularly in urban areas, many house owners are resorting to guard dogs for protection and many owners are concerned that if their guard dog attacks an intruder and possibly maims him will he be liable for damages.  This should not be the case.  An owner of a fully licensed guard dog should not be responsible for the behaviour of the dog during a deliberate act of crime.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the Garda, local authorities and general public have expressed serious concern about the haphazard way we have dealt with the problems of stray and wandering animals but up to now they were powerless to make any efforts to solve the problem.  I hope this Bill will allow the problem to be tackled seriously.  I hope the Minister will consider the possibility of introducing immediately the new Bill relating to dogs or else incorporate the provisions in the legislation before the House.  I ask him also to clarify the points of concern raised by other speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers on both sides of the House I welcome this Bill which is long overdue.  As an indication of how long it is overdue I refer to the recent spate of attacks by wandering dogs on young children and cyclists in Galway city.  As a member of <Col N="1426" /> the Committee on Legislation I dealt with the 1977 working party report regarding wandering animals and I came across something which gave an indication of how five years ago it was considered legislation in Canada &mdash; which country had the same problems as Ireland &mdash; should have been changed.</P>
      <P>A Mr. Justice Roach in a literary flourish painted an appropriate picture of the regulations and rulings in Canada as they operated in modern social conditions. He made the following comment:</P>
      <P>It is now over 200 years since Thomas Gray wrote his famous lines descriptive of rural England at eventide, `The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea'.  The lea no doubt included such highways as then traversed the landscape.  As I read the modern English cases the herd may still wander along those same highways without the owner being subject to civil liability for the injuries they may cause.  No longer in this Province does `the ploughman homeward plod his weary way'.  He goes now in his tractor, oft-times along the highway.  The farmer whose land adjoins the King's Highway can in this modern era scarcely know the meaning of the `solemn stillness' of which Gray wrote.  No longer can he be conscious of the beetle wheeling his droning flight.  What he hears, instead, is the whir of motor cars wheeling their way at legalized speed along the adjoining highway.  The common law of England may have been adequate in Gray's day. The Courts in England have held that it is still adequate, but surely it must be apparent that today in this Province it is not.</P>
      <P>I contend that it applies to us also.  The general public will be glad of the changes proposed in this Bill which give to the Garda the authority to round up and impound wandering animals.  It also extends that authority to local authorities to impound animals found wandering in public parks and open spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on the increased charges in respect of pounds. These are quite substantial.  As a previous <Col N="1427" /> speaker pointed out, it was silly that the fine for turning an animal loose on roads was between 10p and 50p.  Thus, owners were encouraged to have animals impounded because it was cheaper than keeping them at home.  There is also the question of the physical construction of pounds.  A substantial amount of money is involved in this area but if the Bill is effective the number of wandering animals should diminish and we might find ourselves with empty pounds.  I can understand the reluctance of the Minister to involve himself in building pounds in every village and to prefer that they be provided by private individuals.</P>
    <P>The money raised in the pounds, whether payment of fees by owners of animals or by the sale of animals impounded, should be used not only to run the pounds efficiently but also to provide for wardens.  Perhaps we should have something like the American system where dog catchers are paid to round up unlicensed animals.  These people should have training.  As has been pointed out, many gardaí come from urban areas and have no experience of rounding up substantial numbers of horses, as was the case in Galway city.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  The two major measures that are in operation date back to 1935 and to 1851 &mdash; in the latter case I refer to the Summary Jurisdiction Act.  By virtue of the Provisions of that Act the occupier of land on which an animal trespasses must return the animal to the owner if the owner is known.  If the owner is not known, he is at liberty to have the animal impounded but to recover any damages he has to apply to the District Court.  This system is archaic and a more rational and modern system will be implemented when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>In section 6 the Minister refers to undeveloped housing estates.  Deputies from urban areas will see what the Minister is trying to do here.  In such estates animals are let loose deliberately and they wander quite freely.  I compliment the Minister on the way he has worded the Bill so that the local authorities or the Garda may <Col N="1428" /> round up and impound animals found in such areas provided that the owner of the land states that the animals are not his and that he does not wish to have them on his land.</P>
    <P>One of the changes recommended in the report of the Law Reform Commission was that of strict liability on the owners of animals found wandering.  Like the Minister, I believe strict liability is excessively harsh, although I know that animals have been involved in quite a number of accidents.  From a report of An Foras Forbartha on accidents in which animals were involved which dealt with the situation up to 1980, it is notable that the number of such accidents was lowest in 1980 as compared with the preceding years back to 1968.  This indicates that farmers have realised their animals are valuable and must be better guarded.  I hope I am right in that and that the figures will continue to drop.  In 1980 in 503 fatal accidents there were two cases in which animals were involved.  The total number in the section dealing with injuries was 5,180, in 54 of which animals were involved. It would appear that the numbers are dropping, and I hope that trend continues.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recommended that ordinary negligence should be a defence in law against a claim.  I concur completely with him and I also agree with the proposal regarding strict liability for all cases of injury caused by attacks on persons by dogs.  I can understand why nobody is willing to come to grips with this grave problem.  The ICMSA, the IFA and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals made a submission to the Government recommending particular changes in the Dogs Act and I cannot understand why these changes have not been brought before the House.</P>
    <P>The growing concern about wandering dogs is natural.  Statistics prove that the number of dogs is increasing rapidly and it is difficult to find out who the owners are.  I suggest that the Minister enforce dog licensing.  When this Bill was first introduced Deputy Hyland said that the loss of revenue from the non-collection of dog licences was in the region of £2.5 <Col N="1429" /> million.  I am not sure if that figure is accurate but, if it is, this £2 million could provide adequate pounds throughout the country.  Deputy Hyland suggested that the licensing fee should be increased to £5.  That might be a bit harsh.  Nevertheless, I suggest that the Minister update the dog legislation so that each dog would be licensed, wear a collar and have an identification tag.  Any animal found without identification would be immediately put into a pound and after a certain time the pound would decide whether the dog would be put down or sold.  At present if a dog injuries a person the owner can disclaim all responsibility because it would be very difficult for anybody to prove to whom the animal belonged since he does not wear an identification tag.  This is an out for dog owners.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the number of attacks on people in rural areas, many of whom have guard dogs. Recently a reporter rang me and asked if I was aware of the fact that elderly people were keeping a certain amount of money in their houses in case they were attacked because then they would hand over that money.  He asked me what was my opinion of this and I said it would be better if they bought a dog.  I did not mean that they should have a dog just for the sake of having a dog; I meant they should have a dog which was trained to defend, although not necessarily attack unless there was no other way out.  The Minister should take into account the number of attacks on sheep by dogs.  Perhaps on Committee Stage he could ensure that there would be adequate protection for sheep and other animal owners.  This would have my 100 per cent support; at present the Bill has 99 per cent of my support.</P>
    <P>The ordinary crime of negligence in respect of wandering animals does not occur in areas where there is commonage or where traditionally there has not been any fencing.  This applies particularly to the West.  Driving from Dublin one notices the changes from hedgerows to stone walls until one reaches the west coast where there are not even walls.  It would <Col N="1430" /> be very difficult for any farmer to fence areas in Connemara or Kerry.  I do not think tourists would like that.</P>

      <P>The first thing that struck me on reading this Bill was, with regret, that the crucial recommendation on this branch of the law which had been made by the Law Reform Commission was not being implemented.  I wonder about that because we set up this Law Reform Commission at very considerable expense.  I understand it costs about £7 million a year to run.  They are a very able body of legal and other specialists and they go to some degree of investigation and trouble in examining the questions of law reform delegated to them and prepare their documentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They went into the question of civil liability for animals in some detail.  First they prepared a very comprehensive and exhaustive working paper, No. 3 of 1977, and not being unduly rushed about it, they prepared their report some years later in 1982 &mdash; the Report on Civil Liability for Animals, LRC No. 2, 1982.  In that report the crucial factor they wished to see implemented was to provide for the strict liability of owners and animals for damage and injury they would cause.  In my view their recommendation is entirely right.  A motorist confronted by an animal may sustain serious personal injury &mdash; and this could happen to any of us &mdash; or death.  Families can then be deprived of their wage earners and young children can be left destitute.  The question is: should that loss fall on that family, on the farmer or on the person who owns the animal which was responsible for the accident?  The farming lobby, which is no mean lobby where power is concerned, would not wish that liability to fall on them.  I fear that the reason we have the <Col N="1431" /> Bill in its present from, washing down and denuding the force of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, must be due to some excessive pressure brought about by the farming lobby.</P>
    <P>The farming lobby would maintain, I suppose, that if it was not their fault they should not be liable and that it should be on a fault basis.  That is a line of argument; but considering all the factors I do not see that it warrants being implemented. The fact remains that it was that person's animal, they should control it and ensure that it cannot cause the death or injury of innocent people.  If an accident happens in that way and a person is injured for life, the damage has been done and the question that must be determined is &ldquo;Who is to carry the can for that injury?&rdquo;.  Is it to be the innocent motorist or the owner of the animal?  It ought to be the owner of the animal.  Would it place a tremendous burden on the farming community if such a legal provision was instituted?  Is this a provision which would put farmers out of business, which would be a tremendous burden on their profits and which would be a tremendous difficulty for them?  Is that the kind of argument that is put forward?  If it is, it does not hold water.</P>
    <P>Some investigations were carried out as to what it would cost a farmer to insure himself against this liability.  When we considered this in the Joint Committee on Legislation we thought that there might be something in this argument that it would cost substantial sums for a farmer to get insured to cover his public liability for his animals causing death or injury to people.  The information given to us from the Irish Insurance Association in their letter of 13 July 1984, addressed to the Clerk of the Joint Committee on Legislation, indicated that the average existing premium for a farmers' liability insurance is in the region of £25 to £30 and they went on to say that in the event of a farmer's liability being made straight &mdash; in other words, that they would be liable for any injury or damage caused by their animals in any circumstances &mdash; that <Col N="1432" /> would warrant an increase in the premium of the order of 200 per cent.  An increase of the order of 200 per cent on an existing premium of £30 gives a premium of under £100, which is not the end of the world by any means, and a small price to pay for providing security and compensation for unfortunate people unlucky enough to be involved in a serious accident with animals on a dark country road.  It would not be beyond the bounds of fairness, equity or reason to expect farmers to carry that kind of insurance. They could well carry that in their profit and loss accounts.  It is an indication of unreasonableness that for so small a premium they would endeavour to avoid liability for accidents caused in such a way.</P>
    <P>Are we talking about something that rarely happens?  What is the extent of injuries or deaths caused by this situation? I do not suggest that this is a very common occurrence, but it happens all the time.  Unfortunately, the most recent figures we have available are only up to the year 1980.  There may be later figures available but we have not got them at our disposal.  Deputy Coogan referred to the figures and, as he said, for every year between 1968 and 1980 at least two deaths were caused as a result of these accidents involving animals and some years it was as high as nine.  It was never less than two deaths being caused.  So far as injuries were concerned, the lowest figure for any year was 54.  In most years it was well over the 100 mark.  There were 100 injuries per year and at least two deaths per year caused in this way.  While it is not an overwhelming preponderance of injuries there is a substantial enough number involved and it is a regular thing. For the unfortunate person at the wrong end of the situation it is a very serious matter and it could spell disaster for an entire family.  All that would be required to deal with that kind of situation would be a relatively modest expenditure of under £100 a year for a farmer in providing insurance.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of fencing and to the question of whether it is customary to fence in certain locations. <Col N="1433" /> I am unhappy about that exception from the Bill.  It seems too vague, and the question of whether it would be customary in a particular area to fence is something that I would have wished to be more specifically laid down in the Bill.  Having to go into evidence of what was customary in an area could create problems for courts in that there would be borderline areas where that question alone could give rise to considerable doubt.  The fact that an injured party will still have to prove his case and prove negligence against the owner of the animal, if this Bill is passed in its present form, gives rise to considerable difficulties on the part of the claimant for damages.  The question of locating the owner of the animal, trying to find out under what circumstances the animal escaped onto the road and of assessing whether the fence was weak, whether the farmer had maintained it, and of establishing where exactly the animal got onto the road are questions that could present insuperable difficulties of proof to an injured person. For that reason the onus ought to be on the farmer to excuse himself rather than that the burden of proof be on the injured party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will control wandering animals.  In the past three years I had the experience of knowing of two people who had fatal accidents, one was a motor cyclist and one a motorist.  Both were killed because of animals wandering on the road.  In Kerry during the weekend I saw at least five horses wandering near Tralee causing considerable disruption of traffic on the main road.  I welcome the Bill because we all agree it is time something was done to control such animals and to provide for impounding them.  Local authorities in future can put animals in pounds, but unfortunately many counties have not got proper pounds.  In former years every town had a pound attached to it.  I suggest that local authorities and urban district councils will have to buy land on which to set up pounds into which they will be allowed to put the animals which they can sell or destroy if not collected. <Col N="1434" /> In the past councils had to get an order from a district justice and this sometimes caused considerable delay.  Therefore, the Bill gives important new powers to local authorities and I am sure that as a consequence the number of animals wandering abroad will be reduced considerably.</P>
      <P>I suggest that one provision should be amended on Committee.  A farmer may keep his fences very well but somebody passing by at night, whether as a joke or blackguardism, may open his gates and allow his animals to escape on to the public road.  There should be a provision in the Bill to protect that landowner if it can be proved that he had been keeping his fences in good trim.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions on dogs.  All of us have seen the damage done and the injuries caused by them to sheep and, in Kerry, even to cattle.  In my parish 12 to 14 dogs every night hunted cattle and caused considerable injury and damage, because bullocks and cows got their legs broken.  Eventually, farmers had to poison or shoot those dogs.  Heretofore, no one was liable for such damage but the Bill provides that dog owners will be liable in future.  In the sections dealing with dogs I think there is room for an amendment.  A farmer living on a remote holding may keep a dog to protect his person and property but if a robber or a blackguard calls and is attacked by the dog the owner can be liable for heavy damages.  Throughout the country people living in such circumstances depend on guard dogs to protect their persons, their property and their stock and there should be something in the Bill to render them not liable when their dogs attack intruders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should consider allowing local authorities to collect dog licence fees and to use the money to appoint dog wardens.  This would help to reduce the number of wandering unclaimed dogs throughout the country which do such terrible damage.  Only about one-tenth of the licence fees due on dogs are taken out.  If we had 100 per cent collection it would mean there would be a substantial <Col N="1435" /> fund for local authorities out of which to pay wardens.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the fine has been increased substantially for allowing animals to stray.  It will be £150 for a first offence and £350 for a second.  This should act as a deterrent.  People will have to keep their fences in good trim. The provisions will deter those who do not own land and permit their animals to wander on the public road at night.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to insurance cover.  In the past farmers obtained public liability insurance for a premium of between £25 and £30 annually but I have no doubt that when the Bill is passed that premium will be increased considerably. Has the Minister had any discussions with insurance companies about the extent of the increase?  It must be remembered that it will mean an extra cost to farmers. There is no doubt that dog owners will also have to take out insurance cover for their animals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions.  I have no doubt that owners of animals will keep them under control from now on.  Wandering animals on the public road have always been a great hazard to traffic.  I have had occasion to come upon two fatal accidents caused by wandering animals. I am pleased to note that the provisions will deal with marauding dogs.  Such animals have caused a lot of damage down the years; the figure must run into millions of pounds.  It is time we had legislation to control wandering animals and marauding dogs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This important Bill is overdue and tackles some real problems. The net effect of its provisions will be to make life safer in the countryside and more pleasant in urban areas.  However, I have two reservations about its provisions. I endorse emphatically the reservation expressed by Deputy Mervyn Taylor about the failure of the Bill to include one of the central recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on whose report the Bill was based.  The Law Reform Commission proposed that the <Col N="1436" /> law should be replaced by a general provision to the effect that the keeper of any animal should be strictly liable for any damage caused by it, the damage caused to be reduced if there was contributory negligence on the part of the injured person and strict liability to be subject to certain qualifications such as what I call an act of God.</P>
      <P>That was an important, if not central, recommendation, in the report of the Law Reform Commission and it should have been acted upon.  I understand the reasons why it was not acted upon and I can see how in some of the discussions we had in the Joint Committee on Legislation this was becoming an urban-rural issue.  As a Member whose roots are entirely rural and who still regards himself as essentially a rural person I can understand those fears but, nonetheless, it should have been possible to find some obligatory insurance scheme for farmers which would meet the cases I have in mind.  The vast majority of farmers have a strong vested interest in ensuring that their animals do not stray and that they are neither the cause of accidents nor injured in them.  There is a strong vested commonsense interest on the part of animal owners in ensuring that straying does not take place and accidents are not caused.</P>
      <P>However, I believe a provision such as I suggested would have brought greater pressure on animal owners &mdash; they are not necessarily farmers &mdash; who are careless or negligent, or both, and allow their animals to wander, are oblivious to and unworried about the consequences.  We are all aware of fatal accidents caused because animal owners were careless or negligent, allowed their animals to wander and could do so with impunity. We have heard of cases where those injured were left not just without compensation but where billed for the cost of the accident.  I compliment the farming lobby, if that is what happened, that got its way on this clause, and regret it is not part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Bill was being prepared at the same time as the Joint Committee on Legislation was debating the <Col N="1437" /> report of the Law Reform Commission on this subject.  We had a case of a Government Department working in tandem with a committee of the Oireachtas. It was a discourtesy to the Joint Committee that this was allowed to happen.  There was full agreement and open discussion at meetings of that all-party committee and we made it clear to the Department what we were doing. However, the Department pressed ahead.  The Department were less than courteous in dealings with the committee. I should like to place on record the dissatisfaction felt by all members of that Joint Committee about the way that was done.  I hope we do not have duplication of that sort in future.</P>
    <P>Apart from the two reservations I have expressed I welcome the provisions in the Bill.  I intervene on the substance of the Bill as an urban Member in response to representations I have had from two categories of people in my constituency. I am referring to those who have suffered from the stray, untamed, undisciplined dogs who wander in ever-increasing numbers in the new housing estates and are causing terror to many young and old people.  I have received representations also from people who are concerned about dogs that may not be untamed and may have good homes but are a source of harassment to elderly people because of the failure of their owners to keep them in proper check.  Yesterday I received a letter from a lady in Howth whose elderly husband finds it almost impossible to go for a walk because of the constant harassment he receives from large undisciplined well-fed dogs that come from good homes and have pedigrees as long as one's arm.  Those dogs make the ordinary recreation of such elderly people very difficult.  I know the provisions of the Bill will not change that but it will create a consciousness among animal owners that they will be answerable under the new severe restrictions.  I hope that in positive sense the provisions will create a greater awareness among dog owners about the rights of other people who use public paths and parks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> The power which gives gardaí the right to impound directly is long overdue and I welcome it.  It is right that the new power will apply even where the owner of the animal is known.  The Bill will be welcomed by all animal lovers because no true lover of animals wants to see animals in danger.  This animal loving measure is designed as much to protect the interests of animals as it is to protect human beings.  I am glad the Bill proposes to increase the effectiveness of the impounding measures.  The present system does not work and is ineffective in many areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also that the fines proposed under the provisions of this Bill will be substantial because those to date, which I believe were rooted in the thirties, were laughable.  They created no sense of fear, nor did they act as a deterrent in the event of people being answerable for breaches of the law.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the use of pounds will not be confined simply to public ones, that there will be provision for private pounds.  As Deputy Coogan pointed out, if the provisions of this Bill are effective it may well mean that we could have spent a lot of money building public pounds which might not be needed ultimately. I am not sure that will happen, but the possibility of using private pounds could well obviate a great deal of public expense which might prove to be unnecessary ultimately.</P>
    <P>As an urban Deputy I particularly welcome the proposal of strict liability being imposed in all cases of injuries or damages caused to a person attacked by a dog. That should render our lives somewhat safer in the months of May and June as we face into the local elections when usually all of us have our share of scarred ankles and feet from attacks by dogs, each dog knowing that he or she was entitled to the first bite.  Now the provision of a dog being entitled to the first bite is gone.  That message may not get across to the dogs in time for the local elections; but, with that gone, we may all feel somewhat safer.</P>
    <P>All of us are aware of and share in the agony of those farmers mentioned by <Col N="1439" /> Deputy McEllistrim, to have seen their flocks of sheep savaged by dogs, sometimes by dogs let loose deliberately by groups of youths who come out to enjoy the sport of seeing savage dogs let loose on sheep, to the suffering and destruction of the sheep and the great loss of the farmers concerned.  The Bill includes provisions which should render that pastime less profitable and enjoyable to those involved than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that those people who knowingly let loose dogs with a tendency to indiscipline, to bite or attack people, those owners who take the chance of bringing out dogs with a track record of ferocity, with a track record of attacking people, will now be liable.  However, I am not sure that the relevant section will be all that workable.  For example, how can one prove that dogs have a track record of attacks on people?  Will there be some system of red, yellow or other coloured card, some gradations of offence for those dogs guilty of this?  It will be very difficult to prove that an owner could have known that his dog was liable to attack people, that in the past his dog had attacked people?  Even though I realise this will be a provision difficult to enforce, sometimes the very existence of such a provision acts as a deterrent, so that people will at least be more careful. Perhaps we cannot ask for much more.</P>
    <P>The problem of stray, savage or uncontrolled dogs, of those who make life difficult for all but their owners, is a growing problem in must urban areas.  I have mentioned already attacks on people, the dirt difficulties and dangers caused by straying dogs in many of our larger urban estates.  The Minister mentioned the alarming rate at which our canine population is growing.  It is true that it is growing at an alarming rate.  The evidence is there for all of us to see and the consequences of a lack of control over this increasing population are all too obvious.  In the present climate I would not risk suggesting that the Government might contemplate some sort of scheme to provide contraceptive facilities to dog owners who may feel it would be a good idea that <Col N="1440" /> we begin to endeavour to curb our canine population.  The time might not be right for such a proposal; but, in all seriousness, it is something we may have to think about in years to come.</P>
    <P>With those reservations I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome most sections of the Bill.  Like other speakers, I am most concerned at the number of accidents, some fatal, and injuries done to people on account of straying animals on our roads.  Deputies have dwelt at length on this because it is not a problem in urban areas only but extends throughout the country.  For example, even on small country roads we encounter the same kinds of problems when one regularly comes across accidents involving stray animals.  Any legislation that helps alleviate that problem is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern about this Bill is in regard to the sections relating to increased powers to be given to local authorities.  I am always concerned at any legislation we introduce here which in the long run will entail more expenditure on the part of local authorities.  We have seen this happen in the case of much legislation in recent years when the onus was thrown onto local authorities for its implementation.  In this case local authorities must provide more money for the establishment of animal homes or pounds.  In recent years Galway County Council, in conjunction with Galway Corporation, have been endeavouring to find funds to set up an animal home at a time when finance is not readily available. As Deputy Manning said, there are many people, animal lovers, who wish to have such animal homes established.  There is also a strong farmers' lobby in rural areas for the establishment of such homes.  This means there is tremendous pressure on all local authorities for the establishment of such homes.  When replying perhaps the Minister would let us know whether any additional funds can be made available to local authorities for this purpose. For example, I can tell the House that this year our local authority are allocating £8,000 for an animal home in County <Col N="1441" /> Galway and that we provided £10,000 in 1984.  That is a small percentage only of the amount of money that must be made available on foot of this legislation.  The IFA have also come out very strongly in favour of these types of ventures and have welcomed many sections of the Bill. Indeed they knew a lot more about the legislation than did many Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Manning, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Legislation. As far as I am aware, that legislation was drafted before we had finished our discussions on the report of the Law Reform Committee.  I agree with him when he said that that committee had been dealt with in a most discourteous manner and am glad to note that we shall be meeting the Leader of the House at the end of this month to discuss the role of our committee, which is an important committee but which has been treated on a number of occasions in a most discourteous way, particularly in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The need for this Bill becomes very obvious when one examines the minimal penalties that obtained heretofore, with penalties of 50p and 10p for allowing animals wander onto public roads.  Such penalties have correctly been increased to £150 for a first offence and £350 for a second or subsequent offence, there being an increase catered for in the regulations concerning pound breaking.  We welcome such changes.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a matter dealt with by other speakers also, that is, the question of dog licensing.  Some figures were given in the House of the amount of money that could be gained from having a comprehensive dog licensing system. Naturally we would welcome that but I hope that any dog licensing system would be operated by local authorities and, more importantly, that the funds from that system would be paid to local authorities. In the past, local authorities did not benefit from revenue from motor taxation or from settlements in court.</P>
    <P>The farmers and the IFA have repeatedly made strong representations to public representatives regarding attacks <Col N="1442" /> on sheep and this Bill will help in that regard as at present owners have no liability in regard to damage done by sheep and dogs.  It would also mean that the very serious losses sustained by farmers because of attacks on sheep will end if the provisions of the Bill work.</P>
    <P>There are stray dogs roaming through underdeveloped housing estates all over the country and this Bill will help to control them.  I hope this legislation will deal with the problems which I mentioned.  I also hope that more funds will be made available to local authorities by the Government especially when one considers that if dog wardens are appointed, pounds will have to be provided.  In every county now, a smaller number of people are paying rates.  In Galway the figure is 11 per cent of the total population.</P>
    <P>We must remember that local authorities are very short of funds.  There is much talk of reform but the only reform we see relates to constituency boundaries of local authorities.  There should be a proper funding and taxation system in regard to local authorities.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it tackles the serious problems relating to stray animals and I hope that the Minister will clarify some of the points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In parts of the country unfenced land is causing great problems in regard to stray animals, especially sheep.  In some places, animals continuously stray on the roads and I am very concerned about this.  I welcome the provision in relation to owners' liability concerning stray animals.  If a motorist is blinded by the lights of an oncoming car, it is very hard to see animals on the road and a considerable amount of damage can be done by a car if there is a collision. Owners should make every endeavour to keep their animals off the road and every dog should be licensed.  I hope the Minister will empower local authorities to collect dog licences because they will need funds to set up pounds for stray animals, which will prove expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a farmer's gate is left open by people going into his field and cattle stray on to the road, one wonders if a car collides <Col N="1443" /> with an animal who is liable.  If an animal is killed, it is very expensive for the farmer to replace it but, of course, it is even more expensive for the motorist.  I hope these matters will be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister.  This debate has been very helpful and constructive and the Minister is glad that there was a general welcome for the Bill from all sides of the House. The extent of that welcome underlines the concern felt by people in many parts of the country about the nuisance of wandering animals and their frustration and exasperation when they find that the present law is inadequate to cope with it. These feelings were voiced particularly by Deputies from areas where the problem is greatest.  I speak from practical experience because Limerick and Kildare have been plagued in this way for many years but I know that several other areas, including outlying areas in Dublin, have also been badly affected.</P>
      <P>To those people the enactment of this Bill promises to bring to an end what has been a nuisance and, in many cases, a nightmare. This is because the Bill will put into the hands of those who can effectively deal with the problem &mdash; the Garda and the local authorities &mdash; the necessary powers to round up and impound animals that are wandering on the roads or tresspassing in public parks or other public open spaces.  Moreover the people who are being given these powers are subject to the pressures of public opinion, to a greater or lesser extent, and I have no doubt that public opinion will be brought to bear to ensure that whatever action is required will be carried out promptly and firmly.  Not that I have any fear that the Garda or the local authorities will be unwilling to use the powers which the Oireachtas has given them.  I am sure we can rely upon them to use their powers and to do so effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised quite a number of <Col N="1444" /> points during the debate and I shall try to deal with them in the course of my reply.  Of course, the Committee Stage will provide an opportunity for these points to be discussed in detail.  But there was one matter on which many Deputies expressed concern &mdash; quite rightly &mdash; and that is the problem of stray dogs and dog control generally.  I should like to deal with that first.  They said the Bill should have included provision for the control of these dogs.  Now, as most Deputies know, this problem has been around for quite a number of years and successive administrations have been trying to do something about it.  One of the big difficulties, as I see it, is that there is no one Government Department charged with the primary responsibility for looking after it.  Be that as it may, steps towards remedying this situation were taken some time ago by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, with the establishment of an inter-departmental committee to look into all aspects of the problem.  That committee have since reported and their recommendations are now before the various Departments for study.  I expect that the whole matter will be brought before the Government for decision in the near future.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the other points that were raised, Deputy O'Dea inquired why no changes in the law relating to liability for damage caused by animals are proposed save for those set out in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  For the reasons set out in my opening speech, it was decided that it would be premature to introduce a general principle of strict liability, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission. It was the view of the Law Commission in England that the present rules of strict liability for damage by animals had much to recommend them and should be retained.  On the other hand, as has been pointed out in the Law Reform Commission's working paper, the statutory amendments of those rules, reflected in the English Animals Act, 1971, have been much criticised.</P>
    <P>After full consideration, it was decided that any defects in the existing common law rules relating to strict liability for <Col N="1445" /> damage caused by animals are not such as to warrant their amendment by way of statute, pending their possible absorption, in due course, by a general principle of strict liability as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  Accordingly, the Bill does not propose to amend the existing common law rules in this area, save in relation to strict liability for damage caused by dogs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland made a most thoughtful and constructive contribution to the debate and raised many detailed points which will require careful consideration. I will look into these points between now and Committee Stage when there will be a better opportunity to discuss them in detail.</P>
    <P>I will be dealing with many of Deputy Hyland's points in the course of my reply but I want to make a general point first and that is that when we are talking about liability for damage caused by animals or persons we are in the area of the law relating to civil liability.  It is peculiarly an area where the law sets out the principles to be followed, leaving its application to the courts in the particular circumstances of each case so that there can be the necessary flexibility to enable the court to do justice, having regard to the merits of each of the parties.</P>
    <P>It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Legislature to lay down precise instructions in this area that would make it possible to say with certainty what the outcome of every case would be.  That is because the situations in which accidents happen are so different and because so much depends on an assessment of the meaning of the duty to take reasonable care not to harm other people.  The people involved in an accident can put very different interpretations on that phrase, as we all know.  But, nevertheless, these general principles, expressed as imposing on everyone a duty to take care, can serve as a guide and lead to many cases being settled without the need for a court hearing.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the scope of subsection (1) of section 2.  The effect of this subsection is as follows: it will remove the immunity from actions in <Col N="1446" /> negligence at present enjoyed by occupiers of land in respect of damage caused by their animals straying on to the public road.  But for this immunity the legal duty of care would be on such persons as owners of the animals.  The provision in section 2 will place them on the same footing as any other citizen in regard to actions in negligence for damage which their animals cause.  It will be a matter for the court to decide, in each case, whether the owner of the animal exercised due care.  If, in any particular case, the court does find that the owner of the animal complied with his duty of care and was not negligent, it will not find him liable in damages to the injured party.</P>
    <P>The wording of subsection (1) is necessitated by the complex legal background and by the uncertain scope of the rule of law of common law which the provision abolishes.  The provision is in accordance with the draft recommended by the Law Reform Commission and follows the corresponding from adopted in England in the Animals Act, 1971 and in Northern Ireland in the Animals Order, 1976.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea inquired as to the scope of the existing rule of law proposed to be abolished by subsection (1) of section 2. This is a general rule of common law to the effect that an occupier of land adjoining the highway is under no liability if his domestic animals stray onto the highway and there injure a user of the highway, whether the straying was caused by his negligent failure to build or maintain fences or by some other factor. In England, this rule was confirmed by the House of Lords in the leading case of <i>Searle v. Wallbank</i>, to which the Deputy referred.  As stated in the Law Reform Commission's working paper, published in 1977, the general principle in this rule of common law has been accepted in Ireland in a number of cases.  As I have said, the limitations of the rule are uncertain; it is for this reason that subsection (1) of section 2 is widely drafted.  However, the intention in subsection (1) is quite clear: it proposes to abolish this rule of common law in its entirety.  The effect of the provision, accordingly, will be that the immunity to question will no <Col N="1447" /> longer be available.  Thus the ordinary rules of negligence will apply in the case of animals in the particular categories referred to by the Deputy, where they cause damage having strayed onto the public road, that is to say, animals owned by non-landowners and animals which stray from land which does not adjoin the public road.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the position of a farmer whose animal causes damage through the intervention of a third party &mdash; for example, where an animal escapes on to the public road when a trespasser has left a gate open, or where a gap has been left when a vehicle crashes into a fence.  The question of whether, and to what extent, the owner of the animal has failed to observe his duty to take care in relation to such an incident is a matter for the court ultimately to decide, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  In some cases the owner will not be liable at all and the third party will be fully liable, assuming that there has not been contributory negligence by the injured party. In other cases both the animal owner and the third party will be liable to the extent that each is regarded by the court as having contributed to the damage by his failure to take care.</P>
    <P>Farmers and landowners, therefore, will be in the same position in this respect as any other citizen in regard to the degree of their liability for damage due, in whole or in part, to the intervention of a third party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave inquired whether liability for damage caused will be on the animal owner or the owner of the land in cases where animals stray on to the public road from land which the animal owner has leased for grazing purposes.  In such cases, also, the incidence of liability can only be decided by the court having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>It appears, however, that in the type of case referred to by the Deputy the primary responsibility, at least, would be on the animal owner, as the person owing <Col N="1448" /> a duty of care in respect of the animal causing the damage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland inquired about the position, under the Bill, in relation to damage caused by animals straying on to the public road from land which is held in common by a number of individuals. The Bill makes no special provision regarding the respective degrees of liability in such cases.  This would raise complex legal issues which would be appropriate for decision by the court in each case coming before it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland raised also the question of liability in respect of animals such as deer, fox or badger which cause damage having come through a farmer's fence and on to the road.  So far as civil liability is concerned, such animals would be regarded as wild animals not reduced to captivity and, therefore, liability would not be incurred in respect of any damage they might cause.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to damage which may be caused by an animal which escapes from its drovers while being driven on the public road.  The position in those cases will not be affected by the provisions of the Bill.  It is not possible to say, in general terms, what the liability would be in such cases.  This would be a matter for the court to decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland adverted to subsection (2) of section 2, which refers to &ldquo;areas where fencing is not customary&rdquo;.  The question as to whether any area comes within this category, for the purposes of the subsection, will be a question of fact to be determined by the court in any case in which the question is raised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland inquired also whether a Schedule to the Bill might list such areas.  It would be a difficult task to draw up an exhaustive list of such areas without elaborate machinery for determining what areas came within the definition. This list would have to be reviewed from time to time.  The wording of subsection (2) has been very carefully considered to see if a more concrete definition could be arrived at but it was decided to adhere to the present wording, having regard to the fact that it has been used in the corresponding English and Northern Ireland <Col N="1449" /> legislation, which was adopted and recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>On a question raised by Deputy O'Dea in relation to persons coming within the scope of subsection (2) of section 2, I should say that such persons may be found liable in negligence after the provision comes into effect, but it will be a matter for the court to decide whether they are so liable, having regard to all the circumstances in each case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the question of obliging landowners to fence their land.  As the Deputy said, the Bill does not impose any duty to fence.  Any such provision would not be appropriate to the Bill.  The question was raised, in particular, of obliging landowners, including local authorities, to fence off their lands where they adjoin the public road.  In addition, a number of Deputies suggested that there should be road signs indicating to motorists that they are entering unfenced areas.  These matters would be for consideration in the context of road traffic legislation and the suggestions made in this regard will be conveyed to the Minister for the Environment, who is the appropriate Minister.</P>
    <P>I now come to section 3 of the Bill, which relates to liability for damage and injury caused by dogs.  I am glad to note that no objection has been raised in the debate to the basic principle in this section, which is that strict liability should be extended to damage caused in attacks on persons by dogs, but with exemption from strict liability in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies suggested that further provision should be made in the Bill in regard to the liability of occupiers of premises whose dogs cause damage to trespassers.  The Bill provides already that the general rule of strict liability will not apply in such cases, so that the occupier will be liable only in accordance with the ordinary rules of negligence. This is in accordance with a recommendation by the Law Reform Commission, made in the light of the Supreme Court's restatement of the law relating to liability towards trespassers in the 1975 case McNamara v. ESB.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> A number of Deputies suggested that occupiers of premises should be wholly exempted from liability for damage caused by their dogs to trespassers.  Reference was made to the situation of vulnerable sections of the community, such as old people, whose dogs injure persons entering their premises.  Any such statutory provision, exempting occupiers from liability for damage caused by their dogs to trespassers, would have to take into account the large variety of cases that can arise.  Thus it would be necessary to distinguish between criminal trespass and trespass which is innocent or inadvertent. Questions would arise as to whether the provision should be confined to particular types of premises, such as residential premises and, indeed, whether it should relate only to trespass during the hours of darkness.  The question would also arise as to the type of dog which would be in question and the purpose for which it was kept.  In individual instances it can happen that the injury caused by a dog is disproportionate to any damage which the trespasser might cause.  In view of these considerations, it appears that the degree of liability incurred by the occupier in such cases is best left for decision by the court, which will have regard to all the circumstances of each case.  This is a developing branch of the law and the necessary degree of flexibility is allowed to the courts by the new subsection (5), which the Bill proposes should be inserted in section 1 of the Dogs Act 1906.  Accordingly, the Minister would not consider himself justified in proposing a statutory exception from the general rule laid down by the Supreme Court as to the nature of the duty of care owned by occupiers in such cases.</P>
    <P>During the debate, references were made to damage caused by dogs attacking sheep.  Recently I was made aware of a case in Kildare in which a small farmer lost his entire flock, his entire profit, as a result of marauding dogs.</P>
    <P>Any further statutory provision relating to this aspect particularly would be appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Agriculture, who is at <Col N="1451" /> present examining the report of the inter-departmental committee on dog control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland raised the question of liability for damage caused by stray dogs which attack themselves temporarily to the premises of a person other than their owner.  The position in such cases is that, under the Dogs Act, 1906, the occupier of any premises where a dog is kept or permitted to remain is presumed to be the owner of the dog.  However, it is always open to the occupier of the premises to prove that he was not the owner of the dog at the time the damage was caused, in which case he should normally be exempt from liability for the damage.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised questions about the licensing of dogs and the fees payable for such licences.  Any such provision would require an amendment of the Finance Act which at present governs the licensing of dogs and would be appropriate for consideration in the context of the general review of dog control measures which is at present taking place.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of insurance against the new heads of liability being imposed under sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  Under section 2, persons having animals on their land will now be liable for damage which their animals cause, having strayed onto the public road.  Such persons would probably find it advisable to insure against this liability.  While inquiries made from insurance sources indicate that such insurance would be available, it is not possible, in the absence of claims experience, to estimate what the additional premium would be.  A corresponding provision has been in force in England and Wales since 1971 and inquiries made from insurance sources there do not disclose that any difficulty has been experienced in securing insurance against this additional liability.</P>
    <P>Dog owners also would probably find it advisable to insure against the strict liability for personal injuries by their dogs now imposed under section 3.  Inquiries from insurance sources indicate that the <Col N="1452" /> additional premium required in this connection would not be significant in amount.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner referred to the desirability of informing landowners and farmers of the insurance implications of the Bill.  This aspect will be brought to the attention of the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Glenn and Deputy O'Dea suggested that insurance against the new heads of liability being imposed by the Bill should be made compulsory.  It is not considered that such a provision would be warranted, particularly since the Bill merely provides for an extension of the liability which already exists in the law relating to animals.  The imposition of compulsory insurance in this area would involve provision for supervising and enforcing such a system.  I should add that the introduction of compulsory insurance has not been found necessary in respect of the corresponding liability introduced in England and Wales in 1971 and in Northern Ireland in 1976.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his opening remarks, one of the main purposes of the Bill is to amend the law on impounding of animals.  I have heard with great interest the comments made by Deputies on this aspect.  Wandering animals constitute a serious problem and, as has been indicated, it is proposed to meet this problem by giving the Garda and local authorities specific powers to impound such animals and to strengthen the impounding procedure itself.  Some Deputies expressed doubt as to whether such impounding can be carried out with existing manpower resources.  While the Minister is very conscious of the demands being made on Garda time, I would point out that the most serious manifestations of the wandering animal problem are concentrated in a relatively few areas. Gardaí and, where appropriate, local authority staff are best placed to implement effectively the proposed impounding powers.  It is not considered that it would be appropriate to contemplate the appointment of special wardens for this purpose, as has been suggested by some <Col N="1453" /> Deputies, at the very least before experience has been gained under the arrangements provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern as to the adequacy of impounding facilities and related financial arrangements. Inquiries have been made from local authorities in this connection.  These inquiries indicate that, generally speaking, there are sufficient impounding facilities at present.  However, this aspect will be pursued in any instance where it transpires that the facilities are inadequate after the coming into effect of the impounding provisions in this Bill.  The general intention is that these impounding provisions should be self-financing, as far as possible, through increased fines, higher pound fees and, where necessary, the sale of impounded animals.  I would also refer Deputies to the provision in section 5 of the Bill whereby, in order to meet any short-term demand for impounding facilities following the coming into force of the Bill, local authorities may arrange for animals to be impounded in private pounds.  This would save the necessity for providing permanent impounding facilities that might rarely be used once the legislation had full effect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh and Deputy Tunney raised the question of the cost of transporting animals to the pounds.  Under existing law this cannot be covered by pound fees and a provision has been included in section 4 (5) of the Bill enabling local authorities to recover the cost of transportation from the animal owner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast and Deputy Cosgrave referred to the necessity for giving speedy effect to the regulations provided for in the Bill, so that there will be no delay in enforcement.  On this aspect, I can inform the Deputies that the necessary regulations are at an advanced stage of drafting and it is intended that they will be completed and put into effect without delay on the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have queried the provisions in the Bill regarding <Col N="1454" /> impounding by local authorities of animals trespassing on their lands, and the related provision allowing impounding of such animals by the Garda at the request of the local authority concerned.  Deputy Hyland and Deputy O'Dea suggested that it was inappropriate that local authorities should have an impounding function in such cases.  Deputy Treacy and Deputy Walsh queried the provision whereby the Garda Síochána could impound animals on such land only at the request of the local authority concerned. I would point out that the Garda must be regarded as being, in a sense, the agents of the authorities concerned in such cases, and it would not be appropriate that they should enter on such lands for the purpose of impounding animals without reference to the authorities by whom the land is owned or occupied.  In this connection I would refer Deputies to the provisions of section 4 (4).  The intention is that the exercise of impounding powers by the Garda and local authorities will be covered by amended regulations to make them more direct and effective.  This would govern such aspects as the notification of impounding, the periods for which animals must be held and the disposal of impounded animals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland queried the grant of power to the Garda and local authorities to impound even where the owner of the animal is known.  I would point out that this power will be discretionary.  There will be cases where it will be reasonable to facilitate the return of the animal direct to its owner.  In other cases, however, particularly where the owner repeatedly and deliberately allows his animals on to the public road or on to public open spaces, it will be necessary for the authority concerned to have an impounding power, even though the owner of the animal is known.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland and Deputy Byrne referred to the problems which arise from the ownership of horses by persons who have no accommodation or other facilities for their maintenance.  It is acknowledged that a problem exists in this respect, and the Minister is considering <Col N="1455" /> what other measures might be taken, in addition to those proposed in the Bill, to deal with it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to problems caused by itinerants' horses. Deputy Treacy and Deputy Doyle referred to the question of providing fenced grazing areas for these horses, but any special provision of this nature would be outside the scope of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates and Deputy Woods referred to the desirability of providing for private detention of trespassing animals. I would point out in this connection that, at least so far as urban areas are concerned, trespassing by large animals is a comparatively recent phenomenon, deriving from the acquisition of such animals by persons who have not got adequate facilities for them.  These animals are allowed to wander on public roads and public open spaces from which they occasionally enter private gardens. This problem would arise in rural areas to a much more limited extent.  So far as animals wandering on public roads and in public open spaces are concerned, I am confident that the problem will be met by the measures now proposed in the Bill.  This should have the effect of very considerably reducing the number of intrusions by large animals on to private property.  In rural areas, where cases have arisen over the years of livestock straying from one person's land to another's, the position is adequately met by the existing statutory provisions, which were probably designed to avoid breaches of the peace that could occur where the occupier of the land trespassed on was allowed to detain the animal.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question raised by Deputy Treacy, I should say that separate statistics are not kept in relation to the total extent of losses incurred through damage caused by animals.  I would add, in relation to a suggestion made by Deputy Treacy and Deputy Glenn, that there is no proposal to provide compensation for damage caused by animals whose owners are not known.</P>
    <P>I come now to the arrangements regarding private pounds, provided for in <Col N="1456" /> section 5 of the Bill.  The Minister said in his opening remarks that the Bill envisages that private pounds will be utilised only in areas where the need arises, as determined by the local authority.  The Minister is satisfied that this is a suitable provision which will be used effectively by local authorities in appropriate cases. In reply to a point raised by Deputy Yates, I can assure him that arrangements with local authorities for the provision of private pounds will be on a purely voluntary basis and that there will be no question of compulsory acquisition of land or premises for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and Deputy Glenn were concerned about problems experienced in some districts in the Dublin area in relation to the provision of pounds. Inquiries are being made about the position in the particular areas to which they refer.  On a more general note, I trust that the provisions in section 5 of the Bill will facilitate and put on a proper basis arrangements for the use of private pounds in areas where the provision of a public pound is found to be unduly difficult or expensive.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) provides for the making of regulations in relation to private pounds. Deputy Glenn inquired whether this provision will also apply to public pounds. On this point, I should say that the regulations for public pounds are separate, being made under section 8 of the Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, though some provisions relating to public pounds will correspond to those in the private pounds regulations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland and Deputy Yates referred to the importance of compliance with animals diseases regulations in relation to the provision of private pounds.  I can assure the Deputies that such regulations will be fully complied with.  The animals diseases regulations are being reviewed at present by the Department of Agriculture and their relation to the impounding process will be borne in mind in this connection.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea asked for clarification of the purpose of section 6.  As I said in my opening remarks, this provision is designed to deal with the problem caused <Col N="1457" /> by animals wandering from undeveloped housing estates.  These cause a serious nuisance which the Garda and local authorities would not be able to deal with in the absence of a special provision, as the animals causing the nuisance would be on private property.  The problem arises from the slow development of many private housing estates which take perhaps four or five years to be substantially completed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) gives a general definition of the kind of land to which section 6 will apply but the intention is that the provisions of the section will apply to particular sites only where a nuisance of the kind in question arises.  The local authority will be in the best position to determine whether such a nuisance exists and if it does, they may designate the site as a &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;, thus bringing the provision of section 6 into operation in relation to that site.  Once this is done, it will be open to the occupier of the site to authorise the Garda and the local authority to remove the wandering animals, which might then be impounded.  If the occupier does not so authorise the local authority and the Garda, he will be liable for damage caused by the animals straying from the land as if he were the owner of the animals.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question raised by the Deputy, I should say that subsection (2) of section 6 will cover land of the kind referred to in the subsection at any stage after planning permission has been obtained, even though development has not commenced.  As I have indicated, the provisions of section 6 will apply in any particular case only on the making of a designation order in respect of the particular site in question.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that a designation order may be made in respect of any portion of land coming within the category defined in subsection (2).  Thus it could be made, for example, in respect of the particular part of a development site on which houses have not yet been built.  The term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; would be applied to the person occupying the site for the purpose of development and <Col N="1458" /> would not be applied to the occupiers of individual houses on the site.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission regarding strict liability for damage caused by animals.  The Minister pointed out in his opening speech that this would mean for landowners and farmers a change from virtual immunity to full responsibility for every animal.  I do not think that should happen in one step. There is no strict liability for damage caused by motor vehicles in the Acts in question and I do not think it would be helpful to impose full liability in respect of the Bill before us.  However, I think we should progress towards that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt asked if money could be provided for animal shelters.  This is something that has arisen in my constituency in Kildare.  However, it is not a matter that could be dealt with in the context of this Bill although it may arise in relation to the general question of the control of stray dogs.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points raised by Deputies.  However, if unwittingly I have omitted some there will be an opportunity of raising them and having them discussed fully on Committee Stage.  I wish again to apologise for the absence of the Minister which I wish to assure the House was not intentional.  It was absolutely impossible for him to be here.  I thank the Deputies for the constructive way they have contributed to this debate and I assure them that their comments and suggestions will be given careful consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> That Dáil Éireann approves of the following regulations in draft:</P>
    <P>Local Elections (Postal Voting) (Amendment) Regulations, 1985</P>
    <P>a copy of which regulations in draft form was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 25th day of February, 1985.</P>
    <P>These draft regulations are laid before the House in accordance with section 82 (5) of the Electoral Act, 1963, which provides that, where regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    <P>Postal voting has been discussed by this House on a number of occasions in the past few years and Members will be familiar with the subject.  It is not, therefore, necessary for me to detain the House unduly with a detailed outline of the background; I will be brief and deal only with essential points in this introductory statement.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to the House previously, I am having a Bill prepared which will provide for postal voting at all elections and referenda.  The Bill, which takes account of the views expressed by Deputies and Senators in the various debates in both Houses and in the Joint Committee on Legislation, will entitle certain categories of persons to be registered in the register of electors as postal voters. Persons so registered will vote by post at any election which takes place during the currency of the register.</P>
    <P>The registration of postal voters will be carried out as a normal part of the procedure of compiling the register of electors.  This takes place between September and December each year and I will be bringing forward the legislation as soon as possible so as to ensure that the new system will be in place in time for the 1986 register.  In the meantime, the draft regulations now before the House will bring the postal voting system to be used at the local elections in June into line <Col N="1460" /> as far as practicable with the permanent arrangements proposed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Postal voting for categories other than the Garda and the Defence Forces was introduced for the 1974 local elections by the Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations, 1974.  Under those regulations, anybody who could not vote in person by reason of the circumstances of his occupation, service, or employment, absence from the place in respect of which he was registered as an elector, illness or physical disability, or his employment by a returning officer, could apply to vote by post.</P>
    <P>The 1974 elections have been our only experiment with the extended postal voting system: it was not used for the local elections in 1979 because they were held with the European Assembly elections. It was considered that it would not be practicable to run two elections together with different postal voting systems.</P>
    <P>From an administrative point of view the system worked satisfactorily in 1974 but many public representatives had reservations about the security of the system.  Nevertheless, it is essential that those who, for genuine reasons, cannot vote in person should be catered for. What we are trying to do in these regulations therefore, and in the Bill, is to provide a system of postal voting which will minimise the risk of abuses, while continuing to provide a simple and accessible facility.  I will now outline briefly the principal changes which the regulations will effect.</P>
    <P>The regulations will effect changes in key areas &mdash; they will restrict somewhat the categories of persons who will qualify to vote by post; they will build safeguards into the application procedure, and they will improve the security of ballot papers being issued to voters.</P>
    <P>Under the draft regulations the persons who will be entitled to vote by post at the local elections will be those who will be unable, or are likely to be unable, to vote in person by reason of (a) the circumstances of their occupation, service or employment, or (b) physical illness or physical disability.  This is a narrower <Col N="1461" /> range of eligibility than applied in 1974 but I believe that those with a genuine claim to a postal vote will be catered for under the regulations.  The electors being catered for are those recommended by the Joint Committee, except for diplomats and certain other categories resident abroad who cannot be registered as electors under existing law.  These will be dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The application procedure is also being tightened up.  The time for making applications will be earlier &mdash; from 15 to 30 April.  This takes the processing of applications out of the peak period of preelection activity and gives the returning officer the opportunity and time to thoroughly evaluate and investigate applications.  In addition, applications will now have to be independently supported by a certificate from an employer or medical practitioner or by a statutory declaration where a person is self-employed. This will obviously impose a certain burden but we are satisfied that it is essential for the security of the electoral system.  Finally, the returning officer will be empowered to seek additional information for the purpose of satisfying himself that an applicant is a qualified person and to reject an application where such information is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The other area which has been identified as being open to abuse is the actual issue of ballot papers to voters by post. This, too, is being dealt with.  Under the regulations, all ballot papers will be sent to voters by registered post.  This means that a signature must be received by the postal authorities for every ballot paper entrusted to them for delivery, a procedure which should help considerably to ensure that the ballot papers get into the correct hands.  It should also help to trace the culprits if ballot papers are interfered with.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say about the regulations themselves.  I believe that the controls we are proposing are the absolute minimum which we could accept if the security of the electoral system is to be protected.  The facility of postal voting is a privilege; the position is that the Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to <Col N="1462" /> extend this privilege to certain categories. The concession carries a risk of serious damage to the electoral system and there is the obligation to protect against that by all reasonable means.  I think the regulations strike a reasonable balance between availability and control.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil welcome this proposal.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Minister and his Minister of State for coming forward with this legislation, albeit a bit late.</P>
      <P>Earlier we encouraged them to come forward with legislation to apply to all elections &mdash; general elections, European Parliament elections, local elections and referenda.  Unfortunately, the Minister has delayed bringing forward regulations which could have been introduced in time for the European elections, but at least he has come forward with these draft regulations for the local elections which, we understand, will be held in June.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement that the Minister is having a Bill prepared which will provide for postal voting at all elections and referenda.  We look forward to extending the availability of the postal vote to those categories who, because of their circumstances either through illness or employment, have been denied the opportunity to participate in the electoral process.  That is their right under the Constitution and they should not be denied that right when procedures can be devised to enable them to vote.  We welcome the Government's commitment to bring forward a Bill at a later stage to extend this facility to general elections, other elections, referenda and so on.  As the Minister said, we have had at least two major debates in this House on postal voting and I do not intend to go over the ground we have already covered.  We welcome these regulations which provide the facility of a postal vote for those who wish to participate in the local elections next June, but we urge the Minister to bring forward as quickly as possible the Bill extending the scope of these regulations to other elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> In our view the procedures being adopted are reasonable safeguards against the possibility of abuse.  I compliment the Minister on the method he is adopting and will fully co-operate in ensuring that the section of the community who have not had the opportunity to participate in elections in recent years will be made aware of this facility and will be encouraged to avail of it.  The returning officer will determine whether a person is entitled to a postal vote.  He is the final arbiter under these regulations, but they do not set out the criteria he is to apply when deciding if a person will be granted the postal vote.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that.  It will probably be left to the returning officers' commonsense. If a person applying for a postal vote is ill and a doctor signs a medical certificate, in most cases there will be no cause for the returning officer to question such a certificate but a self-employed person applying for a postal vote on the basis that he may not be in a position to attend at the polling station has to obtain the signature of a peace commissioner or a commissioner of oaths.  I wonder why the signature of a commissioner of oaths is required when the signature of a peace commissioner is acceptable since there is a vast difference in the legislation establishing both offices.  Would I be right in thinking that the commissioner of oaths may seek payment for his signature in certain circumstances whereas the peace commissioner is not entitled to charge for signing a document confirming that the person is the person mentioned in the document and that the circumstances were such as to justify him seeking a postal vote?  What criteria will apply when examining these documents, especially in the case of a self-employed person?  If a person says he expects to be busy on 7 June or 20 June, the date of the local elections, is that sufficient for the returning officer to grant him a postal vote?</P>
    <P>I expect the wish of the House would be that the person would have to show that he will not be in a position to attend at the polling station because he has to <Col N="1464" /> travel a very long distance from his normal place of residence, and therefore he has a right to seek the postal vote. This is a very subjective matter.  I ask the Minister to refer to this because he glanced over it in his introductory remarks and there are no conditions laid down in the regulations as printed.</P>
    <P>The requirement that an application for a vote be forwarded by registered post and that the person must sign for the receipt of the envelope containing the ballot papers is a good safeguard.  We hope that this question of postal voting will be regularised in the new Bill so that we will not have this type of <i>ad hoc</i> regulation from one local election to another.  It would be preferable if a list of postal voters is drawn up at an early date on an annual basis when the local authorities are compiling the register. People should be required to make an application for a postal vote at that stage so that the list can be checked by members of the public and those participating in the election process so that an assurance can be given that the people compiling the list are genuinely complying with the regulations.  These regulations introduced for the coming local elections are a vast improvement on the procedures for the 1974 election.  The type of abuses that were alleged to have occurred on that occasion are catered for in these new regulations which will minimise the possibilities of abuse.</P>
    <P>We will all observe this postal voting system carefully to see if it operates as satisfactorily as it would appear to.  I compliment the Minister on these regulations and hope that the public who had not, up to now, the opportunity to vote will avail of these facilities.  It would be tragic if the people for whom these regulations were introduced were not aware of their existence. Because of the short time left there is an obligation on the Government to bring the existence of these regulations to the notice of the public by way of public advertisement.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the regulations providing for the extension of <Col N="1465" /> voting to disabled people particularly. For a long time there has been a demand for the extension of voting rights to people who were not able to go to a polling station.  Some of the polling stations particularly those in rural Ireland cannot cater for people in wheelchairs who now will not be required to present themselves at a polling station to vote.  In 1974 this facility was extended to a wider range of people than the range being catered for in this Bill and there were a number of abuses.  I would not like to see those abuses recurring.  The Minister has said that he has taken account of the objections and the allegations made in relation to the 1974 postal voting.  We should have a definition in the Bill as to what constitutes physical disability. Would a person described by a doctor as being incapable of voting be considered as being disabled under the terms of this Bill?  Some people will apply for a postal vote for another person who is incapable of voting.  What will the situation be there?  Circumstances of employment have been catered for and I take it that the Minister means that the people who will qualify for a postal vote will be normally resident outside the State or might find themselves outside of the State on business for a period before and after the election, if that can be established.  The local elections will be held in June which is a time when many people go on holidays. Holidays are planned up to six months in advance and I would like to know if people on holidays will be covered by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with who will qualify for a postal vote it is important to ensure that the person who applies for the vote is the person who gets the vote and is the person responsible for signing the ballot paper. That will be the difficulty.  Any postal voting system is open to a range of abuses.  I urge the Minister to take every precaution to prevent abuses and to impose a sufficient penalty to deter people from abusing the law.  The penalties should be spelled out clearly well in advance of the date of application for postal votes.  One of the major defects in the postal voting system that applied to <Col N="1466" /> the 1974 election was that people could apply for voting papers a fortnight or three weeks in advance of the election. That is a time when the returning officer is extremely busy getting everything ready for the election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the serious implications for our fishing and fish processing industry from the proposed enlargement of the Community by the admission of Spain and Portugal to the EC, and calls on the Government to ensure that whatever arrangements are necessary to protect our national interests are included in the accession agreement.</P>
      <P>The EC enlargement negotiations with Spain and Portugal have been going on for some time.  Progress has been slow but the negotiations are now entering their final phase.  Inevitably, the issues being discussed now are the most difficult and complicated and it is true to say there is widespread anxiety and uncertainty among fishermen here in regard to future prospects for their industry.  I will put on record views expressed by the representatives of the three major fishing organisations, the Irish Fish Producers Organisations, the IFO and the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation.  A circular issued to all TDs stated:</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the I.F.O., the I.F.P.O. and the K.F.O. in relation to their opposition to current accession negotiations is to prevent Irish fishing interests being subordinated to the interest of other sectors within the Community.</P>
      <P>The circular states that the Spanish fleet:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>is so large that concentrated fishing in Community waters would decimate <Col N="1467" /> the Irish Industry.  Even limited access to Community waters by Spanish vessels spells danger for Ireland, given their blatant disregard for any rules or regulations.</P>
    <P>Spanish fishing activities in our waters have been the subject of an agreement between Spain and the EC, signed in April 1980 and ratified in May the following year.  That framework agreement arose from The Hague Agreement of 1976 and set down the outlines for and EC agreement on fisheries, and this has been going on since 1976.  Ireland would accept an agreement subject to the condition that Ireland would fish the 50 miles around the Irish coast.  The Spanish rights would terminate at the 12 mile zone and Spanish catches would be reduced progressively to a modest level.</P>
    <P>This framework agreement was ratified in May 1981 and its terms have been complied with since.  There has been a systematic effort made by the Community to reduce fishing activities by Spain in Community waters and this has reduced the Spanish activities in coastal areas by 50 per cent since the agreement.  There is no doubt that Spanish access to Community waters and fish resources is the most difficult problem that will have to be dealt with in the current negotiations. Spain is pressing for equality and has suggested that its fishing rights should be based not on the framework agreement but on the situation in operation in 1981 before the framework agreement became operative.</P>
    <P>We all know the size and proportions of the Spanish fleet and that it will pose a major threat to our industry.  I will give a brief indication of the capacity of the Spanish fishing fleet.  The fleet numbers 17,500 vessels capable of 750,000 gross registered tonnes.  We have approximately 1,600 vessels with a capacity of 36,000 tonnes.  In the Community the Spanish fleet would represent 70 per cent of the entire fishing fleet.  Total fish landings by Spain in 1983 was 1.1 million tonnes as against Irish landings of 200,000 tonnes.  Spain imported 270,000 tonnes <Col N="1468" /> and exported something like 200,000 tonnes, about our total catch.</P>
    <P>The position is that Spain, with a fleet of that size and capacity, is now fighting very hard in the Community to gain access to Community waters.  If access is granted to Spain it will mean annihilation of the Irish industry and devastation, with widespread unemployment, with prospects of employment in the future seriously undermined.</P>
    <P>We expected the Government to adopt a strict line in regard to the negotiations with Spain and there were indications earlier that the Government would insist on at least a 20-year transition period and that within that period Spanish activities in our coastal areas would not be increased so that their operations would be minimised and curtailed as far as possible in Irish waters.  Our industry is a young one which has already made significant gains but we need to expand and protect our industry.</P>
    <P>There has been recent indication of a weakening of the Government resolve in regard to Spain.  We understand that a ten year transition period has been agreed and it later transpired that that period would be added to by a possible five years, this to be insisted on before negotiations could get under way.  However, there has been a Council proposal that the 20-year transition period which we understand the Government to be maintaining had been replaced and there has been a suggestion of a seven year transition period.  There is genuine fear that the transition period will not be even ten years but seven years.</P>
    <P>It may be that in further negotiations Spain will seek to get concessions in a graded way which will bring them fully into our areas within a short time.  That would be disastrous for us and it must be resisted by those negotiating on our behalf.  We are not satisfied that that is being done to the best advantage as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that because there is such a huge demand for fish in Spain &mdash; Spanish consumption of fish is in the region of 1.2 million tonnes per year; the <i>per capita</i> fish consumption in <Col N="1469" /> Europe is 40 pounds annually as against 12 pounds here &mdash; that we would have an opportunity in the marketing area to exploit.  We should look at our marketing arrangements in regard to Spain because there is a cause for some concern in that area.  It is known and well understood by those involved in the negotiations that Spain has many third country agreements because of their need for fishing opportunities. They have about 20 international agreements along the west coast of Africa, with Canada and the United States.  In 1983 Spain had 106 joint ventures involving some 200 Spanish vessels and it was estimated that these were responsible for duty free imports of 180,000 tonnes of fish.</P>
    <P>It may be that because of Spain's arrangements with third countries the prospects in the marketing area for our industry may not be as they appear.  That is why we are concerned and want an assurance that in the accession negotiations the agreements and joint ventures which carry with them concessions do not adversely affect our prospects of getting into that market.  The Spaniards also have a marketing problem with fish because of their imports but their biggest problem seems to be in the area of structures.  It is well know that their huge fleet is not in a healthy state.  Huge injections of capital will be needed to modernise their ageing fleet, get rid of obsolete vessels and overcapacity in the industry.  That will weigh heavily on Community resources to the detriment of our economic development under the Common Fisheries Policy.  We recognise that our fleet has been expanding and developing with the aid of Community resources which we expect will be available under the Common Fisheries Policy.  If we are to be limited in an enlarged Community it will be detrimental to the modernisation and restructuring of our fleet.  Any curtailment of funds to our industry from Community sources will be a disadvantage which must be dealt with in any enlargement negotiations.</P>
    <P>There is a major concern about the whole area of access to Irish waters.  We have had a 50 mile box within which <Col N="1470" /> activity was permitted on licence and under strict control and management.  In the negotiations involving Spain the Government must insist on getting back to the original demand for a 20 year transitional period.  Any attempt to water that down must be opposed by our negotiating team.  We must have a longer period than that mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Irish case can be based on Article 4.1 of the Regulations 170/83 which states that the volume of catches available shall be distributed between the member states in a manner which assures each member state relative stability of fishing activities to each of the stocks considered.  The Government must insist on preserving what we have, particularly in the west and south-west where widespread illegal fishing by Spanish vessels takes place. Our fishery protection service almost daily charge Spanish boats with blatant breaches of our fishery regulations.  We must adopt a hard line on that.  We are dealing with this from a position of strength.  We know where our fleet has progressed and developed in recent years and we see the need for further development. The preservation of the 50 mile box is vital.  Preservation of the stocks not being exploited at present is also vital so that our industry can expand in the non-traditional areas.  Many people in the industry say that in order to have substantial gains in the fishing area in the coming years there will be a need to move away from the traditional species and get involved in research into new methods of fishing and catching species which have not been exploited by us up to now.</P>
    <P>It is evident that the Spanish authorities are seeking access to the species I have mentioned such as horse mackerel, blue whiting and so on which have not been developed to any great extent here. That represents an area for development, job creation and an opportunity for an increase in the incomes of fishermen that will be lost in the negotiations unless the Government provide the incentive to our fleet to get involved in them.</P>
    <P>The development of our fishing industry under the Common Fisheries <Col N="1471" /> Policy is crucial to our economy.  We must respond vigorously to the challenge of the new economic order now confronting us.  We have a valuable natural resource and we must develop and exploit it to the fullest.  Downstream industries must be developed and extended.  The entire fishing industry must be injected with more capital.  Participants in the industry must be trained to the highest possible standards if they are to avail of the opportunities that will be available in a new fisheries development programme that will evolve as the Common Fisheries Policy comes into operation.</P>
    <P>We are at a stage where the policy is beginning to show results.  We have seen the development which has taken place in our fleet.  It is recognised that there is a huge potential which has been relatively unexploited.  Some of the figures for improvements which have taken place in the fishing industry in the past number of years will give us an indication of how far we have come in such a short time and where we can go if the industry only gets an opportunity to avail of the Common Fisheries Policy, which will be the cornerstone of development in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Fish landings have increased from 86,000 tonnes in 1972 to 206,000 tonnes in 1982.  Fish exports have grown by 294 per cent between 1978 and 1982.  Employment in our fishing industry has grown by over 30 per cent since the mid-seventies, with in excess of 13,000 people being employed in it at present.  In the short few years we have seen the expansion of the industry and the development which has taken place in providing jobs in a whole variety of areas, especially in the isolated areas among the coastal communities. It is essential not to put any brakes on that impetus in future.  It is vital in the present negotiations that the Government adopt a firm stand.  If they do not get the support of the member states they must continue to fight their case, because it is essential in the interests of the industry and of those involved at <Col N="1472" /> present; but much more vital to its expansion and development and future possibilities is that the Irish Government take a firm stand and do not allow themselves to be stampeded into reaching agreement in negotiations, not for social or economic reasons but for other reasons.  There would appear to be at present a motivation which has nothing to do with enlargement of the Community or with economic or social policies, but with other issues unrelated to them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to adopt a firmer line than he has adopted up to now.  I am aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is conducting these negotiations. At this time there is need for the Minister for Fisheries to become directly involved in negotiations as far as possible.  We insist that the Irish case be fought to the very limit in the Community to ensure that our industry is protected and also the present jobs, and plans and prospects with regard to job creation.  This will be to the benefit of the fishing industry and the economic benefit of the State in the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>The reason for tabling this motion tonight is that we are not satisfied with the information given or the progress which has taken place to date.  We are not satisfied that this issue has been fully teased out and full information given to everybody involved.  We are dissatisfied with the way in which the negotiations are being handled and call on the Government to state clearly their position and how they see the enlargement negotiations progressing between now and 1 January 1986, which is the date on which the new enlarged Community will be ratified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion before the House:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the serious implications for our fishing and fish processing industry from the proposed enlargement of the Community <Col N="1473" /> by the admission of Spain and Portugal to the EEC, and calls on the Government to ensure that whatever arrangements are necessary to protect our national interests are included in the accession agreement.</P>
    <P>This motion has been eloquently and decisively proposed by my colleague, our spokesman for Fisheries, Deputy Daly.</P>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that every fisherman is sceptical of the activities of the Government in relation to the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC. They believe that if concessions are given it is the rights of the fisherman and the fishing industry here that will go first.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing waters of their very nature, having the benefit of the warm North Atlantic Drift, are the richest fishery grounds in Europe.  Every nation is anxious to fish in these waters and share in the spoils.  The Spaniards, in particular, and the Portuguese are anxious to become part of the elite and to reap the vast resources of those fishing grounds. The Spaniards have already tasted our fishing grounds by using loopholes in the system.  Given an inch, they have taken a mile &mdash; or in nautical terms, a fathom. They have completely exceeded their quotas and completely ignored limits imposed upon them.  They have already damaged our fishing grounds.  They have clearly shown how inadequate our fishery protection vessels are.  These vessels are exceptionally well manned but are lost when they have to move away from shore.</P>
    <P>I question the Government's policy in relation to protection.  Are they more concerned with attacking our own fisherman than with attacking foreign boats in order to give an impression that something is being done by our fishery protection vessels?  The Spaniards and Portuguese are relishing the thought of free access to our rich waters.  Recently when a Spanish ship faced a fine of £30,000 it came back again.  If one trawler in breaking the law lost £30,000 and made a profit, that puts the richness of our waters into perspective.  The Spaniards <Col N="1474" /> are notorious for flouting the laws, exercising no control over limits, particularly in the field of conservation.  The Spanish fleet is 17,500 strong compared with our 1,000 trawlers.  As I understand it, they have unlimited markets at home for all their catches.  If they get into our seas they will literally clean them out.  They have already been banished from fishing grounds elsewhere.  Anything less than a total ban in the Spanish and Portuguese fleets will sound the deathknell of an already ailing fishing industry, an industry hit so hard in recent times that the arrears to Bord Iascaigh Mhara grew from £6 million to £7 million in the period from May 1984 to November 1984 &mdash; six months.  The recent package put before us by the Minister, which proposes to accommodate in some way BIM boat owners, gives no support whatsoever, apparently, to those who did their own thing, got bank loans and so forth. Pardon the pun, but the Minister is making fish of one and flesh of the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested to hear, as would every fisherman, exactly what the position is.  If the Minister is supporting all fishermen, I am sure they will be delighted.  However, that is not what they believe at present.  We shall give the Minister full opportunity to hand out this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything less than a full commitment to Irish fishing, fishermen and their families and the full protection of our waters will be seen as a sell-out by the Government. We welcome the fact that Spain and Portugal have applied for membership of the EC.  They will fight their battle to get as good a bargain as is possible for themselves.  We must with equal resolve ensure that Ireland and our fishing industry will not be the scapegoat. Now is the time to put in the boot, to say &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go and no further&rdquo;. From the latest thinking in Commission circles, it appears that a proposal has <Col N="1475" /> been put forward for a seven year transition period after which there will be a free-for-all.  I am disgusted that the Government would even allow that be put before the Commission.  In the famous phrase, that is out.</P>
    <P>Another proposal is that 200 Spanish fishing trawlers of 700 horse power will be allowed initially to fish inside the 200 mile limit to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo;, the main feature of which is the 12 degree line of longitude off the west coast, but as close as 50 miles to our coast.  That also is out. We are in the EC and surely that should be to our advantage.  Spain and Portugal are anxious to get in.  Let them take what they are offered by us and let us not offer them an industry which, if developed, could boost our economy enormously which is being strangled and starved.</P>
    <P>Our fishing industry is one of our greatest natural resources and deserves such recognition which has not been forthcoming in the past two and a half years.  We need support to develop our fleet, to train our fishermen, to develop our harbours, and, above all, to develop markets at home and abroad.  The importation of enormous quantities of fish into the EC should be taken into account immediately. The prospect of fish sales at acceptable prices to Poland, and other countries of a similar nature, should be investigated.</P>
    <P>The development of harbours is a must to help boost this flagging industry.  I should like to make particular reference to the Kilmore Quay harbour.  It is well known that Kilmore Quay needs to be dredged immediately and it certainly needs extension.  It should be given major harbour status.  What is the position in relation to Kilmore Quay?  If we are to compete we must have a strong fleet with a fully developed harbour.  Everybody agrees that the Kilmore fleet is most industrious and most productive.  That dredging should be carried out immediately. When will that happen?  Some time last year we were told it was imminent.  Now it seems that it has been put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>The debate on this whole issue should <Col N="1476" /> be extended to cover the submarine activity in the Irish Sea.  I do not say this lightly.  Recently a Scottish fishing vessel with five people aboard disappeared.  No body has been found and no wreckage has been found.  This was another incident in the Irish Sea.  I have had letters from people in the Isle of Man and in Scotland about this incident.  What are the Minister's intentions in relation to this new menace out there, a menace which has increased significantly over the past few years?  There has been a loss of life and a loss of boats, and there is a great fear on the part of the fishermen for their lives and their livelihoods.  What precisely does the Minister intend to do?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to meet the IFO immediately. They are very concerned about the accession of Spain and Portugal.  They should meet them in the next few weeks before any decisions are taken.  I agree with my colleague that the information being made available to us is very scant on a subject which is of vital importance to this economy.  We do not know what is going on out there.  I do not think the fishermen trust the Minister to bring home a good deal.  If the Minister put his cards on the table we could advise and support him to ensure that, when Spain and Portugal join the EC, a good deal will have been made.  If the Minister puts his cards on the table we guarantee him our full support in the interests of the Irish fishing industry.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I welcome the opportunity to outline to Dáil Éireann the general approach pursued by the Government on the fisheries chapter of the enlargement negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Daly, in his statement, has touched on the anxieties felt by Irish fishermen about the future development of the Irish fishing industry in an enlarged Community.  The Government are conscious of the apprehensions and anxieties of our fishermen.  It is with a firm commitment, therefore, to ensuring that the arrangements which are ultimately to be <Col N="1477" /> agreed comply with the developmental needs of the Irish fishing industry that the Government have determined their general approach to the negotiations with Spain.  Portugal given the size and structure of its fleet, and its traditional fishing patterns, has less interest in gaining significant access to the waters and resources of the present Community.</P>
    <P>Before going into detail on our approach to the negotiations it might be helpful to say a few words about the Common Fisheries Policy into which Spain has to be integrated, and give the Dáil some background on recent developments in the negotiations on the fisheries chapter.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand why the fisheries chapter should be the most sensitive outstanding one in the enlargement negotiations, and the least easy one in which to arrive at solutions.  It is of fundamental concern to Ireland, and to countries like the UK, Denmark, France and Germany, which have significant fishing interests in the North Atlantic, that the integration of Spain fishing into the Community's Common Fisheries Policy should not lead to upheaval in a policy brought into existence a mere two years ago, after seven years of very difficult negotiations among the Ten, and designed to last until the year 2002, with provision for some review in 1993.  The difficulties in bringing the policy into existence are successfully described in a 1983 publication by the European Commission:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After seven years of tough negotiations, the common fisheries policy has taken its place as a fully-fledged Community policy.  It was not an easy achievement.  A great deal of effort and good will was needed on all sides. The ultimate success of the negotiations proves that it is possible to reconcile differences of view and allow the common European interest to prevail. A new European policy has been born.  This is an important sign that, slowly, step by step, the construction of Europe is proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy put in <Col N="1478" /> place at the beginning of 1983 is designed to maintain fishing opportunities for community member states and to assist the rational development of the fishing industry in the Community through the application of a range of conservation measures, through the regulation of member states' fishing activity, through organisation of the Community market for fish and through Community financial assistance for structural changes.  This policy, even if it has been criticised by Irish and indeed other Community fishermen, has, I believe, ensured relatively stable fishing patterns for Community fishermen by striking a balance between the need to protect stocks and the requirements of the fishing industries of the member states.  In Ireland's case the so-called &ldquo;Irish Box&rdquo; ensures that the Spanish fishing effort is confined to areas outside 50 miles and that Spanish vessels do not compete with Irish vessels on fishing grounds normally worked by the great majority of Irish boats.  Unlike other member states of the Community who have fishing opportunities in the North Sea and in the waters of third countries, we are, as you know, very largely dependent on our coastal waters for our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I might refer here to the &ldquo;box&rdquo; and say that, from what Deputy Daly has intimated, he regards the &ldquo;box&rdquo; as something that was sacrosanct from the beginning. I might point out that when I became Minister &mdash; and I am quite sure in his time as Minister &mdash; there were pressures at Council meetings in Brussels and in Luxembourg to breach that &ldquo;box&rdquo;. In other words, there was not an acceptance of this &ldquo;box&rdquo; as something that should be kept intact by us with the agreement of other member states of the Community. I recall that a crunch stage was reached in 1983 when negotiating a Norwegian deal in the North Sea when our box was being used as a <i>quid pro quo</i> and when we insisted on keeping the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; intact.</P>
    <P>On later occasions the same attack was made on this &ldquo;box&rdquo; and we still insisted that it formed part of our negotiated position. We still hold that view.  As Deputies <Col N="1479" /> will see later the &ldquo;box&rdquo; is now accepted by the Commission, not by us, as part of something which is not to be tampered with in relation to negotiations, or as not to form part of a deal, or to be frittered away as part of a deal.  I shall deal later with the question of the length of the transition period.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry has benefited considerably from the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In 1983 total landings of fish in Irish ports were valued at £51 million.  At present some 12,900 people are employed in the fishing industry, of whom 8,000 are commercial fishermen.  Our preliminary estimate of the value of our exports of fish and fish products in 1984 is approximately £82 million.</P>
    <P>It was inevitable that the negotiations on fisheries with Spain would prove difficult, since for Spain, fisheries is a subject of major economic and political importance. A traditional sea-fishing and seafaring nation, Spain has the fourth largest fishing fleet in the world, some 17,400 vessels, which is approximately 70 per cent of the size of the present Community fleet.  I should add, however, that only 106 Spanish vessels are at present entitled to fish in Community waters at any given time.  The fishing industry in Galicia and in the Basque country is of central importance to these regions.</P>
    <P>As to the negotiations themselves, I might mention an allegation made by Deputy Daly when he said we were pulling back from our original stance which put the transition period at 20 years.  That is the first time I have heard 20 years mentioned.  I presume that if we were negotiating a 20 year transition period today the far side of the House would be talking about 30 years.  This is the kind of political nonsense in which we indulge in a most important area when we should all be on the same side trying to push our case on a realistic basis, not on airy fairy basis.</P>

      <P>As to the negotiations themselves, the Government were at pains to ensure that the principle of the relative stability of the Community's fish stocks and the requirements of the Irish fishing industry were fully protected in the offer which the Community decided, in December last, to present to Spain and Portugal.  In brief, the Community's offer to Spain on access includes the following main elements:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) Spain would have access, on the basis of 1984 quantities, to those species which it currently enjoys.  These species &mdash; for example, hake &mdash; are subject to the Community's total allowable catch and quotas control mechanisms.  However, this fishing would continue to be governed by a licencing system;</P>
      <P>(ii) Spain would have access to quantities, yet to be determined, of horse mackerel and blue whiting within the framework of a transitional licencing system;</P>
      <P>(iii)  The transitional arrangements should last for ten years &mdash; with the possibility that this could be reduced to eight years if satisfactory post-transitional arrangements could be adopted before the end of 1983.  If such arrangements could not be implemented by 1995, the ten years' transitional period would be extended for a further five years &mdash; i.e. until the virtual expiry of the present arrangements under the common fisheries policy in its present form in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  With regard to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo;, the Community position states clearly that Spanish vessels should not have access for fishing purposes to the Irish <Col N="1482" />&ldquo;box&rdquo; area during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>There are good reasons why the offer made to Spain by the Community envisages a long transitional period, with fishing possibilities broadly similar to those at present enjoyed by Spain, and the exclusion of Spanish fishing from the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo;.  Spain's reaction to this offer has been decidedly negative.  Spain has expressed strong opposition to the possibility of a 15-year transition period, fearing that such a long transition would exclude her from effective participation in the review of the Common Fisheries Policy due to take place in 1993.  Moreover, Spain is seeking access to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; from the date of accession.</P>
    <P>Spain's reaction to the Community's offer has led some member states which do not have significant fishing interests in the North Atlantic to raise questions about the length of the transitional period offered to Spain and also to query other aspects of the Community offer.  Moreover, with a view to advancing the negotiations and narrowing the wide gap which exists between the Community and Spain on fisheries, the Commission recently produced a new set of proposals for consideration by the Council.  Deputy Byrne also made the ludicrous suggestion that he was surprised that the Government allowed the Commission to make this proposal.  The former Minister, Deputy Daly, will confirm that Governments do not influence Commission proposals in any way.  They are made by the Commission, the Council then discuss them and accept or reject them as the case may be. Governments have no input into strictly Commission proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, these proposals envisaged limiting Spanish fishing activities to sea areas Vb, VI, VII and VIII; during a seven year transitional period: the retention of the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; for that <Col N="1483" /> period only; a control system, to govern Spanish fishing, along the lines of that which at present regulates fishing in the Shetland &ldquo;box&rdquo; area; strict monitoring procedures; access to hake, monkfish and megrim, which Spain currently enjoys, together with modest additional allocations of other species, such as nephrops, pollock and sea bream.  Central to the Commission's approach was the proposal that, both before accession and in the course of the seven year transitional period, Spain should be given financial aid to reduce the capacity of that part of its fleet which is active in the North Atlantic.</P>
      <P>While we welcomed the Commission's ideas on reducing the capacity of the Spanish fleet, to bring it into line with the actual volume of resources which Spain would be legally entitled to take after accession, other elements of the proposals were unacceptable to Ireland.  In particular we could not agree to a mere seven year transitional period after which Spain would be given access to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent discussions in the Council of Ministers have identified possibilities of improving the Community's offer to Spain through some modest additional allocation to Spain of quotas for certain species, such as nephrops, pollack and squid, as well as the provision of financial aid to encourage Spain to reduce the capacity of her fleet.  However, the Irish Government, with the support of member states which fish the North Atlantic, have firmly insisted during recent Council discussions on the need for a long transitional period, on the need to exclude Spanish vessels from the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; for the duration of this period, and on the need to ensure that any Spanish quotas on accession should respect the relative stability of the existing member states' percentage shares of the stocks subject to total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas and the general balance of their fishing activities.  There are, of course, a number of other important aspects in the fisheries dossier, to which Deputy Daly has referred, on which we have been taking a firm line with a view <Col N="1484" /> to ensuring that our fishing interests are fully protected.  In particular, we have emphasised that the final arrangements should ensure that the fish, and fish products, produced by member states of the present Community should not be displaced by similar products coming from Spain.  Moreover, appropriate arrangements should be made to ensure that the large proportion of the Spanish fleet which fishes distant, non-Community waters should continue to do so, thus preventing even further pressure on Community waters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly referred to this and I agree we must ensure that they maintain these contracts with third countries which they have done in West Africa, Latin America and the South Atlantic.  When they become members, these connections will no longer be bilateral; they will be handled by the Commission from then on and it is in our interests, as a member of the Community, to ensure that we maintain these links and that the fishing rights which Spain has established to these waters will be maintained.  I assure Deputies that they can depend on our assistance and insistence on that in so far as we can.  At the same time, however, we need to ensure that Spanish catches, under either Spain's bilateral agreements with third countries, or under the commercial joint ventures between Spanish fisheries interests and their counterparts in third countries, do not lead to the displacement of Irish fish exports on the Community market.  Deputies will appreciate that our objectives on these matters are shared by other members states of the present Community for whom exports of North Atlantic fish are of considerable economic importance.</P>
    <P>I refer to a statement made by Deputy Byrne which was exaggerated.  However, he was on the right track. We are not too sure to what extent Spain is taking fish out of the Community waters simply because we do not have the powers to scrutinise their books and follow their catches into the ports of landing in Spain. This is a facility we would have if they <Col N="1485" /> were members.  That is one of the advantages of Spanish membership.  Under CFP regulations we would have access to Spain and to the points of discharge of their catches.  We would be able to establish for the first time to what extent they were taking stocks from Community waters.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to contribute constructively to the work of bringing the Community's negotiations with Spain and Portugal to an early conclusion.  We intend to ensure, at the same time, that the existing balance of the Common Fisheries Policy is not upset as a result of the fisheries negotiations with Spain and that the final agreement will be one which will enable our fishing industry to continue to develop its potential in future years.  In addition to pressing for a long transitional period, for the preservation of the Fish box as a necessary means of control, and for reduction of Spain's North Atlantic fishing capacity, we shall seek to ensure that the final agreement with Spain will avoid any possibility of upheaval in the Common Fisheries Policy when the transitional period comes to an end.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the present negotiations is fully in line with that which has been pursued by successive Governments in relation to defending our interests in the fisheries sector since we joined the Community.</P>
    <P>The norm which has been set in relation to other chapters in negotiations is seven years.  I rebut any suggestions that we have pulled back from a 20 year level. That was never mentioned by anyone until tonight.  As Deputies are aware, at the European Council in The Hague in 1976, we secured a particularly favourable agreement on fisheries.  The concession fought for and won at that time was that the figures taken into account for establishing our quotas when the CFP became effective would be twice the 1976 catch.  That was a major concession won by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald.  He is a man to whom we owe a lot in relation to that negotiation.</P>
    <P>This agreement explicitly recognised the need to secure the continued and <Col N="1486" /> progressive development of the Irish fishing industry.  The realisation of this objective formed the basis of our negotiating stance in the protracted discussions on the establishment of the Common Fisheries Policy which came into operation on 1 January 1983.  The arrangements to be concluded with Spain, particularly on access to waters and resources and with regard to the duration of the transitional period, are unlikely to be easily arrived at.  Among the factors which may make for difficult negotiations are the somewhat exaggerated expectations apparently entertained by Spain and the consideration that some member states of the present Community appear to feel that the countries with fishing interests in the North Atlantic should contemplate sacrifices on fisheries to balance those made by countries which will pay the price of post-accession competition from Spain and Portugal in, for example, the wine and agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government intend, however, to show the same determination as in the past in working for an outcome favourable to the further development of the Irish fishing industry.  Irish fishing communities and the Irish fish processing industry can rest assured of the Government's intention to ensure that the developmental needs of the Irish fishing industry are fully taken into account in the difficult negotiations which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The enlargement negotiations including, of course, the sensitive fisheries chapter, have now entered a decisive phase.  We are now preparing for an important meeting of the Council of Ministers which is scheduled for 17-19 March 1985.  It is hoped that the negotiations might be concluded at the Council or, at least, the range of problems significantly narrowed before the European Council at the end of March.  The Government are fully conscious of the importance for Ireland of a successful outcome to these negotiations.  We hope that we will have the support of all sides of the House in pursuing our determined efforts to secure a positive outcome on <Col N="1487" /> behalf of the Irish fish, and fish processing, industry.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic.  For the sake of our fishing industry I would prefer if the Spanish fleet did not have access to the EC waters.  However, many years ago the member states of the day came to the conclusion that they would welcome Spain's application for membership.  One of the consequential results of that is the accession of Spain on certain terms and it is up to us to ensure that our end is kept up and that we get the best deal possible for our fishermen.  There are bottom lines for us in these negotiations. They are a matter for negotiation and are not to be used publicly at this time. However beyond those bottom lines we are not prepared to go.</P>

      <P>Our fishing industry is perhaps experiencing its leanest period ever since the foundation of the State.  The rot began on our entry to the EC if not before then in that the then member states had already introduced the equal access clause which gave to member states a right to fish in waters to which up to then they had no access.  In particular they were given the right to fish in our territorial waters with the result that they gained a tremendous advantage while our fishing industry which was only beginning to take off then was severely hampered and has never since had the opportunity of building up to the extent that might otherwise have been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can hardly blame the then members of the EC for having the foresight to gain some advantage for themselves but they left us in an impossible position because we had to accept a <i>fait accompli</i> in regard to the future of the industry. Consequently, we have been groping in <Col N="1489" /> the dark in respect of that industry ever since.</P>
    <P>At that time, with the help of the then Government, the fishermen tried to gain the best advantage possible for themselves. While they gained some little advantage they were hampered to a great extent by the situation they were going into.  Any Government in the future will find it extremely difficult to build the type of fishing industry that will benefit not only the industry but the economy.</P>
    <P>When we joined the EC we were just beginning to make progress in terms of our fleet.  We had developed a pattern of fishing which to some extent was lucrative for a certain number of fishermen.  At that time the concentration was on herring fishing.  Our fishermen depended totally on herring fishing and usually they managed quite easily to meet the repayments on their investment especially when the herring season was good.  The other areas of fishing were by no means as lucrative.  There was a very tight kind of arrangement whereby the situation was fine so long as the herring season was good but then matters changed and the markets for herring were lost.  Herring did not appear to have the same value on European markets and the fishermen did not seem to be capable of diversifying into other types of fishing.  Very little progress has been made by our fishermen since the herring fishing was lost.  Some have been successful in mackerel fishing or in fishing for other types of fish but they have not enjoyed the kind of profits that were gleaned from herring fishing. It is strange that herring sell for about £8 per box compared with £20 per box for dogfish, a species that up to some time ago would have been thrown overboard. The same applies to crab.  In the past few years inshore fishermen made most money on these two species so that is a rather strange turnabout in the industry.</P>
    <P>Another factor that hindered the fishing industry was the lack of any co-ordinated approach to the whole future of the industry.  I maintain that BIM's brief was far too limited.  As I said here last week they were no more than a lending agency.  For instance the board had <Col N="1490" /> no say in harbour development and very little say in the matter of processing.  They had no say either, up to a short time ago, in the training of fishermen.  That is why it was rather extravagant to describe the board as a development agency.  Their only say in development was in making money for boats available to selected fishermen.</P>
    <P>There should have been a co-ordinated approach encompassing harbour development, fishing fleets and processing.  In this way the industry would have made much more progress and those who invested in the industry would have had better returns and could have had more confidence in themselves.  The sad position at the moment is that where the heaviest investment is in boats, these boats are not making money.  The only area where a reasonable livlelihood can be got is with the smaller boats under 50 feet and the very large boats over 120 feet.  Of course, along with the fact that our development has not gone as we would have wished, we had to face the plundering of our stocks by EC member states.  We are all aware that a modern fishing boat is equipped in a manner which makes it possible for it to take out very large catches.  One can say literally that the fish has no escape.  The uncontrolled fishing of our waters by these huge ships makes it almost impossible for a little fleet like ours to compete.  We can see from the number of boats that are being caught by our small protection fleet ample evidence of what I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>We have seen a gradual increase in State investment in our fishing industry over the years.  We put something like £27 million into the industry in 1983 and £19 million of that went towards the fishing fleet.  When we talk of the fishing fleet we also have to talk of the work that was provided on land, the boatyards and so on.  All of these have more or less gone by the wayside, and that is another indication of how serious the position in our fishing industry at the moment is. The increases in oil charges created one terrible headache for our fishermen. They have never really recovered fully <Col N="1491" /> from the terrible increases that were introduced as a result of that.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must have some major onslaught on the whole future of the industry.  I have said here in this House on many occasions that we have no exploratory fishing, no research, no real planning for our industry by comparison with what happens in other countries. Unless we have a planned approach to the future of the industry, then I see no hope at all of our getting anywhere in the future.</P>
    <P>Against that background we must now consider the serious consequences facing our fishermen with the possibility of the Spanish and Portuguese entering our waters.  We have approximately 13,000 fishermen employed and 40 per cent of those are part-time fishermen.  If the 17,000 plus Spanish boats along with the Portuguese fleet gain entry, then I can see nothing but our harbours littered with rotten hulks.  I cannot see that we will be in any position to have any fishing fleet for the future if that is allowed to happen. I understand that their fleet would be approximately 70 per cent of the EC total fleet.  That is really frightening.  I do not see how we can hope or have any chance to overcome that if the Spaniards are allowed in here or, let us say, given free entry.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is not enough for us to shout, &ldquo;out, out, out&rdquo;, We must stand on our own feet and look at fishing as one of our greatest natural resources and try to develop it to the full.  BIM with Údarás na Gaeltachta, the IDA and CTT should co-ordinate their efforts to get the best possible advantage for this industry.  We need better and bigger boats and highly skilled and determined fishermen.  We <Col N="1492" /> must organise so that we can get the maximum added value from our landings. We must streamline the various ancillary services to give more efficiency on shore.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs outlined the number of foreign boats that have been caught fishing illegally.  What would the position be if we had the full 17,000 out there?  I hate to think how we would handle that situation.  We must encourage our fishermen to have a sense of pride in themselves and to have no inferiority complex.  While we are at a terrible disadvantage when we try to compete with our EC colleagues and neighbours, at the same time we have a duty to equip our fishermen so that they can go out there and get their own share of what is available to them.  At the moment we have only six boats in our fleet out of our 1,600 boats that are in a position to go out and compete with the foreigners.  We on this side of the House will give every support we can to the Government to gain the best advantage possible for our fishermen. It is not a political matter.  The consequences for us are far too serious, and everybody with an interest in the future of the industry and the country must try to ensure that the best possible advantage is gained for us.  We have this motion down for discussion first of all to let our own people see what we are fighting for and, secondly, to let our EC partners, the Spanish and others realise that we are at one in our aims on this issue.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from self-employment exceeded the statutory limit.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed him with means exceeding the statutory limit and disallowed his unemployment assistance claim.  He was advised of the decision of the Appeals Officer on 23 January 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means exceeding the statutory limit.  He appealed against this decision and an appeals officer on 23 July 1984 assessed him with means of £84 derived from the profit from his holding.  He requested that his means be reviewed and his case was reinvestigated by a social <Col N="1300" /> welfare officer in December 1984.  His means derived from the profit from his holding were however again assessed at £84 per week.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £15.80 weekly being the appropriate long term rate £99.80 less £84 means.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was not prepared to co-operate with the social welfare officer in the investigation of his claim and this gave rise to delay.  He was then advised that he must co-operate in the investigation to enable his entitlement to unemployment assistance to be determined.</P>
      <P>Following further inquiries by the social welfare officer his means were assessed at £15.75 weekly.  His means were derived from the value of board and lodging in his father's home.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £14.20 weekly the appropriate rate £29.95 less means £15.75.  All arrears due have been paid and weekly payments of £14.20 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 23 October 1984 and ceased to sign at her local office on 29 October 1984.  Her case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of her means and she informed the social welfare officer that she did not wish to pursue her claim.  She recommenced signing on 28 November 1984 and her case was again referred to <Col N="1301" /> a social welfare officer for investigation of her means.  It was recently ascertained that the claim papers were not received by the social welfare officer as the documents appear to have gone astray in the post.  Duplicate papers have been prepared and the case has again been referred to a social welfare officer for urgent investigation. When these inquiries are completed her means will be assessed and her claim will be determined.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assume the Deputy is referring, in the main, to the search procedures which apply before a person is allowed into the prison.</P>
      <P>These procedures, which have been in force for many years, apply to all persons entering the prison whether they be visitors (lay or clerical), prison staff or staff of my Department with official business to do in the prisons.  For that matter they apply to me personally.  The procedures are an important protection for persons entering the prison in that efforts which might otherwise be made to intimidate them into bringing contraband into the prison will be seen to be pointless.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's reference to members of the Roman Catholic clergy because, apart from the fact that clergymen are searched in the same way as other visitors, I am assured that no prisoner is ever interviewed in the Governor's office by anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the number of permissions given to foreign research vessels in 1983 and 1984, the name and country of origin of each vessel, the purpose of the cruise, whether there was an Irish observer on board, and if a report on the cruise was subsequently received in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs granted permission to 45 foreign research cruises to operate in waters under Irish jurisdiction in 1983 and to 49 in 1984.  These vessels came from the following countries: Great Britain, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Netherlands, Norway, USA, USSR, Poland and the Faroe Islands (Denmark). They carried out research in the following categories: fisheries resource evaluation; benthic ecology &mdash; environmental; oceanography; marine geology; geophysics; pollution monitoring; hydrography; and fishing gear evaluation.  A detailed breakdown of each of these cruises providing the names of the vessel, the country of origin and the purpose of the cruise is given below.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the research being carried out is considered of particular national interest or importance, arrangements are made in accordance with standard international practice to include an Irish Scientific observer aboard and the attached list also indicates on which cruises an observer was present.  Cruise reports are, however, always requested when authorisation for a research cruise is being granted. Delays are frequently experienced in <Col N="1309" /> receiving these reports.  However, it will be appreciated that the processing of the scientific data necessary to the preparation <Col N="1310" /> of reports can involve a considerable amount of time.</P>

      <P>As access to public money markets &mdash; including those in the US &mdash; has the potential to contribute to improving the equity base of Irish industry, I would generally welcome the move referred to in the first part of the Deputy's question.  I understand that the vast majority of projects assisted under the Industrial Development Authority's Enterprise Development Programme would not be of a sufficient scale to warrant equity flotations on the US public money markets. While the IDA attempts to ensure that all such projects have a satisfactory equity base, it is primarily a matter for the individual promoters to determine the appropriate manner in which this should be achieved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I held a meeting last year with the major multiple supermarket groups at which we discussed how these groups could play a more active role in the development of the Irish food industry.  To ensure that this initiative is followed through, I have entrusted the Irish Goods Council, who are regarded by both multiples and manufacturers as an independent body, with the task of ensuring that the goodwill evidenced by the initial meeting is built upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity, at both individual meetings with the multiples and at various specialist seminars in <Col N="1320" /> which they have been involved, to stress my continuing wish for Irish suppliers not only of food products but also of other products such as clothing, to be given a &ldquo;fair crack of the whip&rdquo;.  I obtain continuous feedback from the Irish Goods Council in this regard and from this and from my own observations, I am satisfied that the multiples are today much more conscious of the unique role which they can play in the development of new business opportunities in Ireland.  While I have no immediate plans to meet again with representatives of the multiple supermarket groups, I would, of course, arrange such meetings if I considered them necessary.  I will continue to monitor progress in this area.</P>

      <P>The regulation provides for the publication by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities of invitations to submit applications for support for appropriate projects.  The Commission has not yet published such an invitation but has convened an Advisory Committee to consider the general conditions governing the submission, selection and level of financial support for projects.  Ireland is represented on this Committee by an official of the National Board for Science and Technology. When the invitation to submit projects is published the Board intends bringing it to the attention of interested parties.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> These rates have been calculated on the basis of block grant excluding funds provided for the improvement of county roads under the EC western package which, prior to this year, were notified as part of the block grant.  Furthermore, the figures are not strictly comparable because of the variations, in the proportions of main roads to the combined main-county road network in each county.</P>
    <P>In the period 1973 to 1975 the block grant system replaced four separate grants.  Initially the level of block grant, to each county, was related to the total cost of the old grants which in turn had been determined, <i>inter alia</i>, by the open ended discretionary expenditure by councils on the maintenance of main roads.  Since 1975, the relative amounts of the block grants to individual counties have been adjusted gradually in an effort to relate them more closely to the maintenance and improvement needs of the regional road network.  A further step in this process has been taken this year, as will be seen from the above table, and it is envisaged that this process will be continued in future years within the limits of available funds.</P>
    <P>In recent years, in addition to the block grant, special grants have been provided for works on regional and county roads. New grant commitments notified to Galway County Council for such works total £1.898 millions since 1983.  The works involved would otherwise have to be financed from the council's own resources, (including the rate support grants) supplemented by the block grant.</P>

A grant could not be allowed in respect of the bathroom or bedroom because the statutory waiting <Col N="1331" /> periods had not elapsed since payment of a previous grant in respect of the house. As adequate water and sewerage facilities and a chimney already existed in the house neither could grants be allowed in respect of these categories of work.</P>

      <P>Monitoring of water quality in the River Boyne indicates that the river is in a generally satisfactory state with slight pollution being recorded at a few points.  I am aware that a deterioration in water quality has occurred in the estuary and that sewage discharges have contributed to this.  I understand that Drogheda Corporation have recently received and are examining their consultant's report on the options for sewage disposal.  When the consultant's report and the corporation's recommendations thereon are received in my Department, they will be given early consideration.</P>

    <P>(1) There is no reliable information available on which to base an estimate of VAT receipts from goods vehicles and other motor vehicles.  However, VAT-registered persons are entitled to a deduction in their returns for VAT borne on business purchases of motor vehicles other than cars and motor cycles, and this would very significantly reduce the VAT yield from such vehicles.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 518 to 521, inclusive, together.  Under the exchange control regulations, which are designed to protect the external reserves, investment in stocks and shares abroad is, in general, restricted.  However, securities issued by EC institutions may be purchased under special arrangements, and other foreign securities may be purchased as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;by individuals and institutions, using the proceeds of sale of existing holdings of such securities;</P>
      <P>&mdash;by insurance companies and pension funds, within limits which are settled annually;</P>
      <P>&mdash;by individuals and institutions, where the purchase is financed by foreign borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that, in addition to the above possibilities for purchase of securities, the Central Bank permits Irish employees to acquire shares in their firm's parent company abroad under employee share option schemes.  Also, under a scheme I introduced last year, Irish venture capital companies may obtain permission to take up shares in foreign companies establishing subsidiaries in Ireland, provided that the funds concerned are retained here for investment <Col N="1339" /> in the subsidiary.  It will be clear from the foregoing that the controls do allow scope for foreign investment.  I have no evidence that they are adversely affecting confidence in Irish firms who may issue shares in the USA.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance (a) the amount of revenue raised in 1984 from tax yields on the disposal of developed property; and (b) the estimated amount of revenue that will be raised as a result of doubling the 5 per cent VAT rate on the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) Presumably the Deputy has in mind the tax paid on the disposal of property by a builder or developer after it has been developed.  Such disposals are subject to <Col N="1341" /> value-added tax and stamp duty except where exemptions apply (such as certain disposals by the State and local authorities in the case of value-added tax and new grant-sized houses in the case of stamp duty).  The profits derived from the sale of developed property, which is trading stock of a trade of building or of dealing in or developing property, are included in the computation of the trading profits assessable to income tax (or to corporation tax in the case of companies) and accordingly are not subject to capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>As regards value-added tax it is not possible to state the yield of tax from the disposal of developed property as value-added tax returns are not submitted in a manner which would enable such yield to be identified.  However, it is estimated on the basis of non-Revenue statistical data that the net value-added tax yield in 1984 from buildings and construction work was £64 million.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable separate figures to be supplied in respect of the stamp duty paid on disposals sals of developed property.</P>
      <P>No statistics are available as to the amount of income tax or corporation tax arising from the disposals in question. The net profits from the relevant sales would be included in the accounts of the vendors concerned and it would not be possible to quantify with any degree of accuracy the tax in such cases.  However, it is tentatively estimated that the income tax (non-PAYE) and corporation tax yield from the construction industry and property dealing and development sector as a whole in 1983, the latest year for which detailed statistics are available, was of the order of £35 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be of interest to the Deputy to note that sales of development land by persons other than those trading as builders or dealers and developers will normally attract capital gains tax.  While the same difficulty arises concerning the provision of statistics in this area as is encountered in the case of disposals of developed property, it has been tentatively estimated that the capital gains tax <Col N="1342" /> ultimately payable in respect of such sales in 1983 will amount to £5 million.</P>
    <P>(b) An estimate of the net value-added tax yield from buildings and construction work in 1985 is £107 million.</P>

      <Col N="1349" /> Additional Categories of Persons eligible for Medical Cards.</P>
    <P>From 1973 certain social security pensioners from other EC countries and families of persons insured in other EC countries became eligible for medical cards arising out of EC regulations.  These regulations were extended to the self-employed with effect from 1 July 1982.</P>
    <P>From 1 July 1982 a concession was made to all persons aged 66 or over who were recipients of social welfare pensions whereby their eligibility for medical cards was determined without reference to the income guidelines.  This concession was rescinded in February 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Task Force on Child Care Services recommended that health boards should carry out the functions of child care authorities as envisaged in their final report.  The forthcoming Children Bill, which I expect to circulate later this session, will give effect to this by extending the statutory powers and responsibilities of health boards in relation to child care services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> The Bill will also provide for the introduction of a system of statutory registration of day care services e.g. creches, day nurseries, playgroups and child-minding facilities.  It is intended to prescribe standards in regard to these services in regulations to be made under the Bill.  In anticipation of the legislation, I have established a committee, representative of the various bodies having an interest in this area, to advise me on the minimum requirements which should apply in relation to day care services.  I expect to receive the Committees report within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Present policy is that health boards assist voluntary organisations and community groups in providing day care services for children from deprived or disadvantaged families.  The boards assess the need for such services on an ongoing basis.  In this connection, I might mention that the number of day care services receiving financial support from health boards has increased from 87 in 1981 to over 230 in 1984.  The total cost of this assistance has increased from £400,000 per annum to over £1 million per annum in the same period.</P>

He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £56.45 weekly the appropriate rate payable to a man with an adult dependant.

      <P>The person concerned was an applicant for unemployment assistance from 2 April 1984 to 28 August 1984.  He was assessed with means at £16.50 weekly derived from the profit from his shop and from self-employment.  His means were reviewed and following an investigation by a social welfare officer the assessment of his means was increased to £53.10 weekly with effect from 15 August 1984. He appealed against the assessment of his means and an appeals officer reduced the amount of means assessed against him to £19.50 with effect from 15 August 1984.</P>
      <P>During the period of his unemployment assistance claim he had only one qualified child.  He was, however, overpaid unemployment assistance during the period 2 April 1984 to 3 July 1984 in respect of a child who had already attained the age of 18 years.  The amount overpaid to him was recovered by deductions of £5 weekly from the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to him.  Accordingly, he was paid unemployment assistance from 4 July 1984 at £37.90 weekly being the appropriate rate £59.40 less means £16.50 in addition to a weekly deduction of £5 towards recovery of the overpayment.  From 15 August 1984 he was paid at £1.30 weekly being the appropriate rate £59.40 less means £53.10 and £5 deduction against the overpayment. Following the assessment of his means being reduced to £19.50 weekly by the appeals officer the amount of arrears of unemployment assistance due was withheld against the balance of the overpayment of unemployment assistance due to be recovered from him.  He ceased to sign as unemployed after 28 August 1984.</P>

In addition, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides income support in any case where a particular need arises.

In negotiations with the union my Department offered some very generous concessions, while maintaining the basic principles laid down by the Government, but the union chose to reject the package. There can be no question of continuing to spend huge amounts of Exchequer money on eradication measures which have failed to make any progress in recent years, and so I have directed that the new programme should go ahead using such veterinary resources as are available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the views expressed by the Irish Road Haulage Association in relation to the enforcement of provisions of road traffic legislation relevant to the road haulage industry.  Meetings have taken place both with the Garda authorities and with officials of my Department over the years in relation to enforcement and in fact as recently as Wednesday last I met a deputation from the association at which they put their views to me.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that the picture painted by the association in relation to enforcement fairly reflects the attention paid to this matter by the Garda Síochána.  In 1983 proceedings were taken for breaches of the Road Transport Acts in 1,457 cases, about 75 per cent of which related to the road haulage industry.  In addition, the level of prosecutions for breaches of road traffic legislation, including untaxed and uninsured vehicles, is high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met the association last week I assured them that the Garda authorities <Col N="1387" /> were giving this matter as much attention as possible having regard to the many other demands on the force at the present time and that every effort would be made to effect an improvement in the position as far as possible.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy's previous question indicated that representations had been made by him, that was of course accepted as fact but, as stated in the reply, no trace of representations could be found.

      <P>I understand that the organisation of school transport services to Ballinasloe post primary centre is being reviewed at present.  This review is being carried out by CIE in consultation with the transport liaison officer for County Galway who has responsibility for the local administration of post primary school transport in the Ballinasloe catchment area.  The review has not been finalised but I will advise the Deputy of any revised arrangements which may be made.</P>
      <P>The number of eligible pupils from the areas in question who availed themselves of school transport during the school years 1982-83 and 1983-84 were 75 and 67 respectively.  During the current school year, the number is 85.</P>
      <P>At present, a large school bus and a private contractor's vehicle serve the areas.  During 1982-83, the same number of vehicles was engaged.  However, the use of the private contractor's vehicle was not required in 1983-84.</P>

      <P>Up to now students in colleges of education paid a composite fee which covered tuition and maintenance and a separate grants scheme, which reflected this position applied to them.  The proposal in <i>Building on Reality</i> to which I intend giving effect in respect of the general intake of students in 1985, is that new students in the colleges will be charged separately for tution and accommodation and the higher education grants <Col N="1393" /> scheme will apply to them.  This proposal will have the effect of putting students in colleges of education on the same basis with respect to tuition fees and maintenance costs as other third level students.</P>
      <P>The fees for tuition will be broadly similar to those for Arts students in the university sector.  The increased cost of attending the colleges will arise from the charges for accommodation and meals which were hither to included in the composite fee.</P>
      <P>With regard to the implications for prospective applicants from lower income families I would direct the Deputy's attention to paragraph 5.23 of <i>Building on Reality</i> which deals with students aid and which states:</P>
      <P>It is proposed to update the financial provisions of the Higher Education Grant and related schemes which have remained unchanged since 1981.  The maintenance element of grants will be increased by 10 per cent in real terms from September 1985; income limits for eligibility will be increased by 5 per cent in real terms from the same date; both will be indexed to the rate of inflation thereafter.  Account will also be taken of the National Planning Board's recommendations regarding grants for partial payment of fees and a more gradual tapering of eligibility limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 639, 640, 641 and 642 together.  When the Joint Committee on Women's Rights produced its Interim Report on Education last October, I was pleased to note the close alignment of its views with my own and our mutual ambition of eliminating sexism and sex-stereotyping from education.  In view of the work which I had already initiated in this area the committee's report was most timely.  I promised that their recommendations would be taken extremely seriously and that as many as possible would be implemented. The following is the position on recommendations (1), (9) and (10) which are those relevant to the questions under reply:</P>
      <P>Co-educational Schools</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of primary <Col N="1396" /> schools the Programme for Action 1984-87 (para. 3.13) states that proposals for new schools on a co-educational basis will be encouraged and the reorganisation of school provision on such a basis will be facilitated&rdquo;.  The regulations governing the organisation of primary schools on co-educational lines require that boys and girls be taught together in mixed classes.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Oireachtas report there are eight new primary schools at the planning stage, which it is intended will operate as fully co-educational schools.</P>
    <P>The position regarding post-primary schools is that new `greenfield' schools in courses of being planned or under construction are co-educational.  Amalgamations of already existing schools under the rationalisation programme will also nearly always involve the incorporation of single sex schools with new co-educational schools.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the Oireachtas report in October last decisions on the provision of two new `greenfield' schools have been taken and these will be co-educational. Decisions on the provision of four new post-primary schools have also been made which result from replacement through amalgamation of existing schools.  These will be co-educational.</P>
    <P>Amalgamation of post-primary schools</P>
    <P>My Department have an ongoing programme for the amalgamation of post-primary schools under paragraph 5.12 of the Programme for Action 1984/87.  A number of decisions have already been made involving the creation of co-educational schools through amalgamation of existing schools.</P>
    <P>Interchange of Pupils/Teachers</P>
    <P>Since the issue of the Colley letter in 1966, my Department have an active policy of encouraging inter-school co-operation involving the exchange of pupils and teachers with the object of broadening the range of subjects available to pupils.  In addition, my Department are now preparing a list of those <Col N="1397" /> girls' schools which do not provide the opportunity of taking the subjects mentioned and the matter will then be taken with the individual school authorities with a view to remedying the situation.</P>

A whole series of actions has been set in train in pursuit of that objective.</P>

      <P>In addition to increasing the number of women participating in traditionally male courses, AnCO has run a number of courses specifically designed for women. These include 'women in publishing', 'women in co-operatives' and 'return to work' courses.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware of the increasing level of skin infections and dermatitis amongst the industrial workforce; and if, in view of the failure of some employers to disclose the nature of <Col N="1404" /> the chemical components of raw materials, he will introduce legislation obliging employers to disclose such information to workers or their representatives.</P>

      <P>I am aware and concerned that work-related skin diseases outnumber all other work incurred illness and that occupational dermatitis is the single most common work-related disease in this country.  A recently published explanatory booklet entitled <i>Dermatitis can be Prevented,</i> which was prepared with the assistance of my Department, is available from the National Industrial Safety Organisation.</P>

      <P>Directive 75/117 relates to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women while directive 76/207 is concerned with the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training, promotion and working conditions.

      <P>As regards keeping women (and men) informed of their rights under these directives the Employment Equality Act, 1977, provided for the establishment of the Employment Equality Agency.  The general functions of the agency are: (a) to work towards the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment; (b) to promote equality of opportunity between men and women in relation to employment; and (c) to keep the working of the equality legislation under review, and, whenever it thinks it necessary, to make proposals to the Minister for Labour for amending either, or both of the Acts.</P>
      <P>The agency has published a code of practice designed to eliminate sex and marital status discrimination, and to promote equality of opportunity between men and women in employment.

This review takes account of future trends and the present relatively high unemployment situation among apprentices and skilled workers.  As a result of the failure on the part of employers to recruit apprentices, AnCO has had to maintain a high level of sponsorship of apprentices to ensure that skill shortages will not arise when the recession lifts.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to paragraphs 3.9 to 3.14 of the National Plan which deal with profit sharing and worker shareholding and in particular the last sentence of paragraph 3.14 which reads:</P>
      <P>The Government for their part, have a strong commitment to developing profit sharing and worker shareholding, which they consider an effective step to ensure the success and efficiency of Irish industry and the prosperity and security of Irish workers for the future.</P>
      <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the important initiatives to promote increased worker shareholding in companies in the Finance Acts of 1982 and 1984.  My own view is that employee financial participation must be based on agreement and developed through good management and trade union practice as part of a total philosophy of employee participation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a variety of forms of financial participation in operation in the United States at present, some of which are not primarily motivated by industrial relations considerations.  While we can learn from the experiences of other countries, including the United States, we should not copy schemes in an uncritical fashion which may be inappropriate to Irish circumstances.</P>
