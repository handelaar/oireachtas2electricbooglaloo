      <P>In regard to item No. 7 and the budget debate, in view of the fact that a number of decisions have been taken by the Government since budget day which considerably alter the financial provisions and the arithmetic of the budget, may I ask the Taoiseach if it would be possible to bring forward and publish for the benefit of Members participating in the debate on item No. 7 a new budget table that would incorporate all the changes that have been made since <Col N="2336" /> budget day and let us see exactly what we are debating on item No. 7?</P>

      <P>On the night of the budget this House passed, and in some cases voted on, Financial Resolutions but the impact of those resolutions in many cases has been subsequently changed by Government decision.  For the benefit of all those affected by the Financial Resolutions, I wish to know if those Financial Resolutions as passed by us on budget <Col N="2338" /> day are still valid or are new Financial Resolutions not required?

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not agreed.  We on this side of the House are opposed to making an order for Second Stage of this <Col N="2339" /> Bill and taking the Bill at very short notice tomorrow.  We object to the manner in which the Government, for what appear to be nothing more than tactical political reasons of their own, are attempting to rush this Bill through the House in a hasty, ill-considered manner, brushing aside the normal parliamentary procedures.  The Parliamentary procedure whereby business is ordered by agreement between the Government and the Opposition is valuable and useful.  It enables legislation to be adequately and constructively debated.  I acknowledge that there may be times when a Government are justified in setting aside procedures but otherwise it is a duty on the Government to adhere to the established procedures and so ensure the orderly and responsible management of parliamentary business.  There is no justification for the Government on this occasion.  We on this side are not being unreasonable and we are fully prepared to take this Bill next week even though, as it happens, nobody has given us any good reason why it should be taken.  We also believe that there is no public demand for this legislation which can only cause divisions and dissent at a time when 234,000 people are unemployed and all our energies inside and outside this House should be concentrated on solving the grave economic and social issues confronting the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People want to know why the Government have chosen this moment to bring forward this legislation and thereby disrupt the most important economic debate of the year, the budget debate.  At a time when these grave economic and social issues press with increasing severity on our people, it is irresponsible to throw the national community into the kind of acrimonious divisive debate which is bound to follow the introduction of this legislation.  If, as I assume, the Government's case is that this is an important and necessary reform, why is it not being dealt with in the normal manner with plenty of time given to the public to consider its provisions and implications and for interested parties to make submissions to both Government and Opposition? <Col N="2340" /> If this legislation can stand on its own merits, why is it not being allowed to do so?  It is our wish that this legislation should be dealt with in the House in a dignified, mature and responsible manner, and we hope that it will.  We are quite prepared to take this Bill in the normal way next week or the week after, but this attempt by the Government to use their majority to abandon normal procedures to force the Bill through is not calculated to achieve a reasonable atmosphere for the debate.  Why is it being done?</P>
    <P>The Government are leaving themselves open to two sustainable accusations: firstly, that they are seeking to divert attention from the failure of their budgetary and economic policies; secondly, that they wish to have this Bill safely dispatched through the Dáil before public opinion has focused fully on its provisions and assessed its implications. Are we witnessing another instance of the handling of public opinion, an attempt to put something across?  There is no pressure for this legislation; in fact, the reverse is true.  There is no valid case for taking it tomorrow.  I am asking the Government to adhere to the normal practice and procedures and take this Bill by agreement next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am concerned at the haste with which this Bill has been introduced to the House without giving adequate time to us in Opposition to study it and make our case and without time for consultation with various interested bodies outside.  I am concerned also that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are making the case that it is a very minor Bill and, to use the Taoiseach's own words, very minimal changes are involved in it.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs in a statement which was quoted in the leading article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> stated that the proposed amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to try to make it clear to the House that <Col N="2341" /> the only matter before the House at the moment is the date on which the Bill is to be taken.  The merits or demerits of the Bill may not be debated at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept entirely what you say, but the case I am making is that that date should be postponed.  My concern is that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs either do not understand the implications of their own Bill or were misled at the Cabinet table and do not know what is in the Bill, otherwise they would not go out and tell the public that it is a minimal change and the Minister for Foreign Affairs would not say that there is only one change in this Bill when there are three changes. The one change that the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to was the removal of the need for a doctor's prescription for non-medical contraceptives. If that were the only change in the Bill then it might not be necessary to have a long time for consultation, but this Bill is a fundamental move away from the 1979 Act.  In fairness to the Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, he will not go in front of the public and say that it is only a trivial Bill with only trivial changes. He recognises the major social change involved in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That will arise on subsequent Stages if we get to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this is important. We are appealing to the Government to extend the time before Second Stage is debated in this House.  I am appealing to the Government to reconsider their decision to take this Bill forward tomorrow. It appears from what the Taoiseach said that he does not realise that this legislation introduces a major social change.  The 1979 Family Planning Act puts family planning in the area of family health care and it is in keeping with Article 41&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now getting into a major Second Stage debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major move <Col N="2342" /> away from that principle enshrined in the 1979 Act.  Also I would like to know why the review body's report was not circulated to Members of this House It would be very useful in our deliberations. I would like to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health what consultations were held before this legislation was introduced.  When Deputy Haughey was Minister for Health he consulted with 18 different bodies over a period of months before introducing legislation to the House.  I would like to ask if consultations took place with the chemists, with the IMO&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant because in this new legislation it is proposed that the health boards will have a major role.  Are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health aware of a recent decision of the Midland Health Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I will be repeating this on Second Stage but it is very relevant to try to get this Government to delay the introduction of Second Stage so that proper consultation with the appropriate bodies can take place.  It is usual when legislation of this nature takes place that it would be circulated to the health boards, the chemists the medical organisations.  What about the maternity hospitals?  There is a major change in this Bill in relation to the maternity hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The House should be advised of the arrangements put by the Government to the Opposition with regard to the taking of this Bill.  The Bill was published on Thursday last.  The Opposition spokesman was contacted on Wednesday evening.  It was made clear that the Government's wish was to take the Bill as soon as possible after the Opposition had had sufficient time to examine it. Deputies opposite may scoff but we all know why another weekend is needed &mdash; so that the Bill can be examined.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The Government recognised that the Opposition Front Bench would need time to consider the Bill, that their Parliamentary Party also would require time for that reason, and that was why we suggested that Second Stage commence this afternoon.  I stress the word, &ldquo;commence&rdquo;. There have been attempts to suggest to the media that we wished to guillotine the Bill or to force it through the Dáil whereas all we requested was that Second Stage would commence with no restriction as to the amount of time allowed for that stage.  The reality is that we wished to have the Bill debated here in Parliament and not on the streets where people are being confused every day of the week.</P>

I will keep an ear to what the Minister of State says but so far as he has gone he has been dealing with attempted arrangements for <Col N="2345" /> the taking of the Bill and that to the Chair appears to be in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): Having heard from the Opposition that they needed more time to discuss this matter and in view of their Parliamentary Party meeting taking place today, the Government decided that in fairness to the Opposition they should be allowed time to discuss the taking of the Bill.  It was put to them then that we postpone the commencement of Second Stage until tomorrow, Thursday, so it is not correct for anyone to suggest that we have attempted to rush the Bill through the House or not to give the Opposition ample time to consider it.</P>
      <P>We have attempted at all times to give maximum opportunity to the Opposition to consider the Bill.  I would remind the House that we are talking about a three section Bill but a Bill which consists mainly of one section.  It is not a long technical piece of legislation.  I agree that there are principles involved, but it is a matter for people to decide for themselves. I am dealing with the arrangements and I wish the House to be aware that the Government did not fail at any time to accept the fact that the Opposition needed time to consider the Bill.  In view of the arrangements we put to the Opposition regarding the taking of the Bill, I do not think we can be accused of acting with undue haste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Opposition wish to have the Bill commenced on Tuesday rather than today defies logic and I would remind the House once again that we asked for the commencement of Second Stage and said we would wait until Thursday evening to consider how the Second Stage debate was progressing and that, if necessary, we would order it to be resumed next week.  We did this so that everybody here would have a right to speak and express their opinions on the Bill.  I wish to refute the allegation that is being heard generally that we are endeavouring to guillotine the Bill and to <Col N="2346" /> deprive people of their right to speak on it.  We did not have at any time any such intention.  I trust that those who are considering whether the Bill should be moved today with Second Stage being ordered for tomorrow will recognise that we have endeavoured to be considerate towards the Opposition and to allow them plenty of time to examine the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which this budget was introduced to the House was unprecedented.  Quite clearly the Government have carried out a series of discussions and negotiations since major features of the budget were presented to the House.  The fact that this has been done clearly indicates to the public at large that the Government had not a clear and decided opinion as to what was best at the time the Minister for Finance made his speech.  It is also clear that in proceeding to have negotiations and to alter major financial features of the budget, which alter the arithmetic of that budget, they are setting a precedent by which pressure and pressure groups can at any time after the introduction of a budget alter the course or direction that the Government propose to take in that budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is tragic that two very important areas and two very important bodies of people central to that budget were not consulted and the necessary negotiations and conclusions to those negotiations finalised before presentation of the budget to the Dáil.  There have been a series of meetings with the builders and construction industry people.  As a result a decision has been taken since the introduction of the budget to defer increased VAT rates on the building industry.  This is in the opinion of reasonable and concerned people a very serious departure. Certainly, it is welcomed.  The decision to defer increased VAT charges is one that should have been considered and recognised as desirable and important in the first instance, having regard to the fact that many contracts were entered into and many conditions had been decided upon by builders in relation to contracts and engagements that were in existence at the time of the introduction <Col N="2352" /> of the budget and the particular provision within it.</P>
    <P>Of course, the increase in VAT on the building and construction industry has levelled another devastating blow at an already crushed industry.  I cannot see, for the life of me, nor can 10,000 others, how this country is expected to make any recovery from its present serious financial plight.  One of the major economic growth areas of our economy is devastated by taxation.  We have witnessed prior to the budget, and had a recognition in the budget of what crucifying taxes have done to other industries.  Nonetheless we proceed once again to impose a brutal tax on a vital industry to the extent that any prospect of recovery has been destroyed.  We have learned nothing about the crushing effects of taxation on tourism are unable to reinvest in it.  This age tourism and the people engaged in tourism are unable to re-invest in it.  This has resulted in major losses and the closure of hotels.  Having witnessed that situation develop in the tourist industry it is extraordinary that we failed to recognise the impact that extra taxation would have in an already penal situation.</P>
    <P>Last night we had the welcome announcement that building society rates for borrowers will not be increased to the extent originally thought.  However, the increase allowed is a horrendous blow to mortgage holders at a time when everybody recognises the difficulties that many people are having in making their repayments. For many months throughout last year building society representatives were heard on radio and television acknowledging the problem that was developing for mortgage holders and suggesting that mortgage holders should call to the building society offices and discuss any difficulties they envisaged.  The building societies, by this clear decisive action recognised the problem; they recognised the effects of the recession, job losses and the rise in the cost of living for mortgage holders.  Mortgage holders are deva-stated by this 1¼ per cent increase and by the total abandonment of social consideration in the budget for mortgage holders. It is well known that Irish people place a <Col N="2353" /> huge value on the possession of their own homes and in the light of that knowledge I would have thought that we would not proceed down this road.</P>
    <P>The budget has failed to take account of the necessity to create productive jobs. The budget with its tax measures has seriously damaged job prospects in areas that could have given hope to the unemployed. Because of the increase in VAT rates and extraordinary charge has been added to the cost of housebuilding by local authorities, to the cost of road construction, road repairs and road maintenance. These are labour intensive areas and work in those areas should be intensified so that our roads network will not collapse.  It is widely recognised that the restoration of roads, particularly country roads which are mainly financed by local authorities through rates, will suffer seriously because of additional VAT charges.  The budget has failed to recognise that the building industry offers wide scope for jobs creation.  The development of infrastructure such as water and sewerage facilities, amenities for tourism and so on have been seriously affected by what I can only describe as a penal taxation.</P>
    <P>The budget does not recognise the crisis in Dublin, a city that is badly planned, seriously over-populated, a city that has found itself in an irretrievable position in relation to crime, a city that needs vast injections of finance to meet the minimum housing requirements, a city that has transport problems, a city that will stagnate unless serious policies are formulated and pursued.  There was a great opportunity for the Minister for Finance and Government to acknowledge that a contributory factor to the social and economic crises that exist in Dublin as well as in other towns and cities could have been stabilised if regional policies were pursued in order to attempt to return the many thousands of men and women to the other provinces, particulary the west from which many people migrated to the east coast during the years.  Now they find themselves without houses or jobs, victims of the many social <Col N="2354" /> ills that best this city and the unwitting cause of those social ills.</P>
    <P>There has been a lack of any regional policy and of recognition by this Government of how tragically the west has suffered during the years.  This suffering has denuded the west of its population which, in turn, has transferred their problem to the east coast.  In Dublin now they are worse off than they were originally and their position is irretrievable.  Massive investment of Government finances is necessary and if the Government are borrowing anyway let them do so for productive purposes and ensure that places like the west will attract back those who left during the years.</P>
    <P>With the type of proper productive investment I am speaking about we could stabilise the drift eastwards and even attract many thousands back to their home countries.  There are roads to be built, water and sewerage schemes to be completed and tourism is crying out for investment.  Because of taxation we see hotels lying almost derelict.  Because of lack of finance their owners have been unable to be competitive and to make their facilities attractive.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider the job creation element in food production and processing.  We all know the tragic figures of an agricultural country importing almost 70 per cent of what we eat and juxtapose that with the vast quantities of undivided good land lying idle because the Land Commission are no longer pursuing a policy of acquisition and division. The State is paying enormous amounts of money for the importation of food used in our institutions such as prisons, hospitals and educational institutions.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government, recognising the need for new jobs can stand by and see vast areas of land lying unused because of bad recent decisions. I do not understand why the Government do not appreciate that and try to accommodate even on an interim basis the people now without work.  At least it would give our people the right and the dignity attached to productive employment and at the same time we would do much to improve the economy <Col N="2355" /> of the State.  Anything is better than the dole system and the tragic psychological effects and domestic problems it presents for our people, individuals and families. The economic plight of homes throughout Ireland, is incidentally, one of the most serious threats to marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>It is hard to imagine that a Government which recognised in some small way the desirability to move from their original policy have not been able to provide productive gainful employment which would attract back to their home counties many of the people now living in Dublin who, through no fault of their own, are contribution to the dire social problems in this city.  They came here in pursuit of jobs and if these were now provided in their native environment they would gladly return there.</P>
    <P>In my constituency £25 million of taxpayers' money lies in a bog in Ballyforan at a time when commitment and sound judgment indicate that there is productive work there for at least 400 people in the manufacture of beat briquettes. Last week and for a number of weeks it was impossible to purchase peat briquettes anywhere in Ireland.  Reclamation work was carried out there in a vast area of bogland which originally had been intended for afforestation.  As many as 16,000 young trees were removed to make way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I must emphasise that the budget takes no account whatsoever of the fact that serious job losses will occur in many areas which were already badly off.  It is only right that I should <Col N="2356" /> emphasise the fact that the Minister for Finance and the Government in regard to this budget could have taken U-turns in other respects as well had they the courage to recognise that through sound Government management there are ways and means of creating jobs and better job opportunities.  Having spent so much already the failure of the Government to proceed with the Ballyforan project is a clear demonstration of their negative, foolhardy policy in regard to the development of job opportunities.</P>
      <P>In regard to our housing stock perhaps I could revert to local authorities for a moment.  I cannot understand why the Government in this budget did not take account of the fact that local authorities have highly skilled administrative, technical staff &mdash; a sound structure capable of providing enormous job opportunities in the restoration and improvement of houses in our cities, towns and villages, not alone ensuring productive employment but restoring our housing stock, which is so badly needed.  This would also have provided a means of training, in co-operation with other State agencies, giving, at the same time, an opportunity for the development of skills and employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>We now know our difficulties; they have been identified.  At this late stage the Government must recognise the truth, take their courage in their hands and proceed with corrective policies regardless of the political cost to themselves in the short-term.</P>

      <P>It was commonplace for political commentators in the sixties, when our economy was expanding very rapidly, when after the introduction of large scale indirect taxation Government revenue was increasing very rapidly and, in consequence, Government budgets could be expansive and generous to pity the Opposition spokesman.  In those days for a long period, it was Deputy T.F. O'Higgins on our side, now a member of the European Court after a distinguished career as Chief Justice.  It was the commonplace thing to say: &ldquo;What a job the Fine Gael spokesman has, faced with a <Col N="2357" /> budget which is relatively mild&rdquo;&mdash; because the continuing expansion of the economy, like all other economies in the sixties, permits it.  It was contended that the most he could do was to bleat about what the Government were doing as being &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo;.  That must have been monotonous enough.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of one or other of these Houses for nearly 16 years now. I have been a Member of this House for just 12.  I have been here in particular since the first oil crisis struck.  Since then the pattern of budget and general economic debate in the House has been somewhat different.  It has not been the case that a Government in power for a long period &mdash; and reaping the benefits of a world boom under a rising tide which in the late Seán Lemass's phrase &ldquo;raised all boats&rdquo;&mdash; have been able to produce mild budget after mild budget, being able to spread happiness and sweetness all round.  That has not been the case. Neither has it been the case since 1972, even before the oil crisis &mdash; when the State observed the simple maxims of housekeeping which were taken as axiomatic in the days of William T. Cosgrave, Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass, the idea that one must not spend more than one earned, that revenue must not fall below what one paid in current expenditure. Those days also disappeared in the seventies.  Since then we have seen our economy, like many other Western economies, in difficulties, originally because of the oil crisis and the extravagant reckless borrowing this State undertook, perhaps unavoidably as it reeled under the first impact of the oil crisis but then afterwards, unfortunately, towards the end of the seventies, for pure political reasons. It has not been the case that Governments since then have been able to hand out much sweetness and light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Budget debates have developed a somewhat different character.  They have now developed a certain stale routine, a certain dreary, predictable monotony, whatever side is in Government or whatever side is out of Government.  Everybody who has been in the House as I have been for 12 years &mdash; and, in your own <Col N="2358" /> case, Sir, a good deal longer, and many other Deputies longer also, who form part of a diminishing minority of membership of the House &mdash; listening to budget debates here despite four or five changes of Government over the last 12 years, must have noticed this awful, predictable, routine ritual exchange of abuse and recrimination between the two sides. It is reminiscent of the blows exchanged by seaside Punch and Judy figures in those old fashioned booths on the sands when I was a child, during which time, of course, the tide came in and went out according to its predestined course regardless of them.  Without taking partisan sides one could transpose the names on Budget Statements here over the past 12 years as between the Minister who presented them and the Opposition Member who replied.  It would take some ingenuity some historical understanding and knowledge indeed, it would be quite hard to spot who belonged to which party.</P>
    <P>One thing which characterises Opposition performances &mdash; and the budget debate of this year has been no exception &mdash; is the wisdom, the certainty, the scorn they show towards the efforts of the Government facing them across the floor of the House, the confident stridency with which they predict that as soon as they can get the leavers of power everything will change for the better.  I am not going to do what I have sometimes fallen into doing, go through Fianna Fáil speeches.  I must say I have become somewhat weary of that, particularly in the budgetary context.  I will just give as one single example of the kind of thing I am talking about, something which Deputy Haughey said in his budget speech last week &mdash; and I do not purport to quote him verbatim; everybody in the country, he said, outside this monetarist, book-keeping-crazed Government knows exactly what should be done with the economy.  That is a very proud thing to say.  But it does not differ in essence from what Opposition spokesmen on all sides have said down the years since I have been here at least.  Surely we have sufficient <Col N="2359" /> experience behind us to get away from that form of debate?</P>
    <P>Let us examine even Deputy Haughey's own record.  I am going to go through that now in a dispassionate way because I do not want it to appear that I am going back on what I said a moment ago and suddenly going to concentrate on attacking the other side instead.  When Deputy Haughey became Taoiseach at the end of 1979 inflation stood at 15.9 per cent, unemployment at 98,000, which was thought be to be a terrible figure, and the current budget deficit at 521 million. When he left office in the summer of 1981 inflation had risen to 20.1 per cent, the deficit, as it turned out at the year's end, was £819 million despite the efforts that the Government that you and I, Sir, had the honour to work in made to rein it in, almost 60 per cent wide of the target. Unemployment, despite the favourable seasonal factor and the massive public sector recruitment, was virtually unchanged, whereas on the projections which Deputy O'Donoghue's 1977 election manifesto had contained it should have been eliminated altogether.  There should have been a labour shortage in this country by that date, instead of the unemployment figures remaining unchanged.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey returned to office in early 1982 inflation stood at 18.7 per cent &mdash; slightly improved as a result of the efforts of the Government in which you and I, Sir, had worked &mdash; unemployment stood at 126,000 and the deficit budget was £678 million.  The result of the efforts of himself and his party when they left at the end of the year was that, while inflation had continued to fall and had then reached 12 per cent, unemployment had risen again to 133,000.  The actual 1982 deficit turned out to be almost £1,000 million, or almost 50 per cent wide of the target.</P>
    <P>In case the Deputy opposite thinks I will not acknowledge failures on our own side, I admit that, despite a very rapid improvement in the inflation rate since the present national Coalition came into office at the end of 1982, unemployment has continued to climb steeply.  The <Col N="2360" /> inroads made on the deficit and the associated borrowing requirement, in spite of the most politically painful economies, in spite of economies which undoubtedly have cost the Government thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of votes, such as the abolition of 50 per cent of food subsidies, despite these gruesomely painful, in the political sense, economies, paring off a couple of million pounds here and another £10 million there, the overall impact on the deficit on the borrowing requirement has been disappointing.  It has been very disappointing when measured against my party's initial hopes of eliminating it altogether.</P>
    <P>Looking at these facts dispassionately and without partisan bias &mdash; and I hope Deputy Fitzgerald will be able to acknowledge that I have done that when I have finished &mdash; one is driven to the conclusion, or at any rate to the suspicion, that we are making a mistake in attributing that much importance to the budgetary instrument, that most of the problems we have of high unemployment, high taxation, the unstable currency and trade situation are probably outside the reach of the budgetary instrument altogether.  Instead of this annual set piece, as I said before like one of those ritual Japanese battles in which people buffet one another with padded swords, perhaps we should stop assuming that the budget can do very much to change the economic difficulties we find ourselves in, and have been in chronically, and look at some of the underlying factors which are irremovable and unarguable and, whether it is a Fianna Fáil speaker or a Fine Gael speaker addressing the House, will be there when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have passed away if something is not done to change them.  If the two parties disappeared from existence tomorrow morning they would still be there.</P>
    <P>These factors are something like a sub-soil which would require a governmental form of deep ploughing to reach, and which the budgetary instrument cannot reach.  Juggling with taxation, with incentives and with little bits of investment <Col N="2361" /> here and disinvestment there, and subsidies here and little grants-in-aid there, no matter how cleverly organised, can do no more than worry the scraw off the soil. It will scrape the scraw off the top, but the main problems we have lie buried, like large hunks of bogwood which wreck machinery, six feet or eight feet below where that instrument is capable of reaching.</P>
    <P>If we could face up to the fact that the budgetary instrument and all instruments which have been used conventionally by Governments are not capable, no matter how cleverly operated, of reaching down that far, we might begin to get somewhere. If we could look dispassionately at what has passed here for economic debate for the past 12 years and recognise that no party have really succeeded in making things much better and very often &mdash; and I am sorry to strike this partisan note now but I honestly believe it &mdash; as in the case of the 1977 Government have made things a great deal worse by reckless spending at a time when the economy was improving anyway, we might begin to get somewhere and Governments, of whatever colour, might finally come up against the necessity to invent new mechanisms, to devise new forms of control, new forms of encouragement, to mobilise new allies for themselves and not to depend simply on the cleverality of the transference of a few million pounds here and there through taxation, or social welfare benefits, or subsidies, or State investment.</P>
    <P>These fundamental bogwood factors, if I may so call them, which lie far below the reach of an ordinary budgetary plough, are not new.  I have not invented them, or thought them up.  They are familiar to anybody who listens to what economists and business people say.  Some of them are intractable in the sense that nothing can be done about them.  We just have to live with them.  Others are not so intractable.</P>
    <P>A well-known one is that we have a substantially higher ratio of people in dependent age groups than any other EC country and, in particular, we have a very much higher proportion of very young <Col N="2362" /> people below working or production age, people aged less than 14 years.  Our proportion of the population in that age group is 50 per cent greater than the EC average.  If we were to exclude a couple of the other countries in which children are fairly numerous like Italy, the difference between ourselves and the others would be far greater.  If we were to compare ourselves not with the EC average but with the northern European average &mdash; in other words, the average in countries with similar climatic and other conditions to ourselves&mdash;the disparity would be far greater.</P>
    <P>That implies a huge burden on the economy which cannot be disposed of. We cannot get out from under it.  That implies a huge extra burden on our economy in regard to health expenditure and education expenditure in particular, both for people who are very young and for people who are older than the working age group.  We have to carry that huge disproportionate burden in the European sense although we are, in fact, almost the weakest, and if we are to exclude Greece certainly the weakest, of all the European economies.  That is a rock bottom fact which no amount of political rhetoric or budgetary juggling can get away from.  I do not see any way of getting away from it.  That is a fact we have to live with. That makes it the more urgent for us to see whether we can countervail that fact and neutralise the disadvantages which it contains for us by doing something more radical on other fronts also in the bogwood category.</P>
    <P>We have a public service which is as numerously manned and in general as well equipped, heated, housed and supplied with expenses and plant of all kinds as our partner countries.  I know there are sections of the public service which are ill-housed in draughty old offices. Some of the people who work in our police force are in poorly equipped, rundown stations and sections of the Army are in barracks which are nearly 200 years old, and so forth.  But, by and large, the people who work under the Irish State flag and who draw their salaries at one or two removes from the State are as well <Col N="2363" /> equipped and as well looked after and as well paid as their European equivalents, and better than some.</P>
    <P>Although I spend much of my time criticisng public service numbers, if we were to examine it in numbers alone it is not an extravagantly large public service for our population compared with other EC states.  That has to be admitted.  The point about the the public service is that, indispensable though its functions are, it does not produce wealth.  It simply consumes the wealth others have to produce. If we relate public service numbers to the resources available to pay for them, with the exception of Greece, Ireland carries far the heaviest burden with far the lowest figure of gross domestic product available to support each member of the service.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Greeks have what seems to me a grossly inflated public service.  I would not wish to speculate about that.  It would be an impertinence if I were to do so.  If we exclude Greece, we have far fewer dollars or ECUs or pounds &mdash; I do not care which unit is chosen &mdash; in gross domestic product to sustain each member of our public service than any other European state.  The Netherlands have about one-third more of gross domestic product per public servant they must carry than we have.  The French have about 50 per cent more gross domestic product for each public servant they have to carry than we have.  The Germans have almost twice as much gross domestic product for each public servant they have to carry.  These facts suggest the imperative necessity of trying to get the same value out of a smaller number of public servants by way of better office methods, better organisation or better management of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The public service position here is complicated by the fact that although we are a very small State in numbers and in wealth &mdash; the smallest in numbers in the EC, except for Luxembourg, and the smallest in wealth on many indexes &mdash; we have the diseconomy of carrying the entire panoply of a modern State.  No <Col N="2364" /> one, I hope, will misunderstand me when I say that.  I am not suggesting that we should shed any of the duties which having an independent State entails.  I am not suggesting that we should do what the Luxembourgers do and let the country next door manage some of our foreign affairs or other aspects of our administration. I am proud to have this chance of running a State of our own; but it is only fair to point out that this is another of these bogwood factors.  We have a very heavy diseconomy in that we have to run a complete defence establishment, and a complete diplomatic establishment, we have to meet the cost of things like State visits, the Presidency of the EC, travel around the world for public servants and so on.  These costs fall just as heavily on us as they do on the Germans.  That is a burden which it behoves us to try to counteract by more Scrooge-like management in the public service than we ever got around to.</P>
    <P>I read figures in an article recently about the amount of money spent by office holders on journeys around the world.  I have a certain sympathy with that kind of criticism because in my view office holders do far too much travelling. In some cases I cannot believe their duties could have involved these journeys.  I felt the same about Fianna Fáil Ministers. Many office holders are accompanied by an entourage wherever they travel.  When Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach he went to the United Nations to make a speech on how Northern Ireland was a failed political entity &mdash; I have forgotten what the theme was but no doubt it was one of his few themes which are well worn and wrong &mdash; and he had an entourage of 12 persons, a cavalcade.  Where was the need for that?</P>
    <P>We all love a trip abroad.  I have had many a free trip and I would not pretend that I did not enjoy them.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, whose frankness I admire above nearly any of his other qualities replied devestatingly here last year when somebody accused him of having missed a food fair in Munich, &ldquo;Do you really think I would rather be here than in Munich?&rdquo; I admire <Col N="2365" /> that kind of frankness.  I like a trip abroad as much as anyone, and if I do not have to pay for it so much the better, but these trips abroad and the accompanying entourages of civil servants are over done.  I said that when I was in office, and I say it out of office.  I give this as an example because questions are always being asked about the relatively up-market way our public arrangements are conducted.  That is a built-in diseconomy and we have to see if we can do anything about it.  Public service numbers are part of it but the way the public service do their business, or are even encouraged by office holders to do their business, shows very bad example.</P>
    <P>We have a population whose rate of increase is extravagently out of line with the general EC picture, again an intractable problem.  I have no suggestions to make about this.  Irish people like big families.  I have five children which by continental standards is an insanely large family.  I make no complaint about this, and I have no suggestions to make about it.  That is an intractable factor which is equally outside the reach of a budgetary instrument.  Between 1973 and 1982 the overall EC population increased by 2 per cent; but the Irish population increased by 13 per cent.  That implies a constant influx into the lower age group cohort with the consequence that if that rate of increase continues, the proportion of the population below 25 years, or any other young age, keeps growing, with increased pressures on the educational and social services and increased pressure on the jobs supply.  These are relatively intractable rock-bottom, bogwood factors which a budget like ours cannot do anything about.</P>
    <P>Some of the things which I hear mentioned as advantages are hidden disadvantages. Only a few minutes ago I heard Deputy Doherty speak about the state of the county roads.  We all know roads are a necessary part of the infrastructure, but there are limits to that proposition.  For historical reasons Ireland has the largest length of metalled roads per 1,000 acres, or any unit you like to take, in Europe; and that means in the world because I do <Col N="2366" /> not think there is any country outside Europe which could come into this category. During the last century local authorities got involved in road building as a form of relief but these roads have to be maintained.  Anyone who travels by train or car in Europe will see that the road network there, although perfectly adequate according to their standards, is in no way inhibiting their development of a fine transport infrastructure, but it is nothing as elaborate as ours.  There are little link roads in Ireland leading basically from nowhere to nowhere which have to be maintained and if they are not, the scattering of people who live near them feel they are being ill-governed.  I am not recommending that any road should be let go back to grass; but this feature which we think of as an advantage is not necessarily so.  Quite likely a smaller length roadway but a better planned and maintained roadway would be far better.</P>
    <P>These factors, some of them fundamental and others more marginal which I would not have thought of mentioning, for example, the roads, co-exist with a number of other features of our economy which far from tending to alleviate their impact makes them that much harder to overcome.</P>
    <P>I have been hearing since childhood that our greatest asset is our land.  Most people either in the human scale or in the scale of their own talents, are brought up to make the most of their assets.  You put your best foot forward, you lead with your strongest card, but if land is really our greatest asset then God help our other assets.</P>
    <P>This is the situation with our greatest asset.  The value of our agricultural production per hectare of land in use is little more than one-quarter of the value produced per hectare in Denmark.  I mention Denmark because since childhood traditionally, because of the climate, because of the nature of the soil and certain geographical disadvantages and because of the size of the population, it was looked at as the country most nearly comparable with us in terms of agricultural potential. The Dutch are even further out of sight. They have hardly more than one-third of <Col N="2367" /> land in agricultural use that we have but they achieve a production nearly four times the value of ours.  Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa are not here and would not be interested even if they were here, but let us pretend they are here.  I would like to emphasise for Deputies like them that that degree of development and achievement was reached by the Dutch and the Danes without State intervention.  Those patterns existed when State intervention were bad words in those countries.  In Denmark, if I understand correctly, it was achieved very largely by a co-operative effort and, to some extent, the same applied in Holland even though the co-operative effort there was not as developed as in Denmark. It was not the State which raised agricultural production in those countries, it was their own farmers, their sweat, planning and seriousness.</P>
    <P>Something like that could be said about the associated food industry here.  Since I was a student I am sick and tired of hearing about the need for Irish agriculture to concentrate more on high labour-intensive things like vegatables and fruit. Not all vegetables or fruit do well here and obviously there will be times of the year when some items have to be imported.  I am sick hearing about standards in vegetable production and of reading articles every year about dirty bags of crudely packed, diseased potatoes with half the field stuck to them.  Is it the Government's job to wash and grade potatoes?  Are the Government supposed to invest money in telling people what their common sense should tell them needs to be done if they are to compete successfully with something which they can see with their own eyes in the shops? Have we to do that as well as maintaining sexual morality?  That feature is not accessible to a budgetary instrument; it is accessible only to the serious combined efforts of the industry and of the people who work in it and depend on it.  To thrust the responsibility of that on the Government is the sign of a diseased industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> Irish industrial productivity has, undoubtedly, improved over the years but is still far behind the European norm and the problems associated with industrial relations are compounded by an insane proliferation of trade unions which often compete for members by outdoing one another in militancy.  That was recognised by the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; for which I honour them &mdash; as long ago as 1941 after a prolonged dock strike here in the middle of the war which looked like leaving a country which was badly supplied anyway likely to grind to a halt. Mr. McEntee who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce because Mr. Lemass was in charge of the Department of Supplies at the time introduced a Trade Union Bill which had the object of limiting trade unions &mdash; I am speaking roughly &mdash; to one per trade.  The trade unions did not like this and challenged it in the courts.  It was shot down by the Supreme Court in 1945 in what, speaking as a lawyer and not as a politician, I say was one of the feeblest and most poorly argued judgments which the Supreme Court ever delivered.  Anyone who is interested can examine it and compare it with the very fine judgment given in the High Court by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy which was over-ruled.  The case to which I refer is the <i>National Union of Railwaymen v Sullivan</i> which is reported in the 1947 <i>Irish Reports</i>.</P>
    <P>No effort was subsequently made to regulate the proliferation of trade unions. It is natural for people to compete and if there are two trade unions to a trade of course they will compete for members.  I do not blame trade unionists for not being more than flesh and blood.  I would do the same myself if I was in their business. However, when the public interest visibly suffers there is a case for the interests of the people to prevail over what might otherwise be a completely acceptable freedom of association for anybody to form as many unions as he liked when and where he liked.</P>
    <P>The picture in industry here, particularly in an era of closing industries, is bad enough without us getting into the business of masking unfortunate realities. <Col N="2369" /> I wish to refer to an article in <i>Industry &amp; Commerce</i> for January 1985 by Deputy Flynn regarding the closure of Travenol in Castlebar.  I do not expect 100 per cent frankness or ingenuity on this or any other matter from Deputy Flynn, who is a well-known Haughey freak.  It is too much to expect dispassionate, or self critical, analysis of anything from that quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I admit that Deputy Flynn's article is not over-contentious or over-partisan, it reads as follows:</P>
      <P>What influence such things as unit cost of production, productivity levels, wastage levels, energy costs, transport costs, labour relations, absenteeism levels, etc., had in the formation of the decision is difficult to quantify but one thing is certain &mdash; sentiment for job protection in Ireland played no part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the name of God when did sentiment for job protection play a part with any industrialist, Irish or foreign?  One does not expect sentiment for job protection from an industrialist, any more than one expects sentiment from a tiger for a lamb. That is not meant to be insulting to industrialists &mdash; they are in the business of industry and they want to maximise their own and their shareholders' profits.  They want to do business and the whole point about encouraging industrialists is not because we are under any illusions about their motives in setting up here but that benefits necessarily must flow from their activities in terms of employment and revenue buoyancy.  You do not expect <Col N="2370" /> the bees to flit their little lives away and fly their little wings to rags to put a pot of honey on your breakfast table.  They do not do that out of altruism.  But those who keep bees know if you house them warmly and feed them a certain amount of sugar, or whatever else they live on, they will produce a huge excess of what they need to keep going, and the rest of us can live from the excess.  That is what industrial development is all about.  I do not want to make too much issue of this because Deputy Flynn does not do so either but to insinuate that sentiment for job protection should have countervailed all these other factors, which he does not want to quantify, is insane.  That, unfortunately, is &mdash; I do not want to use a word which will bring the Chair down on me again &mdash; the kind of approach to the world which is peculiarly characteristic of one wing of the party to which Deputy Fitzgerald belongs.  Although he may disclaim such a compliment from me, I do not believe he belongs to that wing himself, at any rate, in this sense.</P>
    <P>I know very little about the closure of Travenol but I know that absenteeism was a major feature of the operations of that plant.  I also heard &mdash; if I am wrong about this I will withdraw it willingly because I do not want to say anything offensive, least of all to people in the county from which I am half descended &mdash; that when that plant was trying to slim down its workforce some time before it closed and asked for 50 voluntary redundancies, they got 300 applications.  That is the sort of thing we want to know about.  Why are the Government supposed to run around the country wiping up milk which the people have deliberately spilled?</P>
    <P>The terrible industrial history of Cork city and surroundings in the last couple of years &mdash; although I am going by shreds of rumour and hearsay &mdash; was in some cases heavily contributed to by the workforce themselves who for the sake of getting their hands in some cases on large sums of redundancy co-operated and collaborated in the closing down of their own factories.  No Government could deal with a population that works that <Col N="2371" /> way.  Neither can the IDA countervail such a thing when it happens.  I do not wish to make any more specific allegations because I do not have the detailed knowledge to do it, but the rumours and scraps of information that one picks up at a distance, which may be wrong and unjust &mdash; and if they are I will withdraw them &mdash; suggest that there is a large degree of substance in a proposal which was made about ten days ago in a column where such things are extremely rare.  It was in a column which John Healy writes in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I do not see much to agree with as regards the general trend of his political beliefs &mdash; although these are very erratic; he could, for equally little reason, be on your side in another few weeks &mdash; but there was a lot of merit in a proposal which he made very much off the top of his head.  It was an inspired proposal, and is something that is not often done by a political columnist.  I have reason to find fault with a lot of what he writes but I acknowledge this proposal.</P>
    <P>He suggested that instead of rows in the Daíl and occasional sworn inquiries being set up there should be a permanent inquiring authority to investigate every closure which is not a straightforward decision by management to close &mdash; for example, if the owners are getting too old and there is nobody else to take over the business.  It should be in permanent session, and would perform much the same function as is performed by a doctor who is not immediately able to give a death certificate stating that his patient who was suffering from cancer or whatever died from natural causes.</P>
    <P>It is an excellent idea and we should have such an authority.  It should publish its findings.  There should not be a panoply of solicitors or counsel.  I am talking about a simple mobile inquest, so to speak, which would go around the country and come to conclusions rapidly about the features which contributed to a closure. If it identifies features in the workforce or management which contributed to the closure it should say so.  It would leave us with more knowledge about what is responsible for industrial decline.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> In his article Deputy Flynn stated:</P>
    <P>To provide a proper environment which will continue to attract prestigious foreign investment, the Government have to face up to the level of essential industrial costs.  We are out of line with our competitors in the cost areas of energy, transport and communications. Our interest rates and personal taxation rates are an active disincentive.  These matters are Government controlled.  It is futile for the Government to be preaching competitiveness to the private industrial sector when it is not contributing by an enlightened and realistic basic costs policy.</P>
    <P>Those words could have been penned by the director of the Confederation of Irish Industry during the tenure of any Government over the last 12 years.  These points could have been made with the same degree of validity about any Fianna Fáil Government since I entered politics. We all know this.  What I am protesting about is the impression which this article reinforces: that the Government somehow have a lever in their hand, not only to induce a fit of altruism in an industrialist, but to introduce budgetary mechanisms to give industry, apart from any other considerations, a road to success which would otherwise be denied it.  That is simply not true.  Even if the Government had stood on their head they could not have changed the facts about Travenol or the Cork closures.</P>
    <P>Politicians are not doing any service to the people they serve by concealing these facts.  It is disagreable to say these things or to make allegations about management or the workforce being in large part to blame for the position they are in.</P>
    <P>But people are paid salaries in politics to say things which are disagreeable when necessary.  If we went through life plámásing everyone we would not be worth the money we are paid.</P>
    <P>The Irish are fatally isolated by geography and tradition from the knowledge and influence of any part of the world which is not England.  We have a fair <Col N="2373" /> enough knowledge of England and English standards, which are not all that great.  The English economy, but for the fact that they have a great deal of oil, would be in a desperate condition.  That isolation deprives us of an understanding of what the rest of the world takes as normal as regards standards of quality, performance, work, punctuality, marketing expertise and so on.  We do not have a clue about these things, not because we are less intelligent or more ignorant but because we are isolated and have done nothing to counteract that.  A dejected party of Irish food producers came back from the Food Fair last year which Deputy Deasy would have preferred to have been at had he been able.  They said in dismay, having had a look at the Irish products on display there, that &ldquo;we had not even arrived at the fair&rdquo;.  They had at last got an insight into the kind of things which foreign agricultural sectors take for granted and are anxious to explore every day in terms of what the market wants and would buy.  I do not want to appear to belittle something with a single phrase which is always the danger when one puts something in graphic form.  It is a doorstep I am always tripping over; but effectively, the Irish food industry's difficulty could be condensed into the following proposition: they are only interested in producing hunks of cheddar in plastic corsets, and hawking them pathetically around the world, while the rest of the world are selling delicacies which presumably could be produced here but which nobody has got around to investigate the market for or costs behind.  Everything I have said &mdash; I may have said it in more ignorant form but I hope not offensive form &mdash; has been said before.  The Minister who is present, with the bluntness which I said before he came in was the characteristic I most admire about him, has said it several times.</P>
    <P>We are shut off from acquaintance with these standards, with what our competitors can deliver and what our potential markets can expect.  We are unable to communicate linguistically with most of them.  We are a blindfolded economy grouping around in a world-sized game <Col N="2374" /> hoping that by luck, we may grab something. Now and again we have a bit of luck.  A sector is grabbed here or there by dint of devoted operations by isolated industrialists, or by the very thinly spread resources of CTT.  These problems require a radical reorganisation of Government policies which will get away from the idea that we can do everything with a budget.</P>
    <P>We will have to put the spade right down into the soil and grapple with the educational training our young people get.  If they are literate in English and half literate in Irish they are lucky.  Most of them have no ability to communicate with anyone outside of the English speaking world.  Some of them do not have even a well developed ability to communicate with those inside it.  Any mention that they might go away for a few years to work and learn something about the outside world is greeted with: &ldquo;That is Deputy Kelly's solution again &mdash; the emigrant ship&rdquo;.  If I was to leave politics this minute that is the misrepresentation I would complain about most.  I have been a victim of it for the past three or four years but I will keep on saying it. Any Irish person who can get the chance to go away for a few years should do so for his own sake, not just to take the load off the dole-queue but for his own sake.</P>
    <P>Go around the captains of Irish industry such as they are &mdash; lance-corporals though they may appear in the world's industrial army &mdash; and see how many of them have spent their entire careers at home.  The answer is not one of them.  Every single one of them has spent instructional formative years abroad.  Instead of encouraging the old granny attitudes of &ldquo;Wisha, take care, do not stray outside the door or you might catch a chill&rdquo; or &ldquo;Take care not to go beyond the end of the boreen or the bogeyman may get you&rdquo; or &ldquo;Take care not to go as far as Belgium or the púca might fly away with you&rdquo;, we should be encouraging our young people to go away.  Naturally there is the danger they may decide to stay away.  If a man marries a foreign wife and wishes to stay abroad that is tough on the parents, but it is his <Col N="2375" /> life.  It is wicked of Irish politicians to keep up this fetish about the emigrant ship; it is wicked to keep whinging about someone who has to fly for one hour and a half to Frankfurt and who earns very good money in Germany.  That person may come back in three or four years with expertise, and knowledge about the world that he would never get at home. It is wicked for politicians to act as though they were at a Queenstown wake.  I will keep on saying this until I resign or lose my seat here.</P>
    <P>I have got two grown-up sons, one of whom is in America doing a university graduate course and I have to take a chance that he may decide to stay there. I do not want him to do that, as I should like him to come home, but it is his life; I think he intends to come home, but it is is his decision.  I have seen fathers weeping at the wedding of their daughter, but I have seen other fathers when their daughters did not marry.  The world is not all about protecting the emotions of parents.  We should try to give a better chance to the generation who follow us.  I am not trying to parcel up the population and send them on the emigrant ship but I am saying that one of the things we need more than anything would be for every member of the population to get first-hand knowledge of the outside world, although I accept that target is unreachable.  Every citizen should have the opportunity to bring up his standards materially to what the outside world expects because we depend on that world.  The attitude that the Government should put a factory at the end of every boreen so that the children can come home for tea is childish.  No country would attempt to do that.</P>
    <P>The Greeks and the Italians are as proud as us, they are as old a people as we are and there is absolutely nothing we can teach them.  They do not think it shameful or a failure on the part of their Governments when their children go to the northern part of Europe where work is more plentiful and better paid.  Their Governments do not whinge and whine about the emigrant ship.  It is wicked of <Col N="2376" /> politicians to behave like that and it is wicked of people outside politics and of teachers to back them up on that.  Parents have to be forgiven because of their natural feelings regarding their children, but anyone who contributes to maintaining this fetish that keeps Irish people inside their own backyard is doing a serious national disservice.</P>
    <P>There are huge markets that linguistically are completely closed to us.  There is an enormous market in Japan and for the four times larger market in China which is only now going to open up.  Think of the opportunities in that enormous country, particularly when they allow an admixture of the business economy into their society.  Think of the opportunities that Africa will offer if it can get itself on its feet.  We must remember that Africa is not all English-speaking: a huge proportion of that continent is French-speaking. There is also the Arab world, the richest region in purchasing power.  We are ignoring all these possibilities.</P>
    <P>We should have some State initiated policy of making sure that a certain proportion of our school leavers are inducted, and if necessary supported with scholarships, into a third level system that will give us a reasonable force of marketing executives capable of selling our goods in the languages of the markets we are trying to reach.  We cannot whinge that the Japanese market is hard to penetrate when the Japanese have had to learn English to understand what we are trying to sell them.  It is not rational for a small country that is so dependent on trade to behave like that.</P>
    <P>I have suggested to a member of the Government that it would be worth while having an institute that would not have any academic potential but would be entirely geared towards the material job of marketing and of having commercial and industrial contacts with the outside world.  Perhaps it could be attached to the NIHE in Glasnevin or in Limerick or to any of the universities.  However, I think it would be better if efforts were not made to pretend that it had a largely academic content.  Such an institute could concentrate on developing a knowledge <Col N="2377" /> of languages that are not taught outside very small university departments.  I see nothing absurd or ridiculous in that.  By such methods 150 years ago the Japanese dragged themselves by their bootstraps into the modern western world that they now dominate.</P>
    <P>The Government will make a serious mistake if they allow whatever kind of local government reform they have in mind to go through without incorporating a new tier in local government.  I am not talking of people doing the kind of functions we have associated with local government up to this but I mean a tier that will be there only at the option and on the initiative of the population of a particular locality.  It could be called a District Development Council or something of that kind.  Such councils would not exist or function within areas predetermined by statute, but it would be open to a population anywhere &mdash; outside the cities where the same possibilities do not exist &mdash; to organise co-operatively and to present a petition based on a proportion of the electoral register.  It would be supported by a subscription to show they were putting their money where their mouth was, unlike the airport development in Mayo up to recently.  The subscription could be, say, £20 or £50 per head for the signatories and it would require the adhesion of a certain percentage &mdash; perhaps 30, 40, or 50 per cent of the people on the electoral register &mdash; who required the formation of such a council, by which time a considerable amount of capital would have been collected. I would envisage that the Government would match that collection pound for pound, but no more.  When that council were established and elected it would have a function that had nothing to do with maintaining roads, running libraries or any of the other services provided by county councils but would have everything to do with assessing soberly the economic performance of that district and seeing how it could be raised at district level, in an area small enough in number so that individual contributions and performance could be acknowledged. <Col N="2378" /> Human spirit thrives on acknowledgement and recognition.  The institute could be supported by a team of advisers living on the spot, drawn according to the economic facets of the neighbourhood. They would be supported by a team of experts, pioneers, drawn from a range of appropriate services now under State control, and quartered in there among the people, not flying up and down by the day or the week, whose job would be to see whether the agricultural production of that region could be improved year by year, to see whether year by year more employment could be given, to exploit, on the ground and under the direction of the people who knew the place best, every possibility in afforestation, fish farming and tourism that the district offered.  That would call on an asset, perhaps the only asset which Irish people have in huge heaping measure compared with other European people, namely, the capacity and instinct for voluntary service.</P>
    <P>I would not envisage that the councillors in a Development District Council would be paid anything, even expenses. They would not go on junkets; but they would be a tier of genuine local government with an economic cutting edge and no other function whatever.  They would be optionally instituted, in no way forced on the people and, therefore, occurring only in a district where the people had enough local leadership and initiative to take themselves in hand and put their money where their mouth was.  It would be up to the Government to co-operate and collaborate with them to do something at a level where individual input would be recognised and understood and individual knowledge exploited, so that there can be an end of looking to Dublin for everything and particularly of expecting that the Government through a budgetary mechanism was suddenly going to put things right.</P>
    <P>I have left myself no time for speaking about the individual budget provisions.  I recognise that the Government have had to mark time somewhat in their efforts to phase out the deficit and to haul down the borrowing requirement.  I said at the <Col N="2379" /> outset that it must be acknowledged that the progress has been disappointing.  On the other hand I recognise, not simply in the electoral sense, that a case was to be made for the sake of national morale for some slight improvements and for giving people a sense that their burdens had to some extent been eased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Kelly's contribution and I would like to refer to a number of points in it.  I must confess to granting myself a certain licence to engage in the flair and articulation which is so much Deputy Kelly's hallmark.  Readily I confess to admiring that aspect and also his frankness and bluntness which are characteristics of him that I find commendable. However, having granted myself that aesthetic licence to be carried away sometimes with these aspects, I must then stand back dispassionately and ask myself whether I am really being objective in my judgment.  It is a very attractive to listen to a person who is articulate, who has a great flair for words and who seems to be analytical and logical in his reasoning and his approach and who seems to be frank, honest and open.  However, one must stand back and ask oneself if this is looking at people, analysing people, a serious, logical, reasoned attempt to get people to work together, to co-operate and to get the country&mdash;which is people&mdash;moving in the direction in which Governments decide.  I acknowledge that Governments must decide, sometimes unfavourably and unpopularly, that the best long term interests as well as the best short term interests of the people are to go down a particular road.  However, when we make decisions, when the mechanisms are being used they must be used as fully and comprehensively as possible in trying to achieve that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made the point that the budget as an instrument is incapable of dealing with our overall complex problems, that it is inadequate.  He chose, for reasons that became clear as he went along, to ignore to a great extent the content of the budget and the features of <Col N="2380" /> the Financial Resolutions passed through the Dáil by the Government of which he is a member in the sense that he is a member of one of the parties in that Government.  He chose to ignore the content of that budget, the resolutions that were passed and the debate that has since ensued, a debate taken up by the Taoiseach, the leader of his party, by the Tánaiste, a party to that Government, and by other Ministers as well as backbenchers on his side of the House.  I find it disappointing that a person of his ability for whom I have respect for the reasons I have outlined &mdash; his bluntness, his flair and his analytical abilities, &mdash; should choose to ignore so fully this instrument and how it was applied in this case by the Government.  It would appear to be a form of escapism, and I would not lightly accuse him of that.  I have listened to him, I read his statements even before I entered politics, but it seems today as I have sat here listening to him and looking through this budget that he has chosen to put it aside and say that he would deal with the real issues.  This budget does not deal with the real issues.</P>
    <P>Budgets in general are incapable of dealing with the real issues in our economy. They are inadequate, therefore we must look for other mechanisms.  Deputy Kelly thinks honestly that that is the situation, but I have a niggling doubt about it because of the let-off it gives.  I believe that he does not believe fully in this budget.  I believe he has serious misgivings about the direction it is taking and about what would seem to be inconsistencies between the 1983, 1984 and 1985 budgets.  That is my interpretation of the direction he has taken in this debate. Another disappointment is that he made no reference to the diversionary tactics used by the Government in relation to the Finance Bill which has come before this House.  I am not saying that we should pin everything on tradition and custom, but traditionally and customarily a budget is brought into the House by the Minister of the day, the resolutions are decided upon, changed, amended or whatever, and then we give an opportunity to everybody in this House to debate, <Col N="2381" /> tease out, analyse and discuss openly within the confines of the House all the implications of the budget, all the instruments, all the advantages or disadvantages as he or she perceives them.  It is a very democratic way to go about our business.  If we were to stifle that debate in any way that would be a very serious blow to democracy.</P>
    <P>I must allow that my years here have been very few, but let me say that, while the kind of system that has been allowed to operate over the years here by way of drawn out debate on Second Stage may not have been ideal, in that perhaps many things were said that were absolutely meaningless, inconsistent and contradictory, perhaps on both sides of the House irrespective of who was on what side, and perhaps a great deal of time could be deemed to have been wasted, in the interests of democracy a very important principle was inherent in the practice adhered to in this House.  That was the principle of permitting every Member elected to this House and representative of a certain section of the people outside the House to come here and make his views known and to allow his views to be judged by others here.  That is a very important principle but I would hope that what we witnessed on the Order of Business today is not an attempt by the Government to obliterate that principle.  In this second week of the budget debate they saw fit to bring before the House today an issue which is not of serious public concern and one that has not been lobbied for.</P>

      <P>I am trying to illustrate the point that we are in the process of a budget debate, that we are dealing with the economic and social problems. That is what the purpose of the budgetary instrument is and I submit that each Deputy should be goven the opportunity of expressing his point of view so that the totality of the consensus can be clearly perceived by people outside the House. The introduction of another measure at a very early stage in this debate would <Col N="2382" /> appear to be a deliberate and calculated attempt to stifle that budget debate.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling. I was glad to hear Deputy Kelly say he is disappointed with the development in the past two to three years in relation to budget management, to current budget deficits and to the servicing of our foreign debts in respect of international and domestic borrowing.  At least we can say that his admission is an indication of the honesty I acknowledged earlier in so far as the Deputy is concerned.  I was somewhat sidetracked on the question of the diversionary tactic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>By myself.  Deputy Kelly has referred to the inadequacy of the budgetary instrument.  I had hoped he would be more forthcoming with ideas that should have been used by the Government to focus on the economic and social problems and on the need for the development of our economy and services, that he would have brought to the attention of the Government prior to their launching of the budget other instruments that could have been brought into play, that he would have indicated <Col N="2383" /> for us, if he is so aware, that there are mechanisms which in the future will deal more adequately with the kinds of complexities and difficulties to which he referred and in respect of which he expressed concern.</P>
      <P>However, no such references were made specifically.  Therefore, I find Deputy Kelly's decision to ignore the content of the budget surprising and, secondly, I must point out to him, to the Government and to anyone else who might be inclined to take that line that in the absence of other mechanisms we must use the budget as the primary instrument to deal with the enormous problems facing us.</P>
      <P>The budget is a disaster primarily because it has little or nothing to offer as solutions to the real ills in the economy. It is clear that the budget was framed deliberately as a piece of political expediency with cynical disregard for the real issues.  The Government are made up of two parties but these two parties, whatever about the reality, are poles apart ideologically.  They were faced with the dilemma of how to placate the increasing disenchantment within their respective ranks at tha abysmal failure of the Coalition to make even one worthwhile contribution to the frightening dismantling of our economy, the falling apart of some of the basic structures, both semi-State organisations and private sector enterprises. That dismantling is unfolding before us daily.</P>
      <P>The budget will be remembered primarily for a number of reasons.  It is antiemployment but there is little point in quoting figures to illustrate that.  The budget is anti-worker though it proposes to do much for those who are employed both in terms of tax and in terms of incentives for employment.  The budget is anti-family.  I am very disappointed that one party to the Government would permit such a budget to come before the House because of the extent to which it is anti-family.  The budget is anti-social and it is very much anti-builder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of the struttings or the posturings the handlers engage in, no matter <Col N="2384" /> how much they talk about this being the kind of recipe necessary for economic reconstruction and no matter how persistently the Taoiseach decides to babble on about the economic upturn being at hand, the package meted out by way of the budget is being perceived quickly for what it is.  The public will no longer be conned by these self-appointed lords of credibility.  I must use that term because it has been the keynote of the Government's term in office.  We were told that everything they would do would be in the interest of credibility, that despite harsh and unpopular measures having to be taken the Government would retain their credibility.  Many people believed that.  Obviously, at the general election in November 1982, not a majority but a significant proportion of the people believed those pronouncements. But the face masks are falling off.  The veneer is cracking and the real incompetence, insincerity, conmanship and deceptions are rapidly being exposed.</P>
    <P>The public did not have to wait for the recent budget to demonstrate what they think of this bungling Government.  They had done so already, as was indicated in the outcome of opinion polls.  However, since the publication of the budget the public have even more unequivocally demonstrated their dissatisfaction, distrust and downright disillusionment with such gross mismanagement.  There is little doubt that, if the people were given the opportunity in the morning to demonstrate their opinion of this Government, the overwhelming majority would hurl them out of office and would be only too glad to see the backs of them for the rest of the century.  That is a belief that has grown out of the sentiments and views being expressed in local communities, expressed so vehemently, so enthusiastically and in some cases so bitterly against the performance of the Government in the past two years.</P>
    <P>The figures presented in the budget are wrong.  They are deliberately distorted and grossly misleading.  For example, 217,000 is the figure used to represent the average number of people who will <Col N="2385" /> be in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance in the coming year.  Surely, with 234,000 unemployed at present, this is totally unrealistic and gives a deliberately false promise.  The PAYE earner is told by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Finance that he will be better off by from anything between £17 and £600 this year.  This is rubbish, absolute nonsense. The PAYE workers will be paying an additional £160 million in tax this year.  I know that the Taoiseach, on the night of the budget, explained that away by saying that reflected the buoyancy which would take place in the economy.  I think his expression was that nearly all of it could be accounted for the in that way.</P>
    <P>We all agree that over a number of years the tax burden carried by the PAYE earner, both as a percentage of total direct tax and as a proportion of tax revenue, had become most unacceptable and disproportionate.  Urgent reform of personal taxation, it was agreed by all, was essential in the interests of equity. Very serious inequities are there, which needed to be addressed.  These have grown into the system over the years. Even as far back as 12 July of last year Minister Bruton was quoted in <i>The Irish Press</i> as stating that the Government definitely intended to introduce indexation in the next year's budget and that it would be the first time since 1981 that income taxpayers would not be worse off.  A Minister who preaches credibility, honesty and frankness made that statement then.  I know that he got his wings clipped shortly afterwards for making it. However, that is the background against which the public approach this budget.</P>
    <P>One would have to admit readily that the budget simplifies the tax code by reducing the number of bands from five to three.  Income tax payers will in future be paying income tax at 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 60 per cent.  At the same time the bands have been widened.  Any attempt at simplification of the code must be welcomed, but the big question is: is this exercise meaningful reform? Because of the abolition of the 65 per cent top rate and the widening of the bands, in gross terms the high income <Col N="2386" /> family will benefit, according to the calculation of one accountant, to a greater extent than the low income family.  This is a very important aspect of these changes which we must take into account.</P>
    <P>There are implications right down the line, for social policy among other things. For example, the calculation given to me was that a married couple with three children and one spouse earning £30,000 would be, under certain circumstances, likely to save £503 next year whereas a similar family with one spouse earning £15,000 would save only £160, or perhaps slightly more.  That is in certain circumstances. However, all analysists who have seen the figures now agree that these savings assume that earnings will be static in the coming year.  If, for example, earnings keep pace with inflation, there will be no real tax saving &mdash; in fact there will be a real loss, although slight.  This is because the budget changes have not reduced the rate at which income tax is charged.  Instead they ensure that basic wage increases are taxed at more or less the same rate as for 1984-85.  From the figures which I have already used, it is quite clear that that would be the case.</P>
    <P>If the intention was to improve the situation, very obviously the gains will accrue to those on higher incomes. Again, that the greater hardship, in relative terms, is on those on lower and middle incomes is a very obvious, immediate deduction which it is possible to make.  Surely the gains should have accrued to those in need and surely, if involved in this simplification exercise was an intention to reform with equity in mind, that is how it should have been done.  I agree that the reduction from the top rate of 65 per cent imposed by that Government to 60 per cent was a wise move because there were implications for investment and for incentives.  There was a very definite fall-off in these areas because of the existence of that rate.</P>
    <P>It is commendable that the top rate was reduced.  However, if one takes the lower and middle income family and looks at how these would be likely to suffer on the basis of what is perceived as the ostensible intent of this instrument, <Col N="2387" /> surely the measure is anti-social.  It is giving the greater benefits to those who least need them and the lesser benefits to those who need them much more.  There is a big lie exposed in this income tax adjustment situation.  There will be no gain, but a real loss for taxpayers in this budget.  They will pay over £160 million more in 1985-86 than in the previous tax year because of the absence of any real reform or meaningful adjustment other than a simplification exercise.</P>
    <P>The house buyers are told that they are getting a grant of £1,750 for the purchase of their first homes, a 75 per cent increase, while the Government through the back door increase the price of the average house by VAT to the tune of £1,800.  That is keeping a low average price for houses in the Dublin market at present.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach did the best arithmitic exercise even when it comes to buoyancy.  To balance the budget and provide for a £58 million shortfall of what was granted for public sector pay increases but not allowed for in the budget, they very neatly, conveniently and, one would have to admit, inspirationally come up with the exact sum in revenue buoyancy.  What an extraordinary piece of arithmetic mumbo-jumbo.  The importance is that the sums add up in the end, that the figures come out exactly right.  I wonder how many members of the public, if they appreciated what was meant by that, would believe it.</P>
    <P>Our poor and unemployed, our sick and senior citizens are told that they are getting enough by way of this budget because their increase benefits, in the words of the Tánaiste in this House on 31 January, 1985, Volume 1321 &ldquo;at least match inflation over the period they are intended to cover&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He goes on that the Government can make this claim &ldquo;in respect of last year and the previous...&rdquo;  That is very important.  I suggest to this House that these statements are grossly inaccurate and the Minister knows that.  His party have simply treated the unemployed and the disadvantaged with derision.  His <Col N="2388" /> party's actions and attitudes are nothing short of immoral in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have betrayed the legitimate aspirations of the voiceless and defenceless among us.  They are clinging to power on the backs of the unemployed. Whatever Deputy Kelly thinks about it, this budget is callously driving thousands onto the emigration ships.  Deputy Kelly went to great lengths to point out that he had been misunderstood in the recent past because of his sentiments in relation to emigration and he conjured up images of greatness, importance and great significance, the wonderful experience, insight and broadmindness in the idea of taking that trip across the Irish Sea or the Atlantic, where horizons could be broadened and where all disadvantages that could be put down to emigration could be so overwhemingly overcome because of the gains that would ensue.  I refuse to go along with those sentiments. I wonder if the Government go along with them.  Quite frankly, the decisions and the effects of the budget seem to coincide with that point of view.  If that is the case we have taken a very sad turn.</P>
    <P>Last year was an extremely harsh year for all those on social welfare benefits. The miserly increase of 7½ per cent was not paid out until July, giving an annual increase of 3½ to 4 per cent from that budget.  This was the second time that the Coalition had left this sector to suffer all the other increases that came on board for a full six months before, giving them a meagre increase.  Then came the halving of food subsidies, the curtailment of supplementary benefits through the health boards, the alteration in the guidelines for eligibility for assistance for school uniform grants, the almost total abolition of assistance to the poor, the unemployed, the widowed and the sick with the payment of ESB bills while at the same time the price of fuel increased substantially.  This is the scenario that the weak section of our community had to endure last year.  That is the nightmare with which they were faced.  Anyone who tries to deny that is flying in the face of reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> All these things happened in 1984 because of the Government's massive cutbacks in the health and social welfare services.  The most unsavoury feature was having to listen to the present Minister for Health repeatedly passing the buck last year for his callous decisions and the callous decisions of the Government in regard to the defenceless local officials manning the health boards in an attempt to administer a scheme and meet guidelines for which there was inadequate funding. The Ministers denials ring hollow when compared with the realities.  The Minister must be aware of the queues of people outside health boards and the sitins that took place on various occasions and of the deputations that went to his Department and were not given a fair hearing and of the calls and appeals to him to meet groups.  The Minister refused on nearly all occasions.  The Socialist element in the Government must be terribly embarrassed by these realities.  They must be wondering as to their purpose and as to whom they represent if they are prepared to ignore all these hardships and turn a blind eye by way of policy to what has happened to our economy. These people do not want to know about the embarrassment felt and the hardships endured by the most defenceless section of our community.  The experiences of these people will not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>The 1985 budget is consistent with the Coalition's other budgets in at least one respect.  When it comes to the poor and the unemployed it appears that anything will do.  We have again all the worst features of the previous budgets.  There is only an annualised increase in social welfare payments of 3 per cent and 3½ per cent respectively to the long term and short term recipients and again the increases are deferred to mid-July when these people will have borne the increases from other budgetary measures for nearly six months.  That is a scathing indictment of the budget and a terrible reflection on those who profess any kind of care or concern for the weakest among us.  There has been no increase in children's allowances, and footwear has been taxed at 10 per cent VAT.  To say that it <Col N="2390" /> is only adult footwear does not exonerate the Government.  Tax on clothing has been increased from 8 to 10 per cent and fuel, except electricity, is now being taxed at 10 per cent.  Each of these increases will hit our senior citizens, our unemployed, our widowed and our sick people and there are no compensatory effects.  There is no provision to ease the burden on the least well off.  It is a terrible indictment of the Labour Party that they committed the poorest to shoulder the most.  That is the real result of the budget.</P>
    <P>On the night of the budget when discussion was taking place on Financial Resolutions and when elaborations were being given, damaging effects for certain sections were pointed out to the Taoiseach and he was quick to point out that bouy&mdash; ancy in our economy, reform of the tax system and other aspects of the budget would compensate for losses in certain areas.  I must confess to an inability to get in on the debate on that night but when I put it to the Taoiseach &mdash; and I know he heard what I said &mdash; that he might be able to point to compensatory effects for many sections but that he certainly could not point to compensatory effects for the category of persons I have just mentioned and I asked the Taoiseach to explain why there was no compensation there, the reply I got was a deafening silence.</P>
    <P>From 1980 to 1982 Fianna Fáil gave increases of 25 per cent towards those on social welfare.  We always ensured that payments would not leave those people less well off in real terms.  The decision in the 1983 budget and in the two consecutive ones to defer payment until July is most unjust and extremely harsh.  Rather than deferring payment from the traditional April date it is fair and reasonable to suggest making these payments available to these people to coincide at least with the date of increases in costs caused by budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>Another feature of the budget, of which great play has been made, is the miserly increase of £5 in the fuel voucher scheme.  It does not in any way compensate for increases, direct and indirect, in the cost of living of social welfare recipients <Col N="2391" /> in the past three years.  The prices of a bag of coal and a cylinder of gas have been increased and are likely to be increased further during the year.  A bag of coal now costs nearly £7.50 and a cylinder of gas nearly £8, yet a £1 increase has been given this year to make up for a three year gap &mdash; we are talking about the 1983, the 1984 and the 1985 budgets during which there was no increase of any kind in the fuel scheme.  The £1 now given is totally inadequate in a system which is outdated and meaningless.  I would have considered a £7 or an £8 voucher as necessary considering the other unfavourable aspects of the budget. That would have been a minimum requirement.</P>
    <P>To leave the fuel voucher scheme there in its present form except for this meagre increase is unfair and wrong.  The scheme should be scrapped altogether and the equivalent of £5 given in some other way. It is mere pretence to say that giving £5 in the fuel scheme on a limited time basis to certain categories will make a substantial contribution to their fuel costs.  I would prefer to see the scheme scrapped altogether and to have an equivalent increase given to eligible persons in other ways.</P>
    <P>The cost of education for families has increased greatly over the past couple of years and because many families are operating extremely restricted family budgets, decisions to withdraw children from second level schooling are more frequently being made on the basis of inability to meet the costs of bus fares, school books and other school expenses. The Minister for Education &mdash; I am sorry she is not here &mdash; has done a hell of a lot to ensure that the concept of free education has become irrelevant.</P>
    <P>If we take a husband, wife and three children on short duration unemployment assistance, they are in receipt of £76.50 a week whether their children are in primary or second level schools.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare must know only too well that families in this and similar categories are flocking to health centres in the cities and country <Col N="2392" /> looking for supplementary benefit. Nobody in this House will deny that, because any Deputy who makes himself or herself available to the public and listens to what is going on &mdash; sometimes in a disagreeable way, sometimes in a critical way &mdash; must be well aware of the position in the past couple of years. People go to health centres looking for supplementary benefit, for school uniform allowances, for assistance to pay their ESB bills or rent, only to be turned away because the Minister concerned has simply robbed the health boards of funding for very necessary services.</P>
    <P>This morning two widowed persons came to me to inform me their local health centre had told them that although they had been in receipt of £5 per week each to enable them to pay off mortgages on their homes the money would no longer be payable.  When one of them called to her health centre last week for a £25 cheque &mdash; she was letting the amount run up for five weeks &mdash; she was told by an official that before being paid she would have to get a statement of the interest she was paying on the mortgage. She went away, got the statement and came back yesterday, but she was told she did not need the money.  He told her &ldquo;You are better off than many other people in receipt of social welfare benefits&rdquo;.  No reasons were given for that. When she queried the decision it seemed to her that the decision had been handed down from on high.</P>
    <P>The second widow yesterday had the same experience.  The only difference was that she was not asked for a statement of the interest paid on her mortgage. Earlier, when she called in about something else she was told the money was there for her, but she asked that it be held until this week, that it would be more convenient for her because the date of payment of the mortgage fell due this week.  When she went in yesterday she was told she did not need the money, that she was better off than most others in that category, but they offered her a little help with her ESB bills from time to time.</P>
    <P>We know of the difficulties faced by people who genuinely have not got <Col N="2393" /> money.  In such cases electricity has been cut off on many occasions.  Here we have widows being denied callously assistance that was available to them in 1983 and 1984.  Though there might be some validity in the statement that this category of people might be better off than others under the social welfare code, nevertheless if they were eligible for assistance in 1983 and in 1984 what changes have taken place or decisions issued from the Department to the local health boards to the effect that those people are no longer eligible?  I have no evidence to suggest that things are better now than they were in 1983 and 1984, and I would not agree with anybody who tried to convince me that that is so.  Last year the Eastern Health Board were left short by £3,500,000 and all the Minister for Health and Social Welfare would say was that there was no shortfall or any change in guidelines issued from his Department. The people will not accept this verbiage any longer from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The effects of the budget in real terms will leave the families of the unemployed, the sick and our senior citizens anything from £10 to £30 per week worse off in real terms than last year.  That is a frightening prospect for those people.  It calls for an unequivocal condemnation of the Government and the Minister for Health and Social Welfare who is obviously so uncaring as to permit this to happen.  If he has any conviction he would resign from the Government in protest at the manner in which the poor, the unemployed and the sick are being so derisively treated.  I call on him to resign as a protest against the Government and as a mark of respect to all those so callously ignored by this budget.</P>
    <P>The Government came to office in November 1982 and promised that they would get rid of the legacy of irresponsible borrowing and mismanagement of the economy and State finances by their predecessors. Day after day, week after week the public were treated to a profusion of outpourings about how the Coalition would pursue a policy of financial rectitude, bring the finances of the country <Col N="2394" /> back into line, wipe out deficits and thereby diminish the enormous strain being imposed by the servicing of our foreign debt.  Borrowing was supposed to be immoral and the public were reminded that only through such a policy could our young people face the future with hope. The previous Government, they said, had mortgaged their future for votes.  Credibility had become synonymous with a policy of deflation and austerity.  To say otherwise or even to start to think of people as people was simply living in cloud cuckooland.  All decisions had to be taken in Government within the framework of stringent controls of current budgeting and debt management.</P>
    <P>What is the reality?  Beginning in the 1984 budget, and continued through this one, the Taoiseach has thrown all of this conviction out the window.  If it was so important before he took office, when he was canvassing for votes early in 1983, why is it not still so important?</P>
    <P>The national debt, taking the effects of this budget into account, will have increased by £10 billion during the short term of office of this Coalition.  The foreign debt has been increased by almost £3½ billion in the same period.  The current budget deficit has increased by over £350 million over the past couple of years, from £988 million in 1982 to £1,234 million in 1985, although that figure is still being questioned today in this House. The Government are refusing to up-date the figures on the basis of changes that have already taken place, changes that have not been brought before the House for approval.  I am convinced that before the effects of this budget are fully seen throughout the year, there will be an additional £50 million to £60 million on top of what has been very optimistically allowed by the Minister.  When one looks at this scenario, where is the so-called responsible management, where is the diminution of our foreign debt or the reduction in the cost of its servicing? Where is the rhetoric now about taking on the current budgetary situation?  How can the Taoiseach have had the effrontery to tell the people a couple of months ago that our finances had been restored <Col N="2395" /> to an acceptable level of normality, that the economy had been turned around and that we were now heading for better times?  Does the Taoiseach not realise even at this late stage, that the plot has been blown, that the web of intrigue has been broken and the truth is really out? Surely he must now accept that all the handlers in the world cannot put his fairy castle together again?  This pillar of integrity, and that is what the Taoiseach was put up as being &mdash; the pillar of integrity, truth, honesty and reality; he was built on reality &mdash; should come clean and admit to the people that he has been downright dishonest and deliberately misleading. He should admit also that he has simply lost control of the ship of state, that he never really had control.  He should state that he does not know where he is going or what he is doing.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of their new commitment that by 1987 the current budget deficit will have been reduced to 5 per cent of GNP, despite having strayed already by a significant amount from the commitment in their national plan.  Is there the slightest hope of effecting a few hundred million pounds reduction in this deficit over two years?  Perhaps the Government contend there is but nobody on this side of the House believes them. Therefore one must ask do they really believe it themselves?</P>
    <P>When one takes into account that the Taoiseach and several of his Ministers, not least the Minister for the Public Service, on a number of occasions towards the end of 1984, right into this year, were adamant that there would be no increase in 1985 in public sector pay, how literally on the eve of budget day they so rapidly and suddenly capitulated, then it takes a frightening and unbelievable degree of naivety to hope that the public at large have not seen through their charade.  It must be seen that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and this Government will never be believed again.  No matter how long they remain in office they simply cannot hope to rule effectivly because they have lost the trust and confidence of the people and any Government <Col N="2396" /> that does not have those, simply is not a Government.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on 31 January last the Tánaiste had this to say at column 1317 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The budget, considered as a package of measures, is designed to promote enterprise and employment and protect the living standards of those on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payments to the maximum extent possible. Budgetary policy is one major instrument in seeking employment creation,</P>
    <P>That is the view of the Tánaiste, not necessarily that of Deputy John Kelly and, if it is the view of the Tánaiste, then it must be considered to be that of the Government.  Through a deft sleight of hand the Tánaiste omitted to mention how the provisions of this budget would operate by way of going anywhere near creating a situation in which the average number of unemployed for the year would be 217,000.  How one can explain that is beyond me.  The Tánaiste forgot to illustrate how even one job could be created by virtue of this package.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on the same day the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism had this to say:</P>
    <P>It is desirable that we should try to set up new industries but that would be of little value if we cannot preserve the industries we have.</P>
    <P>Those remarks appear at column 1430 of the Official Report of 31 January 1985.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be a certain degree of honesty implicit in that statement of that Minister although he does not attempt to quantify it.  First of all, he appears to acknowledge the fact that the Government's failure to prevent the closure of over 400 companies last year was clearly a disaster.  Neither does that Minister get involved in the ridiculous posturings of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers that this constitutes an employment-creating budget.  Admittedly his long preamble on the absence of price competitiveness in Irish industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitor nations, the <Col N="2397" /> role it plays and has played in the recent past in dismantling our industrial base, seems to be a rather obvious exercise in buck passing.</P>
    <P>When the figures are broken down one must ask what is in this budget for industry and jobs?  Where are the great incentives about which we hear so much? What grand plan is designed to take on the greatest social evil of all, namely, the unprecedented high level of unemployment? There are now 234,000 people unemployed, approximately 50,000 of whom are from the building sector.  Any Government worth their salt must realise that the construction industry is one of the biggest employers, offering potential for alleviating to a great extent this disastrous unemployment situation.  Economists the world over, although rarely agreeing on many issues relating to economic management, agree that, right across national divides and frontiers, the building industry has a greater multipler effect in terms of employment creation than has any other industry.  Yet this very industry has been forced into rapid decline over the past two years.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate and sad feature of Coalition rule that it manifestly hits this industry and that any time they come to power, the construction industry must dive for cover, investment decisions are shelved and, in many instances, moneys available are invested outside the country. In the past year an inordinate number of builders, large and small, have crashed into industrial oblivion.  Plasterers, carpenters, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, semi-skilled and unskilled labourers daily call to our clinics asking when this stupid Government are going to get out, indicating that if that does not happen very soon they will have no option but to join thousands of their comrades who have already jumped aboard the emigration ships.</P>
    <P>The latest increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on new houses represents a final attempt to dismantle the house building industry.  When, on the evening of the budget, the Taoiseach was asked in this House by Deputy Calleary <Col N="2398" /> to justify this increase he had this to say at, column 1223 of the Official Report for that day:</P>
    <P>... but there is clearly no way that we can arrive at a simplification of the VAT structure without some going up and going down.</P>
    <P>That is what the Taoiseach thought or cared for the plight of the house building industry, that it would simply have to fit into the figures he wanted to employ &mdash; forget about people, about jobs.  The Taoiseach continued to say, at column 1225 of the Official Report of that day:</P>
    <P>Taken overall, the net effect on the construction industry is positive.</P>
    <P>I accept that he juxtaposed a mumble, jumble of figures against the 5 per cent VAT increase but I do not accept his conclusions.  One element in his reply was that there was a reduction in VAT on cement blocks.  The reality seems to elude the Taoiseach, that blocks constitute a minimum component in house building.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider what this Government decided to do to the new house building sector.  In their press release they told of a 75 per cent increase in the house purchase grant, that first time buyers of new houses would receive an increase in this grant from £1,000 to £1,750.  What a generous gesture on the part of this Government to young newly weds.  It was implied that thousands of young couples would now be able to rush to the nearest builder, bringing forward their decision to buy a new home on the strength of this increase.  Of course, builders are always seen to be the bad boys.  It is contended that they will now increase the price of a new house by 5 per cent.  What a bunch of rogues.  But it is not the builders who are doing this at all, rather it is the Government.  But the unsuspecting house buyer is not supposed to know that.  After all, is it not the builder who charges the price?  No matter what may be his protestations his action is seen as a greedy response to this increase in the grant.  One must ask did it not all happen before, anyway?  That is how this Government hoped to put across the net <Col N="2399" /> increase in the price of a new house to the innocent public but it simply has not worked.  Their devious little scheme simply has not worked.  The Minister for Finance, in an attempt to run for cover &mdash; when questioned on television last week or the week before about the effects of his budgetary decisions on the building industry and new house buying &mdash; tried to fudge the issue by stating that the increase was not on the gross price.  However, everybody should be fully aware of what this budgetary measure means.  I should say in relation to VAT that all builders will admit and anybody who does a costing of it will agree, that when the VAT was increased by this Government from 3 per cent to 5 per cent almost invariably the builders absorbed it because there was no future in their doing otherwise.  Take a new house costing £30,000, inclusive of 5 per cent VAT &mdash; incidentally one will find very few houses on the Dublin market at that price and anybody who knows anything about it will agree with that &mdash; its price from 1 March 1985 will not be £30,000 but £31,429.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, together.  There are no proposals for electrification of mainline rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a rail link to Tallaght falls to be considered by the proposed Dublin Transport Authority, in consultation with CIE and in the context of the overall transport requirements of the <Col N="2408" /> Dublin area.  Legislation for the establishment of the Authority will be introduced in this session.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the following road improvement works of benefit to the Tallaght area are being financed or have been financed in recent years by the Minister for the Environment:</P>
    <P>(a)  Tallaght By-Pass: this scheme is in progress, and the estimated cost is £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>(b)  Templeogue Bridge: this scheme is completed, and the estimated cost is £1.4 million.</P>
    <P>(c)  Belgard Road: this scheme is completed, at an estimated cost of £5.5 million.</P>
    <P>(d)  Western section of the Dublin Ring route: to be built over the next few years, at an estimated cost of £43 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the road improvements to which he referred are primarily for the benefit of people by-passing Tallaght rather than for the benefit of the communications needs of the people in that area?  Would the Minister also agree that they need a rail link, preferably electrified, which would provide communications for this town of 80,000 people who are cut off from any reasonable degree of transport policy?  Would it not make good sense to use the expertise built up in the construction of the DART line in providing that rail link to Tallaght?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to be able to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the questions posed by Deputy Taylor but I am not in a position to do so.  The matters which have been studied at length are complex and, as I said in my reply, I hope that the Dublin Transport Authority will be set up very quickly following the introduction of legislation in the very near future.  I hope that Authority will then be able to come up with recommendations in relation to access to Tallaght in the context of an overall transport plan for Dublin.  However, I should point out, as mentioned by An Foras Forbartha among others, that there is an inherent conflict between the low rise, low density planning policy of <Col N="2409" /> the local authorities in Dublin, which has the support of the vast majority of the population, and that of transit.  It is not only here that that is recognised.  I am sure Deputies appreciate that, if we have a low density population, there have to be more stops for fewer people.  That, of course, adversely affects the economics and speed of the operation and suggests that probably the solution to the transport needs of Tallaght would be roads instead of railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that he would prefer to see our roads clogged with fume spewing vehicles instead of having a rail link supplied to Tallaght which, as I have said, has a population of 80,000 people?  Does he agree that it would make sense to divert some of the moneys for road allocation towards the provision of a rail link which could provide a cheap transport infrastructural system for the people of Tallaght which they do not have at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in the arguments put forward by Deputy Taylor but I should also make some counter arguments to show that it is not as clear cut a case as some rail enthusiasts might think.  Nevertheless, the points which Deputy Taylor raised will be studied by the transport authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined a total expenditure of £57.4 million on roads in and through Tallaght. Since CIE already own a substantial amount of the land required for the rail spur to Tallaght, could the Minister say what the cost of a rail link, not necessarily electrified, to Tallaght would be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a certain amount of land has been reserved for the possible route of a rail link to Tallaght.  Consideration has been given to the proposals of the Dublin Transportation Task Force by officials of my Department and CIE management.  The board of CIE have asked the management to prepare alternative proposals for electric and non-electrified railways for consideration by the board before they are considered by me and the transport authority.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that a bad planning mistake was made by successive Governments in spending some £200 million in providing an electrified rail link to a town like Bray with a population of some 10,000 people instead of to a densely populated town like Tallaght which has 80,000 people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 39, 40, 60 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The present position with regard to the revised pension scheme for CIE wages grades employees is as outlined in my reply of 7 November 1984.  The improvements outlined in that reply do not provide for lump sum payments to pensioners.  My approval for the improvements would be conditional on the cost being met out of CIE's own resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at present many wages grade workers in receipt of a pension of £16.50 per week will receive very small increases in their pensions under the terms of the proposed pension scheme?  Is he satisfied that the new level of pension for such workers, with no lump sum included, is fair and equitable after 40 years service with CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned for a long time about pensions in CIE. As a former Minister for Transport, the Deputy will know that the pension scheme is designed so that the amount paid by way of pension to wages grade employees, added to their social welfare entitlement, would give them the equivalent of two-thirds of their wage on retiring. In 1981 the then Coalition Government indicated they were prepared to allow an increase in the pensions but this was refused by the unions because of negotiations going on for a complete reconstruction of the pension scheme.</P>
      <P>Those negotiations went on for a considerable time but when a new scheme emerged the unions, having reflected on the proposals, turned them down.  In the meantime I indicated to the board of CIE that I was prepared immediately to authorise an increase from £16.50 per week to £34.50 a week, more than double the rate.  That offer is now before the unions.  I understand some of the unions have accepted it but one major union has not accepted it.  That is what is holding up the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the proposed offer to those who are at a certain level of income could be £34 but the <Col N="2417" /> reality is that for a large number of the wages grade employees in CIE who are at a lower wage level the increase could be as low as £5 or £6 per week.  If the Minister is not aware of that, perhaps he would look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very well aware of the matter.  Anyone will accept that an increase from £16.50 to £34.50 per week is quite substantial.  When that is added to the social welfare entitlement it gives a sum equivalent to two-thirds of wages at retirement.  The pension arrangements need to be seen in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Minister is trying to mislead anyone but it is misleading to suggest that will apply generally.  At the moment all get £16.50 per week.  With regard to the proposed scheme, many will not get the amount the Minister has mentioned; in fact, a large number will get a much lower increase.  It is not realistic to say they will all get double the amount.  Where people are earning a relatively high income at the wages grade level it will mean they will get almost double, but for many the increase will be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some truth in what Deputy Faulkner has said but, as I have pointed out, this is an interim arrangement which the Government have offered pending conclusion between the unions themselves of a more comprehensive and more acceptable pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>In these circumstances will the Minister make available sufficient money to CIE so that all of the wages grade earners can have a pension at the maximum amount referred to by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows only too well, money is very scarce. Given the scarcity of money and the constraints on the Exchequer, the offer made is quite generous.  A sum of £104 million has been set aside in this year's Estimates and there could be a certain flexibility <Col N="2418" /> within that for CIE to make alternative suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the present position with regard to all the negotiations?  In view of the offer he made, have all negotiations stopped between the unions and CIE?  Has the offer of maximum £34 to be added to social welfare entitlements precluded any future discussion regarding a lump sum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this matter is with the management of CIE and will go before the board.  Several of the unions have accepted the offer but one union has not accepted it.  It is now a matter for management and the board to decide how they should proceed.  It would be wrong for me to anticipate how the board should proceed.  I expect they will take some action in the matter in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that a semi-State company should not expect that after a lifetime of service its employees should retire on a pension of £16 per week?  Will he agree that is wholly unacceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I am very familiar with the problems of CIE, especially in Inchicore.  I have already said that the low pensions in CIE have been a matter of concern to me for many years.  That is why I persuaded the Government to authorise an increase of over 100 per cent, bringing the pension to £34.50 at the maximum.  In the present circumstances that is a very generous offer.  As I have told the House, the plan is that this sum, together with social welfare entitlements, will give those on the wages grade who are retiring from CIE some two-thirds of their wage on retiring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to a question on this subject on 12 December 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please <Col N="2420" /> elaborate because in that reply he gave no reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say at the moment is that details of the proposed runway at Dublin airport are being worked out.  Deputies will be aware that a committee called the Airport Construction Committee has been in existence for many years.  It comprises representatives of Aer Rianta, my Department and the Department of Finance.  Details regarding the dimensions of the runway and its funding are being finalised and I will make an announcement on that as soon as I am in a position to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept it is of vital importance for the survival of Dublin airport that the runway be at least 9,000 feet?  Will he also accept that there is a great degree of urgency about this matter?  Can he give some definite date when we may expect final details?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there is urgency about this matter and that is why I was glad the Government were able to announce the decision in principle in the national plan last October.  I am not in a position to give a date but I can tell the Deputy this matter is being treated with the urgency it deserves and I hope to make a statement on it at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a written answer to my question on 12 December.  Is he aware that out of 46 airports in Europe Dublin lies 42nd in length, just ahead of small places such as Luton and Bristol?  Will the Minister give an undertaking to the House that he and his Department endorse the recommendation of the working party who carried out the study in 1981 and recommended that a 9,000 ft. runway be provided at Dublin airport?  Does he not endorse that working party's recommendation in which members of his Department took part?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises from the question. Cork is being forgotten.  Would the Minister take up immediately with Aer Rianta the question of the runway at Cork so that Cork can compete for the bigger plane market and especially for the European Airbus market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was replying he did not answer the fundamental part of Deputy Prendergast's question, which was whether the completion and operation of this runway would hinder or affect adversely the operation of Ireland's only transatlantic airport at Shannon.  What is the Minister's attitude to the airport at Shannon?  Will these proposals for the new runway at Dublin airport affect Shannon adversely?</P>

      <P>This is a great chestnut of the Deputy from Clare.  I admire the diligence and enthusiasm with which he represents his constituency.  I assure him again, as I have assured him many times, that the status or role of Shannon is not in question.  It is the only gateway to the Atlantic from Ireland and it will remain so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that there was no question of a preference payment to the late group chairman of Irish Shipping Ltd. in relation to the liquidation of the company.</P>
      <P>When the group chairman resigned at my request, the board proposed payment to him of a lump sum in lieu of salary up to June 1986 when his term of office would have normally terminated.  Following careful consideration of all the legal and other factors involved, the Government accepted that the proposal advanced by the board had fewer drawbacks for the company than all others; consequently, that proposal was approved in August 1984.</P>
      <P>The decision to ask the High Court to appoint a provisional liquidator to Irish Shipping Ltd. was not taken until 14 November 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2423" />
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us if he was aware at the time he was approving this payment of £66,000 to the chairman of Irish Shipping Limited that he intended to put the company into liquidation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely not. Indeed, it was only after the appointment of a new chairman that we realised the full extent of the problem.  It became very evident because of a report the new chairman made within months of becoming chairman that we had very little choice but to liquidate.  I asked the late Mr. O'Neill to resign because among other reasons I was not happy that I was getting full information or totally accurate information.  That is not to say that Mr. O'Neill was necessarily in any way keeping me in the dark or misleading me, but he may have been taking an over optimistic view of events and he may have been emotionally attached, given the previous success of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that it was not until a new chairman was appointed that a decision was taken that the company should be put in liquidation, am I right in saying that neither the new chairman nor the management of the board recommended the liquidation of the company to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us that a decision of such magnitude as to liquidate Irish Shipping Limited, the first State company ever liquidated, was made in a period of ten days?  No such decision was made or, the Minister suggests, even in mind at the time this payment was made, yet ten days later the <Col N="2424" /> Minister came into the House and liquidated the company.  Is he telling us that that decision was made within that ten days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is under some misapprehension.  As I said in my reply, the decision on the late Mr. O'Neill's lump sum was taken in August and he resigned in August.  The decision to liquidate was not taken until 14 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making a mistake.  He advised us that the chairman resigned in August at his request but the decision to make this payment to him was not made at that time.  It was made much later, just ten days before the company was liquidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not correct. One reason that we had to pay Mr. O'Neill a lump sum was that there was some difficulty in getting him to resign. He simply would not resign until terms were fixed.  As I said in my reply, the Government accepted that the proposal advanced by the board had fewer drawbacks for the company than all others. Consequently, that proposal was approved in August 1984 and it included the agreement to pay Mr. O'Neill's salary until June 1986 when his term of office as chairman normally would have run out. He was paid salary up to June 1986 and that was decided in August 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to apply the same generous terms to other members of the staff of Irish Shipping Limited whom he praised in his statement announcing the liquidation? Over the years those employees have served Irish Shipping Limited well.  They and their families are the victims of these developments over which they had no control and of which they knew nothing. Does the Minister intend to see that they are treated as generously as the chairman of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the whole House will be unanimous in feeling a <Col N="2425" /> great deal of sympathy for the employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  Very seldom has a workforce been the victim of events less justifiably than in this case.  Unfortunately, we are bound here by bankruptcy law, with which I know Deputy Mac Giolla will be familiar.  It is not possible to give any preferential treatment to any one creditor over another.  The Deputy will be aware that employees in a bankruptcy situation are creditors for whom legal provision is made.  We cannot go beyond that legal provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be favourable to such treatment for the employees when all the liquidation business has been cleared up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Communication if he is aware of dissatisfaction among consumers at the failure of certain cable television companies to provide an adequate service in the area or areas for which they have a mandate; and if, in view of the monopoly situation on an area to area basis, he will take steps <Col N="2426" /> to arrange an appropriate complaints procedure so that consumers and residents can pursue defaulting companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any general dissatisfaction such as mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Cable television systems are required to be licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974, which set out the conditions to be complied with, including technical conditions.  These conditions are designed to ensure that the quality of television signals received at the masthead are not downgraded while being relayed to the subscribers' premises, that interference is not caused to other radio equipment and that the system complies with safety requirements.</P>
      <P>The terms under which service is provided by a cable television company to any individual subscriber are contractual matters between the subscriber and the company concerned and I do not see a need for any special complaints procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would make the Minister aware that there is a problem and that it arises in the Dublin area particularly. Secondly, in view of the monopoly enjoyed by RTE and, through them, Dublin Cable Systems, which they have taken over recently, and since users do not have the opportunity of taking a service from another company, would the Minister not consider it appropriate that arrangements be made for a complaints procedure to deal with the cases of consumers who are being treated shabbily in some cases?  RTE Relays have a monopoly on foot of the authority of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the point raised but I am not aware of general dissatisfaction with the service.  I am aware of individual complaints.  I have received some such complaints in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it the Minister has not been made aware at any stage of a licence being withdrawn from any <Col N="2427" /> unsatisfactory supplier of communal television and could he indicate what steps the Department take before extending a licence to a supplier of communal television so as to ensure that the applicant is in a position to provide the extended service?  Some of these services are not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When an application is received for an extension beyond the franchise area for which a licence is held an investigation is carried out by the radio broadcasting branch of the Department at technical and administrative level.  The general suitability of the applicant in terms of past performance and so on is taken into account.  Normally an extension of a franchise area would not necessarily be advertised unlike an application for the franchise in a new area which would be advertised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Minister will consider the matter and I trust he will find it possible to report progress to the House.  Is he aware that many users in the Dublin area are treated unfairly in cases where a subscriber fails to pay the relay charge.  In such cases neighbours can be punished and do not have any recourse because of the monopoly situation?  Does that sort of situation not necessitate the facility of recourse to some court of appeal?</P>

      <P>For some time I have been very conscious of a number of problems in the cable area but I am aware also of opportunities that may be arising. Following on the report of the satellite committee set up by my predecessor, Deputy Wilson, I set up, almost immediately, in accordance with one of the recommendations of that committee, a committee on the cable systems and they have now reported to me.  In the coming weeks that report will be published by way of a discussion document.  I think it will answer some of the questions being raised by the Deputy, but the report will be debated before we arrive at new policy decisions.</P>

Deputies will then have an opportunity to debate the subject.  I will be inviting comment and submissions on the report before we arrive at policy conclusions. The question raised by Deputy Treacy is interesting but it relates to a very difficult area.  The illegal deflectors are causing <Col N="2429" /> enormous difficulty for legal and franchised cable systems.  For instance, the illegal deflector system operating in Galway was one of the contributing factors to the recent receivership in Galway and I shall have to take action against them as well as against others.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Communications if he is aware that two trains have recently derailed in the vicinity of Kent station, Cork, and that many CIE workers believe that the worsening ground and track conditions have been responsible for the mishaps; and if, in view of the fact that the trains carry 160,000 tonnes of ammonia through the station each year and the serious consequences that would follow from an accident involving one of these trains, he will indicate if he is satisfied with the safety standards operating in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria used in assessing standards for safety in CIE trains are determined by CIE.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that their safety rules and regulations are in accordance with international standards and that implementation is monitored on a daily basis by area inspectors who travel on trains and locomotives.  CIE have also informed me that all train crews and signalmen must be certified by a senior officer of the railway as competent to perform their duties and are re-examined in the rules and regulations proper to their duties on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>In general, the methods of railway operation are not covered by statutory regulations.  My Department's statutory functions regarding rail safety are mainly related to the investigation of rail accidents and to the inspection by the Department's railway inspecting officer of new or reconstructed railway installations.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation, CIE are required to notify my Department of rail accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2430" /> CIE have indicated that there is no difficulty with ground conditions in the vicinity of Kent station and that trackwork in this area continues to be maintained in a satisfactory condition for passenger and freight traffic, including ammonia trains.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, CIE have advised me that, in addition to routine on-going maintenance, the board had commenced a major scheme for rationalisation of trackwork and signalling in Cork station. This work will extend over three years.</P>
    <P>The board have assured me that every effort is being made to prevent any recurrence of the types of incidents which took place in the vicinity of Kent station in recent months.</P>

      <P>The Minister's assurance are very welcome but he will appreciate that there is concern because of two derailments having taken place within a short time of each other.  Can the Minister tell us if, as the belief of the workforce involved in Kent station is that the condition of the track and the ground subsidence were major causes of the recent derailment, these have now been effectively repaired.</P>

      <P>I want to reiterate my concern at the few incidents which have taken place in the vicinity of Kent station. As I have told the Deputy, there is a major three year programme to update the trackwork and so on in that area.  I have been assured by CIE that steps have been taken to avoid a repeat of those incidents.  I have expressed my extreme concern about this matter to CIE and they are in no doubt about how strongly I feel about their duty to ensure safety, not only in Kent station but throughout the rail network.</P>

      <P>A new house costing £30,000, inclusive of 5 per cent VAT, will have a new price, from 1 March 1985, of £31,429, an increase of £1,429.  The builder will be collecting £1,850 for the Government in VAT.  A new house costing £40,000, inclusive of 5 per cent VAT, a very ordinary house, will cost £41,905, an increase of £1,905 &mdash; almost £2,000, <Col N="2468" /> one might say.  Let us not forget that this is being imposed by the Government, not by the builder.  It does not require a mathematician or an economist to determine the widespread and damaging effects which these measures will have on all areas of the housebuilding industry. Let me bring to the attention of the House some of the most up-to-date figures in relation to 1984, as presented to me by the Construction Industry Federation, which I am informed will stand test by any accountant or any analyst in the Department of Finance.  In 1984, 170 builders stopped trading.  In the first five to six weeks of 1985, <i>vis-à-vis</i> 1984, there was a 50 per cent decrease in the number of houses registered with the CIF.  The reaction of the building industry in general is one of absolute and total incomprehension at what the Government have done and proposed to do.  They ask how the Government's budget could reduce VAT on Japanese hi-fis and at the same time increase VAT on the Irish building industry, which uses between 90 and 95 per cent home produced materials.  Some of the effects of the 5 per cent which have been worked out most recently are as follows.</P>
      <P>The first effect is that it is going to increase the price of new houses.  In net terms &mdash; that is, taking all the effects of the budget which might be considered to be favourable and, indeed, given a value and a significance by the Taoiseach which they certainly do not deserve &mdash; there will be a net increase of between £900 and £1,600 per house.  There are two options available to the purchaser or the builder.  Either the purchaser pays, or the builder absorbs.  Anybody who knows anything about the construction industry over the past couple of years will agree that the margins in the industry are nonexistent at present.  There is absolutely no room to absorb this increase.  Therefore, the second effect is coming into play. There will definitely be fewer people buying and more couples going on to the public housing list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the third effect.  It has been conservatively estimated that there <Col N="2469" /> will be 3,000 fewer new houses built in 1985 <i>vis-à-vis</i> 1984.  It is again conservatively agreed that this means that 5,000 more people will be unemployed as a direct consequence of this budget.  There are 5,000 people working now in the construction industry who will not be working there in 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  While the overall industrial output in 1984 increased by over 7 per cent by comparison to that in 1983, the volume of net agricultural output in the same period increased by 8½ per cent. Following on the gains in 1982 and 1983 agricultural incomes improved again in 1984 and the volume of agricultural exports increased by some 14 per cent. These were very significant improvements indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believe that continued agricultural expansion requires as a first priority policies to achieve stability and certainty in the national economic environment and, in particular, policies to reduce the level of inflation.  The benefits to agriculture of a reduction in the level of inflation can be seen from developments in recent years.  Inflation has been reduced from over 20 per cent in 1980 to an expected 6 per cent or so this year.  Following increases in farm incomes in real terms in 1982 and 1983 there was a further increase of about 3 per cent in real terms in 1984.  In fact real family farm income per head increased by as much as 5 per cent last year.  Despite <Col N="2470" /> the rise in the past month or two interest rates are appreciably lower than they were in 1982.  This has been of particular benefit to farmers &mdash; both those who had already borrowed heavily and those embarking on new investment.</P>
    <P>A further priority of both agriculture and economic policy is that of improving the economic efficiency of production. Increased farm production and incomes are determined to a major extent by the level of efficiency achieved at farm level. It has to be recognised, however, that recent changes in policy at EC level will affect the output pattern of Irish agriculture. Accordingly it is important that spare capacity resulting from the application of the milk super-levy should be used for other enterprises.</P>
    <P>As regards EC developments it is just over a month ago that we relinquished the work and responsibilities associated with handling the Presidency of the European Communities.  We carried out the presidency duties in an assiduous and responsible way, and I believe that the goodwill we built up in that exercise will be a solid support for our future efforts. During the six months that I held the chairmanship of the Agriculture Council, I was able to bring about agreement on several important pieces of Community legislation.  Many of these concerned Mediterranean products and as such were not of direct concern to Ireland.  However, they settled some difficult questions in the operation of the complex Common Agriculture Policy.</P>
    <P>The major point at issue in the Dublin Summit in December was the proposed accession of Spain and Portugal.  The ground work for that involved reaching a conclusion as regards the future wine regime within the Community.  In the preceding six months the Agriculture Council did their ground work for such a common wine regime and as a result it proved an easy enough task to reach a conclusion at the Summit.  That was probably our greatest achievement during our presidency of the Agriculture Council. We got the wine situation into perspective and we got the countries to come to <Col N="2471" /> a degree of understanding as a result of which the Summit was a huge success.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals on agricultural prices and associated measures for 1985-86 have just been presented.  Of course, these proposals do not represent the final outcome, but rather the starting point for long and difficult negotiations at Council level.  I would not wish to comment on them in detail at this stage. Nevertheless I can say that I do not see them as adequately meeting the needs of the farm sector in this country and I will be making determined efforts to have them improved in certain respects.  Of course, some other Ministers will also be seeking to have them changed &mdash; and perhaps in the opposite direction.  Some people will be looking for reductions in prices &mdash; but that is what the protracted negotiations will be all about.</P>
    <P>These negotiations usually last for a month and sometimes for as long as three months.  They are due to start in less than two weeks.  The Commission's proposals are for a reduction of 3.6 per cent in the price of cereals.  They also propose a reduction in commodities which do not concern us very much, Mediterranean fruit and vegetables.  A major item of concern to us is the proposal to increase milk by 1.5 per cent.  There is also a proposal to reduce the co-responsibility levy by 1 per cent which in fact is a net 2.5 per cent increase.  That is not sufficient and we will be looking for a greater price increase.  We will certainly not agree to any reduction as is proposed in the price of cereals.  The Commission propose no change in the price of commodities like beef and lamb.  It is very much in the melting pot.  The Commission's proposals are an opening ploy.  I would expect an improvement on their original offer at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>We have to look not just at the specific price levels proposed but also at other measures accompanying them.  We have to consider the mechanisms used to support price levels as well as the various premiums and measures which operate to increase farm income and promote change and improvement in agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2472" /> I will comment on a statement made by Deputy MacSharry, one of our Euro MPs, in the last couple of weeks.  Deputy MacSharry questioned the continuation of our membership of the EC and whether it was economically worthwhile. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken him up on this point and I am categorical in saying that we certainly will remain members of the EC as it is of tremendous advantage to us economically.  I have just referred to the support mechanisms within the EC. Approximately half the price which farmers here get for their cattle is dependent on the support mechanism or the export refunds.  If a beast is exported the price is £700 to the farmer.  Half of that comes from the support mechanism system.  The EC are subsidising our exports by doubling the price which we would otherwise get.  It would be a calamity for farming if our membership of the EC were put in question or terminated.  The question of being an associated member was raised by Deputy MacSharry but if we were an associate member we could be sure that we would not get the benefits we are at present getting.  It is out of the question that we should cease to be members of the EC.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore in our assessment the important revisions proposed for the agricultural structures policy, which have been before the Council for some time. During the Irish Presidency, we made considerable progress on the difficult and complex structural issues and I believe that a final decision is not now too far away.  The revised structures policy will have an important influence on the development of Irish agriculture in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>In looking at the 1985-86 price package we have to bear in mind that the opportunities are severely limited by the financial constraints on the Community, by the existence of surpluses in a number of important sectors, and by past Community decisions on co-responsibility measures for products such as milk, cereals and sugar.  All the member states have to recognise these constraints and operate within them.  But even within that rather <Col N="2473" /> tight framework, there will still be important options for the Community.  It will be my task to ensure that to the greatest extent possible those options are exercised in a way that will maximise the real benefits to the Irish agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In the milk sector the issue which dominated the past year was, of course, the super-levy.  Inevitably there have been teething problems, some of them quite substantial, in implementing the agreement of last March.  Many of these problems have already been overcome and we will be striving to resolve the remaining ones in the coming weeks.  The new system has not been easy for producers, especially those in special situations.  In this regard the milk cessation premium scheme which I announced in November last should be of considerable benefit. The purpose of the scheme is to free quotas in order that a national reserve can be set up to cater for producers whose deliveries in 1983 were substantially affected by disease or certain other exceptional factors.</P>
    <P>The scheme has received a considerable response from producers throughout the country and has been well over-subscribed. The quantity of milk covered by it is limited to 7 million gallons and a ballot will take place to determine the successful applicants.  The results of this ballot will be announced shortly.  Over the Community as a whole the indications are that both producers and national administrations are coming to terms with the new situation.  As they do and as milk deliveries stabilise or even fall further, I would hope that, in our special circumstances, there could be prospects for some further expansion in Irish output.</P>
    <P>I might add that the amount of milk offered was approximately 17 million gallons. We had money to cover only 7 million gallons and, as I have said, a ballot will take place to determine the successful applicants.  We had a reciprocal response from other vested interests in the dairying industry, notably the co-ops who could bear the cost of funding the remaining quantity of milk offered.  I hope they will do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a matter of which will be successful in the ballot.  As regards the problem relating to the actual figures of our 1983 milk output we are taking all necessary steps to press our case.  I have pointed out to the Council of Ministers that the amendment I am requesting is clearly justified by the Council's own agreement on the super-levy.  Ireland has instituted legal proceedings against the EC Commission in the Court of Justice. The Commission has lodged a defence and Ireland must furnish its comments to the court by 25 February.  When this has been done, we will press for the case to be heard so that an early decision can be obtained.  In the meantime, I will continue to press vigorously at the Council of Ministers for amendments to the super-levy regulations to include a solution to this problem.</P>
      <P>I do not want to sound optimistic.  It is unlikely that extra milk, or loose milk, will become available in 1985 because of the cutbacks in other countries.  This year they will have to cut back by one million tonnes.  They took a very heavy cutback last year, going back to the 1981 figure. Therefore, it is unlikely there will be any further release of milk this year.  During the term of the super-levy it is unlikely that extra milk will become available for Ireland but it is possible that additional milk will become available as the scheme progresses through the five years.  It is not possible to predict accurately how much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly the new system is already having its effect on the market.  In the current milk year Community deliveries have fallen by some 4 per cent.  Combined with a 3 per cent drop in the United States this development gives grounds for some optimism about the prospects of strenghtening international markets for dairy <Col N="2475" /> products.  Community stock levels also have come under control.  This is particularly the case as regards skim milk powder stocks.  These exceeded a million tonnes only a few months ago but they now stand at fewer than 600,000 tonnes.  The Community has also succeeded in disposing of some 200,000 tonnes of intervention butter to the Soviet Union and, even though butter stocks remain high and are likely to increase further in the year ahead, this sale, coupled with the drop in production, should help the market considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the super-levy system had not been there last year milk production within the Community would have been approximately 106 million tonnes. It is now less than 100 million and it will be reduced by another one million tonnes this year.  Accordingly the world situation will become somewhat easier as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, some fundamental problems which continue to inhibit the development of our milk sector.  I refer to matters such as our increasing dependence on intervention products, our failure to diversify into new products, and the lack of tangible progress as regards seasonality of supply and milk composition. These inherent weaknesses leave us vulnerable to the vagaries of international markets and to changes in EC policy.  The super-levy has focused our minds on the dangers of our present situation, and there is a new awareness that the milk sector needs to come to grips with its difficulties as a matter of urgency. In this regard I was greatly impressed by the decision of the industry to support the Bord Bainne market development fund.  An important start has now been <Col N="2476" /> made and I see the decision to support the fund as recognition of the urgent need for greater market expansion and diversification.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a few illustrations. Members of the council were here in September and the German minister asked me what was the price per gallon paid to Irish farmers.  When I told him it was 75p he found it difficult to believe because in Germany it is approximately £1.15 per gallon.  Seeing that it is a common market one would expect a uniform price to obtain throughout the Community. Instead, in Holland, Denmark and other Community countries the price per gallon is well in excess of £1.  The reason is that they produce milk which can be put into highly saleable products such as a variety of cheeses, many of which are imported here.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the point further, in conversation with the Danish minister some months ago he told me that farmers in his district of northern Denmark were seeking permission to import milk into that region, that they did not have sufficient milk to make the products they manufacture at present.  Ten per cent of the milk produced in this area is used for consumption locally &mdash; in other words, liquid milk.  The remaining 90 per cent is converted into cheeses; and there are a whole variety of cheeses processed in that locality, all of that cheese being exported to the USA.  They wanted more milk because their cheese enterprises were not working at full potential and the cutback because of the super-levy meant that they could not operate as efficiently as previously.</P>
    <P>Therefore the message is quite simple and clear: dairy farmers in this country should look at the proposal put forward by An Bord Bainne for this research and development fund.  We need to produce dairy products which can be sold on the world market at the top price, not at give-away prices to the Soviet Union, Cuba or the Middle East.  Eventually we sell off these intervention products, whether it be fodder or skim milk powder at approximately half the cost to the Community, <Col N="2477" /> 50p a pound for butter or whatever. Therefore, we are up somewhat of a <i>cul-de-sac</i> in that regard.  Unless we can produce products which sell freely at a premium price then the price of milk will never be as good as it should be.  An Bord Bainne have the right idea.  I am glad to see that the response has been good.  It was not that good initially when they proposed last year to establish a fund twice as much as they are seeking at present.  I think the original proposal was for about £5 million, which was met by somewhat of a cold shoulder on the part of the various interests.  It is essential that we produce commodities which can be sold on the open market.</P>
    <P>Turning to beef, on the whole 1984 was a very good year.  Many other member states did not fare as well because they had to contend with the depressing effects on the market of unusually large quantities of cow beef.  In other words, countries slaughtered hundreds of thousands of heads of cows because there was no alternative under the super-levy arrangement.  They did not have the opportunity to produce not only extra milk but what they had produced in previous years.  Therefore they had to kill off a huge amount of cows which had an effect on the overall beef market.  This was due to a high level of cow slaughterings as a direct consequence of the super-levy. Our cow slaughterings were at a more normal level with good export out-lets being found for them.</P>
    <P>While EC average prices were relatively depressed our market prices were reasonably buoyant.  Anybody in the cattle trade will vouch for that.  Indeed, steer prices rose so high in the weeks preceding and following Christmas that under Community provisions intervention here had to be suspended for the first time since 1973, an indication of how strong was the trade.  This involved no particular hardship since we were buying hindquarters only at the time and the intake was quite small.  In the past couple of weeks prices have eased a little from the high level reached and intervention buying has recommenced.</P>
    <P>The beef classification grid finally came <Col N="2478" /> into operation for intervention purchasing last April.  However, we have been using that system for quite a few years now.  I would expect that, in conjunction with the meat factories, people will be enabled to get a better price for their cattle by using that grid system.  One of the more remarkable features of the beef market in 1984 was the success of the EC scheme of aids for private storage of beef which ran from July to December.  I have no doubt but that this had a considerable bearing on the very strong market for beef in that period.  When the scheme closed at Christmas contracts for approximately 72,000 tonnes had been taken out, which is substantially more than our total intake into intervention in the whole of 1984.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this type of measure become a continuing part of the market support arrangements.  It reduces our undesirably high level of dependence on intervention, which for many years has been treated by some elements of the beef trade as an outlet to be filled automatically before even looking for commercial markets.  I cannot emphasise that sufficiently: intervention should be used, whether for milk products or for beef, only as a last resort.  Too many enterprises here are using intervention as if it constituted their lifeline.  They are actually processing for intervention, which amounts to economic suicide.  It is an abuse of the intervention system.  My warning is that they would be well advised to steer clear of that practice because, with the financial constraints, we can never be guaranteed that the conditions now pertaining will continue as far as support prices for intervention are concerned. It is a dangerous area on which to be relying too heavily.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the beef export trade has been hit by unilateral import restrictions imposed by Canada.  An annual quota of only 2,700 tonnes has been provided for the EC as a whole by Canada for 1985 whereas Community exports in 1984 were well over 20,000 tonnes, three-quarters of that from Ireland.  This is an unacceptable situation.  We have made our views known to the Canadian <Col N="2479" /> Government.  The matter is under negotiation between the Community and Canada.  I have left the Commission in no doubt as to how strongly we oppose the action taken by Canada and how urgent is the need for a satisfactory settlement. Our agreements with the Canadians in this respect and in many other trade negotiations come within the terms of GATT agreements.  We are at present talking to them on the basis of those GATT agreements.  After all, what is good for the goose is good for the gander: if they think they can cutback our exports to them there is always the possibility that we can do likewise in the opposite direction, but we do not want to enter into that type of situation.  Certainly the action of the Canadians has placed a number of our firms in jeopardy.  We have told the Commission as much and we expect the Commission will be able to talk reason into the Canadians in this regard.  It constitutes a most discriminatory action on their part: that they should cut back our exports from well in excess of 20,000 tonnes last year to 2,700 tonnes this year is not at all acceptable.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there will be spare capacity in other enterprises as a result of the milk super-levy and the capacity will be found particularly in beef and sheep production.  As announced in the national plan, encouragement for the necessary growth in the beef cow herd will be given by raising the beef cow rate under the disadvantaged areas scheme &mdash; that is the headage payment &mdash; from £32 to £70 commencing on 1 January 1986. The increase is subject to EC clearance and this is being pursued.  It means that a farmer in a disadvantaged area from 1 January next will be able to get a maximum of £2,100 in beef cow or cattle headage payments instead of the present maximum of £870 &mdash; well over twice what he is getting at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for the Deputy to worry; I will incorporate it. The maximum headage payments for a farmer in a disadvantaged area will rise from £870 to £2,100, a collossal increase for farmers in those areas.  Ths increase will cost an extra £11 million a year, an enormous injection into the deprived areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in his budget speech the Minister for Finance announced that the existing stock relief arrangements for farmers would be extended for a further year at a cost in 1985 of £3 million.  This is a significant concession to permit farm stock to be built up without incurring a liability to an additional tax burden.  Also in 1985 a number of measures are being taken to improve the genetic merit of our livestock. The national livestock breeding programme is operated by my Department in conjunction with the many interests involved, particularly the artificial insemination bodies and pedigree breeders. In this programme traits of economic importance are measured and recorded in order to identify the best breeding stock.  The subsequent widespread usage <Col N="2481" /> of this stock can assist in improving the quality of our cattle and products with consequential benefits for farmers and our exporters.  An expansion of the programme is timely and desirable and so additional funds are being provided this year to expand the progeny testing programme carried out by my Department in co-operation with the artificial insemination stations and to ensure the maximum usage of the central bull performance test station at Tully.  Under the EC common measure for the development of beef cattle production in Ireland, my Department spent upwards of £500,000 on restructuring and re-equipping this station.  We now have a first class modern performance test station and it is important that its increased capacity should be used to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>The low productivity of ewes is a major constraint on profitability in lowland lamb production.  I referred to that in debates on agriculture.  The low level of fertility in ewes is a cause of major concern. Fertility in our ewes is as low as 1.1 whereas in Britain the level is almost 2-1.8 or 1.9.  It is obvious we must pay particular attention to breeding.  It is important therefore to increase the supply of prolific hill-cross ewes for use by lowland sheep farmers.  My Department initiated a project in 1983 to encourage production of such hill-cross ewes.  This project has been very successful and we are now providing some additional funds for the project which will enable it to be expanded with consequential benefits for our lowland sheep producers.  The total amount for the sheep improvement and cattle progeny and performance testing measures is £100,000 and this will be found within the overall allocation for my Department in the current year.  This will be of particular benefit to sheep farmers in places like Bunclody, Kintealy and surrounding areas.  We might even spread it across the border to the Blackstairs near Carlow.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the disadvantaged areas schemes it was announced in December last that the off-farm income limit is being raised from £3,500 to £6,400 <Col N="2482" /> per annum, which is the western comparable income used for the purposes of the farm modernisation scheme.  Many farmers, county council road workers, forestry workers and other low paid workers, together with seasonal workers, will now benefit under the headage payment scheme.  That was a cause of great discontent in recent years.  It will often be found that these are the thriftiest, the hardest worked and the best type of small farmer one could meet.  This is a tremendous boost to those people because they will once again qualify for headage payments. On the other hand, professional and business people with farms will continue to be excluded because of the level at which the new income limit has been set.</P>
    <P>To pay for the concession and still keep within the Vote allocation for 1985 it has been necessary to make a reduction of £1 per head in the sheep headage grants for 1985.  While the decision to raise the off-farm income limit has been generally welcomed, the same does not apply to the reduction in sheep headage grants.  That is understandable.  The alternative, however, would have been to increase taxation to meet the cost of making this desirable improvement which had been sought by the farming organisations.  We opted for a small cut in sheep rates because the payments per livestock unit for sheep were almost double those on cattle.  In fact, the maximum grant to sheep farmers this year will still be £1,550 whereas the maximum for cattle producers will be £872.  Also under the disadvantaged area scheme the grant aid will be increased from £32 to £70 per beef cow. We have a little bit of good news to offset the reduction in the sheep headage grant. As late as yesterday at a special committee meeting in Brussels it was announced that the EC ewe premium will be increased in respect of the 1984-85 marketing year from £13.13 to £14.50 per ewe.  This will more than offset the reduction of £1 in the headage grant.  Everybody should be happy irrespective of whether their income is under the £6,400 limit or not.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the subject <Col N="2483" /> of bovine disease which constitutes a very substantial element in the expenditure of my Department.  Following the successful inroads against bovine tuberculosis in the early years of the eradication scheme, the stagnation and lack of progress in recent years has been a source of concern. Something has to be done.  In the national plan we announced that we would increase the amount of money spent under this scheme by £10.5 million over the 1984 figure, but we qualified that by saying there would have to be rigid conditions invoked.  The most rigid condition is that from now on the farmer will not nominate the vet, but I, as Minister, will do so.  That has caused some controversy and I do not wish to refer too much to the debate which is going on at the moment because negotiations are at a very delicate stage, as everybody will appreciate.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we get this disease under control and eliminated because the amount of money being spent on it is enormous.  The taxpayer is contributing, the farmer is a contributor through the medium of the disease levy and the Exchequer also contributes this money. But the farmer is the person who suffers most at the end of the day because it is a very traumatic experience to have a herd wiped out because of tuberculosis.  The frequency with which this is occurring is not decreasing despite the huge amount of money being spent on the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is my responsibility as Minister to see that this disease is eliminated and I have to take tough action.  Nobody will thank me if I do not.  We have to grasp the nettle.  We are going to tighten up every aspect of the scheme within my Department as well as in the field.  I have laid down a condition for the early removal of reactor animals.  Leaving reactors on farms for a long time after diagnosis is a major cause of the spread of the disease.  Other conditions laid down by the Government are tighter controls at marts, resolute prosecution in all cases of breaches of the rules, and the setting up of a central epidemiology unit to co-ordinate and assist in disease out-break investigations at local level.  I want <Col N="2484" /> the testing to be done quickly and in blocks.  I do not want the testing done sporadically.  I want it done within a matter of weeks.  This will take a lot of co-operation and goodwill and that is why I do not want to cause any problems by dwelling on the subject here today.</P>
    <P>I know that the new system of direct nomination is a departure from existing procedures but it is the best way to tackle the problem.  We have a particular difficulty in this country in that cattle on average during their lifetime are moved five or six times from one location to another.  On the Continent, cattle are moved once or twice at most during their lifetime but we have a trading tradition whereby cattle move at different stages from one part of the country to another which promotes the continuation of the disease.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals made by the EC Commission for future agricultural structures will be finalised fairly soon. The debate on new agricultural structures has been going on for the past year in the Council of Ministers.  The new structures directive will replace Directive 159 which is basically the farm modernisation scheme as we know it.  We have almost reached a conclusion in that debate but the big stumbling block is a disagreement between the Danes and some other countries with regard to grant aid for pigs. The Danes are looking for grant aid for almost an unlimited number of pigs in a piggery and the other countries say that there must be a limit of about 450 or 500. That may sound like a minor issue but it has turned out to be a stumbling block.</P>
    <P>When the new measures are introduced we will be catering for a wider band of farmers than under the present directive since the Community funding will no longer be restricted to farmers able to show by means of a development plan that they can achieve the comparable income on the completion of the plan.  The new measure also includes provision for assistance for young farmers who take over a farm for the first time. We call it an installation grant and it is intended to help them towards meeting installation costs.  There is also a provision <Col N="2485" /> for higher investment grants for young farmers who take out improvement plans.  Both as Minister and as President of the Council of Ministers, I have consistently pressed for an early agreement on these measures for farmers even in the face of opposition by some other member states but I am hopeful of a successful outcome to our efforts.  Some countries do not want to grant any aid to young farmers in the new structures and we have been foremost in leading the assault in that regard.  We want an installation grant to be paid.  I am not saying that future investment aid will be available just for the asking.  The new scheme, like the old one, will be aimed at the full time farmer who is able to satisfy the necessary conditions to abide by the rules.  This will involve drawing up a plan for the material improvement of the holding, keeping accounts and satisfying certain criteria as to the existing income levels and vocational skills.  It has many attractive features but there is always the problem of the cost of its implementation.</P>
    <P>It is great to have magnificent schemes coming from Brussels but we are not always able to meet the cost as other countries are.  In other countries, farming is a tiny percentage of their overall economic situation so they can afford to boost farming and the more they boost it the less they have to import, which solves their balance of payments problems. Countries which are industrially rich can afford to give fantastic aids and match everything the EC has to offer.  We are not as prosperous although we do our best.  If we spend a sum of £2 million on an EC scheme this year we can, in some cases, get back half that amount.  However, we have to wait a year before we can recoup it.  As 50 per cent is the most that we can recoup, many of these schemes, especially the new structural directives, will only yield a 25 per cent recoupment.  To get a sum of £1 million back, we have to spend £4 million and wait for a year to get it, so it is clear there is a financial problem in that regard.</P>
    <P>The western drainage scheme and the western package, a relatively new scheme, are not going as well as we would have wished.  However, the western drainage <Col N="2486" /> scheme has justified itself beyond all doubt with approvals issued for the field drainage of some 165,000 hectares or 330,000 acres.  In 1981 we received so many applications that we could not deal with any more but I am glad to say that we are providing £3 million for that scheme in 1986 and the same amount for 1987 so drainage work can start again. We are reviewing the western package in conjunction with the farming organisations and we hope that we can come up with a new system which will work more effectively.  We will take all views into consideration.</P>

      <P>Farming has never done better than in the past two years although all other sectors of the economy are in recession.  Even taking inflation into account, farm incomes have jumped. Volume increase last year was 14 per cent greater than the previous year and income levels were as high as 5 per cent in real terms.</P>

      <P>Over the past year or so there have been expert studies by groups such as the Horticultural Development Group and the Interdepartmental Committee on Food Imports.  The findings of their reports can provide the basis for the adaptation measures that need to be taken <Col N="2487" /> by the industry.  A number of financial provisions are being made in 1985 to assist progress.  These will be met from within the overall provision already made for my Department.</P>
      <P>The glasshouse industry uses mainly fuel oil as a heating medium.  I intend to give grants for people to convert from oil to solid fuel.  We are awaiting sanction from Brussels in this regard but we do not anticipate any difficulty.  A sum of £300,000 is being provided for this type of conversion in 1985.</P>
      <P>It is apparent that there is a gap in co-ordination between producer and trade interests in the fruit and vegetable market.  This results in periods of over supply and under supply and sometimes unnecessary imports which could be avoided with proper planning.  Last year, we initiated financial aid towards improved market co-ordination for glasshouse products and this year the aid is being extended to other horticultural crops.  A sum of £50,000 is being provided for this purpose.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for more co-operation between growers to ensure that the production and marketing of horticultural produce is better organised.  Aid is already available for the setting up of producer groups and I am providing a further £50,000 to help with the formation of co-operative enterprises.  This should assist the horticultural industry to modernise and revitalise their organisational activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to land policy, a decision was made last year to abolish the Land Commission which had been comparatively inactive for the last five years.  Very little if any acquisition took place in that time.  Very few estates were available for acquisition and the price of land in the late seventies and early eighties was prohibitive as far as the Commission were concerned.  We will be getting rid of the land on hands which amounts to 40,000 acres.  If we cannot do it by the conventional method we may have to introduce a tendering system.  We will continue a series of activities where the ownership or management of agricultural land is concerned.  We will be promoting the <Col N="2488" /> long term leasing concept, group purchase of land, commonage division and rearrangement of fragmented farms.</P>
    <P>The Land Act passed shortly before Christmas was the first Land Act since 1965.  It was small but fundamental legislation. What we are trying to do is promote long term leasing and displace the 11 month letting system.  Under that system about one million acres of land are tied up.  We would like to see that land utilised through long term leasing.</P>
    <P>We encourage long term leasing in the budget by bringing in income tax concessions. The first £2,000 of leasing income will be exempt from tax liability.  The lessor must be over 55 years of age or incapacitated.  The lease must be for not less than seven years.  Arising from the Government's commitment, the social welfare code is being examined to see whether there are any ways to encourage landowners to release land for leasing. Last year social welfare legislation provided that the means of a farmer who leased his land would be assessed on the same basis as a farmer who let his land under the 11 month system.  This provision changed the system of assessing income for social welfare purposes, which previously discriminated against leasing and was an obstacle to its adoption.</P>
    <P>We have continued the exemption from stamp duty which is another welcome relief.  It gives people an incentive to transfer land to their sons or daughters. I mention &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; because of you know who.</P>

      <P>Sons, daughters, nieces, sisters, brothers and nephews.  We have the lowest rate of land mobility in the EC.  Only 3 per cent of our land changes hands each year and most of that is through inheritance and not sales.  Reference was made in recent times to the rescue package which has been in operation for the last three years.  No specific mention was made of the continuation of the rescue package by the Minister for Finance but when I was speaking on radio <Col N="2489" /> on the day of the budget I said I would bear in mind the movement in interest rates when I was considering any future action on the rescue package.  I am not giving any commitment or saying anything. The rescue package is due to come to an end in two months time but the position will be viewed in the light of the success of this scheme over the last three years and also in the light of prevailing interest rates.  I am not dismissing, confirming or saying anything else.  We are reviewing the situation and that is as much as I want to say on that issue.  It has been very beneficial and got many farmers out of financial difficulty.  If the Government regard its renewal or continuation for a limited period as being necessary and desirable then that will be given very serious consideration.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn knows what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past two years the Government have taken a courageous and firm line on expenditure, taxation and borrowing. The results are clearly evident in the level of inflation which has been successfully reduced to about the average level for the EC as a whole.  We used to be top of the league, with the Greeks and the Italians a close third but now we are in the middle of the bunch.  That is considerable progress.  As far as agriculture is concerned, the budget is aimed primarily at ensuring an economic environment in which the industry can prosper.  We are determined to maintain the agricultural progress and the increases in real farm income that have been achieved over the past two years. This involves sustained efforts not only by the Government but also by those involved in agriculture, at production, processing and marketing levels.  For their part the Government have been making strenuous efforts to ensure that farmers are able to operate in economic conditions that are conducive to expansion and development.  This budget provides the framework within which the maintenance and improvement of those conditions can continue in 1985.  There is nothing but positive elements in the budget for the farming community. <Col N="2490" /> There are no resource taxes or 2 per cent levies irrespective of income.  The budget is positive and progressive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  In his summing up, the Minister said he hoped this budget would ensure an economic climate in which agriculture could prosper. I regret to say that not only agriculture but no other industry could prosper under the budget.</P>
      <P>This budget was born out of political expediency and has nothing to do with economic necessity.  The budget is antiemployment. It does not do anything for the 243,000 people who are on the dole. I ask any member of Fine Gael or Labour to point to one concrete piece that the Minister for Finance announced last Wednesday week that does anything for the unfortunate people who are unemployed. It does not do anything either for employers.  There is no incentive for them.  Industrialists are trying to perform in a climate where there are extraordinarily high VAT rates, astronomical electricity costs, huge transport costs due in part to the poor condition of the road-ways, high postal and telephone charges and crippling PRSI rates at 12 per cent which is a taxation on employment.</P>
      <P>Real interest charges over the past year have been 8 per cent, whereas in the UK it was 5.1 per cent, in the United States it was 4.5 per cent and in Germany it was 3.7 per cent.  All these things have an adverse effect on industry and on attracting foreign industry.  Another problem industrialists have to cope with is paying rates and service charges.  In some cases planning permission conditions include the provision of finance for parking in our towns.  The overriding concern of industry is to encourage the creation of conditions which will stimulate profitable industrial expansion at a rate which is sufficient to meet the needs of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government are not doing anything to create those conditions.  We should be in a position to reward risk. We should be supporting manufacturing industry.  We must have a reduction in <Col N="2491" /> current public sector borrowing.  One of the platforms on which this Government took office was the reduction of the current budget deficit by 1987.  At least the Taoiseach has admitted now that the Government are unable to do that.  What happened the commitment to halt and reverse unemployment which stood at 170,000 when the Taoiseach took office? The latest figures show that it is 243,000. What do the Government propose to do about unemployment?</P>
    <P>I outlined the problems experienced by industrialists and manufacturers but the problem is no easier for those at work. Personal taxation does not give any incentive to work.  There is an unwillingness among workers to accept promotion because it may put them into a higher tax band.  There is unwillingness to work overtime because of the penal tax workers will have to pay at the end of the week.  Workers are encouraged to opt out of employment and go sick, claim disability benefit and work the very lucrative black economy.  Personal taxation must be radically restructured if we are to encourage people to work again.  The incentive to work must be restored.  In the long run, workers will be motivated only by more pay in their pockets at the end of the week.  I know of industries where managers literally have had to drive out to their workers houses and plead with them to come to work because the workers decided that to work for February and March is unprofitable.  That is a very sorry situation.</P>
    <P>The high rates of indirect taxes have resulted in considerable losses to the economy as goods and services are purchased abroad.  VAT at the point of entry on industrial raw materials represents an interest-free loan from industry to the Government.  It reduces the capacity of industry to fund working capital and, therefore, employment with consequential losses to the State.  The whole question of taxation has to be dealt with sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the construction industry is on its knees.  However, in his wisdom the Minister for Finance decided <Col N="2492" /> he was going to take the head off the construction industry.  The VAT increase from 5 to 10 per cent was sinful.  Overall the effect of that increase on the output of the construction industry, excluding direct labour which is not chargeable, will be an increase in VAT of £75 million and that is based on figures for 1984-85.  The cost on private housing, agriculture and industrial and commercial development will be £40.5 million.  A sum of approximately £30 million will be taken from the public work carried out by the private sector such as local authority housing, schools, hospitals, roads, sanitary services and public buildings.  A sum of £623 million is estimated to have been the output for new private housing in 1984.</P>
    <P>The increase of VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent will result in an increased tax take of approximately £30 million.  I give the following facts from a submission by the CIF.  In respect of a house costing £36,000, the price will increase by £1,714. The Minister, with a fanfare, stated he was increasing the new house grant by £750.  The price of all new houses will increase by 5 per cent and only first-time purchasers will be able to avail of the increased grant.  A reduction of VAT on materials used in house construction will have no effect on house prices as building companies, being registered for VAT, are entitled to reclaim that VAT.  There will not even be a cash flow advantage from these VAT reductions because the refunding of VAT is normally effected within the credit period that operates in the building industry, that is, they are able to get credit within two months.</P>
    <P>The effect on the labour force in the construction industry will mean an increase in unemployment, which is a major problem.  The effect of the VAT increase will add between £900 and £1,700 to every new house, and that is a net figure.  This increase will have to be funded either by the builders or the purchasers and because builders have been going through a very lean time in the past two years they will be unable to carry this increase.  Last year 170 building companies deregistered from the national housebuilding guarantee scheme.  That is <Col N="2493" /> the only yardstick we can use and it is an indication of the problems faced by the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The imposition and increase of VAT is self-defeating and counter-productive and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  The 5 per cent increase will only exacerbate the problems of the construction industry.  There is no prospect of an increase in activity in that industry so long as this Government continue to follow the policies outlined by the Minister for Finance.  How could any Minister justify an increase on a home industry while, at the same time, decreasing VAT on Japanese and German colour television sets, hi-fi systems and radios? Because of this increase in VAT, an additional 5,000 building workers will be put on the live register and that is not something to be proud of.  It will have a consequential effect on the Exchequer because these workers will have to be paid unemployment benefit initially and then unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It will also have the effect of putting more couples on local authority housing lists.  Up to now young couples who could find a way to purchase their own homes did so, but the additional increase will put that prospect out of their reach.  They will have to be housed by the local authorities. Incidentally, I suspect the Government have under-financed the current housing allocation for local authorities. After 1 May, when the new increase on VAT will be applied, more than 47 per cent of the price of a new house in one way or another will find its way back to the Exchequer.  That is not good enough. Young people should be encouraged to build their own houses but what the Government are proposing will make that impossible.  The increase in VAT will also have a knock-on effect in respect of employment in builders' providers, concrete manufacturers and woodwork establishments. The role of the construction industry in our economy is of vital importance but I am afraid this Government do not take it seriously.</P>
    <P>The CIF have put certain proposals to the Government.  One is that VAT should apply only to that portion of the <Col N="2494" /> selling price which constitutes actual building activity &mdash; that is, materials, sub-contracted labour and direct labour &mdash; and should exclude the site cost, financial contributions, betterment levies, collection charges, interest, legal fees, etc.  This represents about 50 per cent of the selling price of a house.  Thus VAT should be assessed on 50 per cent of the house only. Their second proposal to the Minister is that, recognising that the first proposal has implications for the Exchequer and that the Budget Statement announced an increase in the grant for first time buyers of £1,750, in no case should a first time purchaser receive in excess of £4,000 from a combination of mortgage interest subsidy and new house grant.  The Minister would do well to look at those proposals.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note some statistics from the construction industry.  Construction industry output in money terms in 1981 was £1,907 million.  In 1984 in monetary terms it was £1.8 billion.  That speaks for itself.  In real terms the annual output for the construction industry is down by over 32 per cent in the four year period.  The impact of the decline in the construction output over the past four years on employment is that some 24,000 building workers have lost their jobs.  At the end of 1984 there were 79,000 workers employed in the construction industry.  In 1981 the figure was over 101,000.  One in two of the construction industry workforce is now unemployed. The official figure for unemployment in the construction industry in December 1984 was 45,000.  This represents an increase of 3,500 on the December 1983 figure, which amounted to an increase in the level of unemployment of 8.5 per cent in one year, and with the Minister's proposals of an increase in VAT this will be increased by a further 5,000 people.</P>
    <P>Our health services are in decline.  Cuts in service are causing severe hardship all over the country.  To say that the doctors are not on good terms with the Minister would be putting it mildly.  In the South-Eastern Health Board region patients awaiting dental treatment must wait over six months.  In some cases patients awaiting <Col N="2495" /> dentures must wait over a year.  I know of a lady over 80 years of age who broke her dentures a year ago and is still awaiting a new set from the health board. Long delays in admission to hospitals are being experienced.  But for some religious orders of nuns and the professional attitude and commitment of nurses and doctors many parts of our health services would have shut down long ago.</P>
    <P>This Government should encourage industries such as forestry and fisheries. In the liquidations in the forestry business over the last year the biggest single creditor in most cases was the Revenue Commissioners. This speaks for itself.  The Government are too much involved in industry and they take too much out of it.  Because the Revenue Commissioners are secured creditors they will get their money, but the knock-on effect on the smaller businesses who have provided materials to these companies is that they are forced out of business.  Again I ask the Minister to look more favourably on all manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has been decimated over the past year.  In 1984 BIM repossessed 12 boats out of a total fleet of 200 and it is rumoured that in 1985 they propose to repossess 40.  In the runup to when Spain will take its place as a member of the EC one questions this attitude of BIM.  They should be encouraging our fishermen who have not been making the best use of our fishing potential. If they do not make full use of it within the next two years then it may be too late to do so when the Spaniards arrive.  The Spaniards will not hang around.</P>
    <P>The question of employment agencies must be examined.  We have a duplication in some areas here.  I would like to see the National Manpower Service, the employment exchanges and the Youth Employment Agency all working out of the one office.  At the moment the unemployed person registers with the employment exchange, then goes down town and registers with the National Manpower Service, and he may contact the Youth Employment Agency to see if they have <Col N="2496" /> anything for him.  All of these agencies must be co-ordinated and there is no better place for that than the county councils, who have highly skilled and trained officials.  At the moment county council officials are hamstrung by Department regulations.  Over the years they have been seen to do their part under different administrations in very trying circumstances.  I would like to see the offices and officials of the county councils used to co-ordinate the activities of the various employment agencies.</P>
    <P>We listened with great interest to the Minister for Agriculture today.  However, following on the debacle of the super-levy last year the morale of our farmers is at an all-time low.  The industrious farmer who over the past five or six years spent a great deal of time and energy improving his holding now finds himself in very difficult circumstances. Such farmers deserve encouragement, and I hope that the Minister in his wisdom will give them all the assistance they need.  I was glad to hear the Minister comment on the bovine TB eradication programme.  It would be a severe setback to the Irish economy if negotiations currently in progress between the Minister and the Irish Veterinary Union were to break down.  We saw the effects of that under a previous Coalition Government. Downstream agricultural industries must be promoted.  It is wrong of Deputies on both sides of the House to stand up in this Chamber and criticise Irish people for buying imported produce.  The Irish purchaser will buy a product that is presented properly and priced competitively. I see a role for some Government agencies in promoting the better presentation of our agricultural produce and also gearing the pricing so that it would be competitive by the time it hits our supermarket shelves.  I know that our major supermarkets are only too willing to encourage Irish manufacturers, including our farmers.  Every supermarket group represented in Ireland is anxious to buy Irish wherever possible, but they do not always do so.  For people to stand up and criticise our major supermarkets for not displaying Irish goods is wrong. <Col N="2497" /> They are playing their part; it is for the producers to play theirs.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about abuses in the social welfare system particularly in relation to disability benefit and unemployment benefit and assistance.  The Government must tackle this problem.  It is an area in which large savings could be made.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that, having put the telecommunications area into a semi-private situation, the Government are saying now that the board should contribute to the national Exchequer.  That is a shortsighted approach because all they are doing is ensuring that the board can only find the money by increasing costs to the consumer.  Likewise, the rates bill which the ESB have to meet is passed on to the consumer in the form of increased charges for electricity.</P>
    <P>The Government should give more thought, too, to the area of tourism, an area that is not competitive as a result mainly of excessive taxation in the form of VAT, PRSI and income tax.  There is great potential in tourism but this potential is not being harnessed.  How many times do we hear that it is cheaper to go on a continental holiday than to spend one's holidays at home in Ireland?  This results in big losses to the Irish Exchequer. With the exception of the Dublin area, hotel bed accommodation is not booked to capacity.  The only reason for the exception in the case of Dublin is that the city is the commercial centre of the country.  Where possible the Government should endeavour to bring about a reduction in taxes in those areas relating to tourism so that we may encourage our people to holiday in Ireland while encouraging as many foreigners as possible to spend their holidays here.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget to help the 243,000 unemployed.  Neither will it do anything for the industrialist or the manufacturer who wish to employ people here and it does not help in any way the overtaxed worker.  The budget can be summed up as having no effect other than <Col N="2498" /> keeping the Coalition parties together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget, a budget which I am confident will stimulate the economy and which will give an impetus to the business sector for a positive approach to expanding in the years ahead.  For the first time in years the complaints of the PAYE sector have been recognised. There are now to be only three rates of income tax and there is to be a reduction in the top rate.  I doubt if anyone could disagree with the reduction in the higher rate.  Some 220,000 people will benefit from the changes which, though small, are perhaps a first step in the direction of relieving some of the burden.  It will be important that in future budgets people in the £8,000 to £11,000 income category will be recognised and be put within a single taxband because these are the people who are becoming the new poor. Now that the Government have shown their will to change the system I am sure they will work towards alleviating the burden on the group I have referred to. All parties have lacked the will to make a serious effort to change the inadequate and unfair systems but this Government have made a positive start in this regard. In the past ten years Governments have not shown any direct response to the need for change.  They have simply continued to operate the system as they found it, merely adding more rates each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in the higher VAT rate to 23 per cent.  This reduction will affect a wide range of household items and also some industrial materials. It should improve matters considerably for the electrical trade as well as leaving us more competitive.  In addition it will help to stop cross-Border shopping.  From his knowledge of a Border area the Ceann Comhairle will be well aware of the problems created for traders in that area by reason of the differences in the prices of various goods as between here and the North.  This has had a serious impact on jobs in the past five years but I am confident that the measures taken by the Government will result in the restoration <Col N="2499" /> of some of those jobs.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the number of VAT rates and the abolition of the 35 per cent rate is very welcome and should help to stimulate the tourist industry also.  Opposition spokesmen have been telling us that we should do something positive about the tourist industry but we have taken such steps in terms of the reduction in VAT on hotel accommodation and on short term caravan and boat hire.  That measure should improve considerably our competitiveness and should create a large number of jobs at peak times.</P>
    <P>I welcome, too, the reduction in VAT on newspaper sales.  This should benefit that hard-pressed sector who must contend with such severe competition from the English newspapers.  The Government's action should ensure that jobs will be protected in the newspaper industry.</P>
    <P>However, the increase in VAT from 5 to 10 per cent on the sale of new houses should be reviewed.  Such an increase would do untold damage to the hard-pressed builders.  Instead of an increase I submit that there should be a zero tax rate in this respect.  The increase will add £1,500 to the cost of a house now costing £30,000.  If the rate had been zeroed it would have been possible to abolish the £1,000 grant and in that way we would have been reducing the cost of new houses.  It is easy for the Opposition to make the point that the rate should not have been increased and that something should be done about it now.  I have not yet heard a proposal on how to make up the difference which the Minister intends to make up by the increase in VAT.  I realise the severe hardship that increase will have on builders and on home buyers.  However, there is no point in making comments about it and saying that it should not be done.  When we had got to the stage of introducing two or three rates of VAT, it was inevitable that some area would be hit harder than others, which has happened in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider an area where the money might be made up to reduce VAT on the sale of new houses to zero.  He should consider the introduction <Col N="2500" /> of VAT on worm drenches and on veterinary fees.  At the moment no VAT applies here to either of those items, but VAT applies in all other countries.  This would mean that a large number of farmers would have to register for VAT, but that would not be such a bad thing.  With the increased costs on diesel oil and other items, they would be eligible to claim relief.  This proposal should be discussed in Government and the Government, in turn, should discuss it with the organisations involved to seek out a solution.</P>
    <P>In other professional areas VAT is charged on fees and I see no reason why the veterinary profession should be any different.  The profit on worm drench and other such supplies, I believe, is between 200 and 300 per cent.  It could carry a VAT rate without any increase to the farmers.  This business, I am informed, has a turnover here of between £60 million and £65 million in any one year.  I am putting forward these proposals in an attempt to alleviate the serious problems in the building industry and the ever increasing cost of new houses to first time buyers.  There is no point in making comments inside or outside this House about what could or should be done without putting forward concrete proposals as to where the necessary money will come from.</P>
    <P>The CIF knew as well as everybody else that there would be two or three rates of VAT.  They should have made more use of their politicians in ensuring that they were not affected by pointing out what would happen if there were increases.  They have admitted that they did not do this.  They may not be late again.</P>
    <P>The reduction of excise duty on televisions shows the Government's determination to help in every way to stop cross-Border shopping.  I recall the work and efforts of the Opposition spokesman on Finance around Christmas time in meeting the shoppers on their way to and from Northern Ireland, spending money which they had earned here.  It is hard to credit that when these changes were made the spokesman had nothing good to say about them.  All he had to say was that we had <Col N="2501" /> reduced the excise duty and VAT on imported goods.  The main point of the exercise was to give some real, positive employment back to that industry which has suffered because of increased taxes over the years.</P>
    <P>The increase of 20 per cent in social welfare payments is very welcome and more than generous, given that inflation has been brought down since 1981 from 20 per cent to under 6 per cent this year. According to people who have recently been in other European countries, we have one of the best social welfare services in Europe.  This has come about by proper management of the economy, especially in the area of the control and increase of wages over the last three years.</P>
    <P>When the Leader of the Opposition became Taoiseach in 1979 at every turn, no matter what increase an interest group looked for it was granted, without taking into consideration where any of that money was coming from and whether the businesses had the ability to pay.  As a result a large number of businesses went to the wall because they were not able to compete with 20 per cent inflation and pay increases in salary of the order of 15 to 17 per cent over that period of time. With regard to the real increases in expenditure which took place over that period of time, we must give recognition to inflation now being reduced to 6 per cent.  Very recently somebody told me that last year was the first time in five years that he felt he had a real income and that his money went further.  That relates back to keeping inflation under control.</P>
    <P>From September 1984 up to Christmas the Opposition have promised to reverse almost every Government decision to curb spending.  These reversals would cost around £575 million.  If the Opposition are going to fulfil those promises if returned to office, they should tell the people exactly where the money will come from and who will pay for it in the end.  There are only two ways in which it can be done: either by borrowing and at the end of the day increasing taxes to repay the borrowing, or taking money off <Col N="2502" /> one end of controlled expenditure and spending it on others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy made the point earlier that they would do away with local charges. He has changed his attitude since then and has said that they would give the county councils the right to recommend their own charges to the people.  We certainly know why the county councils are short of money and why our county and other roads are in a deplorable condition. When rates on houses and the tax on cars were abolished an enormous amount of money was lost to the Exchequer and to the county councils.  Over that period of four or five years we were left short of income of between £700 million and £1,000 million.  If we had that money today I have no doubt that we could be talking about a single rate of income tax of about 40 per cent compared with what the industrial worker has to put up with to pay for our interest on debt which has accrued over the last ten years.  I do not say that Fianna Fáil are to blame for all of this.  I should like to see the day when we would have a single rate of income tax, but there is no doubt that within the next 20 years we will not see our debt done away with.</P>
    <P>As far as the farming community are concerned the continuation of the stock relief arrangement which will be extended for this year will cost the Exchequer an extra £3 million.  That is welcomed by the farming community. The extension of the stamp duty relief which is to be continued on the transfer of lands to younger farmers is also very welcome.  I am getting more worried about the monopoly controlling the cattle industry.  The three people controlling the cattle industry decided that at the end of the year from September to December they would buy cattle and would then go out and get contracts to sell the cattle in Europe and the Third World countries. Today we have a situation where hundreds and maybe thousands of cattle are available for slaughter and the prices being quoted mean that the factories are not interested in killing the cattle.  I would like to see the three people monopolising the cattle industry organising so as to <Col N="2503" /> ensure that there will be a market for the cattle that farmers are producing during the 12 months of the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan recently suggested that the IFA were not being hard enough on this Government.  That strikes me as strange because looking back over the years the IFA were really hard on the then Fianna Fáil Government when the farmers over a three year period took a 52 per cent decrease in their incomes and the response from the Government was the introduction of the 2 per cent levy and resource tax.  I was one of those full-time farmers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you still are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a full-time politician today.  Because of those proposals and the way inflation is running we will have a serious problem with farmers who developed.  Farmers who had invested in the future and in improving their standard of living and their income felt that the Government at that time had ensured that their incomes would drop drastically. As a result we have a situation today in which farmers' incomes are as low as they were four years ago.  Deputy Noonan's contribution is not true to form.  If that is the type of slagging he got involved in, certainly the criticism at the time of the then leadership of the IFA was quite right because incomes declined over that period.  I would make a special case for the continuation of the rescue package for 4,500 to 5,000 farmers who are in severe need.  Because of the inflation rates and interest rates the introduction of the rescue package has been of real benefit to more than 8,000 farmers.  The information that we have at present is that 4,000 of those farmers would survive without it in the coming year but the other 4,000 certainly require it for their survival.  I hope the Government will be able to protect those farmers because it was the expensive money which started them into a decline from 1979 to 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the overall policy of the Government on unemployment the <Col N="2504" /> reduction in the VAT rates should certainly produce a sizeable number of jobs in the tourist industry, in small firms and in the electrical business.  The enterprise allowance scheme has been a success with over 5,000 people starting up their own businesses and receiving grants from the Government.  With the State agencies we can go a lot further and ensure that people with ideas can set up in business. The social employment scheme will open up enormous avenues for the long term unemployed.  About 10,000 people will benefit from this scheme in 1985 and if the scheme is worked properly it will be the first time any Government have been prepared to transfer money from the Department of Social Welfare to enable people to work without being cut off unemployment assistance.  We all realise that there will never be full time employment but this scheme will certainly help to ensure that large numbers of people will get the opportunity to work even on a part time basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to see something positive being done about the abuses of the unemployment schemes.  We recently saw a report in the papers that more than 100 people were caught for social welfare abuses in a constituency in North Dublin. The real unemployment figure is way below the official figures.  There are between 40,000 and 60,000 people who can work but who are drawing unemployment assistance.  If these people were honest just think how much better off our country would be by not having to pay that money each week and on the other hand the amount of benefit and goodwill that would accrue from these people working within the system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax incentive for land leasing.  As a result, we should see many acres being transferred to young farmers in the next 12 years and this indirectly should help our exports.  I was delighted to see the Government recognise the special olympics for the handicapped which will take place this year.  There will be more than 2,000 participants.  I welcome the decision to contribute £150,000 for training for the 1988 Olympic Games.  I am sure that after those <Col N="2505" /> Olympics we will be proud of our athletics. I hope that the introduction of a national lottery will benefit our sports activities, particularly the training of thousands of our school children.  We will have a much better country if we have better physically trained young people.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to some Opposition speakers on the budget and its effects.  We have heard the criticisms but not any positive approach towards solving our problems.  Even though they receive £250,000 towards the preparation of their policies, they have not come forward with a single positive idea for the good of the country.  They should be telling the people what they would be doing if in office rather than continuing with their attitude of knocking everything done by the Government since November 1982.  It is a game of power for power's sake.  Deputy Power has said clearly that if there is more money to be borrowed it should be borrowed instead of telling our young people that all borrowings must be repaid with interest. Because of the proportion of the tax yield which we are using to pay interest on foreign debt we will have problems for years.</P>
    <P>I was glad of the opportunity to be able to comment on the budget and its beneficial effects on the economy.  It will do much to stimulate employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I first compliment the Minister for Finance.  There are some good things in the budget, like the reduction in betting tax and the reduction in some of the tax bands.  It will not cost a lot of money.  Above all, I must compliment the Minister on his superb acting in the presentation of the budget.  I have no doubt that if he were a candidate at a drama festival he would get 100 marks for presentation, though not for content. We must give him credit for his presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knew the Coalition were at a low ebb and he had to play to the backbenches, particularly in the Labour Party, who were anxious to preserve some credibility and vestige of identity. He gave them something to enthuse over <Col N="2506" /> and he gave the media manipulators the chance they were looking for.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the Minister had very little room for manoeuvre.  He saw a light at the end of the tunnel but in the past few weeks it has not been glowing as brightly as it did and is now a mere flash in the pan.  When the public sit back and look at the true features of the budget they will see it for what it is.</P>
    <P>The show does not appear to be over yet because during every break in television we hear the public being admonished. I listened to Deputy Durkan here recently and I am sure he believed what he was saying.  I compliment him on his acting when he was saying how the country would benefit from the budget.  If those over there believe that they must be very naive because nobody else does.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has only succeeded in postponing the evil day.  <i>Building on Reality</i> may look fine on a title page but the true reality is that the Irish people have made up their minds about this kind of Government.  They have decided on the fate of the fourth Coalition already.  The budget presentation this year can only be likened to a man about to be sentenced to death.  When asked what he would like before being executed he said he would like to sing &ldquo;Ten billion green bottles hanging on the wall&rdquo;.  If he could juggle with figures long enough he might just save his life, but reality is much different.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to borrowing and about Fianna Fáil borrowing.  I will refer to borrowing and the budget deficit. In the last general election campaign when we met Fine Gael propaganda-inspired people at doors we learned that the two issues on which they fought the election were credibility and the attitude to borrowing.  The Taoiseach was portrayed as a clever, honest man whom the nation could trust.  I, personally, have always expressed doubts on his ability to lead the country along the right road and I have the greatest reservations about him properly pursuing the unification of our island and preserving our neutrality as a sovereign independent state.  In the past few months my reservations have <Col N="2507" /> been proved to be well founded.  So much for leadership.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Government's attitude to borrowing.  They set themselves the target to eliminate the current budget deficit and they nearly caused a Labour revolution in their early days when they said it might be done in three years.  They adjusted that target to five years, subsequently to seven years and have given up the ghost altogether in this budget.  The current budget deficit is £1,234 million or 8 per cent of GNP, an increase of £200 million on last year.  As the previous speaker said, that is money borrowed which will have to be repaid.  It is more than we ever borrowed.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Exchequer current and capital borrowing for this year we will see that it is over £2,000 million or 13 per cent of GNP.  That is an admission to me that they cannot do what they promised &mdash; I suppose an admission that Fianna Fáil were bad but that they are much worse.  To make matters worse still they have nothing to show for it.  We tightened our belts, donned our sack cloth and ashes for the last two years and it did not do one damned bit of good as far as the country is concerned.  No wonder they now resent anybody referring to the term &ldquo;fiscal rectitude.&rdquo;  It is now a nasty word, something of which they should not be reminded.  Perhaps we should now substitute the phrase &ldquo;economic ineptitude&rdquo;.  They have failed in their principal promise to the electorate: that there would be no more borrowing. They are now in Government on borrowed time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking on television last evening, told what he would like to do for the next three years.  I hope the next three years will not be like the last two because, if they are, they will cripple the country.  I am convinced that the people will not accept a Coalition until 1987.  It is unthinkable that we should be faced with a situation like that.</P>
    <P>I might turn now to my priorities for the country and I will endeavour to be positive.  The first thing any Government today should do is to think about jobs. <Col N="2508" /> After that in order of priority I would put equity of taxation.  I do not know whether people in the benches opposite would share my view.  I know people are worried about law and order, about the Six Counties, educational cutbacks, health cuts, super-levies, but I am positive that the top priorities today are jobs and equity of taxation.  We have 250,000 people idle. The Minister for Finance referred to them as those who want to work.  Ever since the budget the condition has grown worse, January being the blackest month of all.  The figure we were given then indicated that the condition of unemployment was getting worse.  The Minister must know this.  He attends clinics in the same constituency as myself, where the people must tell him the truth.  The Cabinet must know it, but they have not responded at all.</P>
    <P>That is the task any Government today must tackle.  Had there been provisions in the budget to help employment we would all have to say today that it had been a good budget, but there is nothing in it for the provision of jobs.  In fact, it will even lead to job losses.  We attended a meeting today at which it was pointed out to us that a conscious decision of the elected Cabinet to impose 10 per cent VAT on houses had already lost 5,000 people jobs in an industry already frightfully depressed.  Not alone have they not preserved jobs but their actions have led to further losses.  The only thing for which I could give the present Minister for Finance credit is for having provided one job in the Curragh Camp in the Corps of Engineers for a friend of his.</P>
    <P>The Minister made constant reference in the course of his Budget Statement to the fact that the plans he was revealing were in line with their national plan.  To my mind that plan exposed the thinking of the Government, when they said that unemployment would get worse in the next three years before it got better.  That is not something that we in Fianna Fáil accept should happen and it is not something that the people should accept should happen.  Only last evening the Taoiseach was indicating that the rate of job losses had slowed down.  My answer <Col N="2509" /> to that is that when one is bleeding to death, near expiring, the rate of blood flow is bound to slow down; but that is no indication that the state of one's health is improving.</P>
    <P>Emigration is rife again.  I heard Deputy John Kelly say that emigration might not be a bad thing.  He emigrated, he said, and it was nice to go abroad because one wanted to go.  But what about the thousands of people today who go because they must, because there is nothing for them at home, there being nothing in this budget or in Government thinking to provide jobs for them?  We were attacked on being negative in our approach when we asked how productive, sustainable jobs could be found. I believe they can be found in processing our natural resources, in giving the greatest amount of added value to our agricultural produce, with better marketing of our beef abroad, properly guaranteed prices for beef, pig and sheep meat for our farmers and a diversification of the normal activities <i>vis-à-vis</i> our milk and dairy produce, with proper utilisation of our land.</P>
    <P>We should also look at import substitution, pondering on the question posed during the year: why do we import so much wheat for our flour and feeding stuffs for our stock when we could produce them at home?  Why did the Government have to be pushed by us to instil into the ESB that it would be proper nationally to burn our native turf rather than imported coal from Poland or the USA?  Perhaps that is what Deputy Farrelly meant when he spoke about this year making people's money go further. Definitely Irish money would &ldquo;go further&rdquo; had we to send it to the USA or Poland to buy fuel we have at home, which this Government would have left in the ground if the ESB had their way and closed the turf burning power stations.</P>
    <P>Last week I had occasion to suggest to the Minister for Defence that possibly the Army would be asked to provide an extra 700 or 800 men for an extra battalion in the Lebanon rather than the usual replacements after six months.  I <Col N="2510" /> asked him would he not consider short term Army training for our young people providing them with discipline, the nation with a corps of trained young people, a reserve of idealistic young people with whom we could well do&mdash;that this would be much better than having them remain idle.  The Minister for Defence said it was not possible within the available resources&mdash;in other words, there was not sufficient money to do that.  Therefore, we pay people to be on the dole when we could utilise their national spirit and idealism to better effect.</P>
    <P>From my short knowledge of forestry I agree with everybody's sentiments that a lot of work remains to be done there. If things were properly managed after 50 years of self-government we could have an excellent forestry industry now, but we have not.  There seems to be a reluctance to provide incentives and encouragement for private forestry to succeed; instead we have somewhat of a tug-o'-war between the two.  There are millions of acres in the west waiting to be planted, but they will never be planted under the present programme of the Department of Forestry.  We want to introduce private individuals and privatisation there.  I visited one forester in Clare who has demonstrated what can be done higher up the mountain &mdash; more than the forestry people thought possible, nearer the sea than the forestry experts thought possible &mdash; and he has made a success of it.  We have a lot to do to encourage investment by private individuals in forestry seeing that the State is not prepared or has not the resources at its disposal to plant all we need.  Above all, we need a proper marketing system.  I am convinced that the set-up in the Department of Forestry is not such that we can properly market our produce.  We have a sure fire winner in forestry if we could pursue afforestation properly.</P>
    <P>Were I asked for my opinion as to the next item after agriculture and the utilisation of our agricultural produce providing the best investment in this country I would have to say it would be tourism.  We have great natural advantages <Col N="2511" /> in tourism and any money spent in that area would be well spent.  It constitutes our second greatest potential, but some action taken by the Government recently can only be described as anti-tourist. I have seen countries that have not half our potential for being a marvellous tourist country, countries such as Austria, where they have made a success of that industry and built up a marvellous economy based on it.  It we concentrate on the promotion of tourism, giving people a good deal, promoting our craft industries and the sale of specialised things we can do well, we shall be making progress.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the present Minister at some stage the possibility of a tax incentive to employers to provide additional employment.  Most employers will tell one that there is now great difficulty in recruiting extra employees.  However, if we said to them &ldquo;If you take on an extra staff member next year we will allow you £1,000 a year on your tax bill&rdquo;&mdash; that amounts to only £20 a week &mdash; that would provide extra employment.  However, I have not seen any evidence of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to equity of taxation the Minister has done something with the tax bands, some have gone up and some have come down, particularly the upper bands. The Commission on Taxation were set up by the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy. Surely this commission have reported by now but we have not seen any action on their submissions.  Deputy R. Bruton gave reasons for the delay in implementing the recommendations.  He said one reason the commission's recommendations could not be acted upon was that people who took on mortgages for 30 years felt they were getting an allowance and that we could not change the rules during the course of the game.  When will we be likely to act on them?  Many poor people paying mortgages find the rules are being changed because they are now paying £20 a month more than they paid previously.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed the first move to rationalise the tax bands but I believe most taxpayers will be worse off, and <Col N="2512" /> they will realise this before the year is out.  There was a slight increase in allowances but this will not beat inflation in the coming year.  It is obvious from the figures that fewer workers will pay more tax and everybody will pay more in VAT. This is not only my opinion.  This has been borne out by the Wall Street pundits who gave their views on our economy and tax structures recently &mdash; and it was not a flattering view.  They did not bear out the Minister's opinion of the tax changes.  In his budget speech he said:</P>
    <P>These changes which I have proposed in our income tax and VAT systems will unquestionably improve the climate for enterprise, effort and employment.</P>
    <P>I like the use of the allteration, but from a tax point of view the situation can be classified as tough, terrible and tightening. The people we met today will bear that out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is reputed to be a great man for his book-keeping.  I would like to give some figures where he compares 1984 with 1985, page 18 of the blue book, Principal Features of the Budget.  They tell the home truths.  They tell us that customs tax revenue in the coming year will yield £12 million more than in 1984, £76 million more in excise duties, £165 million more in income tax, £122 million more in VAT, agricultural levies have gone down slightly by £2.4 million, motor vehicle duties will yield £10.3 million more and the youth employment levy will go up by £2.5 million.  These are the facts. It is obvious that the Minister is taking more than ever before out of the economy and giving less in return.</P>
    <P>The Minister showed a very helpful interest in the bloodstock industry.  That is only natural since he represents Kildare. The reduction in tax on SP betting to 10 per cent will be welcomed.  I predict that he will collect more at the 10 per cent rate than he did at the 20 per cent. The bookmakers appreciated this move and will respond and at the end of the year the Minister might even be inclined to reduce the rate to 5 per cent.  One outstanding matter of great concern to <Col N="2513" /> bookmakers is betting bonds, which the Revenue Commissioners demand.  This means that the bookmaker takes out a type of insurance policy that he will pay his taxes.  In many cases when the policies expired the bookies have not renewed their insurance cover and now they are being asked to make large deposits with the Revenue Commissioners against the tax they are likely to pay.  This penalises the honest bookmaker because the more tax he pays the greater will be his deposit.  Tying up capital in this way can be a crippling blow for some bookmakers who often have a cash flow problem. This profession does not compare with other professions which are allowed a year's grace to pay their taxes.  The bookie has to pay the deposit in advance before he takes in his first bet.  I would like to know if the Minister has any suggestion as to how he can overcome this, or will he arrange to have insurance cover for bookies in that type of situation?</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry is going well from a money point of view.  There is great investment in it from abroad, but racing needs to be helped and prize money needs to be increased if owners and trainers are to stay in business.  The racing and bloodstock industries have a great employment expansion potential. It is an indigenous natural resource which has gained world acclaim for us.  We should build on this and encourage further investment at home.  We have come a long way from my young days on the Curragh.  Three stables I know of, small employers in their own way, now employ 100 people in the stables and the spin-off business.  This industry could be expanded and I hope the Minister will give them every encouragement, because money invested in the bloodstock industry will provide more jobs at home.</P>
    <P>I heard bad news yesterday about grey-hound racing because six tracks are due to close.  I do not know if the difficulties arise with Bord na gCon, with taxes or bookmakers, but I hope the Minister for Agriculture will help this industry.  This is a good Irish industry which needs to be kept in a healthy state.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister <Col N="2514" /> singled out the motor trade for the treatment he has meted out in this budget. There is an increase of 10p per gallon on petrol and diesel, there is an increase in road tax, and VAT at 10 per cent, which shows a change of heart on the Minister's part.  These increases in motoring costs will percolate to all items because this will affect the transportation of goods, tourism, and people travelling to and from work.  I cannot understand why we continue to crucify this section of the community.  This industry can provide a great deal of employment but every year they are affected by the budget.  Old established firms have closed down and no new apprentices are taken on.  The black economy and those doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; in back lanes are the only people doing business.  When Fianna Fáil were in office we had a meeting with motor traders in the Keadeen Hotel in my constituency. Their plight was bad then but it is worse now.  The present Minister for Finance was at that meeting but he was much more forthcoming when in Opposition than he is today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly said there were 40,000 people drawing social welfare benefits who should not be drawing it, or who need not be drawing it.  I do not know what he means.  But I know that many people in receipt of social welfare benefits are asking why for the first time ever there was no increase in children's allowances in this budget.  Some people mentioned the family income supplement. That will probably be taken into account in the husband's tax, but I never remember a time when children's allowances were not increased in the budget.  It is usually paid to the mother. She holds the children's allowance book, and the money she receives belongs to her.  Mothers will not thank the Minister for forgetting the children this time.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of a 6½ per cent increase in social welfare pensions but it will not come into effect until 11 July.  I know that is the anniversary of the signing of the Treaty but the old age pensioners would not have objected to receiving it on 1 April, 1 May, 1 July or <Col N="2515" /> even 17 March.  The six months delay in implementing it means that the 6½ per cent increase will, in effect, be a 3 per cent increase by then.  Judges received an 18 per cent increase in their pensions and they only have to serve five years to be eligible for them, so comparisons do not make good reading.  Indeed, on the day the budget increases were announced &mdash; and they were paltry &mdash; coal went up by 80 pence per bag.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the building trade and those of us who took a walk at lunchtime can understand why.  It is an industry which is capable of an instant response to encouragement and can provide employment if given the chance.  It is at its lowest ebb and the budget imposed further restrictions on first time house buyers with the imposition of VAT and probably a mortgage increase as well despite the efforts to lessen the blow. When the Minister for Finance was asked about this he talked about the new grant to first time house buyers and said it would increase the price of houses by only £325.  If he was buying a new house and finding it hard to make ends meet that money would be a big amount to him. The building industry has declined by 25 per cent in the last two years and these measures will only make it worse.</P>
    <P>Despite a big show about capital projects, the truth is that £50 million less will be spent on capital projects in 1985 compared with last year.  Building societies say that those borrowing £20,000 will pay £21 more per month because of this.  Builders who signed contracts in June 1984 will be faced with a bill of £1,250 on a house costing £25,000 and £1,750 on a house costing £30,000.  They cannot expect the people who have signed a contract to foot the bill but their profit margins are so small that builders will be unable to meet these extra costs. Many more will go out of business.  It is no wonder there is outrage over this measure because the construction industry had been complaining even before the budget that VAT rates should be reduced.  We were told that it had to go up to 10 per cent because the figure <Col N="2516" /> of 5 per cent had been done away with. There was a suggestion made that only half the cost of a house should be subject to VAT at 10 per cent but that was rejected.  Any decision which puts 5,000 people out of work and causes fewer houses to be built in the coming year is wrong.  If the Minister for Finance goes near a building site within the next few months he would be well advised to wear his helmet.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for the Environment on the recent scheme brought in for remedial works on local authority houses.  However, I cannot agree with his statement that the local authority housing programme is in its healthiest state for years.  That is a very sweeping statement and it is certainly not true in the constituency which I represent because only 51 county council houses were built in Newbridge last year and 52 joint venture houses.  If the money stretches that far, 54 new houses will be built in 1985.  This is not nearly enough to meet the demand and it is the same all over the country.  One can see the proliferation of caravans and mobile homes and we know that flats are very overcrowded.  Even if nobody else went on the waiting list the present rate of building would not catch up with the backlog until 1988.  By that time, many more will have joined the waiting list.  In Kildare, we got £5.6 million for small dwelling loans last year and, for the first time, that money was not taken up because of the low income limit and because couples simply cannot afford to build houses.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Housing Finance Agency allocation to County Kildare was a sum of £4 million.  The county manager estimated that we will need £7½ million this year to cope with the demand for 1985 and last year's backlog.  Kildare County Council are now approving loans but they are not sure if they will have the money to meet them.  For the last few months of 1984, people whose loans had been approved earlier in the year received no money because the council got no money from the Exchequer.  Those people were faced with paying bridging <Col N="2517" /> loans which is very expensive.  People cannot afford to build their own houses and the local authorities cannot provide enough houses.  On my reckoning, the Government built 7,000 local authority houses in 1984.  The money they have allocated for housing this year will only build 6,000 houses which means that 1,000 fewer houses will be built.  This is a recipe for crisis and the housing programme is in a disastrous state.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to welcome news in regard to the construction of by-passes. The Minister should adopt a sensible policy about local authority funding.  At present when a TD writes to a county engineer seeking information the answer always refers to the limited funds at the authorities' disposal.  This is because the Government did away with the statutory payment which was due to county councils. Fianna Fáil believe that this should be restored and we will restore it in line with indexed statutory payment each year to county councils to enable them to carry out the work which they should be doing.  I again impress on the Minister, as I did on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, at Question Time, that a monitoring system needs to be in operation to ensure that we get value for money in each individual county and that local authority funding should be set up for roads which will enable not only main and arterial roads, but county roads also, to be reopened.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Government announced that toll roads will be introduced.  It is important that county councillors in the areas affected should be consulted and their views taken into consideration before any action is taken.  Money for the Naas by-pass and others was made available by Fianna Fáil but we were not there to lead in the winner on the day the by-pass was open.  Deputy Spring was Minister for the Environment at the time and he used that occasion, despite a strong motion by Kildare County Council that toll roads should not be introduced, to try to change their minds.  What will be the effect of toll roads?  Who will have to pay?  The poor unfortunates going to work will have to pay 10p extra or a <Col N="2518" /> lorrydriver with a load of sand going to the odd building site which may still be open will pay a higher toll.  In many cases travel on the toll roads will be reduced and towns like Naas and Newbridge will still be jammed.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the suggestions made.  I refute the suggestion that we constantly tell the Government what to do but not how to do it.  Suggestions were made by our party leader as to how the economy might be reflated and that duty on beer, spirits and electrical goods should be reduced.  The Government scoffed at that in the early days but rather belatedly acted on it.  We are glad of that because it is better later than never.  We have constantly harped on the fact that there should be further capital investment in the building programme and that money spent on roads, houses and so on is money well spent.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed lottery this is a matter I have taken an interest in for some years and I have been in touch with the Minister about it.  We should think big about this lottery.  If properly handled, it is capable of bringing in £1 million per week and the Government would get a clear profit of £50 million a year.  I have some knowledge of US lotteries particularly in the north east where they go well. They do not do well in the bible belts but I am confident that a lottery run on the same system as the Massachusetts State lottery would be an excellent one.  The population and type of people would approximate to Ireland very well.  If we adopt that type of policy and if it can be computerised and turned into a national effort it will be a success.  We could have outlets in every supermarket.  The charitable organisations who are worried about their future could be made agents and if the ailing Irish Hospitals Trust feel they are so good at selling and have a part to play they also could be incorporated as agents.  If they can sell a little better than they have with their shamrocks and sweeps they could gain revenue for themselves. We would need a national professional body to run it.</P>
    <P>I think I am talking to the right man when I address the present occupant of <Col N="2519" /> the front bench.  Much or all of the proceeds should go to sporting and educational needs.  If people know what the money is earmarked for they will support it.  We will depend on the goodwill of the public to make this lottery a success.  The money should go where it is earmarked for and not be like the youth employment levy where £7 million found its way to a purpose for which it was not intended.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions in the budget were ill thought out.  They appear to have been thrown in as spot prizes at the last minute.  Reference was made to dental, optical and aural care being available for all pregnant women whose husbands are insured.  Did anybody think out how that would be implemented?</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are often taxed with espousing the cause of white elephants but apparently the Minister has an interest in brown and black elephants with his grant to the Dublin zoo.  I am sure it is needed and I hope it will be spent wisely there.  Some of the things which appeared in the budget were inexcusable.  Did anyone realise the frightful effects of the increase in VAT on the building trade or the effect on unfortunate mortgage holders or first time house purchasers?</P>
    <P>We voted on financial resolutions until midnight last Wednesday week.  Every day since we have heard a change of heart and the financial resolutions we are talking about today are not the ones we voted on.  This is an obvious example of government by reaction.  In our pigeon-holes today we received a memo from the Department of the Environment with regard to the new house grant of £1,750. It is a clear example of Labour giving a grant of £1,750 and Fine Gael putting on VAT which cancelled it out.  There does not appear to be any co-operation there. It was stated at the end of the memo that &ldquo;this announcement supersedes all earlier information issued on this matter&rdquo;.  It is an obvious case of having second thoughts about something.  It is also mentioned that the new house grant will come into effect on 1 May and that the VAT will not come into effect until 1 May.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2520" /> No incentive is given in the budget to invest in projects at home.  There is no encouragement given to people to put money into industry here or into projects which could create jobs.  After two years of frustration and lack of success under the Coalition the country needs a lift and needs someone to boost morale and restore confidence.  It needs someone to offer a glimmer of hope for the future. The Cabinet are unable to do that.  People can see through the gaudy stage props to the reality behind the scenes.  We have more borrowing and fewer jobs.  We have more taxation and less real spending.  If the Government left office today the country would breathe a collective sigh of relief and hope would replace the present despair.  The greatest service the Government could do would be to steal quietly away.  I am positive that if Fianna Fáil returned to office there would be an enormous sigh of relief and an immediate feeling of hope and confidence.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Minister indicated a typical Fine Gael attitude.  It does more for the rich than it does for the poor.  On television last night the Taoiseach was asked why the Government decided to reduce the 65 per cent tax band to 60 per cent.  The Taoiseach did not answer but said that they had helped the poor section. My knowledge of Fine Gael is that they will not be remembered for helping the poor sections.  I have not heard any excuse as to why children's allowance was not increased.  Even if money was scarce they should have found some to increase that.</P>
    <P>In the last line of the budget speech the Minister said: &ldquo;People who want to contribute and want to work ...&rdquo; That may well prove to be his swan song.  The inference is obvious.  He is convinced that many of those who are idle do not want to contribute or work.  I am not naive enough to think that everyone who is idle is genuine but the vast majority are. There are the young people in despair and who have no hope.  The youth employment levy was earmarked to create jobs for young people but we have had a robbery from the children's money-box to the tune of £7 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2521" /> It is obvious that Fine Gael got their way at last.  Adults' shoes and clothes will be now subject to VAT at 10 per cent. Heaven help the fine strapping lad or the well developed lass who needs adult shoes, because they will have to pay for them.  It does not appear that any Labour voice was raised in anger.  In fact there is an obvious lack of Labour input.  There is no sign of Labour philosophy.  Perhaps they too have been subsumed into the Exchequer.  Are the four Labour Ministers making any impact or are they expendable?  They could not be classed as spare tyres because they might be called into action at some future time. They would have to be classified as flat tyres.  The wind has been knocked out of them today anyway.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that this fourth Coalition Government saw the demise of the Labour Party as a grouping with any identifiable separate philosophy.  To steal a phrase I heard in connection with a certain court case, there is no evidence to suggest they have a separate identity of their own outside Fine Gael.  They have become an extension of Fine Gael, and that is not surprising.  This Government have always been a loose type of federation. One could not refer to them as a coalition because by using the word &ldquo;coalition&rdquo; one means groups that coalesce or work together.  A better description would be a condominium, a loose federation of states.  Just as Mrs. Thatcher might be criticised for having &ldquo;wets&rdquo; in her Government, the grouping of &ldquo;flats&rdquo; we have is no help.</P>
    <P>The Minister did the best he could with the resources at his disposal in 1985.  I doubt if anyone else in Fine Gael or Labour could have put as good a gloss on it.  However, when the tinsel wears off and the drabness appears the public will realise fully the con job that has been perpetrated on the nation.  This is the third budget the Minister has presented and I suppose he can have claim to have brought off a hat trick, but I am convinced that if the Irish people in 1985 are given the say they would dearly like to <Col N="2522" /> have, he will never complete the last leg of his jackpot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence my brief contribution by agreeing with the Taoiseach when he said that, having broken the back of the problem left to the Government by their predecessors, we are able in the national plan and in the budget to launch the process of recovery.  We are now on the road to recovery and the budget indicates how we are approaching the matter.</P>
      <P>The budget will help to have an environment where jobs will be created and unemployment will fall.  The budget maintains the rate of inflation at low single figures.  It preserves the purchasing power of those on social welfare payments, it has made a positive start in reforming the tax system and it improves the position of women in a number of important ways.  The fall in employment during the past four years is now being halted.  More new jobs will be created and because of the general improvement in the tax position and the way this affects different areas of the economy, in particular tourism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Mr. Ormonde Mr. Ormonde">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment trend is being reversed.  The budget, together through the enterprise allowance scheme and the social employment schemes with the policies set out in the national plan, will lead to a fall in the numbers of unemployed in the next year or 18 months.  In 1985 inflation is expected to be under 6 per cent, the lowest figure since 1968 and a far cry from the future of over 20 per cent in 1982.  By avoiding any significant contribution to price increases, this budget has helped to keep inflation at its low level.  In a practical way the VAT reductions will reduce <Col N="2523" /> the price of many household items from the beginning of next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What about clothes and shoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to domestic items, to infants' needs and washing powders.  There has been a consistent call from housewives to eliminate what was called the luxury rate under which these items were charged.  What the Government have proposed is most welcome.</P>
      <P>On social welfare, the Government's commitment in the last two budgets to match such payments with the rate of inflation has been more than honoured. The increased social welfare benefits in this budget will more than compensate for inflation and it will protect the vulnerable groups such as old age pensioners, those on social welfare and the disabled.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that an agency to combat poverty will be set up in the coming year.  An increasing number of women are in the lower income groups and they have fallen into the poverty trap generally.  This is a trend here and in other countries and it reflects the increasing number of women who are heads of households and who are mothers.  I look forward to the funding of suitable projects here under the second EC combat poverty programme.  One has to accept that dealing with poverty by way of weekly payments only partially deals with the problem: it does not address the real problem.  We must identify the causes of poverty, whether it be education, environment conditioning or a combination of these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget proposals mean there will be a substantial improvement in the distribution of the tax burden and an improvement in tax allowances and exemption limits.  All taxpayers will benefit and people will have more disposable income.  The limit over which tax will be paid will be £2,650 for single and widowed persons and £5,300 for married couples.  This will remove approximately 15,500 taxpayers from tax liability.  Persons earning less than £5,300 per year <Col N="2524" /> will be exempt from the 1 per cent income levy.</P>
    <P>A notable feature is the increase in the incapacitated child allowance.  This has gone up by £100 and the allowance for a person employed to take care of an incapacitated taxpayer or spouse has increased by £500.  Single parent allowances have kept pace with married person's allowances, with an overall increase of £200.</P>
    <P>The proposed change in the tax relief for a certain amount on deposit will encourage older citizens to put their savings in safe keeping and it should be helpful to them.  The majority of such people are women because their life span is on average five and a half years more than that of a man.  Many older women are living alone and they seem to think it is safer to keep money at home, whether in a box, under the floor boards, or under the mattress.  This makes them very vulnerable. I hope the information regarding this tax concession will filter through.  I am glad the Minister for Health has issued thousands of leaflets setting out the savings people on welfare or on old age pensions can have while still claiming benefit.</P>
    <P>No capital acquisitions tax will now be payable from 30 January last on inheritance from one spouse to another.  This important aspect has not been highlighted very much but it is a matter that has caused much concern which has been expressed to me in my role as Minister for Women's Affairs.  In today's terms, houses have a high value and many men have pensions that are capitalised on death.  There is also life insurance, and the total value can very quickly reach and exceed the £150,000 limit.  Many couples approached me during the year and asked me if something could be done about this. They thought that perhaps the ceiling could be raised.  I am happy that this inheritance tax between husband and wife has been abolished.  That abolition is welcomed by women.  Particularly where couples are self-employed as in the case of farmers and shopkeepers, there was a risk that the source of their income would have to be sold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2525" /> I have pointed out that the budget improves the position of women in regard to VAT on a wide range of household goods, capital acquisitions tax, tax relief to widows, single parents and those who have incapacitated children and also social welfare and family income increases.</P>
    <P>The introduction of dental, optical and oral benefit for pregnant women is welcomed by women, who have conveyed their appreciation of it to me and to other Deputies on this side of the House.  After the broadcast of the budget speech a number of women asked me why the Opposition were jeering or cat-calling or cheering when the Minister read out that section in his speech.  It was absolutely lost on them, as it was on me.  I wondered why pregnant women should have brought that kind of jeer or cheer.  Maybe the Opposition did not realise how it sounded, but it came over in that way.</P>

Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said that it was discriminating between women.  That was an extraordinary thing to say.  Most women think that we made a relevant commitment in this matter which comes up again and again and they want action on it.  They are very pleased that if we were to choose a sector or a group, recognising that the financial situation at present would not allow the scheme to be brought in as totally as we would like, we chose pregnant women <Col N="2526" /> who are wives of insured workers to benefit under this.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey said that a leading gynaecologist has pointed out that pregnant women do not tend to have active dental treatment and the cost of visiting a doctor to get a certificate of pregnancy would cost her too much. Deputy Haughey should look more closely at what happens for pregnant women.  Dentists are very happy that this provision has come in.  Women need dental care during pregnancy.  The Deputy opposite may know of an ailment called gingivitis which is very common during pregnancy and women need treatment for this.  Many of them do not go for treatment because they cannot afford the cost, but now they have an opportunity to have the treatment and other treatment that may be necessary and unrelated to their pregnancy.  The health education booklet on the mother and child advised pregnant women to go to the dentist and that it is not dangerous, as has been said, or inadvisable for them to have an injection for a filling or an extraction.  They may not have a general anaesthetic or be X-rayed.  Very few people who visit the dentist regularly have either of these treatments.  Seventy three per cent of the population have an entitlement to State funded dental services.  The entitlement covers medical card holders and their adult and adolescent dependants totalling 1,025,000; pre-school and primary school children, 792,000; and contributors to the social welfare scheme, 700,000.  On the basis of the total population of 3,433,000, 73 per cent have an entitlement under this budget.  This budget provision, which introduces another group to dental benefit under the social welfare scheme, <Col N="2527" /> will mean that we will move that up a little further; not as much as I would like, but it is a start.</P>
      <P>The additional £650,000 being made available for voluntary organisations is also welcome.  In the last two years many of those who have been helped have been single parent organisations and day care facilities for deprived areas which are directly relevant to women, especially around Dublin, and the growth in these day care centres is noticeable.  Small community groups to whom a few thousand pounds is significant are glad that that sum of money is available.</P>
      <P>The introduction by the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland, this year of free phone information on the budget, highlights the need for information on the part of the public not just at budget time but in the whole complex area of income tax, social welfare and grant schemes etc. as they apply to them. I am conscious of this need on the part of women.  It is important that we have schemes, welfare legislation, policy programmes and so on, but there is not much point in having them if people do not know they exist.  Many people who do not have access to telephones may not even get the newspapers and do not know what is available to them.  I am interested in contributing to reducing the numbers of people who have to go to TDs for basic information.  Perhaps I will put it to Deputy Boland that a free telephone system should be available on an ongoing basis.  That facility on budget day was very widely used and welcomed by the public.  I have had some experience of this in my Department.  I have had requests throughout this year from widows for information on a number of areas such as income tax, social welfare, life insurance, etc.  I put together a very simple booklet entitled <i>Information for Widows</i> which brought together all the information they could possibly need about social welfare, tax, banks and so on.  We printed about 5,000 copies of that booklet and they were gone in three weeks.  The result was that this sector, the widows, had, right away, the information they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2528" /> I referred to the increase in employment. The opportunities are there and initiatives are being taken to help in that regard.  Experience of the enterprise allowance scheme and the employment incentive scheme shows that people are prepared to act in a very practical way to get a job.  Last Friday I saw a clear demonstration of the will to work and in many cases the will for people to make jobs for themselves if employment is not readily available.  I sponsored a seminar on enterprise and women becoming involved in business.  It had 200 places and was over-subscribed three times.  It is obvious that many women are thinking seriously of setting up their own business or expanding existing businesses and are highly motivated about this.  State agencies in the enterprise area, such as the IDA, CTT, AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency, should encourage women entrepreneurs and address advice and information to them.  The theme that came through from the day's papers and discussions was that women were not convinced entirely that these agencies were directing their information or their marketing to them.  The take up of many of the schemes was very low and indicated that they were not catering for the number of women who were applying. Deputy John Bruton, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who contributed to the seminar agrees with me on this.  He is asking the State agencies to examine this issue in detail and to develop programmes of specific relevance to women.  The two activities I have mentioned, preparing information booklets and organising seminars on issues of specific relevance to women, are just two of those I am taking on my £170,000 budget in 1985.</P>
    <P>This year also is the final year of the UN Decade for Women.  That decade grew out of the UN Conference held in Mexico during International Women's Year 1975 which produced a plan of action with the objective of enabling women to realise their full potential and worth as human beings as well as equality in their rights, opportunities and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2529" /> The specific areas outlined for action at national level include political participation, education and training, employment, health, nutrition and the family. The highlight of this year will be an international conference in Nairobi which will address the themes of employment, health and education.  The conference will review progress made during the whole decade and will aim in particular at identifying obstacles to the realisation of the programme of action.  It will go on to formulate priorities and strategies to overcome these obstacles and to implement the goals of the decade looking to the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The liaison committee who are meeting in my Department and who represent such groups as the Employment Equality Agency and the ICA, are aiming to determine Ireland's priorities for this conference and to bring forward a national report.  When we examine what has happened in Ireland in the past ten years we realise that the changes have been very real and definable and are far removed from many of the negative suggestions that tend to be made about women in Ireland.  In legislative terms the changes have been sound and good.  In such areas as family law, employment and rape legislation, we have had 15 Bills enacted since 1975.  That is a very worthwhile achievement.  I am hoping for a series of regional seminars which will focus on the objectives of the decade and also a North-South conference which will consider legal issues as they affect women in the North and in the South.  All of these activities will focus attention on what is the meaning of the UN Decade for Women year but I am very concerned that small local groups in Dublin and elsewhere should participate also.  I intend funding those small groups who are involved in a range of community projects so that they may organise their own projects as they consider best.</P>
    <P>I hope this year also &mdash; I have begun already in this regard &mdash; to consider the facilities that are available to women throughout the country.  In some parts of the country, noticeably the midlands and Galway, there is an extremely good <Col N="2530" /> health service in the area of preventative medicine.  There are cervical smear testing clinics at various centres.  This facility is very important because early detection of cervical cancer is of paramount importance in treating the condition but I have discovered that the smear testing facility is not available in many parts of the country. In trying to identify the facilities required by women, I shall be covering a wide range in each regional area and in that way we shall ascertain where initiatives might be taken and where extra funding might be helpful.</P>
    <P>I have decided this year to involve my Department's work in two main areas, the needs of single parent families, particularly the unmarried mother and also the area of women in small business in terms of their needs and their interests as entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>The seminar that was held last week and the follow up to it by the State agencies represents a major start on the area of women in business, in identifying women with skills and talents in this field, who are anxious to set up businesses of their own and in that way to create jobs for others as well as for themselves.</P>
    <P>The needs of single parent families have been examined in detail by an interdepartmental working party who have been meeting in my office.  I trust that their report will be published shortly.  It will set out the various areas of action needed in regard to the discrimination and disadvantage which operate against women.</P>
    <P>The problem of the unmarried mother and the difficulties with which she must contend is one that we must be particularly concerned about.  Perhaps the public attitude to the unmarried mother is the cause of the greatest pressure and the greatest difficulties.  There are community agencies, and I commend all of them, who are doing excellent work in counselling and in helping the girls to find housing but I am not convinced that that attitude generally is as widespread or as caring as it might be.  That is why we need to give an example and to create an awareness of the pressures that can be brought to bear on the young unmarried mother who <Col N="2531" /> is afraid to discuss her problems and who does not know what the future holds for her.</P>
    <P>The area of housing for unmarried mothers has been identified as representing a big problem.  Many women have approached me on behalf of their daughters who either had babies or were pregnant to seek my advice in regard to housing for girls.  Dublin County Council have a very good policy in this area.  It would be worth the while of other local authorities to follow that example.  It is essential that single parents are not put into ghetto-like situations.  They should not be put into low priority cheap housing areas where they may consider themselves abandoned and removed from the rest of the community.  Ordinary housing should be provided for them and they should be given support in the community.</P>
    <P>A noticeable feature that occurred to me recently in regard to housing in Ireland is that there are so many cases in which one person lives alone in a very big house.  This contrasts starkly with the position in Holland, Belgium and the UK.  When people in these countries have spare accommodation, they tend to think of renting it out as a business venture. They want to make money out of it.  Also, it would relieve the stress and strain on public authorities and on women &mdash; and young couples, even &mdash; looking for accommodation in the private sector. Are we extraordinary in this area, that so many people who live alone in houses over a number of years would not think about sharing their houses and making some money at the same time?</P>
    <P>With regard to unmarried mothers, it is worth noting that in 1983 1,500 of the 3,500 young unmarried mothers who gave birth in Ireland were in the age group of between 18 and 20 years.  That works out as something like 30 young unmarried mothers a week.  We should all take note of this.  I am not going to call it a problem because then we make it a problem, but the reality is that we have young unmarried mothers in Ireland <Col N="2532" /> at present and need to address the problem which that indicates.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this budget provides the hope essential to meet the challenges now and in the years ahead in finding jobs and achieving equity in our standard of living and, from my perspective, in taking positive action to improve the position of women in our society. Clearly, much remains to be done, but I am confident that his budget, set firmly in the context of the Government's national plan, provides a reasonable approach that as that economic activity shows through into people's lives, it will provide them with confidence to build on the framework which the Government have provided and achieve real advances, not just in the economic area but in relevant aspects of social development.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to comment on the Minister of State's reference to the adult dental scheme.  This side of the House, like the Government side, would be pleased if such an adult dental scheme were made available to pregnant women.  They are lovely sentiments but, unfortunately, the reality is totally different. In the South-Eastern, Southern and many other health boards, no funds have been or are available for the adult dental services in 1984 or 1985.  How can a pregnant woman avail of a non-existent service?  One can talk about it in the same vein as the Coalition's 1981 campaign with regard to the £9.60 for the unmarried women.  It is not a reality and nothing that the Minister says will convince me otherwise.  As a member of the South-Eastern Health Board, I know the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many of my colleagues, I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The headline from this week's <i>Sunday Tribune</i>&ldquo;They got it wrong again&rdquo; says it all.  After two years of falling incomes, rising unemployment, increasing bankruptcies and lack of investment, the net result of all this suffering is that the current budget deficit is reduced by a mere 1½ per cent of GNP, by forcing a decline of 3 per cent of borrowing share of national income.  If all this leads to a 1½ per cent reduction, <Col N="2533" /> what burden of taxation will we have to carry and what spending cuts will have to be imposed to achieve the Government's target of cutting back another 3 percentage points within the next two years?</P>
    <P>Both the budget deficit and the borrowing requirements will be larger this year, in absolute and relative terms, than in 1984.  All this, despite a commitment of the Minister for Finance in his first budget speech in February 1983 to reduce overall borrowing requirements and reduce and control current budget deficit.  He went on to say then that the Government were committed to achieving economic growth and higher employment.  I had to read that sentence on a number of occasions to make sure that I got that right about higher employment.  In the two years since this Government have taken over, the unemployment figures have risen by 90,000.</P>
    <P>Even on the very week in which the budget came out, the unemployment figures, in spite of what the Minister says, rose from 217,000 to 234,000.  That is an increase of 17,000 people.  That did not take into account the loss of 800 jobs in Travenol in Castlebar, the 370 jobs in Clarkes of Dundalk, the 170 jobs in Arklow, or over 100 jobs in the building sector in Bray.  That is a further 1,500 jobs lost in the past two weeks since this budget was announced &mdash; an increase of almost 19,000 on the unemployment register.  And this Government state that they are committed to correcting unemployment and creating employment.  In the now infamous document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, there is mention of unemployment peaking at 220,000 by the end of 1984, which would then fall back in the following year to something in the region of 210,000.  Instead of heading downwards, this unemployment figure has gone up by another 19,000 in three weeks.</P>
    <P>Despite all the sufferings, tax increases, spending cuts, many businesses going to the wall, many people being thrown out of work, five mile longer dole queues, we are now in a worse mess than we were.  All the media hype and public relations and national handlers <Col N="2534" /> will not disguise that fact for very long.  The Irish people are cleverer than the Minister or I think.  About now, they have uncovered the outer layers of this budget and discovered its bitter heart, which means in effect that there is no change, but more of the same to come. This must be the greatest con job, the most gigantic hoax of all times.</P>
    <P>Despite the apparent reform of the PAYE system, the PAYE sector will pay something in the region of £160 million more than last year, although 90,000 more will be unemployed.  Once again we are asking the PAYE worker to carry the can.  The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> again on 3 February, 1985 has a headline &ldquo;Stuck on stony ground&rdquo;.  The article starts out by saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The euphoria which greeted the budget last Wednesday did not last long&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the budget demonstrates anything, it shows that the economy has slipped out of the Government's grasp.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in that article it is stated:</P>
    <P>Despite the sleight-of-hand demonstrated by Mr. Dukes in his juggling of the tax bands and the tax rates, there is little or no relief for most income tax payers in this budget when the likely trend in pay and prices this year is taken into account.  The only group to benefit unambiguously from the budget tax changes are the very rich.</P>
    <P>How true that is.  Let me give a small example of the figures quoted from the budget.  A married man with four children, earning £10,000 per year, will show a net gain of £70 from the tax changes in this budget.  To counteract that, the increase in VAT on clothing, shoes and domestic fuel, which the Minister of State omitted to mention when talking about VAT changes earlier, the raising of the PRSI ceiling by a further £800, the increased car taxation and the massive 10p per gallon on petrol which has been estimated <Col N="2535" /> by the motor industry as putting an additional £50 per year on the worker, will ensure that no worker is better off this year &mdash; not to mention the knock-on effect of the rising pressure on industry. We all know that these charges will be passed on to the consumer.  One can expect that items such as bread, butter, milk and so on will increase in price during the year.  I can assure the House that no worker will be better off from this budget at the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>However, these people need not worry, because the Minister has found a solution in this budget.  After all, is the Minister not going to increase the tax on cigarette lighters by 10p.  That is a stroke of genius.  Billions of cigarette lighters must be sold every year.  That will be a massive gain to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>In supporting the motion and in view of the time limitation I will make as many points as possible so that many of my colleagues who wish to contribute to this debate will be afforded the opportunity to do so.  True to form under a Coalition Government the construction industry is suffering depression.  That is confirmed by members of the construction industry.  Each time we have a Coalition the construction industry suffers depression.  No amount of propaganda will distort the facts.  Are the Government in touch with reality?  The Taoiseach may claim in Cork and elsewhere that this Government will have all the idle rusty JCBs in working order.  How naive can the Taoiseach be while presiding over an official unemployment figure of 234,000?  We all know however that the official figures do not always represent the true figures.  The people are looking for encouragement, for hope, for leadership, for credibility and for employment.  The people are seeking the Government decision that will give impetus to the economy and not, for example, the recent decision to raise the VAT from 5 to 10 per cent.  One does not need to be an economist to realise that <Col N="2537" /> the house building industry is going through the worst recession since the second world war.  About 53 per cent of building workers in the Cork area alone are unemployed.  Most builders subcontractors, builders suppliers and others associated with the industry are hanging on by their fingernails.  One would think that the Government would do something to stimulate production in that area.</P>
      <P>However, it would seem that the Minister for Finance and other Government Ministers who live in their ivory towers have lost contact completely with what is happening on the ground.  They propose to double the VAT charge on all houses.  What is rather frightening is that the Minister showed a disturbing lack of knowledge of the operation of the VAT system.  When he spoke on RTE radio on the morning after the budget he gave some figures which indicated that he thought the amount of Government grant was deducted from the gross price of a house before VAT was calculated, whereas it is calculated on the gross price. He also seemed to think that the reduction in the rate of VAT charged on concrete blocks would help the builders.  This is also a mistaken view, as builders and all other traders claim a refund of all VAT charged to them, whatever the rate. It is the rate at which they are charged VAT on their sales that counts, and the Minister proposes to double that rate.</P>
      <P>A very sad experience for those selling houses is to find so many young people interested in buying a house, but when they sit down to do the sums with them they find it impossible to bridge the gap between the price of the house and the finance that is available to the purchaser.</P>
      <P>The recent proposed doubling of the VAT&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that he is allowed to make a passing reference to VAT but he cannot make any detailed analysis of the VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the proposed doubling of the VAT will not occur and that the Minister will change his mind about it when the Finance Bill comes <Col N="2538" /> before the House.  The recent proposed doubling of the VAT and the expected increase in building interest rates on house loans will break the camel's back. The publicity given to the fact that the interest rates by building societies will not increase by 2 per cent as expected but by 1¼ per cent is not acceptable.  That 1¼ per cent is too much to expect house purchasers and mortgagees to pay.</P>
      <P>Many of those young married couples interested in buying a new home will find that the prospect has been put beyond their reach.  If this doubling of VAT is not rescinded it will result in thousands of additional building workers added to the number of unemployed and scores of builders, sub-contractors and builders suppliers will be forced to close their doors with further unemployment.  This decision to double VAT on houses should get into the <i>Guinness Book of Records</i> because of its insensitivity.  The official figures for unemployment in the construction industry in December 1984 was 45,607.  This represents an increase of 3,542 on the December 1983 figure. This amounted to an increase in the level of unemployment of 8½ per cent in one year.</P>
      <P>In March 1983 the rate of VAT on the construction industry was increased from 3 per cent to 5 per cent.  It is estimated that this resulted in an additional £25 million in VAT receipts for the ten months of that year.  It is further estimated that in 1984 £75 million was collected in VAT from the industry as a result of the increase in March 1983.  The effect of increasing the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent is that an additional £63 million will be collected over the period March to December of this year.  Overall, the projected VAT receipts in 1985 from the construction industry will be in excess of £130 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From whom do the Government expect to realise this amount of VAT? Builders cannot carry the increase as evidenced by the de-registration of 170 builders during 1984.  Even this very day, two more building contractors are gone in Cork.  The intending purchasers are unable to meet the present prices let <Col N="2539" /> alone consider further increases such as that intended by the proposed increase of 5 per cent VAT.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent further jobs in the construction will be lost.  It is estimated that it could be as high as 5,000 jobs.  Furthermore housebuilding companies and general construction companies will cease to trade.  The Government strategy as outlined in the national plan and the Programme for Government, which set a target of 30,000 houses per annum, will not be successful as a result of this increase in VAT and other measures to which I had hoped to refer.  The stark reality facing the construction industry in general and the housebuilding industry in particular point to a continuation in the decline in the level of building activity and a decline in the numbers of people employed.  Over the longer term there is no prospect of any significant reduction in the level of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>In his address to the House last night the Minister concentrated on the various measures taken in relation to the major programmes of his own Department &mdash; roads, local authority house construction and sanitary service &mdash; to increase output and employment in the building industry.  In speaking on the motion and the amendment I will concentrate on the other initiatives that have been taken to restore the fortunes of the industry by the Government particularly in the area of housing.</P>
      <P>These initiatives are designed to increase demand particularly in regard to new private housing and the important areas of house maintenance and improvement work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last April the National Planning Board published their report which recommended the abolition of the £1,000 new house grant, the £3,000 mortgage subsidy and the severe curtailment of mortgage interest relief.  The Government, however, regard the grant and <Col N="2540" /> mortgage subsidy as indispensable incentives to private housing and despite the severe financial restraints which continue to beset the public finances decided to retain the grant, the mortgage subsidy and the tax relief on mortgage interest. This decision was of course announced in the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i> The Government have now decided to increase the £1,000 grant to £1,750 at an estimated cost of up to £5 million in 1985. The provision for new house grants in 1985 is now £16.5 million; for the mortgage subsidy £25.4 million and the estimated cost of mortgage interest relief is £70 million in 1984-1985.  This amounts to a total of nearly £116.5 million.</P>
    <P>The Government also announced in <i>Building on Reality</i> a number of other measures of direct benefit to the building industry of which the most widely welcomed was perhaps the £5,000 grant to encourage local authority tenants and tenant purchasers to buy private houses. The CIF have stated publicly that from the evidence available to them this grant has generated a high level of interest and &ldquo;is having a significant positive impact on the level of demand for new housing&rdquo;. Indeed I can confirm this.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council areas alone a total of 340 applications have been received to date.  The first grant payments have been made by my Department and I am confident that interest in the scheme will remain high as tenants and tenant-purchasers realise the benefits that it makes available.</P>
    <P>One of the basic aims of the scheme is to encourage tenants who can afford to do so to acquire private sector dwellings. Earlier incentives with a similar aim such as the low-rise mortgage and special category loan schemes had a limited success in this context.  It is, I think, generally accepted that the assistance now available to tenants and tenant-purchasers who wish to move to the private sector is exceptionally generous.</P>
    <P>In addition to the £5,000 grant, a qualified applicant may also be eligible for both the mortgage subsidy of £3,000 and <Col N="2541" /> the £1,000 grant bringing the total available to £9,000.  The total of loans and grants available to any applicant may equal the gross price of a house.  The new grant has therefore, removed the necessity to obtain a deposit to bridge the gap between the loan available and the purchase price of the house, a requirement which previously prevented many tenants from acquiring a private sector house.  The fact that the grant and subsidy are available for both new and previously occupied dwellings is a further bonus which opens up a wider choice of dwellings of varying price levels to the prospective purchaser.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the scheme will undoubtedly lead to greater activity in the private housing sector of the building industry and will affect the market for both new and previously occupied dwellings. But I am confident that the scheme will play a significant part in enabling local authorities to reach the Government target as set out in the national plan of rehousing 9,000 households per annum on waiting lists by increasing the number of dwellings available for reletting.  It will also be welcomed by those persons on the approved waiting lists of local authorities who will now be rehoused much sooner than they had hoped.</P>
    <P>I have been aware for some time of the major problem which housing authorities have been facing in trying to remedy severe structural faults in dwellings which were mostly built under the low cost housing schemes in the sixties and early seventies.  In addition, there are, particularly in urban areas, many older housing schemes which have deteriorated over the years and are now in a state that requires immediate attention if they are not to be completely lost to the authorities' housing stock.  Because of the other demands on their housing revenue funds, it was obvious that authorities were not in a position to meet the sizeable cost of remedying the structural faults which are affecting these housing schemes and it was for this reason that the introduction of a new scheme to deal with the situation was proposed in the national plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2542" /> That is something the Opposition should well remember because they themselves initiated those low cost or cheap housing schemes, for which we are now paying a very high price.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know about these low cost defective houses because he has many of them in Cork.  Under the terms of this scheme, capital, the repayment of which will be subsidisable to a maximum of 80 per cent, will be made available to authorities to carry out essential remedial works of a structural nature to groups of houses in the two categories I have just mentioned. The works involved will, depending on the extent of the problem and the remedy proposed be costly to carry out.  However, I envisage that the authorities involved will plan to do them over a period of years.  Initially a priority system will operate to enable the most urgent cases to be dealt with first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special provision is necessary to cater for schemes which contain houses which are being or have been purchased under a tenant purchase scheme.  Under the arrangements that have been worked out, such tenant purchasers will be required to pay only half the cost of the essential remedial works while the balance will be borne by the authority and subsidised in the same manner as rented dwellings.  In this way it should be possible to achieve the full rehabilitation of all such structurally defective housing schemes.  I am confident that this new scheme will be the means of solving the problems created by the defective condition of local authority housing estates to which it relates.  Structural repair and maintenance work by its very nature is labour-intensive and the new scheme will contribute to the maintenance of, and <Col N="2543" /> indeed should increase, employment in the building industry.</P>

Naturally this can be a significant barrier to marginal house purchasers.  Therefore, we have established a high level committee representative of my Department, the Department of Finance, the Law Society and the Irish Building Societies' Association to seek ways to streamline house purchase procedures and reduce the delays and costs involved.  That is something that has been needed for a long time and I am glad to be able to say that it is coming.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated the Government are also committed to providing a satisfactory flow of mortgage finance through the local authority house purchase and reconstruction loans schemes.  A measure of their commitment is the increase in the amount provided in the Public Capital Programme for 1985 which is £90 million which represents an increase of some 9 per cent over that provided in 1984.  Borrowers under this scheme have a decided benefit over building society and other borrowers in that the mortgage interest rate is fixed over the term of the loan. This contributes greatly to stability and does much to increase demand for houses.  Also it should not be forgotten that, in the case of both these schemes, the people obtaining mortgage finance are people on modest incomes who would not normally be catered for by the commercial lending agencies, who, in the absence of these schemes, would not enter into the private housing market.</P>

      <P>This will help in an important way to maintain the level of demand for new houses and the scheme will continue to be of considerable <Col N="2549" /> importance from the point of view of the building industry in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The building societies have over the years made a major contribution to the private housing sector in Ireland.  In recent years they have been providing over 70 per cent of the mortgage finance for house purchasers and the amount provided in 1984 was in the region of £415 million.  This funded about 17,600 loans, of which nearly 7,000 were for new houses.  The availability of house purchase finance on such a scale is a major asset to society in that it enables an exceptionally high proportion of our people to own their houses.  It also, of course, greatly benefits the building industry by funding the continuing demand of our young population for new houses as they set up home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance of an adequate supply of mortgage finance from the societies is, therefore, an important consideration.  Societies must secure a good inflow of funds from investors, and here they are in competition with other financial institutions.  Unless they can offer a competitive rate to investors they may lose existing moneys invested with them or fail to secure new investment, and this will ultimately be to the detriment of house purchasers and of the construction industry.  While acknowledging the need for societies to continue to be an attraction to investors, the Government must also ensure that the impact of higher interest rates does not bear too heavily on present and future house purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The societies showed considerable restraint when in December last they acceded to a request from the Minister for the Environment to postpone a decision on an increase in their interest rates. Over the past week they discussed their position on several occasions with the Minister for the Environment and the <Col N="2550" /> Minister for Finance and these discussions culminated in last night's announcement of an increase in the mortgage rate of 1.25 per cent which is considerably lower than the 2 per cent widely predicted by many commentators.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his contribution to this debate last night Deputy Molloy referred repeatedly to the effects on the construction industry of the increase in VAT on building output from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  I hope I will be permitted tonight to set the record straight on the effects of the VAT change on the industry particularly in view of the widely exaggerated and, if I may say so, irresponsible claims that have been made by Opposition Deputies.  The increase in VAT on building output must be judged not as an isolated measure but in the context of the overall reform of the indirect tax system of which it is just one component.  Unfortunately, the analysis of many of those critical of the VAT increase fails to <Col N="2551" /> appreciate the context of the change and the full extent of the alleviating measures taken by this Government.</P>
    <P>The need for fundamental reform of the VAT system in Ireland has been obvious for some time.  The system as it has evolved with its narrow taxation base, its bewildering array of different rates and the unacceptably high level of the so-called &ldquo;standard&rdquo; or 35 per cent rate has very little to recommend it.</P>

      <P>Having agreed on this course of action in relation to the VAT system the Government had to decide the appropriate rate to charge on building output given that the 5 per cent rate was to be abolished.  The choice lay between increasing the present rate to 10 per cent or reducing it to zero, thereby removing building output from the taxable base for the VAT system.  The Government decided against this latter course not only because the revenue loss would have been substantial but also, perhaps more importantly, because any erosion of the already narrow VAT base would have further distorted production and consumption patterns and increased inefficiency, which is the exact opposite to what the reforms in the VAT system are designed to achieve.  Instead, the Government decided to charge VAT at the 10 per cent rate on building output and to introduce measures to alleviate, as far as possible, any adverse effects of this charge on the industry.</P>

      <P>You are a joke.  In assessing the effects of the increase it should be borne in mind that a considerable part of total building output will not be affected by the change.  The output of direct labour units of local authorities and Government Departments will not be affected.  Similarly, the output of private individuals building their own houses will not be affected.  Demand for building in the agricultural sector, in the industrial and semi-State sector, and in the commercial sector is unlikely to be affected because most enterprises in these sectors can reclaim any VAT they pay including VAT on buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The construction industry was dealt a severe blow recently when taxation was increased by 100 per cent.  It is hard to believe the explanation given for this increase by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, here tonight.  The Minister mentioned facts, but after the budgets of 1984 and 1985 the tax take on a £30,000 house has increased from £900 to £3,000. The attempt of the Minister for Finance to explain that it was only a matter of a couple of hundred pounds increase is blatantly incorrect and has been proved so by submissions from the construction industry.  The statements the Minister made on the night of the budget are incorrect. Since the eve of the 1983 budget, the gross price of a £30,000 house has increased to £33,000.  Is that the kind of tax system conducive to growth in the construction industry?  If it does nothing else, it should bury <i>Building on Reality</i> once and for all.  There are many consequences of the Government's decision to increase this level of VAT but the main one is that many housebuilding firms who had been hanging on by the skin of their teeth in the depths of a recession by reducing profit margins and allowing people to be made redundant will now have to close their doors.  The Minister can talk about facts and figures but that is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it reprehensible that one Minister admitted to the CIF in his constituency that he did not realise the implications of the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  It is difficult to understand how a Government Minister did not understand the implications.  Indeed, it is clear that he was not the only Minister who did <Col N="2558" /> not realise the implications because the Budget Statement said that the price of concrete was being increased by 10 per cent.  The Minister for Finance did not realise the impact of this decision.  The CIF submitted recommendations to the Government before the recent budget but none of their proposals were found suitable to include in the budget.  The Minister should take some facts and figures into account.  The total tax take on a £40,000 house is £15,680.  The Government are trying to kill off investment. What are they doing to replace it? The implication of the decline in house building which will take place as a result of the Government's policies will mean a rise in the demand for local authority housing.  This means that the current level of local authority house building will have to increase by a minimum of about 3,500 units per annum.  Public capital expenditure on local authority housing will have to be increased by a minimum of 55 per cent or £116 million per annum to build houses to make up for the decline in private building.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer subsidy on new local authority houses will now have to be increased to £4,420 per house for every additional house completed.  The housing waiting list, which currently stands at 33,000 will increase dramatically.  Those are the direct consequences of the Minister's decision in regard to building in the private sector.  The subsidy for local authority houses is 60p in every pound for houses built by the State compared with 10p in the pound for every private house.  The Government are turning their backs on the little bit of investment into private housing and on the people who are on building society mortgages.</P>
    <P>The Government were very kind in inviting the representatives of the building societies to meet them to discuss their submission.  The Minister for the Environment sat down with them and told them how good they were to keep down interest rates.  However, the Minister then stabbed them in the back by the way he dealt with them in the budget. The result is a 1¼ per cent increase for householders many of whom are unable <Col N="2559" /> to continue with their repayments because they are either unemployed or are experiencing a decrease in real earnings. What will this extra increase do to these people?  The Minister put up a very strong defence tonight but there is no defence for the Government's attitude towards the construction industry.  The Minister of State deserves the kind of treatment he will get from everybody in the construction industry be it sooner or later.  It is clear that he is not too anxious to change his stance or see reality when he can make the kind of speech he made tonight.  It is unfortunate that he cannot accept reality.  He is taking people's lives in his hands and destroying them.  I appeal to the Minister of State to change his attitude once and for all.</P>

      <P>I have been associated with the building business in Dublin for <Col N="2560" /> the last 30 years and I have never rented anyone.  I want that made clear.  These people demonstrated through the city today to show their anger and their feelings against the Government and the sad situation of the building industry.  In 1957, following three years of Coalition Government, the country experienced a recession in the building industry.  There are a large number of small builders in part of the constituency which the Minister of State represents, that is, Walkinstown, Greenhills and Perrystown.  If he went through that area he would see the plight of the many small builders there.</P>
      <P>In 1957 we all felt the building industry had suffered the greatest recession ever. However, the building industry was never at such a low ebb as it is now.  How many builders both large and small have closed their gates recently?  What effort did the Government make to keep these firms going?  It does not matter what constituency, town, village or county one goes to one hears of carpenters, bricklayers and builders' labourers being idle.  It is the duty of a Government to provide work for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building industry was always taken as a barometer of the progress of the country.  We always heard it said that if the building industry was going well everything else was going reasonably well.  The Minister mentioned the Fianna Fáil Government of 1978 and quoted some figures and percentages.  How many people were employed in the industry at that time?  There were no demonstrations in the city.  Today was the first time the builders ever came on to the street to show their anger against a situation which was created by the Government and no one can deny that.  The Minister of State can quote whatever figures and percentages he likes but he must face reality.  In their plan the Government spoke about building on reality.  That has gone out the door.  I ask the Minister of State to take some steps, even at this late stage, to give the builders and workers some hope. Almost 250,000 people are unemployed and 44,000 of them have been made redundant from the building industry. There is no point in trying to criticise <Col N="2561" /> other people.  The Minister of State is part of the Government of the day and is one of the Ministers in the Department of the Environment.  It is his duty and responsibility to give some lead to the industry and to forget about the figures and percentages.</P>
    <P>As far as the builders are concerned they have always played a very important role and acted in a very responsible way. What have the Government done since taking office in November 1982?  They have closed building firm after building firm.  Many small builders have had to leave the country.</P>

He stated that unemployment was coming down.  Last night he stated that the crime rate was coming down.  Everything the Taoiseach said was wrong because everything is reversed.  If he said that tomorrow would be sunny I would advise you to bring an umbrella. That is the kind of Taoiseach we have.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Minister of State that this industry was dealt two major body blows in the last two weeks.  The first was the proposed increase of 5 per cent in VAT on buildings from 1 May 1985 and the second was the increase in mortgage rates of 1¼ per cent from 1 March 1985.  In the building and allied industries 47,000 people have lost their jobs over the last few years.  Many of them have emigrated.  Many went to the Middle East to obtain employment.  As a result of the provisions in the budget it is estimated that over 5,000 people who are at present employed in the industry will be unemployed at a cost to the State of something in the region of £25 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance reduced VAT on concrete blocks from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  This will not have a beneficial effect on the building industry as all registered builders will reclaim that VAT but it will assist those who operate the black economy.  They are in a position to work without paying tax.  Builders who are registered, who are members of the federation and who are giving employment will not benefit by this.  It was given as some kind of ploy to cover up the fact that VAT was being increased by 100 per cent in the budget.  A healthy building industry is good for the economy.  It is a <Col N="2563" /> labour-intensive industry and the majority of materials used are Irish.  The present increase will add between £900 and £1,600 to the cost of a house.  The proposed increase in grant of £750 for first-time house purchasers will not compensate for the increased cost of houses.</P>
    <P>The role of the building trade in the economy should be recognised by the Government.  It is a sad fact that every time we have a Coalition Government there is difficulty in the building industry. Every time we have a Coalition Government there is massive emigration.  I should like to remind the Government that in the past 11 years there has been a Coalition Government in power for more than seven and a half years.  That fact has not been recognised.  Any difficulties that exist are the responsibility of the Government. They cannot put the blame on Fianna Fáil as the Opposition.  When we were in power we always supported the building industry because of its contribution to the employment of male labour and the creation of employment generally.</P>
    <P>In the past few years thousands of workers in the building industry have lost jobs and many builders have gone out of business.  For the first time in 50 years a building firm in Roscommon has gone into liquidation.  Associated businesses connected with the supply of goods to the industry are also in serious difficulty.  We will be facing a very grave situation for the rest of 1985, in 1986 and beyond that date unless the Government relent and decide to reverse their decision.  They should allow the building industry to thrive.  The 5 per cent tax was accepted by the industry but the 10 per cent is the straw that will break the camel's back.  We appeal to the Government to relent on their policy and to reverse their decision. I think the majority of the Cabinet were not aware of the hardship this tax will impose.  I do not think members of the Cabinet are <i>au fait</i> with the problems facing the country.  They live in ivory towers, unaware of the damage they will do by the imposition of this taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2564" /> The public capital investment programme has been reduced by 5 per cent as a result of this increase.  Private investment has decreased.  The section 23 incentive has been abolished and the increase of tax on building societies has led to a further increase in mortgage rates.  I take this opportunity to ask the Government to reverse their policies and to give the builders an opportunity to create employment in their industry. They will do that if they are given an incentive.  We ask the Government to go along with our motion and to support it. I can assure them it will have beneficial effects for the whole economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Government, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance on their efforts with the building societies in the past few days with regard to mortgage rates.  The two Ministers spent the best part of three days negotiating with the building societies and they came out of it well.  In England the building societies increased their interest rates recently and the commercial banks in this country also increased their rates before Christmas.  Because of this there was severe pressure on building societies here to increase their rates even before the budget.  The Ministers' efforts should be praised because they have done a very good job.</P>
      <P>The Government's efforts are there for all to see.  The scheme providing for a grant of £5,000 to local authority tenants has produced 340 applicants to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council. This is a fair measure of the activity in the building trade and it will improve as time goes on.  With this scheme a house deposit is not necessary.  In addition to the £5,000 grant, an applicant is also eligible for the mortgage subsidy of £3,000 and the £1,000 grant, making a total of £9,000.  That must generate considerable extra activity in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in the Opposition calling for large amounts of additional expenditure to boost the building industry.  That might mean some increased activity in the short term but it <Col N="2565" /> will not solve the problems of the industry in the medium or the long term.  In a short time it would put public finances into disarray, increase the budget deficit and the public sector borrowing requirement and, worst of all, it would force up the already high level of taxation.  That would be a recipe for disaster.  The Minister is doing everything in his power to generate activity in the building trade and that is evident from the amount of grants that have been provided for in the budget and that have been in operation in the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will excuse me if I do not fall over agreeing with Deputy Cosgrave about the good job the Government are doing. Since this Government came to power over two years ago, on a deal cobbled together after a general election but without any mandate from the people, every section of the economy has suffered &mdash; to the extent that now we have 234,000 people officially unemployed.  Businesses are closing daily, there is depression throughout the land and the curse of emigration once again has been laid on the shoulders of the people.  Every section has suffered but one of the principal victims of Coalition mismanagement has once again been the building industry.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came to office the building industry has suffered a 25 per cent drop in activity and now at least 50,000 building workers are unemployed. In 1984 alone, the increase in unemployment was 8½ per cent as compared with the previous year.  Unless the Government change their budget decisions, this year a further 5,000 people who are employed at present in the building industry will find themselves on the dole. These are not Fianna Fáil figures.  They are the figures and the estimates of the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one thing clear.  It is the effect of budget and Government decisions that has the building industry in the shape it is in today.  With the industry on its knees after two years of mismanagement, with a 25 per cent drop in activity when everyone knew it was <Col N="2566" /> in trouble, all people expected a major boost for the industry in the budget.  What did we see?  With the industry on its knees the Government imposed two body blows on it.  First, they imposed a 100 per cent VAT increase when they raised the rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent and there was also the proposal regarding increasing the composite tax rate for building societies.  This was in addition to the crazy borrowing policy that has been followed by this Government in the past 12 months.  All of this was at a time when the Government should have been helping the industry which is of prime importance to the Irish economy.  It is the one sector that can give an immediate boost to employment prospects.  If this Government, instead of taking the action they took, had given even a minor boost to the industry, the industry would have reacted and would have taken many thousands off the dole queue.</P>
    <P>In 1983 this Government, again in their typical Coalition fashion apparently detesting everything about the construction industry, increased VAT from 3 per cent to 5 per cent.  It is estimated that this resulted in an additional £25 million in VAT receipts for the ten months of that year out of an already damaged construction industry.  It is estimated further that in 1984, £75 million was collected in VAT from the industry as a result of the increase in March 1983.  The effect of the increase in the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent is that an additional £63 million will be collected over the period March to December and the impact of deferring the increase until 1 May would reduce it to approximately £50 million. That is a further £50 million out of an industry which is already on its knees and not prepared to take any more and has demonstrated that in the manner in which it came to the streets today.  It is the one sector of the Irish community that has really come on the streets.  The surprise is that others have not done so before them.  They are men who would prefer to be on their building sites doing a day's work, building houses to sell to young couples anxious to buy.  They feel so strongly about this Government's action <Col N="2567" /> that they came out today with nearly 500 of their vehicles and in their thousands they marched down the main streets of this city.</P>
    <P>The overall projected VAT receipts in 1985 from the industry that could do most to tackle unemployment, if this Government could only see the light, will be in excess of £130 million; and we are asked then in the Government's amendment to praise them and accept that the Government have been doing a good job in relation to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>What did we expect from a Government led by a Taoiseach who at his Ard-Fheis speech last October-November spoke of dusting off JCBs?  When I spoke on the budget here last Thursday I said that builders do not expect their JCBs to be dusted off; they expect them to be on a construction site moving muck because that is what they are built for and that is what they are involved in.  The Dublin 4 mentality of this Taoiseach and Government has the construction industry in the trouble it is in today as a result of these budget decisions.</P>
    <P>A further nail in the coffin of the industry and of prospective home buyers is the rise in mortgage interest rates brought about as a result directly of Government decisions, one in the budget with regard to the increase in the take on the composite rate on the building societies part of which they have had to back track on, and the other the crazy domestic borrowing policy followed by the Government in the last 12 months.  Let us look first of all at the borrowing policy.  This Government decided last year for ideological reasons to do most of their borrowing in two areas neither of which made sense.  One was the American market when the dollar was very strong and this imposed massive repayments, away above what we should be making, on the Irish people.</P>
    <P>More important from the domestic and interest rates point of view of the mortgage holders and also from the point of view of the interest rate having to be paid by the builders on their construction work, the Government have driven up <Col N="2568" /> interest rates on the Irish market to historic levels.  They have no idea how the economy should be managed and as a result of their policies have driven up domestic borrowings.  This in turn has had to be passed on by the building societies.</P>
    <P>The building societies took a very constructive, positive approach at the request of the Government in December when they were entitled to an increase in their interest rate; they held back their increase.  What response and thanks did they get in the Budget Statement?  The Minister for Finance came into this House and in a most insulting manner talked about not only imposing the decision to increase the composite rate from 75 per cent to 85 per cent but said to the building society movement that if they did not like it they could open their books and we will let the Revenue Commissioners have a look at them.  The building society movement responded rapidly. Then we had the farce of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment trying to undo the damage over a series of four meetings, and we have had a complete U-turn in regard to the budget proposals of only a fortnight ago.  Despite what the Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement, they changed the composite rate and because of their borrowing policy the building society movement have had no choice but to increase the mortgage rate by 1.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of that and how do the community feel about it?  Let me quote from this evening's <i>Evening Press:</i></P>
    <P Just="Center">BUILDERS FURIOUS AT LOAN RISE</P>
    <P>The mortgate rate increase was just another turn of the screw on a devastated building sector, a construction industry chief warned today, as contractors converged on the capital to vent their frustration.</P>
    <P>There was never such anger from builders at the policies of the Government, which were strangling the industry, and today's protest march in Dublin was an inevitable demonstration of that despair, said Mr. Michael <Col N="2569" /> Green, director of the Construction Industry Federation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Quite simply the industry is in a shambles,&rdquo; said Mr. Greene,....</P>
    <P>That is not Fianna Fáil talking, I tell the Minister of State.  That is the CIF director, Mr. Greene.  He continued:</P>
    <P>Over 25,000 jobs have been lost in the industry in the past three years and in all my years in the sector I have never encountered such a reaction....</P>
    <P>As well as the damage done to the industry we have the social damage being done as a result of the budget decisions of this Government which have driven mortgage interest rates to the levels they are at today.  Building society chiefs highlighted how the depressed industry and property market are leaving them with no option but to repossess houses from bad debtors.  That is not Fianna Fáil's claim.  That is the building society movement speaking for itself.  They say that they regret that they must repossess homes from families who struggled to put a roof over their heads and who now through no fault of their own find themselves in difficulties because of total mismanagement by this Government who are insensitive to the problems of families and of the construction industry generally. Those families are faced with the threat of repossession of their homes and this Government and some of their Ministers and spokesmen are asking us to support an amendment which praises them for their management of the construction industry in the last two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment asks us to recognise the record of the Government for the past two years.  The recognition of that record is to be found on the streets today.  It is to be found in every opinion poll that is published.  The Irish people will not be diverted by the type of sham legislation the Government are trying to bring in.  Let us consider the record.  In the public capital programme, which affects the construction industry in real terms, investment has decreased dramatically.  In real terms there was a 15 per cent decrease in this respect in 1983, a further 3 per cent decrease in 1984 and a further 3½ per cent decrease in 1985 &mdash; and that is before the 100 per cent increase in VAT.  As to adjustments for changes in VAT, the public capital programme decrease was 16.5 per cent in 1983, 3 per cent in 1984 and 6.5 per cent in 1985.  That level of the capital programme is a major factor in determining the amount of building activity in any year.  The reductions I have outlined together with the sharp decline in private investment has resulted in the dramatic decline in the industry's fortunes.  The sharp decline also in other building activity such as industrial and commercial and in projects funded by way of the public capital programme has increased the importance of housing in the total output of the building industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing factor is a table of disaster. In 1981, after four years of Fianna Fáil administration, housing completions reached a record 28,917.  In 1983 the corresponding figure was 26,138.  In 1984 the estimated figure is of the order of 25,000. In the private house building area the figures are even more significant and more damning of the Government and their policies.  In 1981 house completions in the private sector numbered 23,167. For 1984 the provisional figure is 18,000. The speculative area is very important in the Dublin area because it provides young couples with the opportunity of buying homes for themselves assuming that interest rates are in any way within <Col N="2571" /> reach but in that area the reduction has been from 10,763 in 1981 &mdash; that was after four years of Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; to 7,435 in 1983 and to 6,650 in 1984. Yet in their amendment the Government ask us to praise the Ministers for the job they have done in building up the construction industry.  The Government are living in ivory towers and of course if those towers were to be built today they would attract an extra 100 per cent in VAT.  What happened to the Government's target of 30,000 house completions in the context of employment?</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste left the Department of the Environment because he did not like the workload there, but on his first day in the House as Minister for the Environment we asked him about the 30,000 completions.  He assured us that he would ensure there were 30,000 completions and that if that target was not reached the Labour Party would be taking action in Government.  Even the public housing programme is a disgrace. If we are to take the Public Capital Programme, in this year alone, it is estimated that 6,000 fewer houses will be built.  This is from a Government made up of some Labour members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in the private house building sector has been most significant on the speculative market.  This results directly from Government decisions.  There has been a decline in disposable income because of Government policies.  First there was an increase in VAT on building from 3 to 5 per cent and now there is an increase in this respect to 10 per cent. That represents a 100 per cent increase. There was a reduction in mortgage relief in April 1983.  There has been the introduction of a residential property tax.  Now there is to be an increase in mortgage interest rates as well as the VAT increase. In addition to affecting the house buyer, the increases in bank and mortgage interest rates will affect the house builder because he must borrow money in the market place.  He must borrow, not from <Col N="2572" /> the domestic banks but from the commercial banks.  As a result of Government decisions which have caused interest rates to increase up to 20 per cent, the builder must borrow money at that high rate and even at a higher rate because the commercial banks operate on a three month calculation basis so in their case the interest rate would be as high as 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition to the interest rates and other aspects I have mentioned, the cost of housing has been increasing also as a result of indirect Government taxes and levies.  The level of direct Government levies and of local authority and semi-State charges has damaged further the construction industry.  For instance, service charges in respect of water and sewerage have increased the cost of houses. A contributory factor also is the level of development bonds.  Charges for ESB connections and for all other services have been a contributing factor also in this respect.</P>
    <P>The decrease in housing construction has resulted in 170 building firms in 1984 ceasing operations.  This figure is confirmed by the figures for the housebuilding guarantee scheme because for the first five weeks of 1985 there was a decrease of 50 per cent compared with 1984 in the number of homes registered under that scheme.  In the real world, as distinct from the fantasy world in which apparently the Government live, everybody recognises the plight of the building industry.  But even in three instances in the Government's economic background to the budget there is a recognition that the industry has declined.  If it is not too late to avoid a disaster I call on the Government to make two further changes in the budget.  They have already made a series of changes in their proposals in the past couple of weeks.  I am asking them to admit that the increase in the VAT rate from 5 to 10 per cent was a disastrous mistake and should be rectified at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission was established principally to revise the representation on county councils and county borough councils outside Dublin, with a view to ensuring a reasonable relationship between population and representation within each local authority. The criteria given to the commission include a requirement that they should recommend sub-division of any electoral area having eight or more councillors. In setting this requirement, the Government took the view that it is undesirable to have electoral areas with so many seats and so many candidates that the electoral choices to be made by voters are unduly complex.</P>
      <P>Boroughs and urban districts, although they have local authorities of their own, are part of the administrative county in which they are situated and electors resident in those areas are entitled to vote at the election of members to the county council.  No change is being made in this respect.  The county council is responsible for certain functions in such urban areas &mdash; for example, for main roads and, usually, for fire brigade services.  The presence on the county council of members from electoral areas which comprise of, or include, urban areas, should contribute to co-operation in planning and development and in relation to services generally.  The terms of reference of the commission do not, however, require that the boundaries of county electoral areas should be made coterminous with the boundaries of boroughs or urban districts.</P>
      <P>I understand that the commission, in carrying out its task, invited written submissions from local authorities, public representatives, political parties and the public generally.  It is a matter for the commission, within the terms of reference, to decide the extent to which submissions made should influence their recommendations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have given serious consideration to the use of pre-stressed concrete floors in houses as substitute for timber flooring. I had this matter examined recently by my Department's inspectorate who have advised me that, on the information available to them, this type of floor is likely to be more expensive than the traditional timber flooring normally used in housing.</P>
      <P>It is considered that pre-stressed flooring would be more appropriate for the construction of office blocks, flats and factories etc., and that it would have only limited application in housing construction. In relation to fire resistance and safety, I am advised that the traditionally constructed timber floor can meet the requirements as laid down in the proposed building regulations.  On the question of the use of native materials, I wish to reassure the Deputy that local authorities are encouraged to use such materials wherever possible and practical.</P>
      <P>Regarding local authority housing, it is a matter for the authorities themselves to plan their schemes and submit them for my approval.  If any such plans contain proposals for pre-stressed concrete flooring they will be considered on their merits in relation to suitability, cost competitiveness etc.  Should the Deputy have any information or evidence to support the use of this type of flooring I will be pleased to have it considered by my Department's inspectorate.</P>

      <P>It is accepted that working conditions at the Employment Exchange, Limerick, are inadequate having regard to the number of staff serving there and the number of claimants attending each week.  In the long term arrangements are being made by the Office of Public Works for the building of an entirely new purpose built employment exchange which will meet all the Department's needs in Limerick.  In the meantime the Office of Public Works has been requested to provide, as a temporary arrangement, alternative premises for use as an employment exchange for women, thus relieving the overcrowding problem in the existing employment exchange.  The Office of Public Works have inspected a large number of premises but had found considerable difficulty in finding something suitable.  The difficulty in this respect arises because of the nature of the accommodation required to provide for the needs of a public office where large numbers of people attend daily.  A suitable premises has been identified and the Office of Public Works is making every effort to secure them as a matter of urgency.</P>

He was paid unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £0.95 the appropriate rate £43.95 less means £43, until he ceased to sign at his local office on 3 May 1983.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed him with means of £43 weekly.</P>
      <P>He made a repeat claim to unemployment assistance on 15 June 1984.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assume that what the Deputy has in mind is the level of compensation that may be claimed for mental distress, the figure for which was increased by the Courts Act, 1981, with effect from 15 October 1980, the date of publication of the Act as a Bill.  The 1981 Act made no change in the law as regards other amounts that may be awarded in fatal injury cases such as for loss of pecuniary benefit, medical or funeral expenses etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be appreciated that what is involved here is legislation giving rights to some members of the public against <Col N="2462" /> others and there are strong objections of principle to making such legislation retrospective though obviously it was considered by the Oireachtas to be permissible to make the change effective from the date of publication of the Bill rather than the date of its enactment.  I am not aware of any defensible grounds for choosing any particular earlier date and, if any such date were selected, it seems clear that other people could with equal validity claim to have a still earlier date fixed and, apart from anything else, a serious issue of discrimination would arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As the law stands, a licensed moneylender cannot enforce an interest rate in excess of 39 per cent per annum.  I am not aware of any report that some licensed moneylenders are charging or have charged in excess of this rate.</P>
      <P>The provisions governing the issue and renewal of moneylenders licences are contained in the Moneylenders Act, 1933, and the Moneylenders Act Rules, 1933.  I do not understand the reference to &ldquo;checks carried out&rdquo;.  The Deputy will see from a reading of the Act and Rules that an applicant for a licence must provide evidence on a wide range of matters relating to the application.  I have no evidence that these provisions are inadequate.</P>
