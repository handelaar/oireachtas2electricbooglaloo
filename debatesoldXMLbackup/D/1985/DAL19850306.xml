      <P>Yes.  On the Order of Business, I should like to direct the attention of the Tánaiste to Motion No. 72 on the Order Paper in the name of our Chief Whip, Deputy Vincent Brady, to the effect that Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to respect the independence of the RTE Authority in the exercise of its statutory obligation to appoint a Director-General of RTE.  May I ask the Tánaiste if it is proposed to give Government time for that motion in view of the very serious implications arising from the action by the Minister for Communications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P Just="Center">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I said I was very happy that the regulations were being introduced in time for the local <Col N="1501" /> elections and that the Minister will introduce a wider Bill providing this facility for all future elections and referenda. The Minister pointed out that it would be necessary to compile a register of voters and to be included in this register, applications would have to be made between the middle and the end of April this year.  It is a pity this work could not have been done when the present register was being compiled.  However, this is a welcome development.  There will be a large number of applications for the postal vote and the fact that a medical certificate will have to be provided showing that a person is suffering from a physical illness or a physical disability will help to eliminate a certain amount of abuse. Applications will also be made from people residing outside the country or who will be outside the country at the time of the local elections, which I understand will take place before the end of June.  These are measures we all welcome.</P>
      <P>June is a holiday month and people may have arranged to go away on holiday when the elections are being held.  Perhaps this facility could be provided for them at future elections.  As far back as 1974 I thought these people should have been provided with this facility in the regulations and perhaps the Minister would examine this possibility for future elections.  It may be said that this would give rise to a greater level of abuse but I do not believe it would.  The Minister and the returning officers must guard against abuses in the postal voting system.  Everybody agrees that a person should have the right to vote, even if they cannot get to a polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated in the regulations that the postal voting paper will be sent by registered post, but more often than not the person who signs for the letter will not be the person to whom the vote applies.  We have all had other people sign for our registered post at one time or another.  A person could apply for a postal vote and arrange to have a family member or friend there to sign for that letter, but there is a danger that the person who signs for the letter could use <Col N="1502" /> that vote, and the Minister must do all in his power to eliminate any such abuse. There should be a proper register with the names of all involved in the local community &mdash; the agents, the local political organisations and so on.  These names cannot be included in the current register but a supplementary register could issue at the end of May which would say who was entitled to the postal vote.  I am all for the postal vote being granted in the circumstances outlined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is the middle of the 1985 spring and there should be an advertising campaign telling people they can apply for a postal vote between 15 to 30 April and if they do not apply within that period the chances are they will not be considered. This facility will apply within that period the chances are they will not be considered. This facility will apply to all future elections. The Bill will provide for that.  There are other circumstances, for instance, where people find themselves in hospital and unable to vote on polling day.  A facility should be extended to hospitals.  It should not be difficult to send a returning officer to a major hospital to cater for these people.  At the moment people in psychiatric hospitals and in general medical hospitals who would like to vote are prevented from doing so and it is not asking a great deal from the Minister to remedy that situation.  There are penalties for voting twice and people in hospital I am sure would not indulge in this abuse.</P>
    <P>There is a definite need for stringent supervision to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.  In relation to voting at home, there can be no secrecy as to who the person might vote for.  To an extent voting in the Seanad elections is secret as it is done under the supervision of a returning officer.  It would be difficult to get somebody to supervise the vote where it takes place in a house but that aspect should be considered.  If abuses creep into the postal voting system they will increase through time so we should try to eliminate the possibility of abuses.</P>
    <P>We are extending the right to vote to disabled people.  It is a pity we have not gone a stage further.  With a right there is an obligation so there should be an obligation to vote.  When the postal <Col N="1503" /> voting register is examined there will be a far higher percentage of votes cast there than would be recorded on the normal register.  We cannot extend the law to force people to vote but we should consider the fact that if a person is obliged to register to vote, by law there should be an equal obligation to cast that vote. Many people do not bother to go to the polling stations at all.  They should have to attend even to destroy their vote unless they have a very good reason for not going.  This could help to eliminate a lot of the duplication on the electoral registers. A persons' name would not be included on two or three registers because it would be up to him to ensure that his name appeared on one register only.  This Bill should consider the legal possibility of ensuring that people cast their votes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the regulations and hope that the efforts of the Minister will be appreciated, that people will respond and that there will be a minimum of abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposed legislation.  We must welcome any opportunity given to a person entitled to vote to discharge that freedom.  I would not regard it as an obligation.  While we as politicians would regret that a person would not cast his vote, in a democracy we must concede a person's right to opt out if he so wishes.  We cannot introduce a law to force him to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech indicates that the registration of postal voters will be carried out as a normal part of the procedure of compiling the register of electors.  I would ask the Minister of State to accept that my comments are not directed towards him.  They are directed towards the manner in which the obligation that is on the local authority to compile a register has been mismanaged over the years.  Politicians will have no difficulty in throwing their minds back to every election where people who were entitled to vote have for one reason or another been left off the register.  It is all right for us to say that an opportunity is given to a person to check the register <Col N="1504" /> and that people are reminded by notices in the papers that they should do so but the fact is that the custom has grown that people place their absolute confidence in the local authority in the matter of the compilation of the register.  There is ample evidence that the compilation has taken place in a rather haphazard fashion.  We have the rather annoying situation, not as Deputy Dowling said of people not exercising their right to vote, but of people reporting to the polling booths to discover that their names are not on the register.  I cannot say that I have the solution to the problem but I have some recollection of raising this matter before and getting an assurance from the Minister for the Environment that he had set up a committee to examine this matter.</P>
    <P>That is the only point I wish to make. I welcome the motion but I hope that a better <i>modus operandi</i> will exist in regard to the recording of those entitled to vote under the new legislation.  Meanwhile, I should like to get the Minister's views on the important matter I have raised.  I am sure he has discovered in his own constituency that many would-be voters have been unduly distressed on arriving at polling booths to find that their names were not on the register and therefore that they could not vote.  We must have confidence in the people who compile the register.  I suggest it should be sufficient to establish the bona fides of persons, even if their names are not on the register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion whose purpose is to enable persons who are unable to go to polling booths but who are entitled to vote to record their votes by post.  We all agree on the need to introduce a proper postal voting system to facilitate ill or disabled persons.  I am glad the Minister has decided to introduce the motion, which will do that. There are many people throughout the country confined to wheelchairs and it would cause great hardship, and did in the past, if they were compelled to attend <Col N="1505" /> polling booths to reach which many of them have to travel long distances.  Likewise, the motion will be useful for those suffering from chronic illness or who are disabled, most of whom have very high regard for their right to vote.  In the past such people have been very distressed because of their inability to cast their votes.  In modern society when people have such civic pride as to be anxious to exercise the franchise we should make every effort to facilitate them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the safeguard in regard to the provision of medical certificates in appropriate cases.  However, there is another problem to which I should allude.  All postal voting systems apply to large numbers of people and are open to widespread abuse.  The system which applied here in 1974 was widely abused and we should find a means to ensure that such abuses will be stamped out.  I can think of countless cases of elderly people who because of their age have not had opportunities to voice their opinions on whom they wished to vote for.  In many instances they have had their minds made up for them.  I hope that all people involved in the local elections will have respect for such people and that such voters will have the right to make up their own minds about exercising the franchise. I agree that people have the right to try to persuade electors to vote one way or the other, but it should stop at that.  We have heard horrific stories about certain people in the past not having had hand, act or part in how they voted or to whom their votes went.</P>
      <P>We must have careful regard for these things in the forthcoming local elections because it behoves all of us in public life to ensure that the highest possible standards will be applied in this postal voting system.  I welcome the manner in which the motion will enable people who would not otherwise be able to vote to do so.  I hope this will alleviate some of the pressures and hardships people have had to suffer in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, I welcome the motion, which is in time for the <Col N="1506" /> local elections some time in June.  However, again we are just making temporary arrangements to extend postal voting. The House will be aware that I raised this matter, particularly in regard to disabled people, a number of times and at about this time last year I tables a Private Members' Bill to provide this facility.  At that time the Minister said he was not in favour of a piecemeal approach to the problem and that he would prefer to refer the matter to the Dáil Committee on Legislation.  He indicated that legislation would be forthcoming in the near future. That is a year ago and we are still being told we will have it in the near future.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will confirm today that that legislation will be brought in here in time for the preparation of the 1986 register so that all disabled and ill people who wish to do so will be able to cast their votes without hardship.  The Committee on Legislation spent only an hour discussion this matter and did not bring forward any new ideas or recommendations. I hope the matter will not be deferred much longer.  It is time the House got down to dealing with the problem through legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether a person should be obliged to vote has been raised. I have mixed feelings about that.  The failure of a proportion of the electorate to vote varies from area to area from as much as 60 per cent to as low as 15 per cent.  That has never been investigated adequately to find out why people are not voting.  I am pretty certain that in many cases it is due to the inability of people to get to polling stations whether through disability, the nature of their work or, as happens in my constituency, because they have transferred to the other side of the city.  I should like the Minister to look at the position in my constituency, although I do not know if he will be in a position to deal with it before the forthcoming local elections.  In the Ballymun area between January, when the final draft register was being prepared. and June, when the elections will be held, in the region of 500 people will have transferred from there.  Most of them will have gone to Tallaght, Clondalkin or <Col N="1507" /> Blanchardstown and it would be physically impossible for most of those people to get back to Ballymun to cast their votes.  Some facility should be provided either to enable them to have a postal vote or transfer their vote to the area where they live.  The right to vote, and the secrecy of the ballot, has been won over the years by a lot of hard struggle. We must ensure that every facility is provided to enable people cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to regulation No. 6 which enables the returning officer to request any applicant to supply him with any additional information he may require to verify the application.  That is not an unreasonable regulation but the time allowed for the return of such information is unreasonable.  Only seven days are allowed for the return of the information requested.  In view of the fact that this would involve people who would be away from home or are disabled, at least 14 days should be allowed for the return of that information.  It must be borne in mind that delays occur in the postal service which may interfere with the return of the material.  The Minister should have another look at that and consider extending it to 14 days.</P>
    <P>Listening to other speakers I got the impression that a lot of abuse of the postal voting system may have occurred in institutions. The Minister should consider&mdash; I put this suggestion before&mdash;providing a system of mobile polling stations for institutions.  Where a hospital or an institution has a large number of voters who are permanent residents it is only reasonable that they should be provided with a supervised form of voting.  That may eliminate the possibility of the misuse of the system in those areas.  It is degrading on election day to see election workers lorrying disabled and old people from institutions to polling stations in order to get the last vote out.  The Minister, and the House should ensure that people can perform their right to cast their vote in secrecy and that the best facilities are made available to enable them do that.  It must be degrading on those who virtually have to carry voters from institutions to <Col N="1508" /> polling stations.  They should not have to do that and voters should not have to put up with that type of activity.</P>
    <P>Generally, I welcome the regulations. I regret that we are passing what is in effect a temporary measure which relates only to local elections.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to confirm that legislation for general elections, by-elections, and referenda will be brought before us shortly.  In order for it to be in in time it should have passed through the House before the Summer Recess.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I made regarding mobile polling stations for institutions and the need for an extension of the period for the return of information requested by a returning officer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Like those who have contributed so far, I welcome the measure although, like the last speaker, I would be happier if we were dealing with a comprehensive Bill or regulation to give postal voting to a wider range of categories. The measure before us is an interim one to tighten up existing regulations which did not prove altogether satisfactory when postal voting was used in local elections in 1974.  The Minister has explained what the new regulations are about and there has not been any disagreement about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to avail of the occasion to make the general point that we have in many ways been very unimaginative in our efforts to ensure that those who are legally entitled to vote can do so.  Deputy De Rossa made the point that we should look at these areas to see if we can find ideas that will enable us to extend the facility of voting.  I would not want to go so far as to recommend that there should be compulsory voting as exists in some countries.  Under that system those who fail to cast their vote must explain why they did not and, if their explanation is not accepted, they can be fined.  Voting is a privilege as well as a duty and, to a certain extent, those who do not vote are indicating an expression of their political choice.  However, the extension of postal voting gives us an opportunity to ensure that those entitled to vote and who wish <Col N="1509" /> to do so are not debarred because of some physical ailment or because their work temporarily takes them away from exercising their right.  It also, as far as possible, ensures that the postal vote is carried out with the same safeguards for fairness and honesty as prevails in ordinary voting.</P>
    <P>The new regulations go some way to ensuring that the vote is carried out fairly. Although I was not in politics at the time, I can recall that there was a great deal of disquiet from politicians of all parties in 1974 about the widespread abuse of the postal voting system that operated then. I hope these measures go some way to tightening that up.  The whole question of abuse, of personation and double voting needs to be tightened up, not just for postal voting but generally.  It is an urban and not rural phenomenon.  In areas where there is a large transient population, &ldquo;flatland&rdquo; where there are many students or people who do not stay for very long, personation is often carried out on a large scale.  In the cities it may well be coming to the stage where some form of identification will be mandatory. In a marginal constituency a seat may be won or lost through a couple of hundred votes illegally cast.  It is in the interests of all parties, all politicians will agree, that elections must be fair and be seen to be fair if they are to carry any credibility.</P>
    <P>This regulation is a reforming, tightening up measure.  I know that the Minister has much reforming legislation in hand at the moment, but I suggest that there are other areas of our electoral law and practice which need examination.  For example, should there be a legal limit on the amount of money a candidate is allowed to spend in an election?  I believe that there should.  Huge sums of money are being spent needlessly in election campaigns which could bring the entire electoral system into disrepute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might look at the question of limits on poster advertising. My main concern is the extension even further of the postal vote but I knew that the Minister and his Department are looking into this possibility.  We should be adventurous and imaginative in the categories to whom we will extend postal voting in the future.  Straight away, there is a very strong case for allowing postal voting for servants of the State who are working abroad permanently, those in our embassies who still are Irish citizens. I would extend the same rights to those executives and workers in our semi-State bodies whose business on behalf of the State takes them out of the country.  They should be allowed to vote, either in the embassies or by post, in a supervised way which does not allow abuse.</P>
      <P>The key issue in postal voting is that abuses must be guarded against and penalties must be extremely strict.  Postal voting has worried people in the past because it was open to abuse.  I wonder how tight is the supervision of the postal voting in the election for the university seats in the Seanad.  I suspect that the supervision there is not as tight as it should be and that a number of votes go astray.  That system lends itself to abuse. Postal voting must be as foolproof as possible and the penalties should be such as to deter anybody who is tempted to abuse the system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure.  I urge the Minister to bring in as quickly as possible the extension of postal voting as discussed by the Legislation Committee.  Also to be included, perhaps, should be airline pilots and personnel of the B &amp; I, much of whose time is spent out of the country; but they pay their taxes and see themselves very much a part of the system. On that note, I wish the Minister well with the new regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my support for the <Col N="1511" /> Minister in his introduction of these regulations. There has been a particularly substantial lobby from the disabled who are unhappy at the prospect of being unable to vote at elections.  Although this measure is merely an extension of the 1974 regulations, it is proper that the Minister should give the disabled and the handicapped the prospect of voting at the next election in the comfort of their own home or institution.</P>
      <P>In 1974 there was widescale abuse, not just confined to cities and urban areas but in rural areas also.  In implementing these new regulations, I hope that the Minister will provide definite additional cross checks.  The attitude of the returning officers in the various constituencies who compile these registers is not as strict as it might be.  I note that the postal vote will now be sent by registered post, but this Bill leaves the system open to abuse if people are physically ill or disabled. The supervising officer should seek the necessary additional information from the appropriate health board to confirm that the applicant is genuine.  The short period from 15 to 30 April might not lend itself to continuous investigation, but because of the abuses experienced in 1974 the Minister should be considering these safeguards.  Changes are necessary, in particular with regard to geriatric hospitals. I do not know if the occupants of such hospitals will be included in these regulations.  If they are to be, perhaps mobile polling stations should be used instead of postal voting, with the expenses which are likely to arise in those circumstances.  The history of abuse in this respect is well known to the Minister. There is an onus on him now to spell out clearly what he means by the circumstances of occupation, service or employment to illustrate the category who will benefit from this regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The handicapped will welcome these regulations.  I appeal to the returning officers to continue the high standards and honesty with which most of them have approached this task.  There is a problem about transient populations all over the country.  In our constituency for <Col N="1512" /> example, there is a large construction operation at Moneypoint.  There are employees working there who come from all over the country and who would probably use postal voting if the Minister includes that category in the new regulations. What cross check would there be in those circumstance?  There are difficulties involved.  I wish the Minister well and hope that his officers can find a reasonable solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this proposal by the Minister.  I remember when this postal vote regulation was first introduced in 1974.  It was worth while for those people who were unable to get out to vote.  When the legislation is finally drafted I hope it will eliminate the abuses which were very evident on that occasion. I would not like to see these proposals being abused.  People have a right to vote at every election.  These proposals are very welcome to disabled people and other people who for one reason or another cannot get out to vote.  There will be a time scale and the returning officers will known whether the excuses made were reasonable and proper.  I hope the postal vote will be extended to general elections in the future.  We must ensure that everybody has an opportunity to vote.</P>
      <P>It is hard for people to get into some of the polling booths.  Big changes have been made in this area over the past few years.  There are large numbers of people in psychiatric hospitals who are unable to go to the polling booths.</P>
      <P>There were large scale abuses in 1974 in different areas by different people. Perhaps that was one reason why the postal vote was not available in 1979.  I welcome the motion.  People who have a genuine reason for not being able to vote at the polling booths are entitled to a postal vote.  They may be working away from home and unable to vote in the middle of the week.  If the legislation is enacted properly we will avoid the possibility of abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and welcome this motion before the House that Dáil <Col N="1513" /> Éireann approves the Local Elections (Postal Voting) (Amendment) Regulations, 1985.  There have been many discussions in this House on the pros and cons of postal voting.  I am delighted the Minister has finally accepted that the advantages outweigh the not inconsiderable risks involved.</P>
      <P>The report of the working party on the register of electors of March 1983 dwelt considerably on the whole aspect of postal voting.  Part of that working party's terms of reference was to examine and make recommendations on a scheme of postal voting for disabled persons and others who may be unable to vote in person at an election.  Our Constitution recognises that every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of 18 years and who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of Members of Dáil Éireann shall have the right to vote at an election for Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As local democracy is but the building block of national democracy, the same premise can be applied to local elections and, indeed, any other election of public representatives.  I am delighted to note from the Minister's speech that he is having a Bill prepared which will allow for postal voting at all elections and referenda. He has promised that this Bill will take into account the wide and various views expressed by Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>The registration of postal voters will be carried out as part of the procedure for compiling registers of electors which takes place in the autumn of each year. The Minister has promised to try to ensure that the legislation will be in operation in time for the 1986 draft register. In the meantime the draft regulations we are now discussing will allow postal voting in the local elections scheduled for June of this year.  They will be in line, as far as possible, with the proposals in the forthcoming Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the undeniable right of all our citizens who, through illness or physical disability of any kind or due to the circumstances of their employment, cannot <Col N="1514" /> exercise their vote in person to have the postal vote.  Ironically the disabled and physically ill are all entitled to be registered as electors but they are not enabled to vote.  The ability to exercise their franchise must outweigh any consideration in relation to the possibility of abuse.  Any postal voting arrangements which have not got the confidence of responsible public representatives will fall into disrepute and could damage the entire electoral process.</P>
    <P>The working party report of 1983 placed considerable emphasis on the avoidance of any abuse within the system, because once the postal voting system is established and is operating well it can then, if necessary, be extended.  If the system is unsatisfactory the entire concept of postal voting will be at risk and there will be a large question mark over the integrity of any postal voting system. Under the Local Elections Postal Voting Regulations of 1974 postal voting facilities were extended to those who needed them at the local elections.  That year a total of 30,689 of our electorate, or 1.52 per cent, applied to vote by post.</P>
    <P>There was a different demand for postal votes throughout the country within the different counties.  Illness or physical disability accounted for 60 per cent of the applications for the local elections in 1974.  Circumstances in relation to employment accounted for approximately another 20 per cent of applicants, with yet another 20 per cent being attributable to change of address.  The official administrative viewpoint of the postal voting system of that year is that it operated satisfactorily.  They claim that some irregularities were investigated and there were a few prosecutions.  However, the viewpoint of public representatives, to which I subscribe, is that the system was abused far more than was recognised. Indeed there is no county that cannot recount stories of postmen even collecting up votes and distributing them among the candidates.  Political parties were particularly avid and organised in relation to the collection of unused votes.  I am afraid that all parties, to a greater or lesser <Col N="1515" /> extent, were tarred with the one brush in this regard.</P>
    <P>Postal voting arrangements were officially suspended for the 1979 local elections because the European elections were being held on the same day and other European countries did not have the same postal voting arrangements.  Therefore it was deemed impractical for two elections to be held simultaneously with different postal voting arrangements.  I cannot help thinking that the view of public representatives in relation to the widespread abuse that occurred at the local elections of 1974 was behind some of the decisions taken for the 1979 local elections.  However, that is not the official reason given.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation postal voting facilities at Dáil elections, Presidential elections, European Assembly elections and referenda are confined to members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  There are many categories of occupations, such as public servants abroad, those in the diplomatic service, merchant seamen and others who have for a long time canvassed for the right to exercise their vote at all elections.  There is merit in each and every one of these cases.  Ironically one of the most vociferous groups over the years in canvassing for a right to a postal vote were the employees of Irish Shipping Limited. Regrettably most of these will not now need the postal vote in the local elections in this year now that they might be entitled to it.</P>
    <P>The abuse factor has been the greatest deterrent in introducing a wider system of postal voting.  I commend the Minister on his efforts on this occasion to try to limit possible opportunity for abuse by the special measures he is undertaking to minimise such risks.  First, he has restricted the categories of people who will qualify for a postal vote compared with the 1974 local elections.  Change of address will no longer constitute sufficient reason to qualify for a postal vote. I suppose that one aspect was open to the widest range of abuse even though there are many cases of people who will have <Col N="1516" /> moved house between the compilation of the draft register and the publication of the actual register in any one year. Obviously the Minister has considered that the possible abuses in this case outweigh the entitlements of those involved. However, the range of eligibility should still cater for the majority of those who have a genuine claim to vote by post.  They are broadly in line with the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Legislation in this regard also.</P>
    <P>The question of diplomats and various other categories who are resident abroad and who cannot now be registered under existing law will be dealt with when the Bill the Minister has promised is introduced. The Minister has tightened up also on the application procedure for the postal vote.  Applications will have to be made earlier so that there will be sufficient time allowed for the proper screening of such applicants, and for the evaluation of the merits of individual cases.  Each applicant will also have to have a certificate from his or her employer or doctor, or give a statutory declaration where they are self-employed. Returning officers will be entitled to seek further information they may deem necessary to establish the bona fides of any applicant.</P>
    <P>I referred briefly to the great abuse that in my opinion occurred in the issuing of ballot papers by post to voters in the local elections.  The Minister has wisely decided that all ballot papers will in future be sent by registered post, a signature being had in respect of any ballot paper delivered.  This should alleviate the situation in relation to this avenue of abuse but I fear it will not in any way close it off altogether.</P>
    <P>One has only to look at the experiences of other countries in relation to postal voting to see how difficult it is to operate and to copperfasten conditions to avoid abuse altogether.  Belgium and France had wide postal voting facilities but abolished them in the mid-seventies because of abuse.  The Netherlands postal voting facilities were available only to civil servants and their spouses who were abroad. Postal voting is not available at all in <Col N="1517" /> Greece.  However, in the United Kingdom, a postal vote is available to any person who cannot vote in person due to physical disability or the nature of their employment.  In West Germany a postal vote is available on various grounds &mdash; change of address, employment, physical disability or through participation in the diplomatic service.  The same applies to Denmark.  In fact Denmark and West Germany have the widest range of postal voting facilities.  I have no doubt that the Minister will have taken a look at their experiences, probably having learned much from them.  Neither have I any doubt but that it will be a matter of time only before there is uniform agreement within the EC in relation to postal voting generally.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is looking at the wider Bill he has promised to introduce as soon as possible I would urge him to endeavour to include as many categories as wish to have a postal vote.  I should particularly like him to make a stand and allow a postal vote for our prisoners who are not entitled to such at present.  In most EC countries a postal vote is not allowed to prisoners.  Many of the problems that have people in prison in the first place are occasioned by a sense of alienation, of not belonging to the system to which we all contribute.  Could there be a better start on the road to rehabilitation than allowing prisoners to exercise their franchise?  After all, the theory of a prison period is that we are rehabilitating prisoners to take their place in society as useful members once they have served their sentences.  They might well spend some of that time considering what the system is about, the society they are about to join and of which hopefully they will become successful members.  Therefore it follows quite logically that the least we could do is allow them exercise their franchise in relation to that system while in prison.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion to the House and congratulate the Minister on taking this initiative because I have mentioned in passing the widespread abuse to which postal voting generally is open.  But I have no doubt that its advantages outweigh its <Col N="1518" /> possible abuses.  I feel the Minister is committed to endeavouring to copperfasten the system in relation to abuse, tightening up any loose ends there may be in this regard.  When considering the broader Bill I would ask him to look at the various categories at present denied this postal vote.  I am not sure whether we will be able to consider long-stay patients in mental institutions, not because I feel that many of them are not entitled or able to exercise their franchise but because these people are most vulnerable to abuse in the system.  If there is a way of avoiding this I am sure the Minister will discover it and allow these people to exercise their vote.</P>
    <P>In a sense it is amazing that it has taken us this long to consider the broader concept of postal voting.  The Electoral (Amendment) Bill of 1983 allowed British citizens in this country the right to vote.  At the time I said, and I still contend, that all aliens in this country should be allowed to vote with possible insistence on reciprocity <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners.  We are today discussing a section of Irish citizens who heretofore have had no vote.  We have already allowed British citizens the vote while this minority grouping have had to wait until today.  I commend the Minister on having taken this action.  I know it has been difficult.  The recommendations of the working party on the register of electors of 1983 are extremely sound and I have no doubt that there will be far more in this regard when we see what the Minister has in mind in the Bill promised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion but I am disappointed that the regulations do not go further, allowing the placing of the names of persons on the postal vote register as in the case of members of the Garda Síochána and Army.  While I agree with extending the system of postal votes on the basis of occupation, such as the diplomatic staff, to those working on boats and indeed to prisoners, I am particularly concerned about the disabled. There are two categories of disabled, those at home and unable to attend a <Col N="1519" /> polling station and those who are able to attend a polling station.</P>
      <P>People who are permanently incapacitated should have a postal vote similar to that given to members of the Garda and the Army.  There names should be on the register with P for postal vote after them and they should know their entitlement to a postal vote.  There should not be any great difficulty in identifying permanent incapacity, as a medical certificate could be furnished to this effect which would allow names to be placed on the register. At election times, the fact that they are still alive could be verified by their doctor which would ensure that ballot papers did not fall into the wrong hands.  The handicapped have been fighting for this right for many years and it could be rapidly incorporated into our system of compiling the electoral list.</P>
      <P>The other category of disabled are those able to attend polling stations and these people should be given the option of a postal vote or the right to attend a polling station because of the number of polling stations which are totally unsuited for the disabled.  In this regard, county councils and corporations should look at the polling stations and see if more suitable premises could be made available because, apart from the physically handicapped, many stations are unsuitable for the elderly as there are steps and the buildings may be small and dark.  There has been tremendous community development in most areas over the last 10 years and many community centres would make excellent polling stations instead of those used at present.  The voting system should be simplified and the very best premises in each polling area should be made available so that people with any degree of handicap &mdash; not just those coping with the handicap of old age &mdash; would have easy access if they wished to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of long term patients in residential care in institutions also arises. When I mentioned the desirability of having postal votes available to the severely handicapped and to those permanently incapacitated, I was referring <Col N="1520" /> to those living at home because I see a problem in relation to those in residential care with regard to postal votes.  The difficulty with postal votes is that these people might be susceptible to influence. For example, there is a home for the elderly in my constituency with 230 beds, and in your town.  A Cheann Comhairle, St. Felim's provides 300 beds.  In an institution catering for 300 people, it could happen that there would be an abuse of the system and that should be taken into consideration.  In the past, polling stations were provided in long term institutions and, while they worked very well, there is the problem of harassment of elderly people by supporters of political parties in their eagerness to get people to support them.  While I am in favour of postal votes, the name on the register with P after it for those permanently incapacitated who are living at home or in small units, I have an open mind on how the question of postal voting should be approached.  However, I welcome the new regulations, they are a step in the right direction but I appeal to the Minister to look at the whole question on a more permanent basis and to ensure that people who are ill and handicapped are catered for.</P>
    <P>I understand that in some countries psychiatrically ill people are not given the right to vote.  We should look at this area very carefully because, thankfully, most psychiatric illness is amenable to treatment at present and psychiatrically ill people should be treated in the same way as those in geriatric hospitals or other institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the implementation of these regulations. Postal voting is a hoary chestnut which comes up every time we have an election and I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to bring forward these regulations. In 1983 a working party stated that most of the submission they received argued in favour of the extension of postal voting facilities to one or more categories of person.  They spelled out the categories they wished to see included in postal voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> By bringing in these regulations, I hope we will continue the impetus, as the Minister promised, and bring in full legislation which will deal with the subject once and for all.  The regulations were there in 1974 but they only applied to that election because, in 1979, when there was a European election it was administratively too difficult to apply them. Obviously, the experience of the regulations in 1974 is available to the Department of the Environment and will be taken into account in tightening up future legislation.  There is considerable concern that granting the facility for more people to be on the register would open up the possibility of further abuse.</P>
    <P>Some of the regulations may be in terms that are very general.  I should like to hear the Minister comment in this regard.  For instance, they seem to leave in the hands of the returning officer the sole say as to whether somebody's bona fide is correct.  I am merely pondering what qualification a returning officer would have to enable him decide whether, for instance, a medical certificate is valid.  It is not likely that the returning officer would be a doctor so I am wondering what back-up service will be provided to enable returning officers confirm the validity or otherwise of a request for a postal vote.  The draft regulations provide that a person applying for a postal vote shall supply any information that the returning officer may require for the purpose of satisfying himself that the applicant is a qualified person.  The relevant paragraph provides further that, if the applicant fails within seven days of being so required to supply the information, the returning officer shall rule the application invalid.</P>
    <P>One can only hope that every precaution will be taken to ensure that the request for further information reaches the person for whom it is intended.  Our postal service, though it has improved, cannot be relied on totally at all times. Perhaps there will be a system whereby inspectors will call to the applicants requesting the additional information. Two or three days might elapse before <Col N="1522" /> the request for information reaches the applicant, especially in the case of a sick person whose post might have to be collected and delivered by a relative.  We must make every effort possible to provide this facility for people who have been disenfranchised because of not having been able to vote for a number of years as a result of prolonged illness or handicap.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of some of those who will be applying for certificates to enable them to vote by post, I should like to hear the Minister say what arrangement might be made to ensure that only the person to whom the authorisation was issued is allowed vote.  The closing date for applications is 30 April, but if the elections do not take place for two months afterwards it might very well be the case that some of the people concerned would have died in the meantime, having regard to the fact that we are talking about people who are old or ill. We must do everything possible to ensure that there is as little abuse of the system as possible and that ballot papers issued to applicants do not find their way into the hands of other people who abuse them.  This is a small point but we must endeavour to close all loopholes.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern is the method of delivering the voting papers either to institutions from which there might have been a large number of applications or to individuals.  Again, we must guard against the possibility of abuse.  One wonders how much abuse there is of the existing postal list, whether all the ballot papers are delivered to the Garda and Army personnel for whom they are intended.  As a result of this legislation there will be a lot more of those ballot papers going through the post.  I assume they will be registered and that will mean they will have to be signed for.  We should endeavour not to send the ballot papers in large quantities in order to eliminate the possibility of someone arranging for the packets to disappear.</P>
    <P>The 1974 regulations included a classification of persons who were entitled to postal voting but this category are not included in this instance.  We seem to <Col N="1523" /> have combined the groups A and B.  The 1974 regulations included people, referred to as group A and defined as people who by the circumstances of their application, service or employment were entitled to postal voting, while those in the group referred to as the B group were defined as those absent from the place in respect of which they were registered as electors.  Why have the B group been excluded?  Did the clause prove to be too difficult to administer?</P>
    <P>The group D people have been excluded also in this instance.  It is regrettable that a person employed by a returning officer in connection with an election will not be able to vote if his registration is at a polling station other than the one at which he is employed.  It would be very difficult, for instance, in a small polling station, where only one person was in charge, for that person to go elsewhere to vote.  If there is some new arrangement whereby people can vote at the station at which they are engaged, I should like the Minister to tell us so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the regulations but in the final legislation we must ensure that everything is as tight as possible.  For some time I have been concerned, as have all of us, about the security of the State and of its officers in the Garda and in the Army.  At present the electoral register indicates by way of the appearance of the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; after a voter's name that he is entitled to postal voting. Obviously, this indicates the electors in any area who are members of the Garda. I would have reservations in this day and age about making that sort of information so freely available.  When we are canvassing from door to door we canvass at those houses where there is a &ldquo;P&rdquo; after the elector's name.  Is there any necessity to continue to identify people in that way? There is no reason for us to know the identification of those who have postal votes.  That would be a matter only for a returning officer.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon has said, there are people who are not disabled, who are not in wheelchairs and who would not be <Col N="1524" /> in a position to obtain a certificate to the effect that they were not able to leave their houses to go to a polling station but who, because of some temporary disability perhaps, would not be able to enter the station.  Every effort should be made to utilise facilities that are more appropriate for people suffering from such ailments as arthritis and who consequently would have difficulty in mounting steps. We tend automatically to use our national schools as polling stations but many of those schools were built in times when we were not as conscious as we are now of the difficulties of the handicapped or infirm or of people with temporary disabilities such as broken limbs.  There are now many splendid community centre type buildings that are much more appropriate for the general use of people, whether fit or unfit, whether they are handicapped or able-bodied.  This matter should be considered seriously.  Today we are making regulations that will move us into the eighties.  We could also look at community facilities that have been funded by large State grants.  They should be made available as polling stations and I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the indication of the Minister that he intends to bring in comprehensive legislation in this area.  I assume he will cover such thorny areas as votes for people other than Irish nationals.  I accept with confidence, his undertaking that the legislation in question will be available before 1986.  As a former member of a local authority he knows the trouble and the time it takes to prepare the register. The sooner the necessary legislation is enacted the better for local authority officials who have to compile registers and notify people.  I welcome the introduction of the regulations before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members who have been involved in local elections, I welcome the extension of the vote.  Deputy Owen said this was a time when people are conscious of security and she spoke about having the letter P beside one's name on the register.  I come from a town that has perhaps the largest Army <Col N="1525" /> vote.  Canvassers for the various parties have found it necessary to visit such people at least a week before they visit other voters because they cast their votes first.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the franchise, as does anybody who believes in democracy.  I participated in the 1974 elections and I witnessed abuses which were referred to in the report of the working party.  In the intervening years Members here have also spoken about the different kinds of abuses that occured when that system of voting was in operation. However, most of those have been circumvented in the draft regulations now before the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the early date of 30 April which will be at least six weeks before the local elections take place.  This will mean that only genuine people will apply because they will have to plan and organise their campaign in good time.  The abuses that occurred in the past were due in part to the haphazard delivery of votes and in some areas some canny people were in a position to do something about that.  The registered delivery of a vote to the housebound person or to the person who may be away from home means that the postal vote will have to be signed for and presumably the postal authorities will have to be satisfied that the person concerned is bona fide.  A major drawback in the previous system was that many postal votes could be collected and many of them were delivered throughout the rural lanes of Ireland.  This was done in many instances to elderly voters who were assisted in their voting pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now only Army personnel and the Garda were entitled to a postal vote. Deputy Owen in her contribution wondered about the extent to which postal votes would be used.  I saw a statistic recently that showed that the percentage of voters who voted from a postal register was considerably higher than the percentage voting from an ordinary register.  For instance, in an Army barracks where there were 1,000 voters, over 90 per cent voted in the last election.  This meant that the people concerned took their civic duties very seriously.  I am sure this will <Col N="1526" /> extend also to those who will now be eligible for a postal vote.</P>
    <P>I am rather concerned with regard to the self-employed person who may now apply for a postal vote by 30 April.  I agree that fishermen, those in the merchant navy, commercial travellers or school inspectors are all in occupations that entail their being away from home for long periods and the case for giving those people a postal vote is quite clear. However, I cannot quite see the same case for the self-employed.  This matter was not explained fully in the regulations. Is the Minister saying that if one's hours of work are erratic a person could find himself unable to leave his place of work to vote?  I hope the Minister will clarify that point because I do not understand the full implications.  I note that such a person or one whose work takes him around the country must get the approval of a peace commissioner or a commissioner for oaths with regard to his application. There may be a certain amount of trouble involved in going to a commissioner for oaths because there are not too many, but I suggest that it should be necessary to have a commissioner for oaths sign the necessary forms rather than a peace commissioner.  I am anxious for clarification regarding the nature of self-employed work that would entitle a person to apply for a postal vote.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the considerable hardships imposed on people in actually getting to polling stations. It is always people who have to suffer hardship and perhaps pain who make the effort to do their civic duty. For those who cannot genuinely leave their homes postal voting will be a boon. It should be possible for those who are partially mobile to vote.  They can find it impossible to vote because they cannot climb the stairs.  Admittedly many polling stations were not built for that purpose but schools in particular are used as polling stations.  I hope that in time all public places will provide facilities to allow easy access for the handicapped.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement about these regulations which have been laid <Col N="1527" /> before the House and I look forward to clarification of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in complimenting the Minister on bringing in these regulations.  We have all been inundated with requests to have the postal voting system extended.  In my view the people who should have postal votes are those who are physically disabled or physically ill and those who would find it extremely difficult to make the long journey to the polling stations. These are the people who most want to vote.  I agree with previous speakers who said that many old people want to vote. It is usually the people who have most difficulty in getting to the polling stations who are most insistent on voting.  The people who complain most are usually those who do not bother to vote.  This is the first step to extend postal voting and the Minister said a Bill will be introduced soon which will extend this facility further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who will benefit under these regulations are those who have a physical disability or illness or those who find it almost impossible to vote because of their occupation, service or employment. In extending these facilities we must ensure that the people to whom the facility is extended are the people who use the vote.  We must provide certain safeguards, especially where people suffering from a physical disability or illness are in nursing homes or are long stay patients in hospitals.  These regulations should be rigidly adhered to and as far as possible we should lessen the possibility of abusing the system.  In these nursing homes and hospitals there may be anything from ten to 100 people availing of this facility and when these people apply for the privilege of the postal vote we must ensure that the regulations are strictly adhered to.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the person whose name is on the postal vote is the person who fills in that form and returns it.  This system could be open to abuse.  There is less chance of abuse when the postal vote <Col N="1528" /> is sent to a person's home because the letter will be sent by registered post.</P>
    <P>Up to now the people who had the right to the postal vote were members of the Garda and of the Defence Forces and it is a step in the right direction that we are now extending this system.  We have had many representations about this and I hope that people who were not in a position to vote will be able to do so now. I am sure doctors will be willing to certify that these people are ill and qualify for the postal vote, but we have to be careful when asking employers to sign because this could be open to abuse.  We will have to clearly define the categories to whom this facility will apply.  While some people may find it inconvenient to vote, they should be encouraged to attend the polling stations.  Those who should be entitled to the postal vote are diplomats serving overseas, people at sea, salesmen and those who find it physically impossible to attend polling stations.  It would be unreasonable to expect a salesman to endanger his livelihood by staying at home to vote.</P>
    <P>The returning officer will have to look very carefully at applications for the postal vote.  I notice that the forms are to be signed by a peace commissioner or a commissioner for oaths, but I wonder if this could be extended to a garda.  I do not want to put an extra burden on the Garda who have been given extra duties lately because of the new passport system, but it should be possible for a returning officer to check with the Garda on an employee whose form has been signed by his employer and a peace commissioner. If an application is turned down, is there an appeals procedure? Perhaps this could be considered in the Bill which the Minister will bring in.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new Bill, I hope the Minister will consider changing the time of year for the compilation and the publishing of the draft register.  At the moment it is published on 15 December and corrections have to be in by around 15 January.  This is a very bad time of the year, from just before Christmas to shortly after Christmas when people <Col N="1529" /> could not be bothered checking the register. I hope the Minister will consider moving this to a more suitable time of the year along with extending the franchise following the referendum last year.</P>
    <P>This new regulation will allow people who were not in a position to exercise their rights up to now to exercise their right to vote.  I hope that in June the system will work, eliminating many of the defects under the previous regulations.  I compliment the Minister for introducing this overdue legislation which will benefit people who because of physical disability or illness were not able to go to polling stations.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will direct that as far as possible polling booths are available to disabled persons and old people. To get to some polling booths people were required to climb flights of stairs to exercise their francise and this proved a deterrent to many who were not in a position to climb stairs.  I hope the Minister will consider some of the points raised and cover them in the new Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the regulations and the prospect of ensuring that disabled persons can cast their votes.  It is only when people are unable to vote that the vote becomes so important.  The problems of disabled persons have been recognised in many areas over the last few years and it is important to recognise the problems here as well and to provide them with an opportunity to cast their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill I hope the Minister will eliminate many of the present anomalies and that he will have a rethink on the compilation of the register.  Today, with such a shift in population, one of the greatest problems is when people move house and there is no record as to where they moved.  This makes the compilation of the register rather difficult.  The 1974 regulations were not as restrictive as these and we certainly do not want to see a Bill whose provisions are as loose as those in 1974.  There was not appropriate supervision of the certification of voters. In my own polling station a person came to claim a vote and it was found that one <Col N="1530" /> of his family had voted for him in the belief that he would not be returning in time to vote.  Measures introduced at that time were very liberal and it is important to ensure now that this sort of thing will not happen on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned polling stations and the fact that in many cases they were inaccessible to physically disabled persons.  More use should be made of community centres, schools and so on. A habit has developed over the years in some areas where the ballot papers are taken out of the polling station to a car to be marked in the presence of the clerk or presiding officer and the scrutineers for the various political parties.  In other areas this was not allowed because it was irregular.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister has a great opportunity to examine the system of compilation of the draft register.  In relation to elections it should be a general rule for the returning officer to examine the premises for suitability prior to polling day.  Many polling stations have been housed in premises such as disused schools and before the election they have been found to have windows broken, no heating and no other facilities.</P>
    <P>Another area which could be examined are the numbers on registers for certain polling stations.  In Monaghan we did an examination of part of the county and did away with the polling stations for 80, 90 and 100 voters.  It is not suitable to have a presiding officer catering for such small numbers and these areas have been lumped together so that from 1,000 people up are catered for at the one polling station.</P>
    <P>This important measure enables disabled people to record their votes.  The right to vote is a right that we should cherish especially when there are so many countries where people have not that right.  I welcome the regulations and would ask the Minister to have a serious look at the new regulations in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is a step in the right direction.  This Bill is long overdue.  It might be thought that this issue is unlikely to affect my constituency but it does because there are lightkeepers on the lighthouses off the coast who were denied the right to vote.  I presume that under the new Bill they will be included in the register of postal voters.  On several occasions these people applied for postal votes but they were turned down.</P>
      <P>Fishermen leave for fishing grounds at 2 a.m. and do not return until 10.30 the following night.  They have not been given an opportunity to vote for years. Seamen are away from home for three or four months at a time.  They should be given similar facilities.  Commercial travellers have told me they have not been able to vote for 20 years.</P>
      <P>The new electoral legislation will need a lot of tightening up.  There must be very careful scrutiny to make sure that there will not be abuses of the system as there were in the past.  There must be proper control of postal voting in particular, the delivery of ballot papers, their posting and their collection.  I welcome the provision for the inspection of polling stations to ensure that adequate facilities for disabled electors will be provided so that they can get in and our of polling stations, many of which in rural areas are old abandoned schoolhouses without any lighting except for candles at night.  This is completely inadequate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has a considerable bearing on our voting system and many other Deputies have referred to it.  I know of an invalid who made his way to a polling station three years ago and <Col N="1532" /> applied for a ballot paper, but his wheelchair was too wide to go through the door, which was too narrow and he was refused a ballot paper by the returning officer and had to return home one and a half miles away.  That was disgraceful and I hope provision will be made in the new legislation to force a presiding officer in such cases to take the ballot paper to the person outside the polling booth.</P>
      <P>Seasonal workers who go to Britain for five or six months each year did not have their names taken off the register.  I have been told that that is not so any more in certain areas.  People who go away for seasonal work should have their names left on the register.</P>

It might seem a rather radical suggestion but in recent elections, principally local elections, the percentage of those participating has been very small, in many cases representing only about 25 per cent of the electorate. Such behaviour leaves the entire system in disrepute.  My suggestion may seem radical but I am sure the Minister is aware that in many European countries who value the democratic system as much as we &mdash; Luxembourg, Belgium and, I think, the German Federal Republic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I will develop my remarks and come to the postal voting. If postal voting is allowed right across the board there will have to be very strict supervision, particularly in regard to the determination of qualifiers.  Otherwise it could be open to a degree of abuse not intended by the Minister.  I refer specifically to people who will apply for postal votes but who are not characterised as <Col N="1533" /> disabled.  That could give rise to an unfortunate development.  Considering the absolute unworkability of the present postal voting system I would go so far as to say that those who do not exercise the franchise should be fined for not doing so.  We would then have a more representative number of people participating. People who do not value their votes, whether they cast them personally or through the post, should be penalised. The ballot paper may be taken by a personal voter and put into the ballot box blank, but such a person will be registered. In other countries it has been shown that the postal system of voting gives a greater percentage of people participating than those who come to register for their votes.  Certainly, it is a step in the right direction but I do not think it is curing the problem.  I should like to make a strong plea for compulsory voting either by post or physical presence in a polling station.</P>
      <P>My second point relates to the partially sighted.  This is an in-between area where those who are partially sighted are not regarded as being disabled.  However, they have a physical handicap which makes it very difficult for them to see the registers because of the poor quality of printing.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.  It should be possible for such people to get information on the phone about their vote at election time.  I should like to make a plea to the Minister to include the partially sighted under these regulations.  People involved can be categorised and obtain proof from an opthalmic surgeon or optician who is in a position to present a report on the degree of anomaly in sight.  I know of many cases of voters with poor sight who when they go to a polling booth find it impossible to cast a vote.  It is just a hit and miss effort.  Such people need guidance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable reservations about the regulations.  We should hasten slowly in regard to them.  Like other Members I am anxious that everybody gets an opportunity to vote at election time but my reservations arise from <Col N="1534" /> what I saw in 1974.  At that time the regulations were very confined.  Those seeking a postal vote were obliged to have their application completed by a member of the Garda Síochána, a clergyman or an officer of a local authority or health board.  Thousands of people breached the regulations and it is well known that some candidates abused the system.  In some areas there was a 100 per cent poll although many of the people on the register had long gone to the next world.  Other people on the register were in institutions, at sea or working in lighthouses.  One man one vote is the criterion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A person may arrange for ten people to vote and fill in the ballot paper for them.  That is turning democracy upside down.  There is a danger of that happening in many areas. One of the strengths in our democracy is that when a person goes to cast a vote representatives of political parties or independent candidates can object if it is felt there is something wrong.  That is good but what I am concerned about is what may happen behind closed doors. A person who applies for a postal vote receives a ballot paper from the presiding officer but representatives of the candidates do not have a right to object.  A person seeking the vote may be under age or have a vote elsewhere in the electoral area.  Abuses have occurred in recent elections and they will continue to take place.  The regulations under discussion will open the door to further abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are solutions to the problem. The Minister should consider systems that operate in other countries.  Portable polling booths are used and those unable to travel to the regular polling booths are given the opportunity of casting their vote at them.  Representatives of the candidates are made aware of those who have applied for this facility and can travel with the returning officer as he drives <Col N="1535" /> through the constituency with the portable booth.  The police are also in attendance. I accept that there is some extra work involved in operating such a system but it would mean more fair play.  It is better that the system is seen to operate correctly.</P>
    <P>I accept the view expressed by Deputy Sheehan about commercial travellers.  In this regard we should give consideration to having voting on Sundays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are considering introducing postal voting because so many people are away from home during the week but most people are at home on Sundays. If we had voting on a Sunday it would avoid the necessity for introducing postal voting.  We must remember that people from rural areas travel to their towns for Mass or service on Sundays. Those people would be able to vote on their way home from religious services. If the Minister decides to proceed with postal voting I urge him to confine that concession to those who are ill or incapacitated. Applications for postal voting should be accompanied by a certificate from a doctor or a state registered nurse. That is essential and it is essential that representatives of candidates are given an opportunity to examine applications for postal votes.  There is some benefit in the scheme proposed by the Minister but the suggestions I have put forward would minimise the amount of abuse.  A portable polling booth and voting on Sundays are the answers to the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The old saw, &ldquo;vote early and often&rdquo;, may now see death because of this wise <Col N="1536" /> move from the Government.  We all agree with this worthy wisdom because it is tightening up a number of abuses which have existed since 1974, when postal voting was carried out in local elections for the first time.  It was not carried out in the 1979 elections due to the intrusion of the European election.  Administratively, logistically and physically it was not possible to conduct the postal ballot in those elections.  Again, I may be slightly out of order about people being harassed at polling booths.</P>

The day must soon come when political parties will get together in the interests of the economy of their electoral coffers and agree to abandon election literature and, with the co-operation of the local authority, set up individual sites to display the names of the candidates for the constituencies.  This would obviate the waste involved in printing election literature.  It is continuing disgrace and a mark against the main political parties that they should continue to spend such large amounts of money on election campaigning.</P>

      <P>That was a passing reference which will now cease.  Deputy Gerard Brady in his very worthy speech made two points with one of which I agree and with the other I do not agree. I do not know if he is quite correct in saying that people in the countries which he mentioned are compulsorily required to vote.  What happens, I believe, is that they are required to present themselves and register at the polling booth, but I do <Col N="1537" /> not think that they are compelled to vote. They can decide to take the ballot paper or not, but their presence is registered and they would not be penalised under the legislation.  I would be concerned that any compulsion with regard to voting should be enshrined in law &mdash; compelling somebody in a democracy to do something which he or she may not wish to do.  We are probably the most politically conscious nation in the world.  One always smiles at hearing that an individual has not got a political opinion here.  I do not think that such a person exists &mdash; we all have political opinions.  At general election time, particularly, a high percentage of people vote.  We can only sympathise with those who do not vote in their lack of patriotism or their lack of community participation.  Inevitably, those who do not vote are the greatest whingers against society, who do all the decrying of what a bad nation, tax system or Government we have.  Some have never voted since they got the franchise.</P>

      <P>The compilation of the electoral register has left a lot to be desired over the years.  A quite genuine elector can come to the polling booth and discover that he or she is not on the electoral register.  That is a very serious deprivation of a civil liberty in any democracy.  I do not believe that the person compiling the register deliberately left that name out for base motives, but that it was a bit of bureaucratic bumbledom. Much needs to be done with regard to compilation of the register, but things are improving in that regard.  I should perhaps know the answer to my next question, but has the whole compilation of the election register become computerised?</P>

      <P>I am grateful to you for your patience and agree entirely with you.  I am once more outside the ambit of the regulations in bringing up the question of accessibility so wisely brought up by Deputy Sheehan.  There have been problems with voters in wheelchairs who, for example, in the town hall in Dún Laoghaire &mdash; now happily abandoned as a polling booth &mdash; were expected to negotiate about 30 steps.  That again is an attack on the right of a person to vote. This regulation is giving the people the opportunity of expressing their views on a political party by means of postal voting, which is as it should be.  However, if physically disabled people want to present themselves at a polling booth it should be made easy for them to express their democratic right at the ballot box.</P>
      <P>Would it not be easy to make the location of polling booths more obvious? Polling booths should not be secreted in large housing estates, which is the case in my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire and, I am sure, many others.

      <P>Briefly, I want to welcome the regulations.  They will assist in underlining the right of people who unforunately suffer handicap or disadvantage to have full and equal participation in the voting process.  For too long in this and other respects those people have been disadvantaged, also.  It is right that the House should take some measure to ensure that people will now be able to vote and have the dignity that goes with that and the right to voice an opinion.</P>
      <P>These draft regulations apply to local elections only.  On previous occasions that obtained too.  I am not sure that draft regulations of this nature were not introduced for general elections because there is a prevailing view in the House that somehow local elections are slightly less important and therefore we can take a chance on them, or because we simply have not got around to it.  I would argue that the principle is identical for general elections and I hope it will be introduced.</P>
      <P>The only area of concern which could arise in respect of these regulations is possible abuse, specifically personation which is a huge problem.  In the local elections we are facing it will be a serious problem in certain areas in Dublin where it would be reasonable to expect that the vote will be quite low, perhaps as low as 30 or 40 per cent.  Every possible precaution must be taken to ensure that advantage is not taken of people in these categories here, and that the general problem of personation will get a thorough examination to see whether we can do something about it.  That is not easy in an open democracy, but it is a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might consider whether it would be desirable to be a little more specific than is the position in regulation 4 (2) with regard to the need to satisfy the returning officer that somebody cannot go in person to the polling station to vote.  Would it be more helpful for returning officers if they had a list of the <Col N="1540" /> kind of evidence which would be acceptable? We are talking about giving a returning officer the right to disenfranchise a person or rule somebody out.  If the area of discretion afforded to the returning officer is very broad, there could be disagreements, tensions and arguments which could be avoided.  I wonder whether specific criteria could be listed, for example, a medical certificate or a certificate from an employer.  The returning officer could look down the list and say: &ldquo;I am sorry but what you have given me does not accord with my list.&rdquo; This might prevent difficulties and awkwardness and it might be helpful to people who had gone to a great deal of trouble to get convoluted evidence which could not be sustained.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that people whose circumstances of occupation, service or employment would normally rule them out will now be able to vote.  That is very important because for many generations people in the Defence Forces, commercial travellers, people who were at sea, people in the prison service, and the Army and Garda in some cases on temporary duties, have been systematically excluded from the voting system.  I always felt that was abhorrent.  I hope the Minister will not just introduce these regulations but will make a special attempt to market this new system to those categories of people about whom it could be reasonably said that they had a tradition of enforced absenteeism if you like.  We want people to know that the old system has changed and they are now entitled to vote.  It is important that everybody should have an opportunity to vote.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to me whether these regulations will cover people who happen to be in prison.  I have a feeling they are not designed to do that.  At some stage we should consider that.  One of the disadvantages of a prison sentence is that you lose your entitlement to vote.  I do not see any reason why people in prison should not be entitled to vote under these regulations.  I am not clear whether that is the intention.  Perhaps the Minister might take up that point.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputies for the positive and constructive debate we have had on this motion.  That is a clear indication that this motion is welcome.  Deputy Molloy referred to the desirability of regularising the position regarding postal voting at elections.  That was also raised by a number of other Deputies.  This will be done in the forthcoming Bill which will provide for the registration of postal voters as part of the normal process of compiling the register of electors each year and the issue of postal ballot papers to postal voters at all elections and referenda. It is our intention to bring forward this Bill as soon as possible.  This debate comes at a very opportune time and I can assure Deputies that the various comments and suggestions made will be taken fully into account in the Bill.  We want to have the Bill ready for the 1986 register. There is a degree of urgency about bringing it in.</P>
      <P>Quite a number of points were raised by various speakers.  I welcome Deputy Molloy's support and that of other Deputies for the measure we have introduced to improve the security of the postal voting system.  I hope events will confirm the view that these measures will close off most of the loopholes which existed apparently in 1974.  There were different schools of thought about that.  I believe we have struck a balance here.  This is very important because we could go overboard with regulations and, at the end of the day, find that we were depriving people to whom we wanted to give votes of the right to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy asked about the criteria which the returning officers will use in adjudicating on applications for postal votes.  There are two elements here. First, the returning officer will have to be satisfied that the application is valid.  This will involve checking that the form has been completed properly and that the applicant is registered in the register of electors and the reason for the inability to vote.  Presiding officers have commonsense in abundance and they will have to <Col N="1542" /> use their commonsense.  I have no doubt they will.  If an application is defective it will be ruled invalid and the applicant will be notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the discretionary element.  The regulation provides that the returning officer must be satisfied as to the ability of an applicant to vote in person.  This means he does not have to accept an application on its face value and that he can reject it where he is not satisfied.  To take an example mentioned by Deputy Molloy, I would not see an application from a self-employed person succeeding unless he could satisfy the returning officer that the nature of his occupation was such as to make it unlikely that he could vote in person by reason of regular absence from home, or business, or some other substantial reason.  Neither would I see an employee getting a postal vote unless the nature of the job warranted it.  Deputy O'Rourke mentioned this as well.  Polling booths are open for 12 hours a day and most people are afforded an opportunity to vote. There are a number of self-employed people who, by virtue of the nature of their business, travel around the country and at times must be away from their place of residence, which is only reasonable and acceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputies Molloy, Dowling and others expressed concern that people should avail of the postal voting facility.  I agree with that sentiment.  I shall be taking steps to ensure that the availability of the facility will be well publicised.  All the details have not yet been finalised.  In general terms what we have in mind is a major publicity campaign involving the press, radio and television, advertising at national level in the period immediately after Easter, as well as an appropriate level of publicity to be undertaken locally by individual returning officers.  We shall also be issuing press statements and availing of any other opportunity for publicity that may arise.  I am sure that individual public representatives will lend a hand in ensuring that this postal voting facility is brought to the attention of appropriate people in their constituencies.  I want to <Col N="1543" /> assure the House that it will be well publicised. I hope that will have the desired effect of ensuring that people who heretofore were unable to vote, for whatever reason, will be able to avail of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>Another question raised by many Deputies was why commissioners for oaths were included as well as peace commissioners as signatories or witnesses to the statutory declarations.  The answer is that both are qualified to witness statutory declarations.  It will be a matter for individual applicants to decide which they will use.  Our aim is to afford as great as possible a choice to applicants.  Deputy Cosgrave asked why would the Garda not be able to witness such declarations as well.  They are not persons who can witness statutory declarations and for that reason they have not been included.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised a related question with which I shall deal now. They mentioned the possibility of applications being made on behalf of voters who were so physically incapacitated as not to be able to apply themselves, their ballot paper being marked by somebody else.  We cannot entirely rule out this possibility.  A returning officer will have to be satisfied that the application has been signed by the applicant and, if he has any doubts in this matter, he can make further inquiries.  If he feels there is something wrong he can refer the application to the Garda for investigation, and there are severe penalties for abuse of that facility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked a question with regard to voting on the part of persons working abroad.  Briefly the position is that persons working and resident abroad should not be on the register of electors and the question of postal voting or otherwise should not then arise.  Of course there could be people working abroad on a seasonal basis or people who have moved abroad recently and whose names are still on the register.  Obviously such people can apply to vote by post.  There is no provision for the sending of ballot papers abroad.  They will be sent to the address at which a voter is registered <Col N="1544" /> which effectively rules out most of those people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen and others asked about the circumstances applying to people absent on holiday.  They were included for the 1974 elections but they are now being excluded.  I must point out that it is not intended that the postal voting system will accommodate people absent from home on a casual basis, whether on business or on holiday.  This will be clarified with the introduction of the Bill which will bring the registration of postal voters back into the period of compilation of the draft register.  Even now, when the application period is limited to April, it would be inappropriate that certain people who have already made holiday arrangements for June should be accommodated while others who have not made arrangements could find themselves not so entitled.  That would be giving people who had made earlier arrangements a privilege which would not constitute a satisfactory arrangement.  Staff employed by returning officers were also included for the 1974 elections but will now be excluded.  Those two categories are caught by early application whereas in 1974 one could apply a few weeks beforehand when it was easy to take on board people who were going on holiday, or those assisting returning officers.  For example, a number of staff would not know by early April whether they were being employed by returning officers, which would mean that some would be eligible and some ineligible.  In such circumstances it is better to exclude them all.  I might point out that the categories being catered for under the proposed regulations are those envisaged by the working party on the register of electors, by Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling and others mentioned the need to accommodate disabled persons who wished to vote in person at polling stations.  I am in total agreement with this sentiment.  My Department always draw the attention of returning officers to this matter at election time.  A number of Deputies contended that we <Col N="1545" /> should be looking at polling booths, particularly with regard to modern community developments, to ensure that such people are facilitated.  As well as faciliating disabled persons with a postal vote we should allow them live as full a life as possible, allowing them to exercise their right to vote within the confines of polling booths.  We are making every effort to do so.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the register for postal voters.  This is provided for in the regulations.  The returning officer will be required to prepare a supplementary postal voters' list, making it available for inspection in his office.  He will also be required to supply, on request, to each candidate nominated for election in each local election area a copy of the list for that area, which is important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerard Brady raised the question of partially sighted persons, suggesting that they be entitled to a postal vote as well.  I should say that existing legislation enables persons with visual problems to be assisted by a companion or a presiding officer at polling stations.  Therefore there are adequate facilities for the partially sighted, giving them the protection of the polling booth, affording them the right to exercise their wish to attend and vote personally.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for their co-operation and contributions on this motion.  I think it constitutes the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1546" /> We should always examine ways of enabling as many people as possible to vote.  After all, we are democrats and it is the feeling of this House &mdash; perhaps with the exception of one or two Members &mdash; that what we are doing is correct. Neither should we be too preoccupied with abuses.  Rather should we ensure that they are minimised.  Our main goal should be to ensure that as many people as possible can vote.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw your attention to the fact that precedent is against you in this matter.  It is a long established tradition that a Minister answering a question by way of tabular statement will frequently, as a matter of courtesy &mdash; provided the Deputy does not abuse the matter &mdash; give a simple figure or two from the statement.</P>

      <P>The table will be available in the General Office within minutes.  My recollection in this House is that when a person was answered by tabular statement &mdash; I am going back to 1965 &mdash; there was never even an attempt to ask supplementary questions.  It may be that now and again since then this practice has crept in, but I am asking for the co-operation of the House in this matter.  If the House in its wisdom thinks that there should be no such thing as a tabular statement that is all right.  If the rules are changed and questions must be answered orally, I will implement such a system.  However, my interpretation of the tabular statement is that it does not lend itself to supplementaries and I am so ruling now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that over the last two years this House is as well behaved and orderly as any I have experienced. However, I do not think we need to make &mdash; as our American friends would say &mdash; a federal case out of this.  I am merely bringing to your attention in the most courteous and respectful possible way possible &mdash; granted my personality being what it is &mdash; the fact that for a long period of years, I am not going back as far as 1965, it has been a courteous tradition here, admittedly always at the discretion of the answering Minister, that one or two figures were given across the floor of the House by a Minister.  If a Minister does not wish to do so, that is his privilege and prerogative; but I do not think it is the function of the Chair to prevent these small courtesies between us.  God knows there is sufficient debate, discussion and argument and these small courtesies on a personal basis between Deputies on opposite sides should be encouraged rather than discouraged by you.  I am just saying it has been the practice for some time and I think it is an admirable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the Chair is to see that the business of this House is conducted in an orderly and efficient manner.  In regard to parliamentary questions and supplementary questions, and with particular reference to a supplementary question as this is, I am guided by Standing Order No. 37 which states that supplementary questions may be put only for the further elucidation of the information requested and shall be subject to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, both as to relevance and as to <Col N="1549" /> number.  It is a matter of supreme indifference to the Chair whether questions are answered by tabular statement or by oral answer but my experience as a Deputy and as Ceann Comhairle is that, if you have a mixture of a tabular statement and an oral answer, there is confusion and chaos because supplementary questions are asked about information which has not been given.  It is not satisfactory and I ask the House to revert to the old practice.  When a question is answered by tabular statement it should be left at that and I so rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to press this beyond the bounds of reason but I submit that whether a Minister gives an answer by way of tabular statement is not within your control, nor is it within the control of the Opposition.  It is entirely at the discretion of the answering Minister and, if he or she so wishes, he or she can resort to the tabular statement as has happened.  On a couple of occasions recently a Minister, particularly the Minister for Finance, has given an answer by way of tabular statement when there were only two figures involved.  I am making the point that if it were a matter of agreement between a Deputy asking a question and the Minister answering that a tabular statement was to be provided, that would be one thing; but it is entirely for the Minister answering to decide whether he or she gives a tabular statement. In those circumstances the practice in recent years is desirable.  If a particular figure can be given out of the tabular statement for the convenience of the Deputy asking the question and the practice is not abused, then, if the Minister so wishes, the Chair should not rule out that type of answer.  If the matter is done on the basis of co-operation and courtesy between a Minister and Deputy, then nothing is lost in the order or dignity of the House.  I appeal to you not to arbitrarily abrogate this practice which may, technically, be outside Standing Orders but which is well honoured by precedent.  There is nothing lost by affording a Deputy the courtesy and convenience of giving one figure on request <Col N="1550" /> from a tabular statement.  There my case rests.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I interpret the rules in a generous way.  As recently as yesterday, because of exceptional circumstances, I allowed almost one hour for a Private Notice Question.  In that regard the House, with my tacit consent and approval must have established a record.  I have read Standing Order No. 37 and I have been interpreting that Standing Order in a commonsense and reasonable way.  I find now, on referring to precedence, that I am not the only one to interpret it in that way.  I refer the House to a precedent printed in the Book of Precedents regarding supplementary questions, that is, that when a reply is to be printed in the Official Report and not given orally, Members should await the reply rather than pursue the matter by supplementary question.  That has been the case down through the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware of a statement (details supplied) made by the chairman of a major Irish industrial group indicating that one of the major reasons for the group in question seeking investment opportunities abroad was the condition of the market sector of the Irish economy and the prospective profitability of investment here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the statement to which the Deputy refers.  While I do not wish to understate the problems of low profitability and high costs within the Irish economy, nevertheless it also needs to be recognised that manufacturing output last year is estimated to have increased by 11 per cent and that many firms within the market sector of the economy are continuing both to be profitable and to invest those profits in expanding productive capacity in Ireland.  This year's budget was designed, within the constraints imposed by the need to continue with the necessary adjustments to the public finances, to improve confidence and to boost economic activity.  I would stress in particular the changes which were introduced in the income tax and VAT systems.  As I said in my Financial Statement, these will unquestionably <Col N="1553" /> improve the climate for enterprise, effort and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some major domestic companies have taken a deliberate decision to invest outside Ireland rather than in this economy, that in particular some major construction companies are engaging up to about 85 per cent of their investment programme outside the country merely in order to maintain a skeleton activity in Ireland?  Is the Minister not aware that some of the major enterprises, banking and financial institutions, are investing a very high proportion of their funds outside the country?  In these circumstances is the Minister prepared at least to acknowledge that the policies being pursued by the Government in the past two years are the direct cause of this haemorrhage of investment to places outside the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, as is every other Member of the House, that a number of Irish companies are investing abroad for a multiplicity of reasons, some of those reasons going back for a number of years.  Perhaps even Deputy O'Kennedy would agree that we should be happy that some Irish companies are able to make advances on markets elsewhere. I see nothing wrong with an Irish based multinational company.  The more we have of them the better.  Other companies are investing abroad because they do not foresee the immediate prospect of growth in their activities within this economy.  Their judgments are based on the state of the market and the market is in a certain state for a number of different reasons, not the least of which is the fact that, despite the difficulties we must face, we have maintained a higher level of economic activity during many years than might have been justified strictly by the condition of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the fact that some Irish companies are proving their maturity and their capacity to diversify abroad but I am asking whether the Minister is concerned that some of <Col N="1554" /> those companies are forced to invest abroad because of the market conditions here.  I suggest that regarding the construction industry, for instance, the market condition is almost exclusively a consequence of Government policy.  This is reinforced by the fact that other countries, notably the Isle of Man are holding major investment conferences in Ireland in an effort to attract money from here to a climate that is better for investment. Ordinary Irish investors are investing huge proportions of their potential outside the country.  The Minister must be aware of that fact and must move to correct it as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is flying in the face of facts, as he knows very well, in trying to indicate that the market for construction activity here is determined exclusively by Government policy.  That is not the case, so to the extent that the Deputy's contentions are based on that, they are wrong.  On the other point raised by the Deputy, I agree that people involved in investment institutions will prospect for markets anywhere they think they can find them but it is rather curious that today we are discussing the matter in the terms in which Deputy O'Kennedy has raised it, when yesterday a colleague of his was asking me if I would consider some further relaxation in our exchange control regulations.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to reports of a recent speech by the Chief Executive of the Bank of Ireland in which he referred, <i>inter alia</i>, to lending risks and the possibility of risk premiums.  My Department have been assured by the Bank of Ireland that it did not propose the introduction of such premiums.</P>
      <P>I might add that the regulation of bank interest rates is a matter for the Central Bank.  That bank also has confirmed that no proposal in relation to risk premiums has been put to it for consideration.</P>

Equally, I have been informed by the Central Bank, which deals with the regulation of interest rates, that no proposal of that kind was put to the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>The present day values of the pre-decimal notes and coins would be as follows: £1 note, 17p; 10 shilling note, 8½p; half crown, 2p; shilling, 1p; sixpence, ½p; threepence, ¼p; I consider that the present range of denominations of coins and legal tender notes is adequate for transaction purposes and will be further enhanced by the proposed 20p coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no information on the circulation of forged currency but I am satisfied that it is insignificant.  The Central Bank have informed me that they are not aware of any cases involving forged coins in recent years.  In the case of legal tender notes Garda vigilance has resulted in seizures of forged £5 and £10 notes in the <Col N="1562" /> past two years together with the relevant printing materials.</P>

Further details will be found in the publication, <i>Coinage of Saorstát Éireann 1928,</i> published by the Stationery Office, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The 1928 coinage comprised eight coins, viz, farthing, halfpenny, penny, threepence, six pence, shilling, two shilling and half-crown.  The farthing and halfpenny were withdrawn in 1969 and the half-crown in 1970.  On the changeover to a decimal systems in February 1971 the penny, three pence and sixpence were withdrawn.  The current ½p, 1p and 2p coins were introduced and the shilling and two shilling coins became the 5p and 10p respectively.  A 50p coin was also introduced in place of the ten shilling note.

      <P>I referred earlier to the proposed 20p. coin.  I announced on 31 August last that the Government had approved in principle the introduction of this coin, subject to the approval of the Dáil and Seanad.  I am arranging to have a copy of this announcement placed in the Library. Work is proceeding on the preparations for this issue and I will be bringing proposals before the House in due course.  I hope it will be possible to issue this coin before the end of the year.  I have no immediate plans for the issue of other new coins or notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither I nor the Central Bank have any function in regard to the provision of medals.  As regards commemorative <Col N="1563" /> coins, it has been long-standing policy to provide coins primarily for domestic purposes.  A special silver ten shilling coin was issued in 1966 on the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising.  Should another suitable occasion arise the striking of a commemorative coin would be considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>I will do my best to deal with each of the five questions.  I do regard this, unintentionally on the Minister's part, as an absolutely derisory reply to so many questions.  I hope this practice will change.  Given the cumulative factor of inflation, £1 down to 17p. since decimalisation, there is an urgent need to review the present range of denominations. Would the Minister consider the introduction of a £2 note or a £1 coin? From the Minister's reply it is apparent that the present copper coinage has virtually no value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to ask supplementaries on so many questions but what safeguards operate in the Department to combat counterfeiting or forgery, given the present upsurge in crime?  We all know of instances of forgeries that have taken place.  In respect of coinage and notes, will the Minister tell the House if any of this currency is printed or minted in this country?  What is the practice in <Col N="1564" /> that regard?  Will the Minister not agree that it is long overdue for the Department to commission the designing of a new range of currency?  The Minister referred to the designs recommended by the committee chaired by the poet W. B. Yeats. Surely the Minister will agree that this would afford an ideal opportunity for young artists and sculptors to participate in such a competition?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the changeover during decimalisation from the original farmyard coins to Celtic designs.  I suggest that that was a compromise scheme between two sets of coins which did not even blend.  On those grounds would the Minister consider having a new set of coins commissioned?  It is apparent from the Minister's reply that there is no commitment to the most important area of involving the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, except in one instance in 1966 for the Pearse commemorative coin.  Surely the Minister would see that it would be an ideal opportunity to collect extra revenue to engage in that practice, as happens in many other nations.  An ideal opportunity was offered to us last year when President Ronald Reagan visited Ireland.  Would the Minister consider having an urgent study carried out to re-evaluate the usage of our coins, the duration our paper money stands, with a view to providing a whole new range of coins?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, I hope we will introduce a 20p coin and issue it before the end of the year.  I will have to come before the House with the necessary measures to bring that about. Consultations on the design of the coin between the Arts Council and the Central Bank are in progress and I hope we will come to a decision on that in the near future.  I do not intend to issue a £1 coin <Col N="1565" /> and, while I am sure there will not be unanimity on the matter, I would refer Deputies to the experience of our near neighbour in the issue of a £1 coin which, as far as I can gather, has not proved to be either very successful or welcome on any large scale by the citizens.  Not only is it small but it is heavy, and there is a difficulty in that regard.  I have no evidence that there is a need to issue a £2 note as suggested by the Deputy.  There is an apparent difficulty in relation to the £1 note which gets grubby very quickly. That is, I am told, because of heavy use rather than because of the lack of quality in the note.  Recently Members of the House will have seen that £1 notes seem to be grubbier than they normally tended to be.  The reason was that for a time there was an interruption in the flow of the £1 notes from our note printing unit.</P>
      <P>In relation to combating counterfeit moneys and forgeries, we have to rely on the vigilance of the banks, financial institutions and the ordinary public to bring apparent cases of forgery to the notice of the authorities.  We have been quite successful over the last few years in detecting forgeries and in preventing widespread circulation of forged notes.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy was saying about the design of our coinage is a matter that is clearly open to debate and I am quite certain that if we were to have a redesign of the whole range of coinage there would be disagreement about whatever solution might be adopted because it is a matter of individual judgment as to whether or not people like the look of the new coin. I remember on one occasion, when new stamps were introduced bringing in the Celtic animal motifs, there was curious correspondence in the newspapers about the apparent obscenity of putting on stamps animals that seemed to be eating their own tails.  We know where the motifs came from.</P>

      <P>In relation to the issue of commemorative coins, the Deputy will be aware that every year.  I receive a number of proposals for the issue of coins or medallions in various precious metals, normally with the suggestion that a fee or royalty would be paid to the State and that the State would get a commission from the issue of these.  I have examined a number of these proposals and I have never been pursuaded that they would be as financially interesting to the State as is often pretended nor am I convinced that involvement in that type of business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions arising from the Minister's omnibus reply.  In regard to the 20p coin which the Minister says is forthcoming before the end of this year, what element of competition has the Minister built into the design of this coin?  Secondly, will the Minister assure the House, even now, that at the very least the general pattern and dimensions of the British 20p coin will not be reproduced here in a way that is sadly familiar to us?  Thirdly, would the Minister agree that the Irish coinage, in the way in which Deputy Brady, suggested, in general is <Col N="1567" /> far too heavy by reference to its value, when one considers, to take an example, that the German 5 mark piece is about the same size as an Irish 10p but that it takes 16 tenpences to buy a German 5 mark piece?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree &mdash; to concede a point to Deputy Brady &mdash; that the total Irish coinage has degenerated and become barbarised since 1928 and now represents a dog's breakfast to which the new 20p coin will only add a further ingredient?  Even though I heard the Minister say that he had examined the proposals for commemorative coins, would the Minister examine the experience of some perfectly respectable country, not banana Republics, but a country such as Austria which regularly goes in for the issue of commemorative coins with a high collectors' pay-off for the State, and say whether the single experience we had in 1966 is perhaps a bad one to go by &mdash; there was no great demand for the coin because it was extremely ugly, although copies are now worth about £15?  Would the Minister be willing, since this is not a political matter but an aesthetic matter, to see a small deputation of Deputies and Senators who are interested in this question to thrash it out with him quietly in his room?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point in relation to the 20p coin is that we have not provided for a competition.  I have taken the step of consulting the Arts Council on the design of the coin.  It is perfectly appropriate that we should do that and that is one of the reasons why we have an Arts Council.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Kelly that the Irish 20p coin will not bear any close resemblance to the UK 20p coin nor do I see any reason why it should.  I agree with Deputy Kelly in his feeling that our coinage is too heavy, although I have the impression that that is not the general view of the House.  I am not considering a redesign of the coinage at <Col N="1568" /> the moment but in the event that we consider a redesign of the coinage I would take the point that we should consider using a lighter alloy to produce lighter coins.  I come to the point which Deputy Kelly had made for me.  He, with his usual facility of language, claims that our coinage has degenerated and been barbarised since &mdash; I have forgotten the date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the concern expressed by Deputy Kelly about the issue of special coins, collectors pieces and so on.  Over the last two years I have examined a number of proposals to issue coins, medals, tokens or whatever of that kind and I have not been convinced that the case would be, as is usually claimed by the promoters, that they would become very popular collectors pieces and that there would be a lot of money for the State.  I am not alone in having drawn that conclusion because I know that a number of those proposals or very similar proposals were made to my predecessors.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions   Oral Answers - National Plan Objectives.</Title>
    <P>11.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is satisfied with the progress being made in achieving the number one objective of the national plan, <i>Building On Reality, 1985-1987</i>, namely the need, as the major priority, to halt and reverse the continuing upward spiral of unemployment; the unemployment figures at the end of each month since the publication of the plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The national plan is intended to create the conditions in which employment will be more readily created and sustained.  While I would like to see greater progress being made with unemployment, I should point out that the growth in manufacturing output, which increased by 13½ per cent in the first 11 months of 1984, combined with the measures taken in my recent budget, will have a major positive impact on unemployment during the course of the year.  These factors will be reinforced by the substantial initiatives announced in the plan to assist the long term unemployed and which have not yet begun to take effect.</P>
      <P>The end month live register totals since the national plan was published were as follows: October 1984, 212, 290; November 1984, 216, 517; December 1984, 225, 445; January 1985 234, 064; February 1985 233, 909.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very obvious the figures are going in the wrong direction. Can the Minister give us any positive indication that the plan has any relevance at all, seeing that in the past six months we have had an increase of more than 20,000 in the unemployment list?  The unemployed and I are not interested in industrial output.  We are interested in jobs.  Can the Minister give us any indication of progress towards creating real jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the national plan we provided for a series of measures, including direct employment, and we have provided assistance to industry which will have a positive effect on employment. The effect of this year's budget will be to improve employment prospects.  I do not think the Deputy should ask me to reverse any of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1583" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Specifically, what budget measure is the Minister talking about?  He spoke about reduced taxation on the PAYE sector whereas in fact he increased it.  This year there will be an increase of £177 million in PAYE tax. Would the Minister tell us specifically about the positive measures in the budget that will improve employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have debated the plan three times and we are in the middle of the budget debate and I would warn the Deputy against confusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not be provocative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be factual. The tax measures which we took in this year's budget will mean that each individual taxpayer in 1985-86 will have less to pay than if we had made no changes in the system.  Naturally the total tax take will increase because of increases in individual incomes.  Whether the Deputy likes it or not, the changes made in VAT, particularly the reduction from 35 per cent to 23 per cent, will have a big impact on the cash flow of Irish industry and allow industry to expand and thereby to increase employment.  It is measures of that kind that will have an effect on employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister change the title to &ldquo;Ignoring Reality&rdquo; in view of the fact that within months of the publication of the plan, which was based on an average of 217,500 unemployed, in two consecutive months we have had a figure of 234,000 unemployed?  Because of that, the Government found it necessary to appoint the Minister for Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is becoming an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>On the last occasion the Minister, when replying to my amendment which seeks to give right to a training school to select their own students, elaborated on what is in the Bill.  From what he said it is obvious that he intends that the central applications bureau will have the right to select student nurses and send them to a particular training school.  That is entirely unacceptable to us.  First, there is the employer-employee relationship that exists in hospitals &mdash; student nurses are employees of hospitals, the training schools &mdash; and we cannot lose sight of that.  It would be wrong that student nurses should be sent to a training school without that training school having a say in the selection process.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the character and ethos of the hospitals.  I should like to ask the Minister how his ideas on the method of selection would be in keeping with the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, which made it clear that An Bord Altranais would not interfere with the autonomy of the nursing school attached to any participating hospital of a particular denominational character.  We believe that the employing authority must have the right of selection to ensure that they are able to maintain the character and ethos of the hospital.  I cannot say how the central applications bureau as proposed by the Minister will ensure a fairer system.  If there is any unfairness in the present system it can be eliminated without introducing a system whereby An Bord Altranais, through their central applications bureau, will send students to a particular training school.  Our amendment should be accepted.  It is very important that the training school have the final say in the selection of students to their school.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 17, subsection (1), line 31, to delete &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; and substitute <Col N="1708" />&ldquo;at least once in every four years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From time to time&rdquo; is not an appropriate phrase.  It is a very vague phrase to use in the Bill.  It can be rather meaningless. Our amendment proposes to put a specific number of years in the Bill, that is, four years, so that there will be some certainty about the decision of the board. Subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>The Board shall, from time to time, satisfy itself as to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the suitability of education and training for nurses provided by any hospital,...</P>
    <P>(b)  the standards of theoretical and practical knowledge required for examinations,</P>
    <P>They could be left for a period of ten years. There could be enormous changes in the practice of medicine.  The board has to satisfy itself as to the clinical training and experience provided in any training programme and the adequacy and suitability of post registration training courses for nurses.  Continuous training courses after registration are often neglected for fairly long periods.  It is essential for the proper running of the board and maintaining the proper standards in the nursing profession that the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; should be replaced by &ldquo;at least once in every four years&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment proposes that at least once in every five years the board would satisfy itself as to the suitability of the standards of nurse education <Col N="1709" /> and training.  The phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; is not satisfactory.  There should be a set period of time within which the board would satisfy itself as to the suitability of the training establishments.</P>

      <P>I also believe there should be some definite time in the Bill. As it stands, it is rather vague.  I would have two worries if we do not set down a specific time.  First, the board could go on for ten or 15 years without assessing the suitability or otherwise of the nursing schools.  There is the other danger that we could hassle them every two or three months.  For that reason we should provide a specific time, perhaps four or five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, education and training is an on-going process and one I would be somewhat reluctant to see constrained by specific time limits.  That is the reason I had originally inserted the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;, seeing it as an appropriate one to be used in relation to those functions.  I was rather anxious that account be taken of the necessarily continuous nature of the functions themselves. I might equally make the point to Deputies that advances in medicine and, consequently, in nursing care take place so rapidly that training courses must strive constantly to keep abreast of such developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the general thrust of the initial part of that section.  However, in deference to those who have proposed these amendments, I would be prepared to agree that we might reach agreement on Report Stage on a particular formulation of words, though perhaps not as specific as Deputies Mac Giolla, De Rossa or O'Hanlon had recommended. Perhaps we could use a phrase such as &ldquo;not more than five years&rdquo;, leaving it somewhat more flexible without tying it down to once every four years or once every five years &mdash; say &ldquo;in a period of not more than five years&rdquo;.  I would be prepared to introduce an amendment <Col N="1710" /> along those lines on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In relation to the functions of the board regarding training, what would be the position of the board, say, in non-registration courses?  Would the board have any powers in terms of providing courses that are not related directly to registration?</P>
      <P>My other question relates to subsection (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Board may maintain statistical records and make such records available for research and planning, including manpower planning purposes.</P>
      <P>Would the privacy of the individual be placed at risk there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential point of the question raised by Deputy O'Hanlon is that the board will not be running courses but will have to satisfy themselves as to the suitability and adequacy of all courses of nursing education and training both at pre-and post-registration levels. Subsection (1) is a new provision.  Therefore the non-registration or pre-registration courses could be encompassed within the work of the board.  I can give the Deputy an assurance in relation to manpower planning purposes and general statistical records that, of course, confidentiality will be maintained.  I would be particularly anxious that such be maintained by the board, as is the case in regard to general health records because quite sensitive material may be on the records and in the hands of very young people in terms of their training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to make some observations on this section.  I have been going through it for some time and am most disturbed at some of its implications. I was unable to amend it suitably. I have some comments I would ask the Minister to take on board with regard to the part on fitness to practise.  I am not worried about the board having the power to hear reasons that a nurse, through her or his misconduct, is not fit to practise &mdash; that is a general power afforded professional bodies.  This is a professional body and professional conduct must be maintained.</P>
      <P>What really concerns me is the provision in subsection (1) (b), which says:</P>
      <P>alleged fitness to engage in such practice by reason of physical or mental disability,</P>
      <P>which is open to grave abuse and carries great dangers for the nursing profession. I do not see anything in it which protects the disabled, their jobs or that affords them permanence of employment.  If they are found unfit to practise the profession of nursing due to a physical disability, are they out of a job for life?  Surely our job should be to protect the jobs of disabled persons?  Perhaps the services of nurses who are not able to work on wards could be utilised in administration or in laboratories. This does not seem to be allowed for in the Bill; when you come before the board and are declared unfit to perform all the duties of the nursing profession due to physical disability, you are no longer a nurse and are struck off the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to mental disability which is much more difficult to assess. There is not sufficient protection in the Bill to ensure that people are not moved from the register unnecessarily perhaps because of a period of mental stress <Col N="1713" /> when they require medical and nursing care themselves for some time to bring them back to full health.  The nurse should be given sufficient sick leave, maybe 12 months, to overcome the particular mental or physical disability but, instead, they will be brought before the board after a month or two and declared unfit to practise the profession of nursing. That area is wide open to abuse; it is not in the best interests of nurses or the concern and care which we should ensure is enshrined in the legislation for physically or mentally unwell people.  We talk a lot about the care of the physically handicapped, the deaf and the blind, in relation to employment and we should ensure that they get the work which they are capable of doing in spite of their disabilities.  In this Bill there is a great danger that we are excluding anybody who has a physical or mental disability, even of a temporary nature.</P>
    <P>There are nearly three pages in the Bill in relation to the Unfitness to Practise Committee and the procedure to be adopted by them or the board.  They may be directed by the board to carry out an inquiry or they may carry out an inquiry themselves if someone suggests that a person is unfit to practise because of misconduct, physical or mental disability. I was unable to formulate appropriate amendments to this section but I am asking the Minister to ensure that nurses will not lose their jobs because of physical disability if they are capable of doing some other job within the health care or nursing areas.  I hope the Minister will find a way to ensure that these nurses are not struck off the register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nurses often injure themselves in the course of their duties and a physical disability would be obvious.  I am sure that problem would be dealt with fairly but the question of mental disability and misconduct are distinct and separate. Nurses under strain can often act in ways which are related to a nervous breakdown. I know of such cases and a mental disability can be as temporary as a physical disability.  However, when nurses change employment from one hospital to another, a confidential report follows <Col N="1714" /> them.  The nurse is question may not even know that there is a reference to her mental disability and, although she is cured, it can be a deciding factor in future employment opportunities.  A nurse may be under stress working in a particular hospital where the environment is not conducive to her wellbeing.  She may have a nervous breakdown and, by having treatment and being reassigned to another hospital, she may be completely cured.  By this report following her to her new place of employment, her career could be permanently damaged and she might have to make do with a lesser status in order to remain in employment.  I am very concerned about this.</P>
      <P>Where a nurse is brought to account because of misconduct or the need to analyse her actions because of mental or physical disability, it is essential that all the details relating to her case should be available to the nurse in question.  Often nurses are given no chance to defend themselves, which is wrong and unfair. The Minister must ensure that they are given a copy of the charges against them in time to get legal advice if necessary. Mental disability or temporary breakdown should not be an inhibiting factor in the rest of their nursing life.  Many nurses are under severe strain at present because of the trauma of accidents and so on and young girls often have setbacks but that should not affect the rest of their career.</P>

      <P>When the board or any other person applies for an inquiry, they should first ensure that they are satisfied that the nurse in question has been given an opportunity to work in a number of different areas.  While, for example, a nurse may be unfit physically for work in one area, she might be competent in another area.  For instance, she might be capable of working in the central supply area of a hospital but not capable of working on a busy ward.  I should like an assurance that when an inquiry of this kind is initiated those responsible would ensure that the nurse be given an opportunity of working in various areas in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> The other matter I wish to refer to relates to section 39 (1) (a) and (b).  It appears a little insensitive to group alleged professional misconduct with alleged unfitness to practise by reason of physical or mental disability.  One would have thought that this could have been dealt with in a different way, that perhaps there would have been a distinction between procedures for processing cases in each of these categories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last point raised by Deputy Faulkner.  Fitness to practise committees serve to protect the public and to maintain the standards of the professions.  There is a section in the legislation relating to the Medical Council which is similar to this section here and I do not think there has been any complaint from members of the medical profession about inquiries suffered as a result of the section.  However, I can appreciate the concern of many nurses, particularly in relation to subsection (1) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner has highlighted the point that on the surface it appears unreasonable to group together alleged professional misconduct and the question of alleged unfitness to practise by reason of physical or mental disability.  I understand that other European countries have moved away from this concept.  The recent legislation in the UK provided for procedures to improve the protection of the public by considering cases in which it is alleged that a nurse is no longer safe to practise because of illness rather than by virtue of being guilty of some culpable action.  In the UK cases considered necessary to be put forward for hearing before the professional conduct committee must take place in law.  If the investigation concerns alleged unfitness to engage in practise by reason of physical or mental disability, the hearing is in private; but it is interesting that, if at the initial investigation the person concerned appears unfit to practise because of illness, the case is viewed by a group of three professional screeners who are nurse members of the central council.  The nurse undergoes an <Col N="1716" /> independent medical examination and the report from that is sent to the professional screeners.  If illness is indicated, the nurse is referred to a health committee who may decide on the outcome; but in the case of professional misconduct the case will be dealt with in the ordinary way, that is, through the fitness to practise committee.  Nurses here consider that something similar would be appropriate to this country and that investigations into alleged unfitness to practise by reason of physical or mental disability should be dealt with in a way that is different from the way in which the alleged professional misconduct is dealt with. Perhaps the Minister will consider this point between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The only other point raised on the section relates to the information to be given to a person who is to be investigated by the fitness to practise committee.  Subsection (4) of section 39 provides that the CEO would forward by way of pre-paid post to the address of the person as stated in the register notice of the nature of the evidence proposed to be considered at the inquiry.  The point has been made that there should be more evidence and that the nurse who is about to be investigaged should have full information as to matters to be brought before the committee. In such cases the letters should be sent by registered post rather than by pre-paid post so as to ensure that they reach those for whom they are intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, consider it somewhat insensitive to group together the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1).  Is there any possibility of introducing an amendment to separate the two, because there is a major difference between alleged professional misconduct and alleged unfitness to practise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other concern relates to a submission made to me &mdash; and made also to the Minister, I understand &mdash; from the Psychiatric Nurses Association in which they express fears about the possibility of duplication.  We all agree on the need for a fitness to practise provision but these nurses are concerned that there may be <Col N="1717" /> duplication between the fitness to practise committee and what they refer to as the existing stringent disciplinary procedure laid down by employing authorities. These nurses express the fear that they may be accountable to two bodies, to their employer and to the board, in relation to the performance of their duties. They say also that there must be a clear understanding of what is appropriate for processing through agreed management-trade union procedures and what is appropriate for the fitness to practise committee.  The PNA are concerned that involvement in a legitimate industrial dispute could result in a nurse being reported for professional misconduct or in her being accountable for involvement in some incident occurring outside normal working hours.  The nurses are concerned that they could be found unfit to practise for one reason rather than the other.  I should like the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate readily the concern of Members with this very difficult section, a section which understandably could give rise to certain facts.  First, the inclusion of a provision denying permission to continue in practice for reasons of physical or mental disability is largely a matter of convenience in drafting.  That section has stood the test of time in the Act dealing with medical practitioners and now it is proposed for the Dentists Bill.  I think it will also stand the test of time there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, for example, that nurse may suffer from drug addiction or schizophrenia. In that connection the board or any person may apply to the fitness to practise committee to determine whether the nurse in question should be permitted to continue to practise as a nurse.  It is a very serious matter.  In the first instance the committee would have to consider the application under section 39(2) and then they would have to satisfy themselves &ldquo;that there is not sufficient cause to warrant the holding of an inquiry&rdquo;.  If the evidence is there the committee would have to hold an inquiry, but clearly the evidence would have to exist.  This is <Col N="1718" /> particularly so because this is an area where one is dealing with subjective judgments and one would have to be exceptionally careful.  I have not the slightest doubt but that the greatest care would be exercised in such a case.  Equally, the rights of the person concerned have to be protected fully and I wish to reassure Deputy Glenn, Deputy De Rossa and others who have raised this matter.  The nature of the evidence proposed to be considered would have to be conveyed to the person concerned.  Section 39(4) states:</P>
    <P>When it is proposed to hold an inquiry under subsection (3) of this section the person who is the subject of the inquiry shall be given notice in writing by the Chief Executive Officer sent by pre-paid post to the address of that person as stated in the register of the nature of the evidence proposed to be considered at the inquiry...</P>
    <P>In effect, one is virtually talking of a High Court case, of a Book of Evidence being produced.  Subsections (3) to (7) deal with witnesses appearing before the fitness to practise committee.  They will be given the same immunity and privileges as if they were witnesses in the High Court.  A person making a serious allegation about another who is engaged in the practice of nursing would have to get protection in the giving of that evidence and would have the same privileges as a witness before the High Court.  Equally, it is provided that in the case of the person who is the subject of the inquiry his or her representative, if any, should be given an opportunity of being present at the hearing.  There is no question of somebody in a hospital or in a health board writing in and saying that Nurse Mary Murphy has an incurable case of alcoholism, schizophrenia or drug addiction and should be removed.  Such an allegation must be backed up and full details must be given to the person concerned.</P>
    <P>The board have a number of options. They need not exclude the person from practising nursing.  They could indicate that the person concerned is in need of treatment, or that the degree of disability is not material to the practice of nursing, <Col N="1719" /> which is a very important issue.  I do not think that a nurse with a particular physical disability or with a degree of mental illness should, of necessity, be obliged to terminate her work as a nurse. It would be a matter of assessment by the board and the options are open to them when a case is reported to them.  They may decide the degree of disability is not material, that the degree of disability is material but perhaps is amenable to remedial treatment, or the board may decide that the disability is material and is likely to remain that way.  Then the board would have to make up their mind and record their decision.  In a quasi-judicial sense the board will be accountable for their decision because there is the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>The procedures to be followed are clear cut.  Deputy Ormonde made a point about duplication but I do not think it holds too much merit.  Without a section of this kind I do not think it would be possible to operate a register or to operate the general provisions of fitness to practise.  Physical or mental disability does not prevent continuing employment but there can be a degree of disability and a dispute may arise.  A nurse may wish to continue in employment but her employers may be of the view it would be entirely inappropriate that she should continue to practise as a nurse.  However, they would have to be prepared to back that up and in these days of litigation if one makes a mess of a case like that one finishes up paying many tens of thousands of pounds in damages.  That is why I think there is considerable protection.</P>
    <P>The fitness to practise committee must embody their findings in a report to the board, specifying the nature of the application and the evidence laid before them. A considerable number of persons, some 29 in all, will receive full information. The fast majority will be nurses and they will get information in confidence about their colleague.  They will have to make up their mind about the matter.  It would be inappropriate to exclude a provision of this nature if we want to take seriously matters such as professional conduct, <Col N="1720" /> competence and capacity.  Medical records are kept by employers in relation to their employees, whether they are public service employees, civil servants or general employees.  While the understandable fears expressed by Deputies exist and will remain, we can only do our best in drafting legislation to ensure that no injustice is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is of vital importance to proper administration and I am not suggesting that the provision should be diluted.  I have been on interview boards in hospitals. It is a fact that nurses' records pass from one matron to another.  My concern in this area is this.  Supposing a young person is accused of misconduct or unfitness to practise through physical or mental disability, they go through this procedure and are found to be not guilty, will that be deleted for all time from their record?  Will there be any reference to it on their record?  If an interview board is confronted with a panel of applicants, all of whom are eminently suitable, the fact that this accusation might be on one applicant's record might mean that the board will come down on the side of another applicant.  I am concerned that a person might have to pay for this accusation for the rest of their lives, although they are found innocent.  I realise matrons have to pass on information about any serious matter, but I am concerned that there will be no reference to any accusation on the record of a person who has been proved to be innocent.  We must ensure that this accusation will never preclude them from changing their employment.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what &ldquo;professional misconduct&rdquo; means.  Can we have a guarantee that professional misconduct means misconduct in a nurse's professional life and not her personal life?  In other words, would it be regarded as professional misconduct if a nurse became an unmarried mother or if she were co-habiting?  For the purpose of this section what is &ldquo;professional misconduct&rdquo;?  Does the Minister mean <Col N="1721" /> professional misconduct and not personal misconduct?</P>

      <P>I want to take issue with the Minister.  He has an amazing knack. I do not know if it is deliberate or accidental, but he appears to suggest that speakers on this side of the House do not see the need for the fitness to practise committee.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Everybody on this side sees the need for such a committee.  The Minister is preaching to the converted in relation to the necessity for such a committee.  While we have certain reservations about particular aspects of this section, we see the need for such a committee. As I said, I do not know if it is deliberate or accidental but he gives the impression that only he is converted.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Mac Giolla I wanted to raise the question of what constitutes alleged professional misconduct.  Must it be something which was done during the time the nurse was on duty, or could it be something outside of that &mdash; for example, drunken driving? In such a case would the nurse be investigated by the fitness to practise committee? What will decide on the code of conduct for nurses?  Will that be a matter for An Bord Altranais?  Will they be entitled to consider offences committed while a nurse is not on duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assure Deputy Ormonde that it was not my intention to infer that Government and Opposition are not at one in the general need for a section of this nature?  Deputy Glenn asked about the prospect of a record being kept of a charge of misconduct which was subsequently rejected by the fitness to practise committee, and the prospect of it being included in a person's employment record.  An assurance is specifically contained in the Bill &mdash; page 19, section 39(5) &mdash; that only where a person has been found guilty of professional misconduct or deemed to be unfit, may the record be made public, but it shall not be made public without the consent of the person unless the person has been <Col N="1722" /> found guilty as a result of the inquiry. This is a very definite protection.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about this matter because when one is employing 25,000 people there is always the 0.1 per cent of either employers or persons in the profession who still act in a malicious, unpredictable and wholly reprehensible way.  You never know what will happen until you hear of a particular case and then that can destroy a person's life.  We must be very careful in operating this section.  An Bord Altranais have been endeavouring to draw up a general code of conduct for nurses, but at present they are not empowered to do this and they are anxious to have that authority.  They will be doing very considerable work in drafting such a code in the very near future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla raised the understandable but extremely difficult question of the converging of gross personal misconduct and professional misconduct. It is very difficult to draw the dividing line.  I have been involved in a situation with medical practitioners.  For example, a medical practitioner could be grossly irresponsible in the use of alcohol to such an extent that his professional capacity was impaired.  It is difficult to know where personal misconduct begins and professional misconduct ends.  This Bill is rigidly confined to the question of professional misconduct in the practice of the profession. I can assure Deputy Mac Giolla that that will be the prime intention and concern of An Bord Altranais.  I can only leave it like that.  I can only give this assurance to Deputies and hope that the section in the Medical Practitioners Act which has stood the test of time despite many challenges will be equally effective on the nursing side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I will expand on the point I made earlier.  If a nurse works on the wards and during the time she works on the wards she develops a physical disability which ultimately results in her being unable to continue to work on the wards, if somebody were to apply to the fitness to practise committee in respect of her fitness and she was judged solely on her <Col N="1723" /> competence to work on the wards, then it might be possible for them to suggest that she was not fit.  In circumstances such as this she should be given permission to work in other areas in which she would be competent.  I would ask that the fitness to practise committee would not decide on her fitness simply because she was not competent to work on wards when she might be eminently competent to work in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very valid point.  If a nurse had been involved in a serious car accident for example and she had a back which made her totally incapable of handling patients in the normal way, and which would require her removal into a tutorial position for instance, if that was denied and if her employer became obdurate and demanded a fitness decision, the fitness to practise committee can go back to the employer and seek further information as to how she was accommodated and may decide then not to proceed with the report and give her a basic protection.  It is a very difficult and dangerous area and one which needs strong trade unionism and strong representation to prevent any abuse of the section.  The Department of Health would be monitoring the general implementation of the section.  We have set up An Bord Altranais to implement it and in consultation with the board I would be anxious to see how it works out in the first couple of years.  The board would be obliged to make detailed reports as to how the section worked.  I would be very distressed as would all Members of this House if there were any breaches of natural justice in this area which impinge to quite an extent on the industrial relations side.</P>

      <P>The nurses are concerned that the failure to pay a retention fee charged by the Board may result in their removal from the register and they are concerned that this is in the same section as removal from the register for professional misconduct.  Obviously not paying the retention fee could hardly be construed as professional misconduct. The other matter in relation to the retention fee is the whole question of the notification to the nurses that they may be removed from the register for failure to pay a retention fee.  Nurses working abroad on mission fields or in Third World countries feel that a period of two months may not be sufficient notice for them to receive word that their retention fee has not been paid.

I note that under the next section and the following sections there are other things that the Board can do.</P>
      <P>Section 41 refers to attaching conditions to retention on the register.  Conditions could be attached in relation to a person who is physically disabled such as that they do not do ward work as in the case mentioned by Deputy Faulkner, and so on.  Why are there only two decisions a board can make in this section and why are all the possibilities not listed?  Do I take it that when the Board make a decision that a person has been either found guilty of professional misconduct or found to be physically unfit to practise or mentally unfit to practise that the Board as well as being able to erase from the register or to suspend registration, can also attach conditions to their retention on the register and can do what is referred to in section 42?</P>

      <P>This is a new provision. Up to now all the board could do was to reprimand, which was rather old fashioned language.  The board could <Col N="1728" /> only reprimand a nurse or strike her off the register.  Henceforth the board can admonish or ensure a nurse and the board formally would have to record such admonition or censure.  Whether such documentation would be made public I am not sure, but the matter would have to be put on record as an act of disapproval of the person concerned.  &ldquo;Censure&rdquo; is stronger than admonish.  Either could occur because of unbecoming behaviour.</P>

      <P>I should like to tell Deputy O'Hanlon that I am not averse to including his amendment but we will have on Report Stage to make some provision for cases where there is no employer and where the board could not notify anybody.  A doctor or a member of the public may report to the board that a nurse was practising in an unprofessional or unqualified way and she could be struck off without there being an employer to notify.  The requirement of notification contained in the Deputy's amendment might be too rigorous in some instances.  I will prepare an amendment for Report Stage whereby the employing authority will be notified in the event of there being an employer in existence.  We can get agreement on a drafting formula.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39<i>a.</i></P>
      <P>In page 25, lines 38 to 40, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Section 52 states:</P>
      <P>(2)  It shall be a function of the Board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that the subsection will interfere with the rights of hospitals as employing authorities in relation to their character and ethos and will be in conflict with what was enshrined in the Hospitals <Col N="1733" /> Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.  That Act clearly protects the rights of hospitals in relation to ethical matters. Section 14 (3) of that Act states:</P>
    <P>(3)  In the exercise of its functions in relation to the co-ordination of the activities of the participating hospitals in the matter of nursing education and the conduct of negotiations in regard to such matters with An Bord Altranais, the Council shall take no action which would operate to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  involve a student nurse in any arrangement for attending lectures on the ethics and psychology of nursing which do not conform to her religious beliefs, or</P>
    <P>(b)  interfere with the autonomy of a nursing school attached to any participating hospital of a particular denominational character.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of that section states:</P>
    <P>(2)  The Council shall not assign any visiting medical staff to a participating hospital of a particular denominational character unless the assignment is in accord with such character save with the approval of the hospital board concerned.</P>
    <P>That enshrines the right of a hospital in regard to ethos and character.  This subsection, in conjunction with other sections in the Bill, gives the Minister extraordinary powers over the ethics of a hospital.  Under section 15 he has the right to discharge the board and to appoint a person or persons to discharge all or any of the functions of the board.</P>
    <P>Under section 54 &ldquo;The Board shall carry out such functions, other than the functions assigned to it by this Act, as may be assigned to it from time to time by the Minister...&rdquo;.  I would not suggest that the present Minister at any time would use these powers incorrectly, but this legislation presumably will carry us on well beyond the end of this century and it is possible that a Minister could give a direction on some matter of fundamental ethics to An Bord Altranais.  If they refuse to carry out the Minister's <Col N="1734" /> directive he can discharge the whole board and appoint one person to act on his behalf who could then direct a hospital in a matter of ethics, behaviour or ethical conduct which might be against the interests of the people but, particularly, against the ethos and character of the particular hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well say that this section appears in the Medical Practitioners' Act and that there was no objection to it at that time.  The big distinction that I would see between the Medical Practitioners' Act and the Bill before us is that the first deals with persons who in the main are independent contractors. Only a minority of our doctors would be employees of an employing authority. The majority are independent contractors working in general practices under the general medical services scheme or working for the voluntary hospitals.  On the other hand, the vast majority of nurses would be employees of an employing agency.  A very tiny minority would not be.  The voluntary hospitals have always cherished their right to have their own ethical code of conduct.  That was enshrined on behalf of the hospitals which are run by the minority religious group here &mdash; the Federation of Hospitals. That is enshrined in the legislation which was prepared by the then Minister in 1961.  I would ask the Minister to delete this subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Hanlon in his request for the deletion of this subsection.  It would give unlimited power to any Minister for Health.  The present Minister may have good intentions, but we do not know who his successors may be.  It is our business to offer the maximum protection now.  The board should have the power to stipulate the guidelines of professional conduct, but it is absolutely essential that the hospitals themselves should have the right to establish the ethical code by which they would administer the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great concern at the moment in relation to this section of the Bill.  As has been pointed out, there are hospitals administering to minority groups who <Col N="1735" /> could be very adversely affected by having a code of conduct imposed upon them.  We can safely leave it to the good sense of the people who have provided this medical service down the years, and have done an excellent job for all of us, to decide the code of conduct which best suits the milieu of their hospital.</P>
    <P>This is also very important because of the area of medicine into which we are entering at the close of the twentieth century.  Medicine is becoming something for debate in most of the Parliaments of the world, with the advent of surrogacy and so many other new technologies. It is essential that we in this country, who have had the benefit of the services of so many religious of all denominations in this area, protect their interests in the common good and for the welfare of all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to resists recalling my earlier contributions to the Nurses Bill when I availed of the opportunity to express my concern at this section.  I am happy to have the comfort of being quite safe in repeating my concern and my reservations.  It is unfortunate that in our country today, if one expresses concern which can be interpreted as the maintaining of what one regards as best in society and if it has any reference at all to religious, straight away one runs the risk of being regarded as an oddity and also of being misquoted elsewhere.  I do not mind that.  The Minister's concern, as expressed early on, that most of the hospitals do not have ethical guidelines is an indication that he and his Department were unhappy about the guidelines in certain hospitals.  My concern was that his unhappiness should not refer to the hospitals in which I would have absolute faith and confidence.  Those hospitals are largely managed by the religious.  I make no apologies whatsoever for saying that, in respect of that management, the religious have displayed an interest, suitability, temperament and spirit of self-sacrifice which has left all those institutions the better for their presence, to say the very least.  I hope nobody would argue with <Col N="1736" /> that.  Instead of having that diluted, it should be maintained, and, if possible, fortified.</P>
      <P>This Bill seems not to recognise the importance of the existing high ethical standards obtaining in these hospitals.  I would not object to anybody who wants another hospital which has ethical standards different from those getting it, if it suits what is regarded as the needs of other people.  I am quite safe in saying that I interpret the wish of the vast majority of our people that there should be an element existing in our hospitals today, a regard for ethical standards, which must be preserved and cherished to the betterment of all.</P>
      <P>I would put to the House and the Deputies listening a question as to whether when we strive to accommodate in one big splash the feelings and desires of all we improve the situation.  I reject any proposition that the introduction of a rule common to everybody improves anything. Rather would I say that excellence comes from the pursuit of a diversity of interests and elements which ultimately leaves a better product.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy about the Minister's desire to introduce what he described at column 1569 of the Official Report of 5 December as &ldquo;a code of ethical conduct applying across the board in the profession&rdquo;. I do not make any apology to the Minister who is present.  I am not indicating all the faith and confidence other people have expressed in him.  I am taking him at his word.  I have not got the confidence in him which I would like to have.  It is he who is saying this, not some future Minister.  I do not think he should have this power because he is not the best interpreter of what I regard as being in the best interests of the people I represent. I would be doing the Minister and the House an injustice if I were to make any hypocritical comment of commendation of the Minister.  In all honesty I could not do it.  The Minister will not lose any sleep over that.  I could not indulge in any complimentary remarks to him when inwardly I harbour these fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of health the religious have made a contribution parallel to the <Col N="1737" /> contribution made by the religious in our educational system.  Perhaps it is fashionable to reject them and to speak about some unreasonable Christian Brother here or an unreasonable nun elsewhere and castigate the whole system.  We all know they have made a very special contribution and, in at least some of our hospitals, I want the maintenance, the continuation and the development of that effort.</P>
    <P>I do not want the idea to go abroad that we are dissatisfied or unhappy with the ethical standards obtaining in our hospitals.  That is the fear I have.  You do not improve anything by reducing everything to the lowest common denominator. That applies to all aspects of life and not just to health, education and matters of religious services or practices.  If the Minister has available to him some proof or evidence of any weakness in what I contend, I maintain that the best product of all is that which emerges after a diversity of effort and conviction by a miscellany of people and agents and agencies. It does not come from watering down everything to the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>This gives the Minister the right to remove existing ethical standards and have them replaced by others.  If there are ills I would rather bear those we have than fly to others of which we know not.  I will not fly to the others unless some indication is given of what they are.  I ask the Minister when he is replying not to extract something from what I said as he did on another occasion when he said I was expressing concern because the religious were not being provided for.  I made no such statement and the Minister knew that well.  He thought he would seem to be making a better case if he could establish that I said that.  As reported at column 1560 of the Official Report, I said:</P>
    <P>I am unhappy in that regard because hospitals which have a religious presence have benefited from it and I do not want to see it removed.</P>
    <P>That was a very fair observation, a very legitimate concern.  I realise I will have an <Col N="1738" /> opportunity to react to what the Minister may say.  In the interests of democracy and the rights of people, apart from the necessity or desirability of it, I ask the Minister to have regard to the rights of people to have recourse to hospitals where they know ethical standards are operating with which they can feel comfortable. There is nothing unreasonable about that.  It is unfortunate that anyone here should have to express that concern about their removal.  I will leave it at that for the moment.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that an amendment has been moved by Fianna Fáil to delete this section and by the Deputies who are supporting the deletion of the section.  We have been dealing with the Nurses Bill for quite some time.  Great praise was given to nurses by all speakers in the Second Stage debate and on Committee Stage.  We have been saying what a wonderful band of people they are, what dedicated service they give, and so on.  Now we do not trust them.  This amendment says we cannot trust nurses.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to raise the status of the nursing profession and we are now telling them we do not trust them as we trust doctors.  It is all right for Deputy O'Hanlon to say most doctors are self-employed and most nurses are employees.  There are self-employed nurses as well, although not as high a proportion as the self-employed doctors.  It is easy for doctors to put a plate on their doors and settle down to business.</P>
      <P>We have no objection to the medical profession setting their own ethical standards. No one has suggested that should be taken away from them, or that the fact that they have set their own ethical standards is interfering with the hospitals' regulations in regard to their ethical standards. We are talking now about the nursing profession and the nurses board.  In spite of what Deputy Tunney said, while the Minister has power to abolish the board he has not got power to give guidance to nurses in relation to ethical conduct and behaviour.  An Bord Altranais have that function under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> About an hour ago we dealt with a section on professional misconduct.  I am quite sure the hospitals have their own regulations in regard to misconduct. Under that section we did not contend that the nursing board should not have any authority to deal with professional misconduct in the nursing profession, that this should be left to the hospitals since they are all employees of hospitals, as Deputy Dr. O'Hanlon said.  What is the point in having a board with functions and in having professional status for the nursing profession unless we trust them at least to be able to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour?  If they cannot do that then they will have no function, purpose or thrust.  The deletion of this section would be degrading to the nursing profession and I hope the Minister will not yield to any pressures in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has covered many of the points I wished to make.  I consider this to be an important provision of the Bill.  Hence I would be opposed to the amendment moved by the Fianna Fáil spokesman.  It is entirely reasonable, necessary and desirable that a professional body such as An Bord Altranais should have a say in matters relating to the ethics of their members. On the extremely important matters with which they must deal on a regular basis &mdash; matters of life and death in so many circumstances, relationships with other human beings and their major responsibilities towards them &mdash; it would be a sad day if they did not have a say themselves, not a total say but one that could be modified by the views and practices in individual hospitals within the context of the whole history and practice of medicine in this country.  It is desirable that they have a voice.  The suspicions this provision seems to have raised are entirely unjustified and unwarranted. Subsections (1) and (3) are totally noncontroversial&mdash;</P>

      <P>In that area very soon the whole of the medical profession, indeed the political world and the whole nation will have to face up to major topics in the area of medicine which were referred to by Deputy Glenn when making a different point.  We must remember all the developments in the area of genetic engineering and surrogacy which are moving at a phenomenal pace. Are we to contend that a body dealing directly with such matters should not have any say?  For example, are those who have questioned this section afraid of that responsibility?  It is something to which we shall all have to face up to very soon when the views and contribution of the nursing profession will be needed. Therefore, it should be allowed to have its say in how we handle these overwhelming, frightening and challenging developments in medicine.  It is important therefore that this section remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment submitted by our Spokesman on Health.  The first thought that struck me on reading the subsection was how the word &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; came to be used.  I could understand and accept the usage of the word &ldquo;behaviour&rdquo;.  It is not sufficient to say that the reason it is included is that it appeared in other Bills.  After all, other Bills were for other times.  We are dealing with present day experiences and in that light I could not understand the usage of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that arises is: what qualifications would the board or individual members have to lay down ethical standards or to give guidance on ethical standards to the nursing profession?  I am strongly of the opinion that the word &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; could very quickly and easily lose its ordinary meaning in this context. One might well visualise a situation in which when the board give guidance they would expect that guidance on ethical matters to be followed and, where it was not followed, equally one could visualise the board deciding on ways and means of ensuring that it is so followed.  Therefore I would say to Deputy Mac Giolla that it is not a question of our not trusting the <Col N="1741" /> nurses.  We certainly do trust them; we have a very high regard for them.  But, as I see it, there is a possibility that the board could enforce their views on the nurses and in so doing enforce a particular ethos on a hospital in which those nurses worked.  It might be suggested that An Bord Altranais would not lay down standards in respect of ethical behaviour which would be at variance with the ethos of a particular hospital.  Probably that would have been the situation that obtained in the past, that might even obtained at present, although in view of the pressures current in the media and elsewhere I would not be too sure of that. For the future one would need to be on one's guard.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this subsection mean that, if An Bord Altranais so decide, they could impose their code of ethics on nurses in hospitals, which code could be in complete contradiction to the code and general ethics of such hospitals.  If, as Deputy Tunney said, there are hospitals with different codes of ethics, with which I might not personally agree, they are perfectly justified in having them and I do not object to such.  But we have a duty to protect the code of ethics in different hospitals which we find satisfactory.  It is our duty to protect that code.  For example, guidance by the board could include a proviso that, if a nurse refused to participate in a particular type of operation to which she had conscientious objections, she could be disciplined and could possibly lose her job.  It should be remembered that at present there is no mobility within the nursing profession.  Therefore there is no way in which a nurse can move elsewhere if she or he cannot accept a particular hospital's procedures.  It is vital that there be a conscience clause included which would enable nurses to refuse to take part in matters to which they had a conscientious objection.</P>
    <P>Anything that affects a nurse in his or her work affects the hospital in which they work.  Therefore guidance by An Bord Altranais &mdash; and this could easily change from guidance to an instruction, when An Bord Altranais could insist on guidance by them being accepted by <Col N="1742" /> nurses &mdash; affects the ethos of the hospital in which nurses work.  The Minister said earlier that there were no codes in many hospitals.  The reality is that, while there may not have been written codes, there certainly were and are codes of behaviour. There always have been codes of conduct in our hospitals, though not necessarily written ones.  In all of those circumstances the amendment submitted by Deputy O'Hanlon should have the support of the House.</P>

      <P>I merely wish to reiterate and add a little to the contributions of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy O'Flaherty.  With all due respect to Deputy Faulkner, when he was talking about the board and its impositions, he seemed to think they were from an alien planet.  As Deputy Mac Giolla pointed out, the board is made up of professional people who will be given the responsibility in regard to qualifications, training and the future and status of nursing. Deputy O'Hanlon informed us that doctors were allowed to have such a clause, autonomy, responsibility and authority included and, suddenly, we decide that we cannot trust a board which is composed of nurses.  I am reminded once again of the authoritarianism which pervades this Chamber again and again and that there is a male point of view evident when looking at certain sections of the community who are not considered responsible enough to be allowed authority and autonomy.  If doctors are allowed to have such a clause, without any conflict or tensions between them and hospitals, it is quite outrageous that we should insult nurses by even suggesting that they would not have the responsibility, integrity or the sheer professionalism to conduct their affairs properly.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with points made by Deputy Mac Giolla and those who reiterated what he said.  He is correct in saying that we gave great praise to the nurses throughout this debate and we never deviated from that praise. Deputy Mac Giolla was here when I <Col N="1743" /> spoke and I am sure he heard exactly. what I said although he chooses to ignore it.</P>
      <P>Section 15 gives the Minister power to discharge the board and section 54 gives him the power to assign new functions to the board.  The board could be abolished and the Minister could then direct the person or persons acting on the board to decide on ethical standards and behaviour which would be transferred to hospitals. I am not concerned about a board that will be elected mainly from nurses because I trust them and, when the board is functioning as outlined in the Bill, I am sure they will be able to give guidance in matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  However, I am very concerned that some time in the future &mdash; and this Bill will probably be law well beyond the end of the century &mdash; a Minister could, under section 54, direct the nursing board on an ethical matter which may be totally unacceptable to the public and that, if the board did not agree with him, he could use section 15 to abolish it.  He would then be in a position whereby the person nominated by him would give guidance on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour. That is why I want this subsection deleted.  If the Minister is prepared to delete sections 15 and 54 of the Bill which give these extraordinary powers to the Minister, the subsection would not have the serious implications it has, particularly when taken in conjunction with sections 15 and 54.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the point made by Deputy Barnes because I thought that in 1985 the medical profession was seen as representing male and female points of view and that the nursing profession would also be seen as representing male and female points of view.  I did not think anybody would perceive the medical profession as representing a male point of view and the nursing profession as representing a female point of view.</P>

      <P>I support the Members who requested the deletion of section 52(2).  This section attempts to take from the hospital the right to determine their own ethical policy.  Earlier on we discussed the fitness to practise committee and we all accept that the board should be in a position to give guidance on professional conduct and behaviour to each hospital. However, each hospital, particularly voluntary hospitals, should have the right to decide their own ethical code.  Perhaps, as Deputy Faulkner said, we could get around this problem by including a conscience clause because each hospital, in deciding their own ethical code, would respect the conscience of each individual employee.  Men and women practise the profession of nursing.</P>

      <P>This also applies to the Dentists Bill which is before the House and there were no protests about the section in that Bill which contains precisely the same provision contained in the Nurses Bill.  There is more than a grain of truth in what Deputy Mac Giolla said, namely, that we do not trust nurses on medical issues and that we do not want to trust women who are nurses.  Forget about the Minister of the day &mdash; I do not think, in the view of Deputy Tunney, that any Minister could be worse than me; future Ministers will be political arch&mdash; angels, he need not worry about that.  The Minister of the day does not have a function in relation to the determination of ethical conduct.  That is a function of An Bord Altranais.  Members of the board, all of whom will be elected will be from the different echelons of nursing, matrons, tutors, administrators and so on.  Some will be religious, some not, some married and some not married. Some will be male and some will be female but the overwhelming membership of the board will comprise elected nurses.  They will decide for the profession as a whole, in broad general terms, the code of ethical conduct and behaviour they consider to be fitting for the profession.</P>
      <P>This is not another Barry Desmond Bill.  The section provides that it shall be a function of the board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour but there seems to be a deep resentment in giving this function to the board.  I am equally surprised that the Deputies are suggesting that the word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; should be left in but the word &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; deleted.  To draw an analogy, one could procure an abortion in this country with the greatest professional competence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but in the process the person performing the operation <Col N="1746" /> would be acting not only unethically but wholly illegally.  This is the issue to which Deputies should address themselves.  To say the least it is incongruous that members of the medical profession should be cavilling on this issue.  Equally, it is incongruous that one should attempt to draw the old red herring of the code of conduct of, for example, voluntary hospitals and of nurses generally.  I would have thought that that decrepit red herring had been buried with the common contract in terms of the consultants whereby we resolved, without any great difficulty the position of consultants in voluntary hospitals, people who adhere to the code of conduct laid down by the Medical Council and who simultaneously are within a framework of adherence to the code of conduct of their employer.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that Deputy O'Hanlon raised the matter of, to use the offensive term, the minority denominations.  That matter was resolved by way of the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961.  The relevant section provides that in the exercise of their functions in relation to the co-ordination of the activities of the participating hospitals in the matter of nursing education and the conduct of negotiations in relation to such matters with An Bord Altranais, the council should take no action which would operate to involve a student nurse in any arrangement for attending lectures on the ethics and psychology of nursing which do not accord with her religious beliefs or interfere with the autonomy of a nurses school attaching to any hospital of a particular denomination or character. That Act is still in force.  It was put through by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Health so I do not know what the Deputies opposite are up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was considerable reaction initially against the section.  There was a reaction expressed by a spokesperson for the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in Ireland.  The view was expressed that the section would remove from hospitals the right to determine their own ethical policy.  I have discussed the Bill with employers, with the trade unions concerned and with the Conference of Major <Col N="1747" /> Religious Superiors and I have reasonably assured them that the section does not give grounds for all those horrendous predictions as to how voluntary hospitals or others will be affected.  That assurance seems generally to have percolated through.  It simply involves an explanation of what the section is all about.  I think that those who had major misconceptions about the provisions earlier on have now realised what is involved.</P>
    <P>Equally I would make the point that there are many thousands of nurses who are not working in a hospital situation.  It is suggested, for example, that there be no code of ethics in respect of public health nurses?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it suggested that the health boards should not have the advice and guidance of An Bord Altranais in respect of the professional and ethical conduct of public health nurses?  If I were on the Opposition benches I would be saying that of course the health boards should have the guidance of An Bord Altranais in these matters.  Is it suggested, for example, that the 6,200 psychiatric nurses who in the main are employed by the health boards are to be excluded?  All this does not add up in terms of the objections being voiced by Deputies opposite.  There are private hospitals that are answerable only to themselves.  Some of these are run by people in religion and some not.  Are they to be exempted from this legislation?  We are dealing with a national body concerned with the registration, the education and the fitness to practise of members of the nursing profession.  It is through the registration process that the profession as a whole will be in a position to establish a professional identity.  If we are to have that identity, we cannot judge fitness to practise and above all the board cannot fulfil their function if a total silence on this very issue is maintained. Otherwise, what would be the purpose of <Col N="1748" /> this professional responsibility devolving on the board?</P>
      <P>In respect of professional matters, are the following the only issues involved: the wearing of white gloves, not advertising one's wares, the ability to distinguish between the male and female body or learning how to give a transfusion correctly? With respect to the nursing profession a far wider professional aspect should be encompassed because if An Bord Altranais are not in a position to advise nurses on matters of professional and ethical conduct, how could the board penalise them in terms of professional misconduct.  Professional misconduct must be assessed and it must be assessed frequently in an ethical context just as happens in respect of members of the medical profession in terms of the Medical Council.  We really should not be arguing this matter at all.</P>
      <P>There is a code of behaviour that applies to doctors in respect of such matters as responsibility to patients, confidentiality, consent, information, responsibility to colleagues, advertising, deputising arrangements, responsibility to the community, certification, human research, donor organ procurement, euthanasia, relationship to prisoners and reproductive medicine.  These are the rules for consultants working in hospitals, many of them voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of professional standards, there are laid down codes of behaviour in relation to such matters as behaviour towards patients, alcohol and the health problems of doctors, irresponsible prescribing, personal relationships between doctors and patients and so on. The Medical Council have now published a second edition.  Professor Patrick Meenan is the President, Dermot Gleeson is the Vice-President and the colleges at Cork, Dublin and Galway are also represented: Professor Eamonn O'Dwyer is the representative from Galway.  The Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians are also represented.  After consultation two people are appointed by the Minister, representing psychiatry and general medical practice.  There are elected members <Col N="1749" /> similar to the nursing side.  They are elected by registered medical practitioners, a substantial body of highly respectable people.  The Minister also appoints four persons.  That is all that is involved and I suggest that the preoccupation of Deputies about this matter is overstressed.</P>
    <P>The section in no way interferes with the rights of a health board or a voluntary hospital as an employer to insist on a certain structure of ethical conduct within its employment framework.  An Bord Altranais deals with the general situation and the employer is directly involved. There need be no conflict with the employers so far as this Bill is concerned. I have checked very carefully and it is my view that the Minister cannot use section 54 to alter the functions of the board under section 52(2).</P>

      <P>Because it would be a fundamental restructuring of the Bill. In my view it would require bringing in new legislation and I do not think one would succeed on that score.  God knows, I have had several experiences of the High Court and the Supreme Court in the past two and a half years and not all of them have been happy experiences.  I am confident that a Minister could not bring in a fundamental change in legislation of this kind without going back to the Government and bringing the matter before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On Report Stage I will give a clear indication that any question of the extension of powers will be done by way of order and the Houses of the Oireachtas will have every opportunity within 21 days if they wish to refuse to sanction a proposed ministerial action.  I do not think any future Minister would be likely to give unpalatable powers to the board.  The phrase used was considered very thoroughly.  I consulted far and wide about the difference between ethical and professional standards and on balance it is wiser to retain the phrase.  It is not a concoction of the Department of Health in the preparation of this Bill.  It is one <Col N="1750" /> that has been there for a long time and is entirely appropriate in this case.</P>
      <P>I accept it is entirely reasonable for a professional body to be connected with the ethics of its profession.  Deputy Glenn referred to this when she spoke about the future of medicine and developments such as genetic engineering.  This would lead nurses to look to their professional body for guidance on such major developments. I do not wish to sound bloody-minded about this matter.  I wish to assure the House that in respect of section 54 any action will be done by order of the Minister.  The House can be assured that the code will be effective.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the code will be to provide a reasonable framework to assist nurses in arriving at ethical decisions and to carry out their responsibilities to patients, the public and to professional colleagues.  It will also help to promote the highest possible standards of professional conduct.  In that regard we have to devolve that responsibility on An Bord Altranais.  They are an elected body who have competent professional people and we should trust them.  Basically this is all a matter of trust.  I have not the slightest doubt that the board will discharge their onerous responsibilities in the most effective way.</P>

Will the Minister tell me if it will be possible in the light of this legislation for a voluntary hospital to continue the system operating now whereby, in respect of the recruitment of nurses who have satisfied the educational requirements, the hospital will be entitled to submit those nurses to an interview as to their suitability and to require of them to follow the existing ethical standards of those hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be particularly careful in my reply to the Deputy. We already had a vote on the general principle of the setting up of a central applications process.  Let us take the case of a nurse who emerges from that process and is being considered for appointment <Col N="1751" /> by a hospital that has a certain ethos. That nurse may be told by the hospital that, while appreciating that she has the general ethical guidelines of An Bord Altranais, if she wishes to have employment in the hospital there is a way that certain matters are dealt with in the hospital and if the nurse wants employment she so signs.  That is the normal established practice.  However, there are many employers.  Attitudes may be different in regard to nurses employed in the area of mental handicap.  One employer may have a different approach to another, one may be a public employer and another may be a religious employer. Conditions of employment vary within the health services because there are 25,000 people employed by many agencies. I can assure Deputies that this section does not interfere with the freedom of health agencies &mdash; and voluntary hospitals are part of those agencies &mdash; to insist that their code of ethics shall predominate in respect of employment in their hospital.  That is already there in terms of the common contract for consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister did not clarify that point earlier.  Now the Minister is accepting that there can be a continuation of diversity as required by the management of the hospitals, but on 5 December 1984 he said at column 1568 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Those observations were made in deference of the need for clear national guidelines regarding ethical conduct to be applied on a national basis by the nurses themselves.  In this legislation we cannot have disciplinary provisions unless we have a code of ethical conduct applying across the board in the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now telling us that it need not be a national standard.  If the Mater Hospital or the Bon Secours Hospital wish, the existing situation may continue whereby the nurses, having satisfied the educational requirements, are entitled to be interviewed as to their suitability in regard to other matters.  If the Minister <Col N="1752" /> is telling me that that is the case I am relieved to hear it, but that is not what he has said up to now.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the counterpart of the bishop's crozier would be, but I think it might be a ministerial axe.  I refer the Minister and Deputy Mac Giolla to section 15.  Deputy Mac Giolla ordinarily comes here and convinces me that he has read the Bill in its entirety, yet he accuses me of not having trust in nurses.  I do not know where I said that.  I was asking him to share my trust in nurses who are called religious, for what reason I do not know. I would remind Deputy Mac Giolla that under section 15 the Minister of the day may appoint a person or persons to discharge all or any of the functions of the board.  The Deputy did not seem to have noted that when he was examining this legislation and I will repeat it for him.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the administrative side.  The issue has been clouded to an extent because the Minister, and indeed Deputy Mac Giolla, have not taken account of the implications of sections 15 and 54 of the Bill.  I will take the example of abortion which the Minister used as an example.  If a Minister some time in the future were to say to An Bord Altranais &ldquo;The norm now for all nurses is that they should assist at abortions&rdquo; and if An Bord Altranais refused this as the norm, the Minister could then invoke section 15, discharge the board and appoint a person he selected who would then be in a position to carry out the functions of the board and he could give guidance to the nursing profession on all matters relating to ethical conduct and as such could direct that this would be part of a nurse's training or part of the behaviour of a nurse.  That is the reality.  While I accept the present <Col N="1755" /> Minister's assurances, we are talking about legislation that will be here for a long time.  The last Nurse's Act was passed in 1950 and this could well be the legislation for the next 35 years.  It is concern about what might happen with some future Minister that is the reason we would like this section deleted or to see the phenomenal powers that the Minister has under section 15 and 54 deleted.</P>

      <P>The argument being advanced on this issue is beginning to strain the general credulity of the House, because if a Minister of the day were to decide that An Bord Altranais should now as a matter of ethical practice encompass the practice of abortion, the <Col N="1756" /> Minister would be obliged to put an order to that effect before the House.</P>

      <P>I have clearly indicated that in respect of section 54 it will be clearly amended and any change would be by way of order, and I have no doubt that it would not take 21 days for the Opposition to wake up to the fact that that order had been made.  They would probably know it within four and a half seconds flat after it going down in the House and the Minister for Health of the day would then be in a real tizzy before the House.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 40 and 42 are designed to ensure that additional functions may not be assigned to the board by the Minister of the day without the concurrence of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill as at present drafted sets out the functions of the board and indicates the nature and scope of those functions.  It could be claimed that to assign additional functions would be legislating without bringing the matter before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendments, therefore, provide that the assignment of any additional functions will be done by ministerial order which will be subject to annulment by the Houses of the Oireachtas. The parliamentary draftsman has advised that it is also necessary to give the Minister the power to amend or revoke an order made under the section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments, which are grouped as related amendments, are designed to <Col N="1760" /> provide clearly that the trainees described at (c) and (d) may attend a woman in child birth only as part of their training. As at present drafted there is a possibility that it could be construed that the person mentioned in these two sub paragraphs may give such attention at any time because they are medical, midwifery or nursing students.</P>

      <P>My amendment seeks to include persons who may attend at a delivery.  There is no provision in the section for the husband of a woman to attend at the delivery.  Many husbands like to attend at the delivery and many wives like to have their husbands present. While the section as presented may be intended to refer to maternity hospitals it does not take account of what would happen at a domestic delivery, in a patient's home.  It is important that any person assigned by the family doctor or midwife be entitled to assist at the delivery. It is common place at a home delivery that the mother, mother-in-law or a neighbour who has had a number of children attends.  Such a person might prove helpful to either the medical practitioner or the midwife.  Is the Minister prepared to consider accepting my amendment?</P>

      <P>I support Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment which seeks to include the husband and allow the midwife or doctor involved in the case to bring in additional help.  I feel strongly about this.  In modern day living it has become the norm almost for a wife to have her husband at her bedside during a delivery.  A lot of families feel strongly about this and it should be written into the Bill.  I am a parent of four children, two of whom were born in America. There was no difficulty about attending the birth of those two.  The fourth child was born in Waterford and I had no difficulty in attending that birth; but, unfortunately, for the birth of the third child, who was born in Dublin, even as a doctor I was debarred.  It is important that a husband, medic or non-medic, be allowed at his wife's bedside.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we might have discussions about this issue prior to Report Stage.  I am not averse to the attendance of the father at childbirth. However, there is the technical issue involved in that attending a women in childbirth is legally to conduct the process of delivery and assist in the delivery of a child as a doctor or midwife would do.</P>
      <P>Should we have this in legislation at all? I have serious doubts about legislating for it.  If it is to be included on Report Stage we will have to have a particular formula of words about a right to be present.  We must also consider the medical issue.  It may be that the father should not be present for medical or obstetric reasons. However, I am agreeable to discuss the matter and see if an amendment can be framed for Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Minister's speech here last night, I was reasonably certain that at the end of the day the Government and the Minister would not sell out on our national interests as affected by the Spanish and Portuguese <Col N="1763" /> applications for membership of the Community with regard to our fishing industry.  However, having listened carefully to the Minister's contribution last night, I must say that I am totally disillusioned and I fear that the fishing industry is about to be abandoned by the Government.</P>
      <P>Let me set for the House the background of the present situation with regard to our fishing industry as it goes into these negotiations within the Community regarding the Spanish and Portuguese applications.  Eighty per cent of our present fleet is in financial difficulties at this time.  This has been caused by the failure of the Minister and his Government to get adequate quotas out of the negotiations for the Common Fisheries Policy.  In particular, I refer to mackerel as being the major catch.  This failure has affected not just our fishing fleet directly, but also our processing plant, with up to 1,000 jobs put at risk as a result The fleet owners at present owe approximately £8 million to BIM, with up to 100 boats possibly being repossessed and 40 to be repossessed immediately. Against this, our catching capacity within the fleet has been going up, but our quotas have been going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is against this background that we as a nation and the Government entered into these negotiations to protect our national interest &mdash; our fishing fleet, our processing industry and all the jobs essential there.  Unfortunately, the Government have reneged on the sworn duty to protect the best interests of this nation. In particular, during our Presidency of the Community there was a glorious opportunity to hammer out a fishing agreement, with regard to the Spanish and Portuguese applications, which would be suitable to Ireland.  However, that Presidency, under the Taoiseach and with the negotiations being handled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, went about being good Europeans while the rest of Europe were looking after their own national interests.  When we should have been looking after the fishing <Col N="1764" /> aspects of the negotiations of entry of Spain and Portugal, what were we doing with the glorious opportunity at Dublin Castle?  We were being good Europeans, settling the wine lake problem for the Italians.</P>
    <P>If the situation were reversed during the Italian Presidency, would they give up their opportunity of using their Presidency to protect their national interests, or would they have been worried about our fishing industry?  Like any sensible, sane Government, they would have protected their national interests.  The Government, under the Taoiseach, had the claim at a press conference in Dublin Castle of a major victory which turned out to be a pyrrhic victory for our fishing industry.  Even looking at the positive features of that Summit meeting, it was agreed that we would have a 15 year transition period with regard to Spanish entry.  It is Spain in particular about which I speak, because the Portuguese fishing fleet is not of significance in this question. That 15 year transition period was itself a sell-out on the original 20 year period being looked for by our fishing industry. We learned from the Minister last night that the Commission have come up with a seven year period, half of what was agreed in Dublin and two thirds of what the national interest is entitled to.  We also learned from him last night that Spain is not even interested in accepting the seven years which apparently our Minister is prepared to accept.  They wanted from day one to have access to the Irish &ldquo;box.&rdquo;  This is ludicrous.  The Minister said that Spain had expressed strong opposition to the policy of a 15 year transition period, fearing that such a long transition would exclude her from effective participation in the review of the Common Fisheries Policy due to take place in 1993 and moreover, that Spain was seeking access to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; from the date of accession.  If we are to judge from the performance of this Government and the Minister to date, Spain will probably get away with it.</P>
    <P>If the Spanish fleet comes in from day one, or even in seven years, or 15 years, it will wipe out our industry totally.  They <Col N="1765" /> have 17,500 boats and 111,000 fishermen, as against our 1,600 boats, mainly small and not able to compete.  Spain is already breaking the rules even before admission. I refer the House to a recent edition of the <i>IFA News</i> which stated that there has already been £1.4 million in 1983 in revenue from fines for Spanish abuses. How much worse will it be when they are in the system?  I thank the IFA, IFPO and the KFO for keeping us, as Members of this House, informed as to what exactly has been going on in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The debate seems to concentrate on the west and south coasts, but it is also about the east coast.  The whole fishing industry is an interdependent, large fishing family of boats, processors and general people involved in the industry. Skerries, Balbriggan, Clogher Head, Howth and the whole east coast are affected as much as the rest of the country. I appeal to the Minister to show some backbone, to remember that he got his seal of office to protect the national interest of this country.  The national interest as it affects his ministry is our fishing industry.  If he continues to behave as he indicated in his speech last night, there will be no fishing industry by the time he leaves office.</P>

      <P>It is very important. People on the other side of the House appear to have a simplistic view of the fishing industry and how it should develop.  There is no short route or easy way towards developing our fishing industry.  I learned that in my two years and three months as Minister of State.  Up until now the industry has been producer-orientated and, as a consequence, insufficient attention was paid to the vital role which marketing has in raising the unit value of fish.  For this reason I established a fish marketing committee representative of all sectors of the industry.  This committee has been working extremely hard in identifying market opportunities and, better still, in taking action to develop them.</P>
      <P>The deliberations of the committee which I chair have shown great unity of purpose and the need for close co-operation between all sectors to the overall benefit of the industry and the economy generally.  I am glad to say that last year's problem of a build up in mackerel stocks has been resolved satisfactorily and herring outlets have improved following trade discussions with Poland.  In setting up this committee I can never be accused of using any political party.  I picked people from the industry up and down the country with the exception of two nominations on the committee.  The industry selected all their members.  I see that Deputy Daly is smiling, but that is the truth.  The fishing industry are very glad that this committee are in operation. I should like to put on the record of the House my appreciation of their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the committee to identify areas for me where they believed I should go as Minister of State representing the industry and where I can be helpful.  As the result of a request from the committee <Col N="1767" /> I went to Poland which was a very useful exercise.  I visited Poland late last year and the visit proved very beneficial, a factor for which herring fishermen around the country will vouch.  While I was in Poland I invited the Polish Minister for Maritime Affairs to come here. Worthwhile discussions were held with him since he arrived here last Sunday.  I visited fishing ports and installations with him on Monday last and I am confident that this latest contact will result in further tangible trade advantage in the near future.</P>
    <P>I brought the Minister to our premier fishing port in Killybegs.  We visited all the processing factories in that port.  We also spoke to the fishermen.  We have drawn up agreements with Poland for the supply of about 10,000 tonnes of fish, 7,500 tonnes of herring and 2,500 tonnes of mackerel.  My big interest is in ensuring that we export processed fish to Poland. They have a huge fishing fleet and a huge market.  Once we identify the markets it is our job to see how we can put fish economically into those markets.  They would not send the Minister over here unless he was coming here to do business and he has done business.  I cannot say exactly how much business has been done but, before this year is out, I am hopeful that some processed fish from Killybegs will go to the Polish market.  That is a very beneficial market for our industry.</P>
    <P>When I took over the Department of Fisheries I was disappointed to find that these markets had not been researched by the Department or anybody else. During the discussions here there were quite a number of criticisms of BIM. They were given about £135,000 for the exporting of fish.  That was completely inadequate.  There was one man in Paris with a specific role to play in marketing. That cost about £70,000 which indicates the amount of money left.  That has been reversed by a decision taken by the Government.  We got £480,000 extra for marketing and for exploratory fishing. That is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of the House my appreciation of the warm welcome <Col N="1768" /> we got from the Polish authorities while we were there.  The negotiations took place in Szczecin with Ry-bex who are the main company responsible for fish imports.  The managing director of Ry-bex accompanied the Minister on his visit here and carried out discussions with interested parties here.  The Government have shown their appreciation of the role of marketing in improving returns in the fishing industry.  This has been shown in a very tangible way by a commitment to an extra £480,000 for marketing and exploratory fishing purposes.</P>
    <P>Those who call for an immediate turnover in the full processing of our fish catch do not understand the structures of the industry at home or on the export market.  The most lucrative market today is for fresh fish rather than processed fish.  This is why we have to be careful to relate our developments at home to the requirements of the market place.</P>
    <P>It would please the Government immensely to have the greatest possible amount of our national fish catch processed in Ireland in shore-based industries but, if we go along that road, we will quickly find that the market will not accept that type of development.  This is very clear not alone here but in every country in Europe.  The Minister went to Japan and it is also quite clear in Japan. They do not require large amounts of processed fish.  Fresh fish and frozen fish are those the market place is seeking. That has not changed over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>We have ample evidence in places like Killybegs and Kilmore Quay of what processing means in terms of secure jobs. This is the way in which we wish to see the industry developing.  Deputy Byrne asked the Government to pay special attention to the development of Kilmore Quay which is in my constituency.  I have paid special attention to it during my term of office.  The harbour was almost split in half and could have been washed into the sea were it not for the fact that I asked the Government for £120,000 to put in stone protection right around the harbour.  That is special attention. It will not stop there.  We are awaiting <Col N="1769" /> reports on an extension of the harbour.  We put an increase of £500,000 into the allocation for 1985.  It is impossible for me to say where that £500,000 will go but, in view of the very tight financial position in which we find ourselves, it is encouraging for harbour development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt adequately with the motion.  Harbour development has been neglected over the years.  I question the wisdom of investing such huge sums of money in five main harbours at the expense of approximately 40 small ones.  I believe sufficient money has been invested in our main harbours. As Deputy Daly will know, our small harbours are in need of development and investment very badly at present.  It is my intention to have an assessment carried out of harbours right around our coasts, ensuring that out of whatever moneys are allocated our small harbours will get their fair share.  We must look after the small boatmen the same as the large boatmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The harbour at Howth has cost between £8 million and £10 million over the last four or five years and <Col N="1770" /> any available moneys in those years have gone into the development of that port.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal now with the fish marketing board.  It is only right to point out that the Government have invested considerable moneys this year in the marketing of fish.  I am glad the industry is prepared to respond, that they are prepared to invest considerable sums of money &mdash; I am not prepared to state how much at this stage &mdash; for the advancement of the marketing of fish countrywide.  This is a most welcome development because I discovered that no contribution whatsoever towards the marketing of fish had come from the industry itself.  This is a great mistake, one that should be reversed, and it has been as a result of the establishment of the marketing board that such has taken place.  I welcome that innovation and I should like to put it on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>I might deal now with something Deputy Hugh Byrne mentioned last evening, that is in relation to the special aid package announced recently to tackle the problem confronting our fishing fleet arising from high operational costs with low returns from catches of some species. Fishermen will now enjoy full duty rebate on fuel oil of 8p per gallon compared with 3p per gallon previously.  This concession will cost our Exchequer approximately £500,000 this year.  It should be remembered that fuel oil constitutes a major operating cost for fishermen.  Depending on the size of boat, usage and the value of the concession, this will range from £2,000 to as high as £14,000 per boat per year.  All fishermen have discovered that the increased cost of oil has constituted a major factor in the industry going in the wrong direction, rendering many boats non-viable.  While this concession may appear to be small it will be valuable to our fishermen and they are prepared to accept it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package also provides for an increased interest subsidy to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and bank loans which qualify for inclusion in the scheme. Deputy H. Byrne said last evening that bank loans do not qualify.  I want to make it quite clear to the House that bank <Col N="1771" /> loans do qualify.  We should not like the message to go out &mdash; and this did receive some publicity &mdash; that bank loans do not qualify.  As far as boat purchase is concerned bank loans do qualify.  I want to make that absolutely clear.  As a result the net interest rate on these loans will be at the very attractive rate of 9 per cent, subject to review in the light of developments taking place in interest rates.  The total amount now allocated for interest subsidy is £1.2 million annually over the next three years.  All arrears on eligible boats may be capitalised and repayments on the new capital sum outstanding calculated on an annuity rather than on a straight line basis.  In addition, loans may be restructured to provide for the extension of the period of repayment &mdash; this is a very important point &mdash; of up to 15 years depending on the age of the existing loan.  These concessions will provide considerable relief to fishermen on repayment of loans.</P>
    <P>Some people have welcomed this development, others have not but, as far as I am concerned, this rescue package was based on the needs of the industry. As far as the industry is concerned, and here I speak of the fishermen &mdash; I do not speak of those who criticise them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not let the occasion pass without saying a few words on the motion itself.  Negotiations on enlargement of the Community have been prolonged and difficult. It is evident from what the Minister said last evening that what was said previously <Col N="1772" /> by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House, that a firm position has been taken by the Government, remains the case.  Negotiations have now reached a delicate stage.  Deputies can be assured that a forceful representation of the particular requirements of our fishing industry will continue in these negotiations as they proceed.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is entitled to the full support of the House in his efforts to achieve a satisfactory deal for our fishermen.  I am glad to see that that support will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Raphael Burke said he was worried at the thought of Spain's entry into the fishing world.  We are all worried at the thought of Spain becoming a member of the EC, something about which we as a nation must be very careful. But, as somebody said last evening, we cannot take all and give nothing.  Deputy Burke referred to the negotiations which took place at the Dublin Summit.  The position taken at the Dublin Summit was for a 15 year period, whereas Deputy Burke talked in terms of seven years. That was merely a proposal by the Commission and should be seen as a starting point only in the negotiations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be less than seven, going down to perhaps four, five or even two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned it constitutes the starting point. The Minister said last evening:</P>
      <P>The transitional arrangements would last for ten years &mdash; with the possibility that this could be reduced to eight years if satisfactory post-transitional arrangements could be adopted before the end of 1993.  If such arrangements could not be agreed by 1995, the ten years' transitional period would be extended for a further five years &mdash; i.e. until the virtual expiry of the present arrangements under the Common Fisheries Policy in its present form in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1773" /> That is quite clear and plain.  I do not know from where Deputy Raphael Burke got his information but apparently he did not read the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>He quoted the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister said, and that constitutes our bargaining position.  As far as we are concerned there will be no change.  I am prepared to accept that, as far as this country is concerned, the introduction of Spain never mind Portugal constitutes a threat. I might add that in 1983 the number of vessels arrested for illegal fishing in our waters was 53, of which 50 were Spanish vessels, indicating how aggressive these people are.  Indeed, one of its worst features was that even the vessels arrested, having paid a fine, returned to fish again and were rearrested on a number of occasions. One might well contend that they are not prepared to accept the legal situation obtaining in a country but are prepared to insist on fishing in our waters. As we are all aware, the Spanish fleet has 17,500 vessels, or two-thirds of the total of the EC, constituting a huge fleet.</P>
      <P>My position is absolutely clear.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs whose job it is to conduct these negotiations.  We have clearly told him that the minimum must be ten years and that if proper arrangements cannot be made for the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; in those ten years then the period should be extended to 15 years, and that position will not change.  I am glad we are receiving the support of the Opposition &mdash; I do not mind some political points being made, sometimes that is useful and does not worry us &mdash; and we are prepared to accept the motion as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted that the Polish Minister for Fisheries visited the south west Donegal constituency last Monday on his official visit to this country and I was particularly glad that he visited Killybegs, our premier fishing port.  I know that an agreement was signed <Col N="1774" /> between Poland and Irish fishing interests late last year whereby they agreed to buy 10,000 tonnes of fish but, as far as I know, most of the fish they purchased was unprocessed.  The Polish Minister also visited food processing plants in the same area.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the note of optimism in the speech of the Minister of State and that there will be further agreements between Poland and Ireland as a result of the Polish Minister's visit.  I had discussions with the Minister and the Minister of State in relation to bringing the Polish Minister to Killybegs.  I hope that any further agreements between this country and Poland will place more emphasis on processed fish because that will create employment at home rather than in Poland.  We have a very good case in that regard because, last year, we imported goods to the value of about £45 million from Poland and, in return, our exports totalled about £2,500.</P>
      <P>We know that the Irish fishing and processing industries experienced difficult times over the last few years because of a number of factors but the most serious threat facing them is the entry of Spain into the EC.  It took seven years to negotiate a Common Fisheries Policy between the member states and it came into being in January 1983.  Within it, arrangements have been made to allow the Irish fishing and processing industries to develop in the years ahead.  I am afraid that, with the entry of Spain, the delicate balance attained in the negotiations leading to the Common Fisheries Policy will be upset.  A number of speakers referred to the transition period: ten, 15 and 20 years were mentioned.  While I realise that there must be a transition period which will allow us to develop our fishing industry, nevertheless, I hope that at the end of the transition period the Spanish fishing fleet will not be allowed to upset the balance arrived at when the Common Fisheries Policy was negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their Ministers of State for their handling of the negotiations since they started and the efforts <Col N="1775" /> they have made to protect our fishing industry.  Five EC countries have fishing interests in the North Atlantic, namely, ourselves, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Denmark.  I hope that the countries who have rights in these waters will put up a united front and adopt a common policy when the negotiations regarding the entry of Spain are in progress. I understand that other members within the Community, the Southern Europeans and the landlocked countries, have different priorities.  I refer to Greece, Italy, Luxembourg and Belgium who are not interested in our waters and may have other priorities at the negotiations such as vegetables, fruit, wine and so on.  I hope there will not be any trading off at our expense in relation to these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Spanish fishing fleet have over 2,000 deep water vessels fishing out of Spain which is almost as many as the entire Community.  Last year, they landed 1.6 million tonnes of fish and I wonder what percentage of that was caught in Community waters.  For instance, during 1984, our fishery protection vessels apprehended over 50 Spanish boats, brought them to our ports and fines exceeding £100,000 were imposed on some owners.  I understand that if a skipper is convicted for a third fishing offence, his boat may be confiscated and I hope that those in charge of fishery protection will bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>Spain has been allocated £160 million for fishery reconstruction from EC funds and we have received very little compared to that.  When the negotiations are completed, I hope that there will be a substantial transition period and afterwards we should still be able to protect the balance achieved when the Common Fisheries Policy was negotiated.  If Spaniards are allowed to fish in our waters after the transition period, we should have some sort of arrangement whereby fish caught in EC waters should be processed in this country which would create jobs here rather than in Spain.  In some European countries there are six, seven or more people employed in the processing <Col N="1776" /> industry for every one person fishing at sea and the ratio here is one to one.</P>
    <P>It is significant that all sides of the House support this motion.  There are no amendments and our negotiators have our full support because our fishing industry is vital to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House but I listened carefully to the Minister of State and I thought we were debating the Estimates rather than the accession of Spain and Portugal.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to people on this side taking a simplistic view but if anyone here took a simplistic view of the fishing industry it was the Minister of State when he suggested to me, in response to a question about an increase in the quotas for mackerel, that there was no point in looking for increases in this respect when we cannot sell what we have.  The Minister should consider withdrawing that remark.</P>
      <P>Matters should be clarified.  Spain and Portugal are the countries seeking admission to the EC, but listening to speakers opposite one would think that Poland was the country we were talking about.  I might remind the House that we sold salted herrings to Portugal many years ago.  The Minister has not told us that there is to be an increase in the quantities being sold.  Instead, he refers to efforts to consolidate the amount that has been sold.  The accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community would have a disastrous effect on our fishing industry unless the Government change the course they are on and take a much stronger stand.  Our fishing industry, which to other Europeans may seem small, is of vital importance to our social and economic life especially in coastal areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 the sea fishing industry contributed about £61 million of the gross domestic product.  This is a significant contribution to the balance of payments in which respect the contribution from the sea fishing industry in 1983 was £52 million.  In rural areas, especially in the west, fishing provides much needed employment.  It generates income along <Col N="1777" /> the western seaboard.  Two-thirds of all fish landed around our coasts is landed in the south, south-west, west and northwest regions.  These are areas that are completely non-developed and in which there are no alternative sources of employment.  There are about 13,000 people employed in the fishing industry. I am not making a political point when I say that if we continue on the road on which the Government have set themselves and if we concede to the Spanish, many of those jobs in the industry will be in jeopardy.  That would have a catastrophic effect on constituencies such as my own and on the country generally.</P>
    <P>When we joined the Community the Protocol on Ireland which was annexed to the Treaty set out the fundamental objectives of the European Community. These included a steady improvement of living standards and working conditions of peoples of the member states and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences between the various regions and by reducing the backwardness of the less favoured regions.  The discussions between the EC and Spain and Portugal are ensuring that the gap is widened and that areas such as the west of Ireland are becoming more backward.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister gave the impression that our fishing industry would not be affected seriously by the accession of Spain and Portugal.  We all know that the morale of the fishermen and of the industry generally was never lower.  Apart from the negotiations taking place, this low morale is synonymous with Coalition Governments. Neither the fishermen nor the processors have the confidence to invest in the industry.  We must give to the industry every freedom and every facility to enable it to operate at its maximum capacity.  It is not operating at its maximum now.</P>
    <P>No decision must be reached in the short term in so far as the discussions are concerned.  We must hold out for the best deal possible.  The concessions that would apply to Spain and Portugal would have detrimental effects on our industry.  As <Col N="1778" /> has been proved time and again, we cannot trust the Spaniards.  One might ask, having regard to our policing system, how we are to control our fishing waters. The Spaniards maintain a pool from which are paid fines in respect of Spaniards found fishing illegally in the waters of other countries.  Indeed, it is advantageous to the Spanish when one of their boats is apprehended, because while the boat is being taken to port an area is left free of policing and other Spanish vessels move in to that area to fish.  A sufficient amount is maintained in the pool to pay any fines that may arise.  Another factor is that when Spaniards detect a naval vessel they immediately head off westwards followed by the naval vessel but having first cut the warps and indicated to sister ships in the area where the nets are.  The other vessels then move in and take the catch.  I understand that the Spaniards require only a legal basis to allow them fish within the 200 mile limit and having obtained that I am convinced they would continue to flout the law as they have been doing while there is no legal basis whatever for their actions.</P>
    <P>In addition the Spaniards are using their NATO membership as a lever in the negotiations.  It is suggested that if their demands are not met, at the time of the referendum in Spain this year in relation to NATO, they will be recommending withdrawal from that organisation. We know that the large European partners could not accept that.  The Commission, as indicated by Commissioner Andriessen, are totally opposed to the proposed 15 year provision.  We must hold out for a 20 year transition period and not agree to any concession at any time within that period.  Also, we would require additional finance during that period to enable us to invest in larger vessels, to fish new species and to adapt and modernise our boats as necessary as well as to aid our fish processing industry so that it may expand its facilities for primary processing and add value to those primary products that are being landed now.</P>
    <P>The Spaniards have been offered a sum of £21 million during the term of the <Col N="1779" /> transition period, the so-called seven year period, to enable them to phase down and adapt their boats, perhaps to adapt them to come here to fish our mackerel quotas.  No offer is to be made to Ireland in this respect so we cannot accept what is being proposed.  The Minister must hold firm on the question of a 20 year period and of finance to help the fishing and the processing industry in the meantime.  We understand that the Commission have proposed a period much shorter than 15 years.  They are not in favour either of a total exclusion from the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo;. They will pressure the Council of Ministers in this regard but I trust that our Minister will have sufficient support to enable him to ensure that the Spaniards will not be allowed fish inside the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; at any time.</P>
    <P>I understand that our arguments are difficult to defend but we can overcome that difficulty by the use of the veto. There should be no question of abandoning the principle of the veto.  Even a small nation such as ours can compete so long as we have the power of veto.  I trust that the Minister will use that power in the months ahead if our demands are not met.</P>
    <P>Thousands of jobs in the industry are in jeopardy because of the indecisiveness and the lack of strength on the part of the Government.  Fishermen and processors are afraid to invest in the industry because they fear that within seven years these other boats will be fishing within the 200 mile limit.  One wonders why all the emphasis should be on the west coast of Ireland.  Nothing is heard of the North Sea in this context.  There is no question of offering the Spaniards quotas of species in that area.  We should remind ourselves that Ireland has no reciprocal rights apart from a small percentage in the Irish Sea.  We had a small percentage in the North Sea but we did not have the right boats.  Now that we have the boats we have no rights in the North Sea.  That is some concession.</P>
    <P>When Spain enters the EC they may nominate boats to fish in Community waters and this means fishing off the west <Col N="1780" /> coast.  As I understand it, this will be called the base list, where they can nominate boats to fish at various times in Community waters.  They will have 26 boats in areas 5B and 6 and 169 boats to fish in area 7, which are the areas off our coast. At any one time 195 boats can fish off our coast.  We have the ludicrous situation where we will have what is known as the second list &mdash; typical European terminology. This means that when the first boats go outside our waters others can come in. We cannot accept this.  When the boats come in they must be given authority to fish for three months and they must return to Spain and deposit their fish before returning here.  We must ensure that they do not go to a mother ship and deposit their fish there.  These figures are based on a standard vessel of 700 hp and the figures will vary depending on the vessel.</P>
    <P>We must ensure also that new quotas are not established.  We have to deal with fish such as blue whiting and horse mackerel which are non-traditional species. We cannot allow those fishermen to come here and fish for blue whiting, horse mackerel or scad.  We have enough difficulty in getting our Government to grant-aid people to fish for these species but, on the other hand, the EC will give £21 million to the Spaniards to fish here.  It has been suggested that the opening up of the Spanish market will have advantages for us but I say there will be no advantages for us.  That market will be supplied by the Spanish boats who fish off the west coast.</P>
    <P>The Spaniards have no traditional rights whatever to fish off our coast.  They have only limited rights for a short period &mdash; in fact, it should be regarded as a concession.  Further development is being put in jeopardy because of the weakness of our negotiating position.  We must insist on a time limit of 20 years and no fishing quota system.  Already they have been offered quantities of hake, monkfish, mergrim, prawns and white pollack.  Although the amount is very small &mdash; 0.4 per cent &mdash; it is a foot in the door.  They should not be allowed access at any time to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; and we <Col N="1781" /> should ensure that our fleet are given finance to modernise.</P>
    <P>What we have been saying on this side of the House has been true.  What we have said has been accepted by the sectoral development committee and by the committee dealing with secondary legislation of the EC.  This is an all-party committee.  We must make sure that we do not do the same thing that was done at the end of last year, just to cobble together an agreement while we held the Presidency.  We did not use our powers then.  Let us use them now by ensuring that, if necessary, we invoke the veto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important motion not only for fishermen but for those engaged in ancillary industries.  The development of the Irish fishing industry is of crucial importance to our economy. We have a most valuable natural resource which must be developed and exploited to the full.  The fisheries industry must get a capital injection, and this was stressed by the previous speaker, in order to bring our fleet to modern standards.  This is necessary to meet the challenge of today.  If we are to continue with the kind of fishing we engage in at present and fight against competition from Spain and other countries, it is necessary that we modernise our fleet.  Not only must our fishing boats be brought up to the standards of larger nations but we must also train our fishermen to the highest standards possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have a vital role to play in protecting the interests of our fishermen both at domestic and at Community level.  It must be asked if the Government are doing their duty in that regard?  Are they fighting strongly enough to safeguard the livelihood of the 12,000 or 13,000 people engaged in the fishing industry?  In the past seven years negotiations for enlargement of the Community have been going on.  The major question facing Irish fishermen is, how long will be the transition period during which Spanish fishing will not extend beyond the present arrangements?  It was indicated by reliable sources that the period would be ten years to 15 years but <Col N="1782" /> after listening to the Minister's speech one would have to question that and to ask if that period has been reduced to eight or seven years.</P>
    <P>Spain wants access to the Irish &ldquo;box&rdquo; from 1 January 1986 but this must not be allowed to happen.  If it did it would wipe out our industry.  They also want access to species such as hake, monkfish and megrim which represent areas of growth for our fishermen.  With the facilities and resources available to the vast Spanish fleet, if they were allowed to gain access to these species our fishermen would have nothing to fish.  It would do away with our industry.  I implore the Minister to stand firm against these demands.</P>
    <P>The Minister also tells us that Spain would have access to the species she currently fishes.  The question I would like the Minister to ask is: in what area is he talking about their having access?  Is it in the Irish &ldquo;box?&rdquo;  Is it in the six to 12 mile area?</P>

      <P>How will the Spanish hordes be controlled when the present illegal use of monofilament nets in the northern and western parts of the country is not being controlled?  I see these Spanish boats coming into Ballycotton Harbour although they are not supposed to be there.  If they were given a foothold we would have them coming in in hordes.</P>
      <P>The present restricted Spanish fleet poses a serious threat to the Irish fishing industry.  In 1983 fines imposed on Spanish vessels came to £1.4 million.  In 1983 arrests doubled when compared with those in 1982 and the Spaniards continued to poach in our waters with impunity. They are willing to take the risks because the rewards are high.</P>
      <P>There is vast potential for job creation off our shores, and over the past ten to 15 years the fishing industry has expanded considerably.  Landings have increased from 86,000 tonnes in 1972 to 206,000 tonnes in 1982.  Fish exports have grown by 294 per cent between 1978 and 1982 and the number employed in fishing has grown by over 30 per cent since the mid-seventies to over 13,000 people.  This growth shows the potential of the fishing industry and it is up to the Government to ensure that that progress is not stymied by giving in to the demands of the Spanish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the opening up of the Spanish market, we must ask if this will mean sales and markets for our fishermen. In my view it is questionable that it will because of the distance from the market and the related heavy transport <Col N="1784" /> costs which would seriously affect our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The picture does not look rosy for our fishermen or our fishing industry and it is up to the Minister and the Government to stand firm and ensure that this growing and potentially major industry is not killed in its infancy.  The Minister said the Government are conscious of the apprehensions and anxieties of our fishermen and that the enlargement negotiations are of fundamental concern to Ireland.  Why then did the Government during their Presidency of the EC not make an issue of fisheries?  Italy's wine problems seemed to be more important to our Ministers at that time.  The buck stops with the Minister and he should make sure that when he hands it back to us it will not be devalued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a Deputy from a maritime constituency with the sad experience over the past 40 years of seeing the rape of our fishing stocks off the south-west coast.  When I was a boy I remember seeing a ring of Spanish trawlers marauding our fishing grounds at 11 or 12 o'clock at night.  They overfished our waters to such an extent that they created a serious difficulty for our fishermen and made it very hard for them to catch the fish they wanted.  The Spanish fishing fleet were notorious for marauding. I have no doubt that if they are given the chance under the present negotiations for their entry into the EC they will be as much pirates of the sea today as they were 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>It is well known that they did immense damage to our fish breeding grounds.  The bedrock of the breeding spawn was torn up by those trawlers.  They entered our fishing grounds in the dark of night and we did not have enough patrol boats to keep them at bay.  Even today it is very difficult for us to control our 200 mile zone because we have so few vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed to hear Opposition Deputies say there will be a sellout to the Spanish and Portuguese.  Who created the sellout?  Who started the rot?  We all know who negotiated our entry to the Common Market and that the fishing <Col N="1785" /> industry was treated as a Cinderella industry by the then Fianna Fáil Government. It is well known that they did not care about the future of the fishing industry when they were agreeing our accession terms to the EC.  The fishing industry was sold down the drain on that occasion.  Our Minister for Fisheries must do his best to ensure that our fishermen are given the opportunity to make a living fishing off our coasts.  He must also ensure that rules and regulations are put into operation when we are agreeing the terms for accession to the EC by Spain and Portugal.  Their entry to the market will have very serious effects on the livelihood of our fishermen, our fishing fleet and on all the people engaged in ancillary industries.  If we are to have a valuable fishing industry protective measures must be provided to ensure that our fishermen are given a chance to earn a living.  The present Spanish fishing fleet represents two-thirds of the combined EC fishing fleet.  Imagine that.</P>

      <P>It is only right and proper to ensure that correct measures will be taken to further the Irish fishing industry. Spain and Portugal have not a legal right to fish within the 200 mile zone but they are marauding inside that limit when they get the chance.  Fines totalling £1.4 million were imposed by Irish courts on Spanish ships in 1983 but this was only a drop in the ocean to the Spanish fleet and it did not deter them from poaching and ravaging our fishing grounds.  If they are not curbed and if they are given an opportunity <Col N="1786" /> to infiltrate our fishing grounds they will create havoc for the Irish fishing industry.  As a maritime country with rich fish stocks around our coasts it is important that our fishing rights are preserved. If we give a concession to the Spanish fishing fleet not alone will they deplete our fish stocks but they will wipe them out completely and they will take the limpets off the rocks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan shares our view as to the importance of the fishing industry but he does not share the aspect that what is needed to protect the Irish fishing industry is a proper negotiating attitude and a proper negotiating stance.  When the Framework Fisheries Agreement with which I was associated both as Minister for Fisheries and Minister for Foreign Affairs was signed between the EC and Spain on 15 April 1980 and ratified in May 1981 it provided the bedrock sensible basis on which negotiations should take place and from which we should not move.  Any Minister who departs from that fundamental arrangement will damage the fishing industry.  As a result of that agreement reached in 1980-81 it is estimated that there has been a reduction of some 50 per cent in the Spanish fishing effort in Irish waters.  That is a conclusion reached by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on page 11 of their report.  In the agreement we got a 50 mile box arrangement, we got Spanish fishing rights for the first time phased out of the six to 12 mile zone in which they worked, as a result of an agreement under the 1964 London Convention and we also got an arrangement whereby the Spanish fishing effort would be progressively reduced.  The net effect of our actions on behalf of the people and the fishing industry at that time has been to reduce the effort of the Spanish fishing fleet in our waters by 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to argue about the importance of the fishing industry and the importance of our fishing stocks, on conservation grounds.  The other member <Col N="1788" /> countries of the EC are very conscious of the need for conservation and that has been the motivation behind the Common Fisheries Policy, and the establishment of total allowable catches and quotas in regard to various species.  As the Minister is aware the underlying principle behind the conduct of fisheries negotiations since our entry to the EC has been conservation and I go along with that.  That is the basis on which negotiations should be conducted because the tragedy of the North Sea in regard to herring and the tragedy generally in North Atlantic waters in regard to herring and salmon is there for everyone to see.  Conservation is all-important.  If we allow this Spanish fleet in without control, without adhering to conservation principles, they will denude the fishing stocks of Northern Europe, particularly our fishing stocks. Traditionally the Spanish have had a very strong fishing effort within our area.  If they, through the medium of improved mechanisation of their fleet, which they can get through various resources from the EC, and if through the joint venture and third country arrangements of the EC they can intensify their fishery efforts in the Community, Irish fishing will not have a great future.  If the Spaniards are permitted to invade our fishing grounds it will be the end of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Through tough efforts we were able to reduce the Spanish fishing activities by 50 per cent in the past five years.  As Minister for Fisheries I was responsible for reducing the Spanish fishing effort.  Many Spanish trawler owners who disobeyed the arrangements have had to bear heavy penalties in the mean time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister appreciates that in this debate we are not in the game of politics.  We are trying to save a major national industry and, as Deputy Sheehan, who saw fit to interrupt me, will appreciate, Castletownbere is very much involved.  I am glad to have been associated with converting that town into a major fishing harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> Our principle business is to see that the terms of the 1980 framework agreement will be carried on.  We must ensure that a transitional period of 15 years would be the minimum.  There must be no compromise on that.  Of course, the Spaniards are working hard to get into our ten mile zone.  We naturally agree that they have established traditional fishing territories around our coast but in present circumstances there must not be any compromise in regard to the six mile to 12-mile area and the &ldquo;box&rdquo; at 50 miles during a transitional period.  Spain must co-operate with the Community, and with Ireland in particular, and adopt arrangements for catches and quotas, species by species, to ensure that their total fishing effort would be substantially diminished.  We must ensure that there will be a monitoring system to enforce such restrictions.</P>
    <P>The Minister must remember that the Spanish fleet numbers 17,500 vessels with a 750,000 gross registered tonne catch. Their fleet on entry to the EC will represent a 70 per cent proportion of the entire EC capacity.  I hope the Minister will not again back down as the Minister for Agriculture did in the past 12 months in the debacle in regard to the milk levy.</P>
    <P>Thanks to great efforts by Fianna Fáil in the past few years the Irish fishing industry has been expanded.  It has made substantial progress and it is now an industry ready for further development. In these circumstances we cannot have dangerous interference from the Spanish. We have developed excellent ports like Killybegs, Castletownbere, Schull, Dunmore East, Dunmore West and others. We can build an ultra modern fish processing industry.  It would be tragic if the Spaniards were to render our efforts null and void.</P>
    <P>Conservation, I am glad to say, is an important theme of the EC Council.  Only by careful conservation of fish stocks will we be able to provide adequate supplies for human consumption.  We are well placed to draw benefits from fish conservation. Therefore we must insist on strict adherence to the framework agreement of 1980.  We must ensure that the Spaniards <Col N="1790" /> will not depart from that arrangement, and that must be monitored strictly.  As I said earlier, under that agreement we succeeded in reducing Spanish catches in our waters by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Even under a new agreement now being negotiated the Spaniards will be entitled to legitimate catches involving a wide range of species but we must ensure conservation to guarantee catches not only for our fishermen but for our fish processing industry.  That is what we want to achieve.  We were prompted to table this motion because we have severe doubts, having regard to certain aspects of the Government's failure, about their political will to negotiate properly on behalf of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to speak on this topical and important subject.  I intend dividing my time between my colleagues, Deputies Noonan and Joe Walsh.  The milk super-levy introduced here last year by the Minister for Agriculture has had disastrous effects on our agricultural industry.  It has set off a chain of events which will affect almost every farm enterprise. The acceptance of the milk quota in the first instance has laid the foundations and made it easy for other quotas to follow.  The super-levy quota has left in its wake many difficulties.  The levy was to have been imposed on milk in excess of an increase of 4.6 per cent.  The deal was hailed as outstanding by the Minister and the Government on the Minister's return from Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>They were incorrect and the result was that the quota was dropped to 3.5 per cent.  I did not hear any hurrah from the farming organisations about that.  That error on the Minister's part has caused great confusion and anxiety in farming and co-op circles.  Farmers, in the first instance, had to make a late change when the levy was imposed but were asked to change again at a stage when it was almost impossible for them to do so.  That was the last straw.  As yet the Minister had not come clean about his mistake.  He has threatened all sorts of action if the EC do not give the 4.6 per cent, but those threats have a hollow ring.  We recall the Taoiseach, and the Minister, promising to block the super-levy even if they had to resort to the tactic of using the veto.  We all know what happened.  The cockup, as it became known, in the presentation of our figures has damaged our credibility in Europe and left farmers not knowing where they stand.</P>
      <P>Last week the <i>Farmers Journal</i> carried an article under the heading, &ldquo;Big Co-ops Back in Super-Levy Net&rdquo;, and I should like to quote part of it:</P>
      <P>An upsurge in milk production during February seems likely to push all the large Co-ops into the super-levy net.  Together, the big six could be facing a super-levy bill of £3½ million.</P>
      <P>Farmers could be penalised by 18p to 30p on each gallon over quota.  Many co-ops are now advising farmers to feed whole milk to calves to reduce the super-levy bill.</P>
      <P>Weekly milk intake during February is up by seven to eight per cent on February 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is obliged to tell the farmers what the precise position is.  He is obliged to pay the farmers to the tune of 4.6 per cent.  Farmers cannot be penalised for a blunder made on this question.  There are <Col N="1792" /> small producers with low quotas and new entrants with no quotas.  Those people had plans prepared by the Department of Agriculture and they were encouraged by the Department.  In co-operation with the banks and the ACC they have prepared plans for a six year period.  They were encouraged by the Minister but they now find themselves without a milk quota. They have embarked upon an enterprise from which there is no turn back.  What is the position in regard to them?</P>
    <P>There are farmers with diseased herds with small quotas and young farmers in training for dairy enterprises.  Those people have been completely ignored. They cannot compete for quotas.  In fact the farmers who need an increased milk quota most are those who can least afford the change.  The Minister should immediately introduce controls on the sale or lease of quotas.  Such quotas should be freed from the land on which they were produced.  Farmers discontinuing production should make their quotas available to a centralised body made up of co-ops and other interests.  Each co-op should determine a list of priorities based on the groups I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The milk cessation scheme clearly demonstrated the willingness of farmers to move out of milk because the scheme was oversubscribed by between ten million and 17 million gallons of milk.  However, because of the Minister's failure to act on milk quota mobility the cessation scheme has failed.  It is seen as being more profitable and flexible by farmers either to lease or sell such quotas.  The Department, undoubtedly, is a disaster area under the stewardship of the Minister. His blunders, misleading statements and failure to recognise the real problem has caused great difficulty.  It is sad for me to say that for the first time in the history of farming in County Wexford farmers are forced to go to the South Eastern Health Board for assistance. Agriculture is the base from which our economy can recover and it is time the Minister recognised that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I support Deputy Byrne's views.  Our party <Col N="1793" /> have called for a debate in the House on the super-levy episode.  We want the position with regard to the levy clarified. Will it be 4.65 per cent or 3.5 per cent over 1983 figures?  The dairy industry is in a state of confusion.  The Department of Agriculture, under the Minister, is in a state of confusion.  There is not leadership. European Council meetings in recent years were a disaster for Irish farmers.  The Taoiseach has been humiliated on many occassions.  He told us that the super-levy negotiations were the most important that ever went before the Council of Ministers, but they turned out to be a disaster for us.  We are aware that there is no joy for anybody in this pathetic position.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years an item of vital national importance has been dismissed as unnecessary in so far as the Council of Ministers and particularly the Commission are concerned.  There is no need for me to reiterate the unique importance of milk production to the Irish economy.  It has been stated as representing something in the region of 9 per cent of our gross national product. It is the basis of the whole Agricultural sector.  Other European countries have almost maximised their milk production, but we said two and a half years ago, when the super-levy issue came up for discussion, that we needed time to develop and reach the average of our European partners.  The Minister, unfortunately, was not prepared to allow that time.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> This is a very limited debate and I am going to give some time to my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh.  As Deputy Byrne rightly pointed out, the whole dairying industry is in a state of total confusion.  Our farmers so not know what their quota will be, whether they are going to be allowed to increase it by 4.6 per cent, 5 per cent or 3.5 per cent.  The Minister cannot give an answer one way or the other.  This is a sad occasion and I want to re-emphasise that the pass has been sold by the Minister to his partners in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for facilitating us.  I want to say a few words in support of a number of categories of farmer, in particular new entrants to dairying.  It is running very late in the day in the current super-levy year which ends on 31 March.  These unfortunate farmers, of whom there must be at least a few thousand, have no quotas whatsoever.  It is now the first week of March and I would appeal to the Minister to formulate a scheme.  I know that he and his Department have been meeting ICOS and other farming organisations.  There is no use in spending the whole year talking about it; a scheme needs to be formulated.</P>
      <P>The other category of farmers are those in severe financial difficulty.  They are badly off enough with the discontinuation of the rescue package, but to have no quotas or inadequate quotas to meet repayments is absolutely disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that time is also running out <Col N="1796" /> for farmers in the diseased herds category because the closing date for the milk cessation scheme offered to the Minister's Department was 10 December.  It is now 6 March and we still have not obtained an allocation of milk under that scheme. In fact, the original allocation of 17 million gallons has been whittled down now to 3.9 million gallons.  There is not half enough to go around.  I cannot understand how it took from 10 December to 6 March to allocate that milk.  Some have withdrawn from the scheme and others who were producing milk have used up their quotas.  We are now told that in the next super-levy year these unfortunate farmers could get some allocation.  I am very much afraid that some will not be able to survive until then.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that the new entrants to farming have their farm plans drawn up, they have their five year programmes and their commitments to meet.  In all fairness to them, at this stage of the game it is only right to give them a scheme which would give them some opportunity of making a living.  The scheme proposed by the ICMSA is one which would not cost the Department anything.  It would regulate leasing. Surely it is not beyond the bounds of ingenuity that the Department of Agriculture and the ICOS representing creameries around the country could get together to formulate a scheme to distribute milk from those who want to cease milk production.  They have demonstrated this wish because they have offered 17 million gallons to the Department to distribute to those who want it.  At this late stage the Minister should set about doing this straightaway, in the interests of a national dairy industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is going to become of the 3,500,000 gallons of milk set aside for those who sold milk directly to consumers?  I understand that included in that amount are at least one million gallons which have no home to go to. Surely as a start that could be divided out to people who want and are seeking a quota?  The outflow of milk from certain co-operative areas will prove pretty disastrous for large sections of the dairying <Col N="1797" /> industry if there is not some kind of control over the outflow of milk from one co-operative to another.  Anybody in the dairying industry in the southern part of the country who has his ear to the ground will know that some co-operatives are in dire danger of being out of business if there is no control of outflow of milk between the co-operatives.</P>
    <P>These are some of the points that I should like to make in support of the resolution: That the Minister immediately formulate a scheme to distribute milk to new entrants to farmers in severe financial difficulties and those with disease breakdown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a colossal set back to them.  Our deal in Europe last March was quite exceptional and was seen as such throughout Britain, Northern Ireland and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts which I have made since coming into office to facilitate the development of the Irish dairy industry have, of course, been of benefit to all in the dairy industry, especially small scale producers. The interests of the dairy industry have been foremost in my mind each year in the negotiations in Brussels in regard to agricultural prices and these have, of course, resulted in significant benefits for <Col N="1799" /> all Irish dairy producers but more especially small scale producers.</P>
    <P>The concession we won on the super-levy was of fundamental importance to the industry in allowing for further expansion beyond 1983 delivery levels.  In dividing out our national milk quota I decided to give more favourable treatment to small producers throughout the country. The allocation to co-operatives and dairies gave a disproportionate increase to suppliers with deliveries of less than 14,000 gallons.  This was equivalent to setting aside for small farmers about ten million gallons out of the extra 50 million gallons available to us above 1983 deliveries and then dividing the remaining 40 million gallons among all producers.</P>
    <P>I felt that the gain of an extra allocation was much more important to the smaller farmers than the loss of some potential quota for bigger farmers.  Many small farmers are also benefiting from the arrangements that I introduced under the milk cessation scheme whereby £5 million Exchequer funds is being made available to free quotas that can be reallocated to special category producers whose deliveries in 1983 were affected by animal disease and other exceptional situations that had to be compulsorily catered for under the Community regulations.</P>
    <P>The Community regulations do not provide for special treatment for new entrants.  I decided, however, that producers who began milk production between January 1983 and May 1984 should be specially catered for.  I stipulated that special additional allocations should be given to them each year out of the flexi milk that becomes available within the co-op area.  The distribution by co-ops of the flexi milk available for re-allocation to new entrants and farmers with heavy investments in dairying must be carried out up to a combined limit of 1 per cent of the co-op's total quota.  I would have preferred to have been able to allocate these additional quotas permanently but the EC Commission ruled that permanent reallocation cannot be made on the basis of reduced deliveries by other <Col N="1800" /> producers.  While the new entrants can have no guarantee that the quantity of flexi milk available for them this year will also be available next year, I would hope that they will be able to obtain additional quotas in future years as well.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, we provided £5 million from Exchequer funds in the milk cessation scheme to buy up quotas for redistribution to those categories &mdash; mainly farmers with animal disease problems &mdash; that must, under Community regulations, be compulsorily catered for through a national reserve.  This scheme was heavily oversubscribed by producers wishing to cease milk production and give up their quotas.  The total number of applications amounted to a gallonage in the region of 17 million.  This has been reduced by withdrawals and up to date figures indicate that about three million gallons have been withdrawn.  People were entitled to do that up to a certain date.</P>
    <P>Because of the heavy response and because also that the flexi milk available may not be sufficient to meet all the demands upon it, I have suggested to the co-operatives that they consider providing the finance to buy up the quotas of the remaining applicants so that we can expand the national reserve to give additional help to new entrants and heavily borrowed dairy farmers.  A working group comprising co-op representatives and officials of my Department have been examining how such a scheme might operate and I understand that there is to be a meeting of all the co-ops to discuss this matter next week.  While I would not wish to prejudge their decision I understand that the response to date from co-operatives has been encouraging.  In the meetings I had with them I noted that their attitude was positive to that request.</P>
    <P>I also had published last week-end a notice in regard to leasing and selling of lands indicating the vigilant controls the Department would be operating to ensure that only bona fide land transactions would take place and that there would be no bogus leasing or selling of quotas.  This should help new entrants as it will have the effect of preventing the pool of flexi milk within co-op areas being <Col N="1801" /> reduced unnecessarily and thereby affecting the prospects of new entrants and heavily invested producers of securing additional quotas.</P>
    <P>These then are some of the ways in which I have been trying to cater for new entrants and other producers with special problems within the constraints that the quota system imposes on us.  I am prepared to look at other ways in which the super-levy system might be improved and to this end I am arranging for consultations between Department officials and representatives of the farming and cooperative organisations later this month. I would point out, however, that I do not have a great deal of flexibility in this matter and many suggestions made to me for dealing with super-levy difficulties are not feasible as they are in direct conflict with the Community regulations.</P>
    <P>I am terribly concerned that new entrants and dairy farmers in severe financial difficulties should be catered for.  When the farming organisations came to me about eight or nine months ago seeking a pool of milk for people with particular problems, they sought a total of £5 million over a period of five years.  Within two weeks I provided that £5 million.  It caters for seven million gallons of milk.  As I pointed out, the total response to the scheme was that people applied to the extent of 17 million gallons which is now reduced to 14 million gallons.  I expect that seven million gallons will look after all the people who had disease problems since 1981.  That seven million gallons will cater for those and will also cater for people who had serious illnesses in the family which inhibited their ability to produce milk.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of caution. In recent times certain creameries or co-operatives had many people applying under the cessation scheme and we had a corresponding flood of doctors' certificates accompanying applications for extra milk.  This indicates that there is some sharp practice in operation and that certain co-ops do not want to lose any <Col N="1802" /> milk.  If they are to lose it due to people partaking in the cessation scheme, the powers that be in certain co-ops want to see that they get it back and they are trying to get it back through sharp practice and on the pretence that there was a serious illness problem when there may not have been such at all.  Of course there are genuine cases but it would appear to me that there are also many bogus cases.</P>
    <P>In certain co-op areas sufficient flexi milk has become available to cater for all the problems that arise.  Enough flexi milk has become available to cater for disease problems, for illness problems, for new entrants and for people in financial difficulties.  One of the major co-ops told me they have 5 per cent flexi milk available in the current market year.  If we had even a fraction of that all over the place, we would have sufficient to cater for all the cases which have been raised in this debate.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no refund of tax due in this case.  In a return of income for the year 1984-85 which he completed on 23 October 1984 the taxpayer indicated that he had been in receipt of a social welfare contributory old age pension since December 1982.  In a return of income for the year 1982-83 which the taxpayer completed in March 1983 he failed to mention that he was in receipt of this pension.  As the pension in question is chargeable to income tax it is more than likely that the taxpayer has paid insufficient tax for the years 1982-83 to 1984-85, inclusive.

      <P>As I informed the House on 15 November 1984 during the debate on the Second Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, approximately 400 customs officers of varying rank are employed in preventive controls at airports, ports and land frontier posts.  These officials, as part of their duties, deal with smuggling by individuals as well as with search of ships, aircraft and vehicles for contraband.  They are trained in the identification and detection of drugs and they examine baggage and question selected passengers specifically as to possession of drugs, having regard in their selection to where the passengers originated and the transit points through which passage was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of normal control of imports, commercial cargoes are also physically examined on a selective basis by customs officials other than those specifically engaged on preventive duties.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 1983 a total of 1,822 persons were charged with offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Figures for 1984 have not yet been assembled but the Garda view was that there was a general fall in the level of drug trafficking in 1984.  The allocation of manpower to combat drug abuse is primarily a matter for the Garda authorities who have informed me that there are no proposals at present to allocate additional manpower to the permanent units of the drug squad and that the current vacancies in the squad will be filled in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in reply to previous questions, it is misleading to suggest that the Garda response to drug offences is to be measured by the size of the drug squad.  The drug squad is simply one special unit with a particular role.  There are now over 2,000 other members of the force with specialised training in anti-drug offence work and, apart even from <Col N="1692" /> that, all members have a role to play. The Garda Síochána are fully committed to their role in combating drug abuse but of course it is a problem which also requires a response from various other groups and indeed society as a whole.</P>

      <P>The boards of management of each of the 3,400 national schools were requested to convene a general meeting of the parents of the children attending the school on or before 31 January 1985 to elect parents to attend regional meetings and to forward the names and addresses of the delegates elected so as to reach the Department not later than 7 February 1985.</P>
      <P>2,711 schools responded in time; a further 288 schools sent in nominations too late for the parents to be registered and authorised to attend the regional meetings. I am satisfied with the response of boards and parents to my initiative in regard to the establishment of a parents' council.  I cannot accept the premise as set out in the question that boards of management who did not respond in time showed a lack of concern regarding primary school children's education.  It is my experience that boards generally serve the individual schools well and work hard for the maintenance of schools and the development of primary education in their area.</P>

    <P>Beidh de shaoirse ag an gComhairle áitithe a chur faoi bhráid ar ábhair ar bith a bhaineann le beartas ginearálta de réir mar a éiríonn.</P>
    <P>Ní bheidh cearta comhairliúcháin ag an gComhairle Tuismitheoirí i leith na n-ábhar seo a leanas:</P>

    <P>Tá i gceist go gcuirfear na prionsabail seo a leanas i bhfeidhm agus an Chomhairle á bhunú:</P>
    <P>(a)  Ní mór deis a thabhairt do na tuismitheoirí <i>uile</i> chun páirt a ghlacadh í dtogha na Comhairle Náisiúnta Tuismitheoirí.</P>
    <P>(b)  Iad siúd as a ndéanfar an coláiste toghchánach agus iad siúd a mbeidh feidhmeannas acu faoin Chomhairle ní mór iad a bheith ina dtuismitheoirí nó ina gcaomhnóirí ag páistí atá ag freastal iarbhír ar scoil ag an leighéal cuí, ag tráth na dtoghchána.</P>
    <P>(c)  Ní mór leordheiseanna a chur ar fáil le go mbeadh páirt sa Chomhairle ag grúpaí mionúracha (reiligiúnach, scoileanna lán-Ghaelachta, oideachas speisialta).</P>
    <P>An uair amháin an Chomhairle bunaithe, ní bheidh a thuilleadh feidhme ag an Roinn maidir le reachtáil na Comhairle, ar acht go ndéantar de réir na dtrí bunphrionsabal a rianaítear romhainn.</P>
    <P>Tá sé í gceist go roghnófar Comhairle Náisiúnta ad-hoc a rachaidh ansin i mbun Bunreacht a leagan amach agus rialacha don Chomhairle Náisiúnta Tuismitheoirí ar bhonn buan.</P>
    <P>Táthar tar éis a chomhaontú go mba chóir dhá shraith a bheith sa Chomhairle &mdash; Comhairle Náisiúnta Tuismitheoirí Bunscoileanna agus Comhairle Náisiúnta Tuismitheoirí Iarbhunscoileanna &mdash; agus soláthar do liasion foirmiúil eatarthu. Táthar tar éis a chomhaontú chomh maith gurbé an bonn is fearr as a bhféad-faí baill a tharraingt chun Comhairle a bhunú ná Cumann Tuismitheoirí a bheith i ngach scoil agus tá na scoileanna ar fad á spreagadh chun cumann áitiúil tuismitheoirí a bhunú áit ar bith nach bhfuil ceann ann cheana féin.  Is chuige é sin go n-éascófaí toghcháin do na cruinnithe réigiúnacha agus náisiúnta faoi mar a rianáitear in ár ndiaidh thíos.</P>
    <P>Toghfar tuismitheoirí mar thoscairí ó gach scoil ar leith chun freastal ar na <Col N="1699" /> cruinnithe ceantair mar a leanas:</P>
    <P>Scoileanna le 1 múinteoir go 4 múinteoir, 1 toscaire; Scoileanna le 5 go 9 múinteoir, 2 toscaire; Scoileanna le 10 go 16 múinteoir, 3 toscaire; Scoileanna le 17 múinteoir nó thairis sin, 4 toscaire.</P>

Ag an gcruinniú sin toghfar ionadaithe chun dul ar aghaidh go dtí cruinniú náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Tá 61 ceantar cigireachta sa tír.  Toghfaidh gach ceantar ar leith beirt thoscaire chun dul ar aghaidh go dtí cruinniú náisiúnta. Ceantair áirithe, iad siúd a bhfuil pobail mhóra daltaíiontu, leithdháilfear aon toscaire breise dóibh chun dul ar aghaidh go dtí an cruinniú náisiúnta. Tionólfar cruinniú náisiúnta de thuairim 160 toscaire a bheidh tofa ag na ceantair agus déanfaidh siad sin ar a seal féin 15 ball a thoughadh don Chomhairle Náisiúnta ad-hoc.  Cuirfear sé suíochan breise in áirithe do ghrúpaí mionúracha.  Na grúpaí mionúracha seo a leanas, a shocróidh a gcuid ionadaíochta féin, do leith-dháileadh suíocháin dóibh mar a leanas:</P>

    <P>(B)  Oideachas Speisialta &mdash; 2 suíochán</P>
    <P>(C)  Earnáil na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaelacha &mdash; 2 suíochán.</P>
    <P>Ní choiscfidh sé sin, áfach, na tuismitheoirí sna grúpaí mionúracha ar bheith páirteach go gníomhach sa phróiséas toghchánach ina gcuid scoileanna le haghaidh na suíochán nach bhfuil in áirithe, ag leibhéil áitiúla, leibhéil cheantair agus leibhéil náisiúnta.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL PARENTS' COUNCIL</P>
    <P>
      <i>Preamble</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Education wishes to refer to paragraph 2.21 of the Programme <Col N="1700" /> for Action in Education 1984-1987 which states. states.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Recognising the primary role of parents in education and the important contribution they have made to educational development, parents will be facilitated in organising themselves into a Parents' Council through which the views of parents may be expressed. The Department will consult with the Council, once established on a national basis, on matters relevant to educational development.  The Council should be broadly representative of all parents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Department is at present facilitating parent groups in the establishment of a National Parents' Council.  The National Executive will be the main point of contact between the National Parents' Council and the Minister/Department but a consequence of the establishment of the Council should be the promotion of effective participation by parents in education locally at the level of each individual school.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fundamental Principles</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister will consult with the National Parents' Council on matters of general policy such as:</P>
    <P>The on-going implementation of the Programme for Action in Education 1984-87;</P>
    <P>The National Curriculum and Examinations Board;</P>
    <P>The role of parents in education;</P>
    <P>Overall policy in relation to School Transport, but not in relation to individual cases;</P>
    <P>Representation of parents on boards such as the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    <P>The Council will be free to make submissions on any matters of general policy which arise.</P>
    <P>The Parents' Council will not have rights of consultation in relation to the following matters:</P>
    <P>The scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers; Matters <Col N="1701" /> relating to conditions of service for teachers; Matters relating to qualifications for appointment as teachers; Matters concerning the management of individual schools (other than the general question of the role of parents as members of management boards).</P>
    <P>It is intended that the following principles will govern the establishment of the Council:</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>All</i> parents must be given the opportunity of participating in the election of a National Parents' Council.</P>
    <P>(b)  Those forming the electoral college and those holding office in the Council must be parents of guardians of children actually attending school at the appropriate level, at the time of elections.</P>
    <P>(c)  There must be adequate opportunities provided for participation in the Council by minority groups (religious, all-Irish schools and special education).</P>
    <P>Once the Council has been established, the Department will have no further function with regard to how the Council is run, provided the three basic principles already outlined are complied with.  It is intended to elect and <i>ad-hoc</i> National Council which will then proceed to draw up a Constitution and rules for the permanent National Parents' Council.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that there should be two tiers to the Council &mdash; a Primary National Parents' Council and a Post-Primary National Parents' Council &mdash; with provision for formal liaison between them.  It has also been agreed that the best basis from which to draw members to form a Council is to have a Parents' Association in every school and all schools are being urged to establish a local Parents' Association where one does not already exist.  This is in order to facilitate elections to the regional and national meetings as outlined below.</P>
    <P>Parents will be elected as delegate(s) from each school to attend the district meeting as follows:</P>
    <P>Schools with 1 to 4 teachers: 1 delegate; Schools with 5 to 9 teachers: 2 <Col N="1702" /> delegates; Schools with 10 to 16 teachers: 3 delegates; Schools with 17 or over teachers: 4 delegates.</P>
    <P>When the parents' representatives are elected in each school, the District Inspector will convene and chair a meeting of representatives from all schools in his/her district.  At this meeting, representatives will be elected to go forward to a national meeting.</P>
    <P>There are 61 Inspectorial districts in the country.  Each district will elect two delegates to go forward to a national meeting.  Certain districts, those which have large pupil populations, will be allocated 1 extra delegate to go forward to the national meeting.  A national meeting will be held of some 160 delegates elected by the districts and they in turn will elect 15 members to the <i>ad-hoc</i> National Council.  A further 6 seats will be reserved for minority groups.</P>
    <P>The following minority groups who will arrange their own representation have been allotted seats as follows:</P>
    <P>(A)  Minority Religious &mdash; 2 Seats</P>
    <P>(B)  Special Education &mdash; 2 Seats</P>
    <P>(C)  All-Irish School Sector &mdash; 2 Seats</P>
    <P>This does not preclude, however, the parents in the minority groups from being actively involved in the electoral process through their schools for the unreserved seats at local, district and national levels.</P>

Pending the opening of the full time office in Swords, arrangements are being made for a further screening of the live register in Skerries to ensure that all those interested in registering with the National Manpower Service are given an opportunity to do so.</P>

      <P>I understand that dialogue has been established between the parties with a view to reaching a solution.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to intervene. I would however urge the parties to adopt a positive approach in their negotiations and hopefully find an amicable solution to this long and difficult dispute.</P>
