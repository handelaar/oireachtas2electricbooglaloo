      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> envisaged measures for reform of farmer taxation including the introduction of a new farm tax.  The present Bill is designed to provide the statutory basis for the farm tax.  The separate matter of the amendment of the income tax code in so far as it affects farmer taxation will fall to be dealt with by the Minister for Finance in due course through appropriate provision in the Finance Bill for 1986.  The intention in that respect is that occupiers of farms above 80 adjusted acres would continue to be liable to income as well as farm tax when the latter is in operation but that they would be given a credit against income tax for farm tax paid.</P>
      <P>Taxation is a necessary, if unpopular, support of all organised societies.  One of the great achievements of Ireland's economic and social history has been the transfer of our land resources from large landlord holdings to the rural people of Ireland.  This transfer, won over a protracted period of time has meant that much of the country's real or capital wealth is and will remain vested in the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From this position within the Irish economy, farmers obviously owe a contribution in taxation to the common good, and this should not now be disputed by anyone.  The new farm tax is designed to achieve this simply and in a <Col N="2251" /> manner appropriate to a key economic feature of farming, the tenure of productive agricultural land.  Taxation proposals strikingly similar to those in the present Bill were in fact advanced in 1979 by the current president of the IFA.</P>
    <P>Much of the criticism which has been made of the new farm tax amounts to the complaint that it is not an income tax. There are a number of comments to be made about this argument.  The first is that the Irish income tax system is already bearing a disproportionately large burden of overall taxation effort and that, like other progressive administrations, we should be trying to develop a better balanced spread of taxes.</P>
    <P>The second is that the farm tax will represent a much simpler system than income tax, not just for collection purposes but for the benefit also of farmers, a large number of whom will be spared the time-consuming onus of keeping detailed accounts for tax purposes.  Most fundamentally, however, a tax based on the productive capacity of a farmer's principal asset is a fair one, particularly given the linkages with the income tax code and the provisions for hardship which I will detail later on.  As I have said, it was independently advocated by the present president of the IFA in 1979.</P>
    <P>The present Bill provides for the calculation, levying and collection of the new farm tax.  The main features of the tax as provided for in the Bill are that it will be determined on the basis of the number of adjusted acres in each farm.  Smaller farms &mdash; those below 20 adjusted acres &mdash; will be exempt from the tax.  The rate of tax will be uniform for all local authority areas and the determination of the number of adjusted acres in each farm will also be done centrally by a body established specially for that purpose under the Bill.  The tax will be levied and collected by the local rating authority in each area.</P>
    <P>The proceeds of the tax will form part of the current revenue of the local authority in each case.  I should mention though that it is envisaged that there will be adjustments in the amounts of the <Col N="2252" /> grants in relief of rates by reference to the revenue from the farm tax.  These adjustments are outside the scope of this Bill and will be determined as part of the process for settlement of the amount of the rate relief grants for each year at the appropriate time.  The Bill also contains provisions for appeals, enforcement of collection, dealing with hardship cases, etc., to which I will refer as I deal with the main provisions of the Bill in more detail.</P>
    <P>The farm tax will be based on the adjusted acreage of farms.  Section 2 defines an adjusted acre as the area of land having the equivalent productive potential of one acre of the best land in the country in ideal growing conditions. In adjusting the acreage of any farm, the factors which are to be taken into account are spelt out in some detail in the Bill and include the quality of the soil, the prevailing climate, aspect, shelter, and so on.  In adjusting acreages, land will be assumed to have a reasonable level of management, maintenance and investment applied to it.</P>
    <P>The task of classifying land into adjusted acreages will fall to a new farm tax office under the control of a farm tax commissioner, which will operate on lines somewhat parallel to those of the Valuation Office in relation to rateable valuation of other property.  The farm tax commissioner, whose appointment is provided for in section 14 of the Bill, will be appointed by the Minister for Finance under whose general oversight the classification process will be carried out.  The appointment will be a temporary one for a period of five years but this period may be extended if required.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that the farm tax commissioner will continue in office until the classification of land is completed.  After that, the commissioner's residual function of keeping the classification up to date will pass to the Commissioner of Valuation.  It is anticipated that a staff of about 200 will be available to assist the farm tax commissioner.  About half will be officers of the Land Commission, the remaining number being recruited temporarily for <Col N="2253" /> the purpose.  I might mention that the recruitment process is well under way. The commissioner will have power under section 15 of the Bill to delegate his functions under the Bill to any of his officers.</P>
    <P>The commissioner's staff will have the right, under section 17 of the Bill, to enter on land and to receive a reasonable level of co-operation from the farmer for the purposes of classifying land or dealing with appeals.  There are penalties of a fine of £1,000 and up to one year's imprisonment for obstructing the classification process and the Bill also contains provisions designed to enable the classification process to overcome any obstruction.</P>
    <P>I might mention while on the subject of penalties that there has been a certain amount of misunderstanding, if not misrepresentation, about the nature of these provisions.  Let me clarify the position on this.  Under existing tax legislation &mdash; specifically section 94 of the Finance Act, 1983 &mdash; there is a list of offences which apply to a wide variety of taxes from income tax to capital acquisitions tax. These offences include failing to make returns and obstructing the officers of the Revenue Commissioner in the performance of their duties.  The offences are punishable on summary conviction by fines of up to £1,000 and imprisonment of up to one year.  Where the conviction is on indictment, the penalties are considerably stiffer.  These provisions apply at present to farmers' income tax.  The provisions in this Bill are no more severe than in other tax legislation and I make no apology for including them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The impression has also been created in certain quarters that the farm tax commissioner will adjust acreages from Dublin without inspecting the land.  I want to make it clear that this will not be the case.  Land will be inspected by officers of the commissioner before the adjusted acreage is determined but, as I have already mentioned, provision is included to deal with the situation where farmers refuse entry on land should that arise.</P>
    <P>The classification will start as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted and will <Col N="2254" /> take some years to complete.  It will start in each county with the bigger farms and work progressively downwards until all farms of 20 adjusted acreage or more have been classified.  Section 3 of the Bill enables interim thresholds to be specified by the Minister for Finance until the classification of all holdings down to the 20 adjusted acres has been completed.  This will enable the farm tax to be applied during the classification process by reference to the interim thresholds obtaining at a particular time.</P>
    <P>There will be a classification list prepared for each local authority area which will contain particulars of the owner, occupier and adjusted acreage of each farm.  The classification list will be made available to each local authority at intervals specified in section 4 of the Bill until the list will be available before 1 Octoof the list will be available before 1 October 1986 to enable the tax to commence in 1986.  It is the intention to assign manpower to the classification process in such a way that it proceeds at an even pace throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Upon receipt of the classification lists, the local authorities are obliged to publicise and make available the list for public inspection for a period of 21 days and to notify individually farmers whose land has been classified, so as to enable those farmers to consider lodging appeals.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the question of appeals is one to which I have paid considerable attention in the Bill.  As Deputies will be aware, one of the reasons for the collapse of the valuation system on land was that there was no procedure for having land valuations reviewed in the light of changing circumstances.  The appeals provisions which I have included, and which I will now briefly describe, are designed to ensure that adjusted acreages are kept fully up to date.</P>
    <P>The farm tax commissioner will be the initial vehicle for dealing with appeals. Appeals to the commissioner will arise in two ways.  Firstly, there will be an appeal open to either the farmer or the local authority against the initial classification decided by the commissioner's office. Secondly, once the initial classification <Col N="2255" /> has been finally determined and circumstances, such as land sales or arterial drainage, cause the classification to require revision, then the farmer or the local authority can request the commissioner to revise the initial classification.  The commissioner's decisions on appeals and revisions are appealable to a farm tax tribunal the special purpose body for which the Bill provides in section 8 and in the Schedule.  There is further specific right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law against a determination of the farm tax tribunal.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is designed to provide a speedy and flexible system of dealing with appeals.  The members of the tribunal will be appointed by the Minister for Finance and will hold office for a three year period.  The tribunal's proceedings will be in private and it will be empowered to call witnesses and to award costs against unsuccessful applicants.  While it will largely be a matter for the tribunal to regulate its own proceedings, the Schedule to the Bill envisages the tribunal operating through three of its members being called together as necessary to hear appeals. This should ensure a flexible system whereby the tribunal can be scaled up or down depending on the volume of appeals arising.  The tribunal will, unless there is good reason for not doing so, award costs against unsuccessful appellants. I must emphasise however that these costs should be modest by comparison with court costs.</P>
    <P>In my comments so far I have been outlining how the base for the farm tax is to be set.  The Bill also provides for the levy and collection of the tax and for some residual arrangements.  Section 9 provides for the levy annually of a farm tax at a flat rate per adjusted acre.  The rate of tax will be prescribed by the Minister for the Environment and the local authorities will levy and collect the tax and, as I already mentioned, the proceeds will form part of the income of local authorities to be spent locally by them.</P>
    <P>The tax is payable by the person who stands entered as the occupier of a farm <Col N="2256" /> in the list of adjusted acreages produced by the farm tax commissioner.  The procedure for levy and collection of the tax resembles the procedure with rates. Local authorities are obliged to prepare details annually of each farmer's adjusted acreage and his tax liability.  These details, to be known as the farm tax record, which are similar to those in the rate book, must be publicised and put on display in local authority offices and specified Garda stations.  There has been comment on this aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me clarify the position.  The purposes of the record are two-fold.  Firstly, it allows farmers to inspect the record and to report any last minute inaccuracies to the local authority before the bills are sent out.  Secondly, it is the formal record of tax liability which may be required as evidence in court cases.  The purpose of the record is not, as has been suggested, to criminalise the farming community.  It follows the procedure for publicising and displaying the rate book except that, for the convenience of farmers who live some distance from the county town, the Bill provides that the record may be inspected in Garda stations.  In relation to the question of display in Garda stations, I will, of course, take account of any views expressed by the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>Once the record has been put on display for 21 days, local authorities are to send out farm tax bills and payment is due two weeks later.  The Bill envisages payment being made in one lump sum or, alternatively, under regulations which I intend to make, in instalments.  It is my intention to encourage local authorities to develop payment patterns that suit their own and farmers' requirements as far as possible.  Where tax remains unpaid after two months of being due, interest at 1¼ per cent per month &mdash; the same as applies to other taxes &mdash; accrues on the outstanding amount.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that payment of the tax must be made where appeals have been entered.  Deputies will appreciate the reason for this provision, which mirrors existing rating law provisions and is somewhat similar to the income tax code.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2257" /> Clearly, it would put local authorities and the farm tax commissioner in an impossible position if the mere entry of an appeal was sufficient to halt the collection of the tax.  This would encourage frivolous appeals and would disrupt the whole assessment process.  The Bill, however, makes it clear that the outcome of appeals &mdash; whether they be in the farmer's favour or otherwise &mdash; will have retrospective effect.  Where this results in a lower adjusted acreage, local authorities must make a refund to the farmer concerned.</P>
    <P>We recognise, of course, that there will be circumstances where payment of the farm tax would cause undue hardship and the Bill provides that the local authority can agree in these circumstances to postpone action to collect the tax for a specified period.  During any such period, interest will not accrue to the outstanding amount.  I have to stress, however, that the tax remains due and will indeed be a charge on the land until it is paid.  I believe that the provision in the Bill provides a flexible system which will adequately cater for the inevitable hardship cases while at the same time protecting local authorities from claims for relief which may not be well based.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill is designed to ensure that farms just above the threshold of 20 adjusted acres will not have to pay the full farm tax.  A farm of 20 adjusted acres but less than 21 adjusted acres will pay only one-fifth of the tax; 21 to 22 adjusted acres will pay two-fifths; 22 to 23 adjusted acres will pay three-fifths and so on until a farm of 25 adjusted acres will pay the full tax.  The same form of marginal relief will apply to interim higher thresholds which will apply before the land classification is completed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides adequate powers of enforcement.  Firstly, the interest provision should act as an incentive to early payment of the tax.  Secondly, local authorities may pursue defaulters through the courts.  Thirdly, in the event that a local authority owes a defaulter money, the farm tax can be set off against the moneys owing.  Fourthly, in common <Col N="2258" /> with the capital acquisitions tax, farm tax will automatically become a charge on the land until it is paid, but small sales of land will be exempt from this provision.</P>
    <P>There has been much speculation about the rate of tax and how the rate will be adjusted in future years.  Let me clarify the position.  The rate of tax in the first year will be £10 per adjusted acre and I will be prescribing that amount for the first year under section 9 of the Bill, just as I have to prescribe the rate for each subsequent year.  Indeed, if it is the view of this House that it would be more desirable that the rate of £10 per adjusted acre for 1986 should be specifically mentioned in the Bill, this can be done by an amendment on Committee Stage and I would be prepared to put down such an amendment.  As regards those years after 1986, section 9 (4) (b) of the Bill sets out the parameters within which I must work in fairly specific terms.  The rate of tax must be set having regard to the change in family farm incomes and taxes generally. This provision will ensure that changes will be in line with farm income changes and changes in the burden of taxation the rest of the community is asked to bear.</P>
    <P>The classification of land will take some years to complete and will, as I mentioned earlier, commence with the bigger farms and work downwards.  The tax will commence in 1986 and will be levied on the larger farms initially.  The Bill facilitates this.  The effect will be that if, for example, by 1987 the classification has progressed down to, say, 40 adjusted acres, the threshold for liability to the tax in that year will be prescribed by the Minister for Finance at 40 adjusted acres. Farms with adjusted acreages below the threshold will only become liable for tax as they are assessed in the following years.  In these cases the farm tax will not apply retrospectively.  Income tax exemption for full time farmers with farms between 20 and 80 adjusted acres, to be provided for in the Finance Bill, 1986, will take effect as liability to the farm tax arises.</P>
    <P>Since the abolition of agricultural rates we have not had a satisfactory and easily <Col N="2259" /> administered system of taxation for farmers. I believe that the Bill will ensure a more realistic contribution from the farming community to the provision of local services and that this will be achieved in a manner which involves no disincentive to agricultural production.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to advise the House that I will be bringing forward some amendments of a technical nature on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This farm tax proposal affects not only the farming community but every sector of the community, particularly the tax paying community.  This proposal, which is being introduced by the Minister for the Environment, runs contrary to every established principle of equity and fair play between the farming community, and other sectors of the community, and even within the farming community itself.  This proposal was born out of a nonsense compromise to satisfy some notional ideological conflict between the Government parties.  As a consequence we get the nonsense of a Minister for the Environment introducing what is if it were passed &mdash; and hopefully it will not &mdash; the most revolutionary change in the principles of taxation here or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It is left to the Minister for the Environment to introduce this legislation.  That, in itself, underlines how woolly and unconvinced the Government at this stage must feel about the purpose and validity of such a proposal.  There are some factors which are emerging very clearly.  First, the proposal to tax farmers on a basis other than income is particularly unfair to the PAYE sector.</P>

      <P>Tax equity demands that every section of the income earning community be taxed on the same basis and at the same rate, but this proposal segregates farmers from the rest of the community and ignores actual income in determining the rate of tax payable.  It deliberately, and with blind determination ignores those two fundamental principles. Not surprisingly, the injustice &mdash; and that is what it is &mdash; and anomaly of a tax at a flat rate on the means of income as distinct from the actual income is now arousing opposition from every section of the community.</P>
      <P>The Government for the first time have actually succeeded in creating a cohesion within the country from the tax paying community on the common basis of total antagonism to their proposal.  I worried that this Bill would create divisions but in view of yesterday's statement from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions it is clear that every sector of the community, albeit for different reasons, are totally and utterly opposed to this legislation.</P>
      <P>Clearly this Bill is demonstrably unfair as between farmers and other income earners.  If that were not enough, it discriminates against farmers themselves by imposing a flat rate of tax on producers who have an entirely different level of income.  Could anyone who understands the basis of income tax or tax liability produce any justification from any tax system for a principle such as that &mdash; a flat rate of tax on the basis of the means of production irrespective of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill cannot, and must not, be passed by this House as being in the interest of tax equity.  If the Government succeed &mdash; and I now believe they will not &mdash; in forcing this legislation through, it will create unnecessary tensions between the agricultural sector and other sectors and it will create deep divisions and tensions within the farming community itself.  At a time when we want to avoid unnecessary confrontation, when we want to get a sense of national purpose based on developing our most important <Col N="2261" /> national resource, our farmland, when we want to demonstrate the interdependence between farmers and workers, particularly those in the agri-food industry which needs to be developed to a greater extent, which is the national priority, this nonsense proposal would achieve the very opposite.</P>
    <P>The fact that it would suit some farmers while penalising others underlines the injustice of this legislation.  It might suit some farmers because the level of tax they would pay would in no way be related to their income, but it would penalise others because their tax liability would arise irrespective of whether they would otherwise be exempt from income tax under the provisions of the income tax code which exempts a married couple with an income of up to £5,300 from paying income tax.</P>
    <P>If the same principle that the Government are proposing to introduce here &mdash; and by the time this legislation is dealt with in detail in this House even the Government will run for cover &mdash; were to be applied, for instance, on the basis of what might suit certain sectors &mdash; the PAYE, business and professional sectors and the self-employed &mdash; we would have a spontaneous and universal demand for the application of the most favourable or suitable system to each income earner in each section.  Why not?  If we are going to apply a tax system on the basis that it will suit those who are in an intensive form of production but might not suit those who are not, is that a justification for any tax implementation &mdash; that it will suit some but not others even in the same major productive sector in our economy?</P>
    <P>The primary concern in any tax code must be first to secure tax equity and secondly to reform and streamline the taxation system to ensure a fairer distribution of the growing burden of taxation between all sections of the community. Let me remind the House that we now have the privilege, amongst all the 24 countries of the OECD, of having the highest level of taxation.  Our burden of taxation has grown to the point that the OECD have referred to it as the tax <Col N="2262" /> wedge &mdash; the squeezing of the life out of our economy.  Because of this, the Government are attempting to create the illusion that they are going to get at everyone in the same way by introducing a nonsense such as this, which exists nowhere else.  In fact, they are doing quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>In March of 1980, when I established the Commission on Taxation, one of the reasons which prompted me to do so was what was evident in late 1979 and early 1980 &mdash; a sense of hostility that seemed to be evident between what for me and my party are two inevitably interlinked communities in our community the PAYE sector and the primary producer, the farmer.  When we saw public demonstrations that tended to divide instead of unite, we realised that the problem was central, to a considerable extent, to the burden of taxation and how it was applied.  For that reason, I specifically obtained the approval of the Government to set up the commission and I set down, in the terms of reference for that commission, clear and specific points.  I quote from them briefly: &ldquo;To inquire generally into the present system of taxation and to recommend such changes as appear desirable and practicable ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash; both those words, desirable and practical, are important &mdash;&ldquo;... so as to achieve an equitable incidence of taxation,&rdquo;&mdash; note the word &ldquo;equitable&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;due attention being paid to the need to encourage development of the national economy and to maintain an adequate revenue yield&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those terms of reference were universally welcomed at the time, even by all in this House, and were accepted by the members of the Commission as a sound basis for their study of the existing system and for proposals to improve it.  In my view, the proposal here will never get much further than being a proposal, but it confronts every principle that the Commission on Taxation were asked to consider.  Let us take the term of reference &ldquo;to recommend such changes as appear desirable and practicable.&rdquo;  There is so much nonsense in this proposal that it would not be even possible, much less <Col N="2263" /> practicable, to implement.  It turns its face entirely against anything that is either reasonable or practicable.</P>
    <P>Let us take the phrase &ldquo;so as to achieve an equitable incidence of taxation&rdquo;.  It is clear from what the Minister has said this morning that the Government are not interested in an equitable incidence in taxation.  They are interested in trying to demonstrate that &ldquo;farmers obviously owe a contribution in taxation to the common good and this should not now be disputed by anyone&rdquo;.  Of course, that is true.  They do not dispute it themselves.  However, this blunt instrument is simply an attempt on the part of the Government to resolve the differences within the Coalition.  If the consequences of resolving those differences are to create unnecessary differences within our community and tensions where they should not exist so be it; this Government are prepared to sacrifice the most fundamental elements in our economy, of primary producers in agriculture and workers in the manufacturing or service sectors, in order to somehow cement over the differences which are becoming more and more apparent within that Government.  That is basically why we have the Minister for Labour introducing this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister must forgive me for forgetting.  With the way things are going these days, it is not going to matter much longer.  This was another of the major priorities of this Government. They were going to demonstrate that the Labour Party had muscle enough to show that any of the proposals, particularly in the tax area, would implement their particular ideological nonsense in Government.</P>
      <P>Let us look at &ldquo;the equitable incidence of taxation, due attention being paid to the need to encourage development of the national economy&rdquo;.  If ever there were a proposal guaranteed to discourage the development of the national economy, it is this.  It is quite clear, as the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2264" /> Minister has acknowledged this morning, that the adjustment can be readjusted <i>ad infinitum.</i> Once a farmer undertakes a programme for development, even allowing that it will eventually be fixed at a certain adjusted acreage &mdash; and &ldquo;eventually&rdquo; is the word, in view of what the Minister has disclosed this morning &mdash; if that farmer becomes more progressive he can be adjusted again and again according to the criteria laid down in the concept of this nonsense of adjusted acreage.</P>
    <P>Adjusted acreage apparently will now be on a basis that cannot be properly defined, much less understood by anyone who will be asked to interpret it.  It provides that an adjusted acre is an area of land with the equivalent productive potential of one acre of the best land in the State.  In heaven's name, where could one find any basis of agreement of what would be one acre of the best land in the State?  Perhaps it is in the constituency of Deputy Yates, of Deputy Bruton or in my constituency.  We are also proud of our farm record.  Did anyone ever hear of such nonsense in any legislation?</P>
    <P>However, it is not left at that.  Other factors that have to be taken into account when considering the productive potential of the land include the range of uses to which the land can be put, access to the land, the nature of the soil, the climate, location, aspect and the structure of the farm and other natural factors.  The Government also state that in classifying land a reasonable degree of management and of investment in land will be assumed to apply.  That shows the nonsense of this entire proposal.</P>
    <P>There will be a system of examination by people who will be given access to the land and nothing will be done until such time as these people inspect the land.  In that connection, let us talk about equity. Even if there was a sufficient number of people who have been displaced from the Land Commission to inspect every single acre on every farm, I do not know if they could be expected to have the necessary expertise to consider, for instance, the range of uses to which the land could be <Col N="2265" /> put.  With regard to access to the land, they will have to spend a long time studying the area, considering the highways and the byways, all the side roads and byroads.  With regard to the nature of the soil, how qualified will these people be to deal with that problem?  The next factor is the climate and the question must be asked if they will have people from the Meteorological Office to assist them.  We are told that the aspect of the farm will have to be considered &mdash; I supose that means the view &mdash; but I do not know what that has to do with farm potential or development.  All of this nonsense is being introduced to have a classification of what is an adjusted acre related to the notional best acre of land, wherever that may be.  Does the Minister not realise this is engaging in fantasy which is the very opposite of what should be considered in setting out a tax proposal. Edmund Burke said that any fool can contrive a new tax.  If he were around now he would have thought that even the depths of foolery could not have contrived such a nonsensical tax as this proposal.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the reactions of the various groups to what the Government see as their determination to impose a fair tax on the farming community.  It will be of benefit to the House if we consider the principles adumbrated by members of the Government and particularly the Taoiseach in relation to their approach to a fair system of taxation.  I should like to refer to an article in the magazine <i>Magill</i> dated July 1979, one of the many interviews given by the present Taoiseach when he was Leader of the Opposition. At that time I was taking office as Minister for Finance.  He had some clear statements on the principles on which tax should be levied and he spelled out the Fine Gael position on farm taxation.  He said that during the National Coalition in the mid-seventies he proposed a 12 per cent levy on farm sales.  He made the following comment in that connection:</P>
    <P>This was merely an option I proposed at the time.  The idea was that if <Col N="2266" /> we were able to raise about £120 million through this means we would be able to revalue the Irish pound upwards against sterling by about 5 per cent and greatly reduce the element of imported inflation in our general inflation rate.  We would have been able to lower income tax, increase food subsidies and eliminate rates on private houses and agricultural holdings.  However, I was convinced that the inequities to which such a levy would give rise would offset the benefits that would accrue.  Therefore, the proposal was rejected in favour of a straightforward tax on farmers.</P>
    <P>In that interview the Taoiseach was asked what form of farmer taxation he would favour.  He said, &ldquo;Farming should be taxed on the basis of accounts, on the same basis as any other business&rdquo;.  We could not have a clearer statement from a man who is not given to making very clear statements.  He gave a specious reason why the idea might have been feasible, namely, the revaluing upwards of the Irish pound by 5 per cent that would greatly reduce the element of imported inflation.  Did anyone ever hear such nonsense in terms of the basis for levying tax?  However, by the end of the interview fortunately he was converted to reality and he came to the conclusion that farmers should be taxed on the basis of their accounts.  I wonder what has happened to him since then?</P>
    <P>In discussions we had in this House he attacked the rates system on agriculture on the basis of the same principle, that it was a levy on productive capacity as distinct from income.  In the Official Report of 9 December 1980, Volume 325, columns 740-741 he made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The rates system takes no account of family circumstances so a farmer with ten children pays as much as a single farmer.  It is not related to the capacity to pay and as a form of taxation in that respect is unjust.</P>
    <P>I was Minister at that time.  That is what the Taoiseach had to say then.  He called <Col N="2267" /> it a singularly inequitable form of taxation which was not only unjust in a distributive sense as between the different people paying it but which imposed an additional penalty when incomes were low or non-existent.  The reasons he put forward opposing the rates system at that time are still valid in opposing the system which the Government have now brought before the House.  The Minister for the Environment has introduced it and he should be much more concerned with clear air and keeping our rivers and lakes clean.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment would be happier dealing with matters relating to the environment than he is dealing with matters relating to taxation.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael policy document of October 1982 suggested that:</P>
      <P>Poor law valuation be replaced as a means of determining liability thresholds for income tax by a system based on standard results for enterprise based on the farm modernisation service.</P>
      <P>It was also proposed that farmers should have the option of having their liability and eligibility assessed on that basis or on the basis of factual assessment.  That is what Fine Gael went before the people on.  They are now repudiating what they asked the electorate to accept at that time.  Some reference should be made to the Labour Party irrelevant though they may be at this time.  In their policy document of November 1982 they stated: &ldquo;all farmers with a taxable income should pay tax and health contributions&rdquo;.  This proposal, introduced by a Labour Minister for the Environment, is being introduced on the basis that farmers irrespective of income will be levied on an acre poll tax of an adjusted acre of the best acre in Ireland wherever that might be.  Labour did not go before the people on the basis of this proposal but suddenly, in Government, they want to demonstrate their muscle.  We are dealing with this nonsense as a consequence.  It has been proved that the sinews in that muscle of the Labour Party are very tenuous and weak.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture might have introduced this measure.  Least of all did I think it would be the Minister for the Environment.  What did the Minister for Finance say in an interview in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in November 1982?  He declared Fine Gael's opposition to any new form of capital taxation on farmers to replace agricultural rates when they would be finally phased out and rejected out of hand the notion of property tax on productive assets.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> Farmers should be taxed on the income they get from their farms and any subsequent profits should be taxed on the same basis as manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>At that time Fine Gael were about to enter into Government.  Today the Minister for Finance has repudiated every principle in that statement.  In the <i>Joint Programme for Government,</i> if that means anything any more, the chapter on taxation states:</P>
    <P>In drawing up new tax proposals account will be taken of the cost of the care of dependent children.</P>
    <P>One of the most inequitable consequences of this nonsensical proposal is that it takes no account of dependent children.  For the first time no difference is made between the income earner who has dependants and the one who has not. I remember well the day the Minister presented the 1983 budget.  It was his first time to address the nation on his perception of how tax should be implemented and what would be a fair system. That Budget Statement was the beginning of all our disasters but if the Minister had followed up on what he said in that we would have something to go on now. He said: &ldquo;The public perception of tax equity demands that all income earners should be liable to tax on an equal footing&rdquo;. How in the name of heavens can the Minister pretend that a proposal which has nothing to do with actual income but with the notional basis of the means of income will ensure that all income earners should be liable to tax on an equal footing?</P>
    <P>In a statement issued on 17 May 1983 the Minister stated that if farmers were allowed the option of a system under which taxable income would be based on standard results the more profitable farmers would be systematically undertaxed while the less profitable would have to keep accounts to avoid excessive income tax charges.  He said that in any event a notional system of taxation for farmers would be inconsistent with the <Col N="2270" /> objective of treating all taxpayers on an equal basis.  I could not rely on any clearer statement from any source as a ground for fiercely opposing this proposal than that which is on the record from the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister for the Environment told us that farmers owe a contribution in taxation to the common good and that this should not be disputed by anyone.  It is not disputed by the farmers or the PAYE sector.  The indication that this is the only means through which farmers could make contributions to the common good is utterly ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister speaks for the Government in relation to this Bill or is it a case of two voices from the Government as happened yesterday when the Minister for Labour was speaking on behalf of Labour in relation to the Dooge report?  This morning the Minister told us that a tax based on the productive capacity of a farmer's principal asset is a fair tax especially given the linkages with the income tax code and the provisions for hardship.  Let us compare that with what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been insisting is the only basis of equity, that is, that farmers should be taxed not on the basis of their asset capacity but on the basis of actual income.  How, then, can the Minister on behalf of the Government say now that the basis of fair play is a tax on the productive capacity of the principle asset?</P>
    <P>If this is now to be the principle on which tax is to be promoted will that mean that from now on in respect of business there will be a poll tax per square foot of the equivalent of the best square foot of business or shop floor, wherever that might be, and regardless of whether it yields income?  If this is the principle that is to apply to the agricultural sector why not provide likewise for the business or professional sectors and tax doctors, engineers, lawyers and so on on the basis of what the best income earner in the corresponding profession would be?  Is there any basis on which that principle could be accepted as being fair, much less as being in line with the need for national development?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2271" /> Regarding the impact the proposal has had so far, I have not concentrated on the attitude of the farmers because, as there are different kinds of businessmen, there are different kinds of farmers but the farmers have made their position very clear.  This proposal discriminates between them and it is unfair to them as it is unfair to the PAYE sector in the sense that it conveys the notion that not only now but for evermore, farmers cannot be relied on to pay tax on the same basis as anyone else and that the only way to ensure they pay their fair share is to hit them with a blunt instrument like the Bill we are discussing.  That is very damaging not only to the farmers but to the economy generally.  Most significantly of all, in support of the principles that were stated clearly by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach and by the farming community, the ICTU have made a remarkable and very clear attack on the Farm Tax Bill.  This must signal clearly to the Government that in attempting to proceed with this nonsense, they will not only further undermine Government but will ensure that there will be an attack from all sides on this nonsense.  This tax is unfair to the PAYE sector particularly.  In their statement of yesterday, the ICTU say:</P>
    <P>Congress supports the proposed farm tax but only as a replacement for rates on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the tax is not meant to be in any sense a form of income tax.  The statement continues.</P>
    <P>We are, however, completely opposed to the Government's proposal to exempt almost all farmers from income tax, a proposal which we condemn as compounding the inequities in the tax system and as a repudiation of the promises that the Government has frequently made about tax reform.</P>
    <P>Some farmers will be exempt form income tax as a result of this proposal. The statement continues:</P>
    <P>Rates on agricultural land were not <Col N="2272" /> abolished by any decision of the Dáil. ...</P>
    <P>That is also recognising that the Government nearly claimed they were.  The sentence continues:</P>
    <P>...nor did any political party propose that they should be abolished. The decision of the Supreme Court about the constitutionality of agricultural rates concerned the basis of assessment of rates and not the principle of levying rates.  It was, therefore, a matter for the Government to rectify this technical matter.  This it has done through the farm tax proposal under which, what in effect are rates, will be levied per &ldquo;adjusted acres&rdquo; in order to conform with the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>That is what Congress seem to think the Government are doing in order to conform with the Supreme Court judgment. The statement continues:</P>
    <P>The proposal of the Government to exclude all farmers with less than 80 &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; acres (a substantial size farm) from income tax is indefensible...</P>

    <P>The proposal of the Government to exclude all farmers with less than 80 &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; acres (a substantial size farm) from income tax is indefensible and an insult to PAYE workers who have lobbied and campaigned through the Trade Union Movement for a tax system which would ensure that all sections of the community would be taxed on the basis of their actual incomes. The proposal to exempt nine out of ten farmers from any liability to pay income tax, whatever the level of their incomes, must be rejected by all who have any concern for equity in the tax system.  Everybody that has looked at the tax system in the light of equity and <Col N="2274" /> fairness has concluded that farmers should pay income tax on the same basis as other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that, including the farmers, including the Commission on Taxation, including anybody who has looked at the whole tax system.  I do not think one will find a better statement of the principle on which this proposal should be repudiated than that from the Congress of Trade Unions and to which all of us can give total and unqualified support.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Income Taxation in the early sixties, the National Economic and Social Council and, most recently, the Commission on Taxation have all recommended that farmers should be brought into the income tax net.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  This theoretically has been the position since 1983. I am afraid there are no horses left for the Minister or Deputy Yates to ride at this stage and they know it only too well. The Congress of Trade Unions continue to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, two factors have combined to reduce the amount collected in income tax from farmers.  Firstly, there has been the ability to offset interest against income and write off <Col N="2275" /> farm investments to reduce the tax liability; secondly &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and listen to this:</P>
    <P>&mdash;there has been the inexcusable failure of the tax authorities to access farmers and to enforce collection of the tax due.</P>
    <P>I would agree with that.  The farmers themselves have acknowledged that. Should farmers be criticised or blamed, much less set up as somehow objects of public odium by the PAYE sector, if they do not even have tax assessments served on them &mdash; and that has been the case for the last two years?  Are they to be set up as targets of hostility or people of a lower level of public concern than the rest of us if they are not even given the basis on which they should produce their tax accounts?  If any of the rest of us were not asked, or were not given assessments, would we be rushing to the taxman either?  Because of the total and utter failure of the Government to introduce the necessary staff, as Congress say here, and to implement the existing system, we find that the farmers were those who were blamed for their failure to pay what they were not asked to pay in the first instance. Here Congress is very strong when they say:</P>
    <P>In no area is the stupidity of the arbitrary staff embargo in the public service more evident than in the refusal to make staff available to ensure the effective operation of the tax system which would recoup multifold the net outlay involved.</P>
    <P>Of course it would.  I have been saying that here and at the Committee on Public Expenditure, of which I am vice-chairman, for a considerable time past.  They continue to say:</P>
    <P>As well, there has not been the political will to compel farmers to pay the income tax they owe.</P>
    <P>There has not even existed the means of assessing what farmers may be likely to pay, or obliged to pay, on an income tax basis, in respect of a considerable <Col N="2276" /> number.  A number of them have been paying on accounts, paying on the same basis after due allowance for accounts. But a number of them have not, and they acknowledge that themselves.  Are they to be criticised if they have not even been asked to furnish accounts much less be rendered liable to assessment?  Then they say:</P>
    <P>The abdication by the Government from its responsibility to enforce the law and collect the taxes due from farmers is totally unacceptable.  The only objection that seems to be raised against income tax on farm income is the difficulty and cost of keeping accounts.  The relatively simple farm accounts required by the Revenue Commissioners are not an imposition on farmers.</P>
    <P>I know.  I was the Minister who introduced those relatively simple farm accounts, particularly in respect of farmers on low income levels, and they did not constitute an imposition on them. While in the first instance some farmers naturally had reservations about having to have all their accounts prepared for income tax assessment purposes for the first, second and subsequent years, as Congress says here, the relatively simple farm accounts required &mdash; which were arrived at after very detailed consultations with all concerned &mdash; do not constitute an imposition on farmers.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and the wildly exaggerated estimates of the aggregate cost involved lack all credibility.</P>
    <P>Congress goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In any case it is accepted that accounts are essential if farms are to be worked efficiently as business enterprises.</P>
    <P>This proposal is doing the very opposite. It is moving away from accounts, insisting that the notion of productive capacity is what will determine liability to tax. Congress further point out:</P>
    <P>The President of the Agricultural Consultants Association has pointed <Col N="2277" /> out that the farm advisory service and the Agricultural Institute have actively promoted farm accounts as an essential management tool and that the abolition of tax assessments on income would undermine the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>I welcome this keen interest and awareness on the part of the Congress of Trade Unions in the role of the Agricultural Institute, particularly their commitment to promoting proper management and productive capacity in agriculture.  This is the kind of thing we have been awaiting for some time &mdash; that sense of mutual interdependence, awareness and cohesion that will guarantee that even after a Government that have proved to be such a disastrous failure as this, we can move together to better achievements.  Congress then say:</P>
    <P>A further point is that the Youth Employment Levy, health contribution and income levy are levied as a percentage of income.  It, therefore, is essential that details of farmers' income should be available.</P>
    <P>&mdash; and they are right &mdash;</P>
    <P>It would be intolerable if farmers were to be allowed to opt out of paying these levies also.</P>
    <P>I am not a zealot for these levies, never have been, particularly the income levy. I argued against them from the very beginning, arguing that they constituted another way of getting more tax and imposing a penalty on the worker, the farmer or anybody else liable to them. That said, as long as they remain &mdash; and I hope that will not be too long &mdash; then the Congress of Trade Unions are quite right to maintain that in order, to apply them equally farmers as to others of course one would have to have details of their income.  If all farmers below the level of the 80 adjusted acres are to pay on this flat rate basis of £10 &mdash; now mentioned for the first time at least in this House &mdash; then there is no basis on which these proposals of this Government can <Col N="2278" /> be implemented.  Perhaps the Minister would care to reconsider the position in relation to that?  Or will we have another notional determination of income which will then impose a 2 per cent levy on a notional income?  I wonder who will do that?  Will it be the same boys who come out to look at the quality of the soil, the prevailing climate, aspect, shelter and so on?  Will they arrive at a notional income as well in order to determine the levy? The Minister might consider answering that one for us.  The Congress of Trade Unions, in this very considered statement, have pointed out the anomaly there.  Incidentally, those income levies will yield over £130 million this year. Therefore it is correct that it should be pointed out by the Congress of Trade Unions that farm income will not be able to be determined for levy purposes.</P>
    <P>Congress go on to say that:</P>
    <P>The campaign for tax equity to which it is committed, will be maintained and that it will not accept the exclusion of any section of the income-earning community from a liability to pay tax on income.</P>
    <P>That is something we should all support.</P>
    <P>This is the only way that greater tax equity can be secured.  If the Government persists in its proposal to exempt 90 per cent of farmers from income tax, it will stand condemned in the eyes of PAYE workers who have sought over many years to achieve reform of the tax system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance indicated that farm tax paid will be allowed as an offset to the income tax payable by farmers with over 80 &ldquo;adjusted&rdquo; acres. This is unacceptable.  The tax should be allowed as an expense as is the case with rates paid by other business enterprises and not as an offset against tax.</P>
    <P>What is now happening is that complications and unnecessary new adjustments would have to be introduced and they would be so complicated that the already over-complicated tax system could not <Col N="2279" /> possibly work.  Under Government proposals they come up with some specific examples for taxing farmers.  A farmer with 75 adjusted acres with an income of £10,000 would pay a maximum of £750 in direct tax or 7.5 per cent of total income. A single worker, taxed under the PAYE system with an income of £10,000 has a tax liability of £2,900, or 29 per cent of his or her income, while a married couple with two children with one spouse earning with a similar income would have a tax liability of £1,800 or 18 per cent of income.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister explain to the Congress of Trade Unions, to the farmers and to me on what basis the Government can call that tax equity?  The Congress have pointed out what this proposal would mean and are pointing out that it is unfair and totally unacceptable.  The only people who suggest that this is fair are this Government even if it means repudiating everything they have said in the last couple of years.  They now come up with a notion that it is fair because the small weak tail of the Labour Party seems to have said at some stage that this must be done.  We all have to pay the consequences for it.  Then they go on to say that a farmer with under 20 adjusted acres with an income of £4,000 a year will pay no tax whereas a single person on the PAYE system with the same income is liable to £380 a year tax or 10 per cent of his income.  Not surprisingly Congress are seeking a meeting with the Government to discuss their proposals on taxation and farming.  Congress will insist that farm income will continue to be assessed for income tax and the tax to be regarded only as a replacement for rates.  What will happen when Congress meet the Government and make a strong and valid point? Will the Government make some concession? Will they concede to the logic of the Congress argument?  The Government are then to have discussions with the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  Will the Government make some concessions to their proposals?  If the Government make some concessions <Col N="2280" /> to them what will happen to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?  The position of the IFA has been clear from the beginning. They want tax on the basis of income.  If further changes arise the Government will only further antagonise every section of the community.  That will create an unique record for the Government. We will have unity in dissension. Everyone will be utterly opposed to this nonsense.  The Government must recognise that to persist is very foolish not just in the interest of their political survival but in the interests of the nation and trying to reduce the tensions.</P>
    <P>I will consider what effects this nonsense, if applied, would have.  The first thing we have to do is to have the determination of the amount of adjusted acreage.  The Minister said this morning that there will be no adjustment until such time as every farm unit has had its acreage adjusted under the regulations in this proposal.  The Minister says that the classification will start as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted and will take some years to complete, that it will start in each county with the bigger farms and will work its way downwards until all farms of 20 adjusted acres or more have been classified.  Do the Minister and the Government not recognise that if that is to be the basis they will still be at it well into the year 2000?  There will not be a question of getting all these farms adjusted on the basis of what the Government have put into the legislation in section 2, which required adjusting on this basis.  They will still be going out adjusting acres for the first time by the year 2000.  The law relating to adjusted acres is set out in some detail in section 2 (2) where it says:</P>
    <P>(2)  In estimating, for the purposes of this section, the capacity for agricultural production of land in any place&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  regard shall be had to&mdash;</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will have regard to the fact that when that is determined by a judge there is no room for discretion. It will have to be shown that each and every one of these criteria will have been <Col N="2281" /> considered.  A judge will have to ask was every use to which the land could be put for the purpose of agriculture considered, in relation to each acre of each farm.  The judge will have to ask was there regard to the adequacy of the means of access to the land, to the nature and quality of the soil and so on.  All these questions must be answered in respect of every acre of every farm.  The judge must ask about</P>
    <P> (I)  the nature and quality of the soil,</P>
    <P>(II)  the location and climate of the place,</P>
    <P>(III)  whether the land is flat or sloping and, if it is sloping, the direction and the degree of the slope,</P>
    <P>We are letting ourselves in for something now.  I know the mountain territory of north Tipperary and the flatlands of Wexford. They will have to go out with their measuring tapes to determine the degree of the slopes.  I have not dreamed this up. The Government are insisting on it.  The judge must also inquire as to</P>
    <P>(IV)  whether the land is sheltered</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;sheltered&rdquo; mean?  Does it refer to trees or ditches or sheds?</P>
    <P>and whether the land is overlooked by hills or mountains,</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Some of the best land in Tipperary is overlooked by hills and mountains.  Will that put them in a better or a worse category?  It shall be taken into account in law when the adjusted acreage is being determined as will:</P>
    <P>(V)  the structure of the agricultural land holding of which the land forms part,</P>
    <P>(VI)  the natural drainage of the land and any arterial, local or other drainage affecting the land and provided by a State authority... or a local authority,</P>
    <P>I am becoming tired reading this thing, but by the time the poor unfortunate adjuster comes out with his measuring tape and all of his soil tests and climatic <Col N="2282" /> tests, his barometer and thermometer, and by the time the farmer has finished looking at him and dealing with him, what then?  The next provision is:</P>
    <P>(VII)  the adequacy of the natural water supply to the land, and</P>
    <P>(VIII)  the accessibility of the land to, and its capacity to support, farm machinery and farm stock and to resist damage to it by farm machinery and farm stock,</P>
    <P>This is getting into could-cuckoo-land. The Bill states after all those things:</P>
    <P>(b)  it shall be assumed that the land has been, is being and will continue to be farmed, and that the land and the business of farming the land, has been, is being and will continue to be, managed reasonably and reasonably efficiently,</P>
    <P>What in hell's blazes can be the consequences of all that?  We are working first of all on the obligations to check on any of eight, nine or ten fundamental conditions and now we turn from obligations to assumptions which are really the basis for no law and certainly for no tax law.  It goes on and on.  I am becoming tired of pointing out the anomalies in this and I can imagine the effect it will have.  We will be dealing with the anomalies on Committee Stage.  We will deal with this in such detail on Committee Stage as to expose the total nonsense involved.  The Bill continues:</P>
    <P>(c)  (i) if investment in the land is at a level that is higher than a reasonable level for land generally or falls short of such a level, any capacity of the land for agricultural production, or any lack of such capacity in the land, that is attributable to the part of such investment that is higher than such reasonable level as aforesaid, or, as the case may be, to the short-fall shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have ever seen such a load of nonsense introducing any legislation.  I do not want to say that our parliamentary draftsmen are entirely dependent on <Col N="2283" /> legislation and legislative draft as in the Statute Book in England, but when we introduce similar laws here we generally tend to use the same jargon.  However, because there is no similar law in Britain or elsewhere for once we have had to try to do it ourselves.  I sympathise only with the parliamentary draftsman who had to put that into legislation which means nothing to me and will mean less to a court and, no matter what the Minister tries to say.  I guarantee that if this nonsense gets through it will not even be able to be interpreted, much less applied in our courts.  The Bill continues:</P>
    <P>(ii) In subparagraph (i) of this paragraph &ldquo;investment&rdquo;, in relation to land, means investment in the land in respect of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Here we go again with a definition of what investment is:</P>
    <P> (I)  the application of fertilisers or other substances for improving the land for agricultural use,</P>
    <P>(II)  the levelling and general reclamation of the land,</P>
    <P>(III)  the clearance of boulders, stones, trees, weeds, gorse or other unwanted vegetation from the land,</P>
    <P>(IV)  the provision and maintenance of a supply of water and of drains and ditches for the land,</P>
    <P>(V)  the cutting of hedges on, and the provision and maintenance and shelter for, the land,</P>
    <P>(VI)  the construction and maintenance of farm buildings, yards, slurry or silage pits and roadways on the land, or</P>
    <P>(VII)  the provision of machines (including farm machinery) for use on the land,</P>
    <P>or in respect of other similar matters. </P>
    <P>Look at the end of it.  What in the name of blazes is meant by &ldquo;other similar matters&rdquo; in respect of these things, in respect of investment to the land?  No court could possibly begin to interpret it with any <Col N="2284" /> degree of confidence, and much less the farmer who has to begin to understand, and he is entitled to understand, the basis on which he is going to pay this tax.  What liability to tax is he going to have as a consequence of all of this if it is introduced? I can say with some degree of experience in the law that if this gets through &mdash; it will not &mdash; it will be a lawyers' bonanza.  It has to be.  I can imagine any first year barrister looking at this and saying, &ldquo;This is my meat&rdquo; because the law says, &ldquo;You shall have regard to all these things&rdquo;.  Every adjuster inspector who comes into court will be cross-examined at great length on each and every one of these things.  It does not say any one of them; it says the lot of them.  He will be cross-examined at great length on all this business about investment and the nature of similar investments and in respect of any of the other matters.  If we have money to spend we can spend it better than on having all these things dragged through the courts. The legal profession are doing well enough already, having regard to the tensions that arise in other sectors of the economy and the fact that so many people are being pursued in terms of their incapacity to pay and their obligations either in commerce or in other contracts that result in the huge growth of law cases going through the courts.  It is remarkable that when things are going badly in the country litigation soars.  One thing we do not need is to have people who want to have no recourse to the courts, namely the farmers, being dragged in on this basis to prove that they have no liability to tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the classification will start as soon as possible after the Bill is enacted and will take some years to complete.  The Minister had better come clean now to whomever this Bill is meant to appease and admit that whatever tax is to come from this farm tax proposal will not begin to emerge for at least five to ten years.  How can it?  Start with the top fellows.  All right, someone at the top will surface in the first year or two, but we are talking about tax liability on all the farming sector.  There is no point <Col N="2285" /> in fooling ourselves that 200 people who are going to be transferred from the apparently defunct Land Commission can do this job within those years, having regard to the obligations the Minister is setting down for them in this legislation. I hate to see legislation introduced here on such a notional basis.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Yates, or any of their colleagues to let us have their comments on it and see whether they believe that this can be done.  If it is not done who will be blamed?  It will not be the Government or at least that is not what they would want.  Blame the farmers again for not paying tax when this nonsense cannot be got under way; then you create more tensions, just the opposite of what we want to do.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not recognise that for as long as we do not provide adequate inspector resources within the income tax system, that failure on the part of the Government is attributable as blame to farmers and causing divisions we do not want?  As long as this inoperable legislation will not be operated that failure too will probably be attributable to the farmers, which is totally and utterly unfair. If a farmer reasonably and properly goes through the motions, which are available to him here by way of appeal either through what is called the farm commissioner or the farm tax tribunal, that will be seen or interpreted in some cases as an attempt by him to avoid tax liability.  He is perfectly entitled, as anyone else would be, to question the nonsense on which this is based &mdash; soil, climatic conditions, slope, aspect, overview and underview from mountains or whatever else.  Not only the Minister for the Environment but the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance should recognise that this is utterly impossible to implement.</P>
    <P>I want to state also what is very obvious at this stage.  I have only mentioned it so far in passing.  Can any person on the other side of the House, before we finish Second Stage of this Bill, justify the fact that the single farmer with 45 adjusted acres will be liable for the same level of <Col N="2286" /> tax as the married farmer with 45 adjusted acres and five, four or three dependent children?  Will somebody from the other side of the House come in and say: &ldquo;that is right and by God we will do it, because we believe that is fair play and justice&rdquo;.  If anybody can come in here and say that, we will at least begin to consider that the Government may have some notion that is how things should be done. It is time for some Minister to come in and say: &ldquo;We know it is unfair.  Let us be honest about it, we know it is not based on any notion of equity or on notional income, we do not care if it is a 60 year old single farmer with no dependants or a 35 year old married farmer with five dependants, we will impose the same tax&rdquo;.  Would the Government at least be honest enough to say that.</P>
    <P>People cannot understand how a proposal is introduced which repudiates any basis of fair play between people like that.  I note this morning that a new position is arising and it comes very clear from the Minister.  Hardship can arise from a variety of factors and ill health is the obvious one, particularly of the farm manager, the owner or his family.  It can arise from farm disease where the actual income is reduced as a consequence of the hardship.  When it arise the Government will be a little bit reasonable.  The Minister said this morning:</P>
    <P>We of course recognise that there will be circumstances where payment of the farm tax would cause undue hardship and the Bill provides that the local authority can agree in these circumstances to postpone action to collect the tax for a specified period.</P>
    <P>Where did we hear that before?  Is this not the same Minister who told the local authorities to be very careful in the way they actually imposed the water charges? He left it to the local authorities to exercise their discretion.  He told them to be careful, not cause unnecessary tension, not do anything that would upset the people, get the water charges but do it in a nice gentle way.</P>
    <P>Here the same Minister is passing the buck on to them again.  He said they will <Col N="2287" /> be told to collect the tax for a specified period.  He said that during any such period interest will not accrue to the outstanding amount.  The local authorities will be the people who will have this discretion.  Then comes the sting.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I have to stress, however, that the tax remains due and will indeed be a charge on the land until it is paid.</P>
    <P>There can be many families who for three or four years suffer a loss of income because of the effect of farm disease and they find they cannot meet it.  They find that farm enterprise has been so badly affected that eventually they have to sell out and move to something else.  They transfer to somebody else.  What happens then?  Along comes some young man who will take a chance and try to develop the whole thing on a different basis, perhaps change the nature of the farm production. He will know there was hardship in that place for four or five years.  Now, according to the Minister the tax remains due and will be a charge on the land until it is paid.  I did not know that land paid income tax, I thought it was people who paid it.  There will now be a charge on land.  If ever there was hardship which was not finally disposed of by way of payment it will now remain as a charge on those who might take over that land either by transfer or otherwise.  That is utter nonsense.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out some other anomalies in this area which will give rise to increasing costs, particularly legal costs, and will ensure that farm mobillity, which is so vitally important, will be obstructed.  A new proposal is being introduced to keep a register in local authorities.  Every person will have to notify the relevant local authority of any transfer in land from now on; otherwise it will be an offence by fine mentioned in the Bill.  That will mean that any person who wants to buy land from Deputy Yates, for instance, who will have a fair bit to sell, or from somebody who will have a small amount to sell like Deputy Blaney in Donegal will not only have to check with the people from whom he is <Col N="2288" /> buying what is the situation but that there are charges on the land and all the usual legal requirements which have to be complied with and he will also have to find out from the relevant local authority if a notification was given to them at any time in 1985, 1986 or 1987 that any part of the particular land was disposed of.  The local authorities will have to keep a register of this.  We all know that this will be the beginning of another nonsense.  Local authorities have more to do if they are given their heads in terms of development than to be dealing with the title of land and keeping a register of all the land that has been disposed of either in full, in part or subdivisions.  The Government must clearly recognise that this proposal involves a consequence which will place a very heavy burden on farmers and on everyone else except lawyers.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the provisions the Minister referred to this morning. He stated:</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Bill are no more severe than other tax legislation and I make no apology for including them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>When I hear the phrase: &ldquo;I make no apology&rdquo; I feel this is a brave man.  Before the Minister starts making no apology he had better correct his information.  The provisions in this Bill are not the same and are more severe in that respect in terms of the provision of allowing access for the purposes of classifying land than anything which exists in other legislation. I want to quote what the Minister said and then I will demonstrate where he is wrong.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Commissioner's staff will have the right, under section 17 of the Bill to enter on land and to receive a reasonable level of co-operation from the farmer for the purposes of classifying land or dealing with appeals.  There are penalties of a fine of £1,000 and up to one year's imprisonment for obstructing the classification process and the Bill also contains provisions designed to enable the classification process to overcome any obstruction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> The Minister says that is the same as anywhere else.  Clearly it is not the same. There is no provision in relation to corporation tax or tax on the income of the self-employed or professional sector whereby for the purpose of establishing the tax liability an inspector is allowed to enter property, examine the productive unit, the machines, the employees and their skills or the shop shelves.  Yet such a provision is being introduced here.  It is nonsense for the Minister to say that these provisions are the same as applied to others.  To inspect records or ask for information is one thing but to inspect total property for the purpose of assessing tax liability is something quite different. Farmers can justly say that they are being discriminated against and not being treated on the same basis as others.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will go through each section in great detail.  My speech has not been nearly as long as it might have been since I picked on only a few points.  This legislation if passed would succeed in damaging not only the interests of agriculture but the whole economy.  This is a time when we need a new degree of understanding and sense of common purpose between primary producers and the workers in every sector.  When we lift this nation again the basis of that leap forward will be the development of agriculture and the agri-food industry, with the employment that follows from it.  You and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, know this from our own place.  We know the number of people in the creameries, the meat factories and the shops who are totally dependent on the farming sector as the primary producers.  It is about time we recognised that this is the only basis for moving forward.</P>
    <P>The Government should concern themselves with a real programme for the development of this essential national asset in terms of training, education and marketing.  The Minister for Finance provided a miserable pittance of £250,000 for agricultural marketing out of a total of £9,000 million.  If we had the wit to exploit the markets which are available <Col N="2290" /> the farmers would produce to supply those markets and the PAYE worker would benefit in the process.  This would lead to that sense of cohesion which is long overdue and which could bring us into a new era.  Nobody outside will solve our internal problems.  The Canadians, the Japanese and the Americans clearly will not do it.  With them it is a case of come day, go day.  Those who have the real commitment are those who have been here from the start &mdash; the farmers and the workers.  I look forward to a day when we will have common marches in Dublin with PAYE workers, the ICTU and farmers joining hand in hand to tell the Government that this nonsense will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will see the light and withdraw this Bill before it reaches Committee Stage.  If not, tensions will be caused which will damage all sectors of the economy.  I hope I will not be addressing myself to this nonsense on Committee Stage, that the Government will get sense and that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture will inform us to that effect, letting the Minister for the Environment deal with matters appropriate to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened attentively to Deputy O'Kennedy and I was very impressed with his ballerina act when it came to the ICTU statement because it showed the supreme dishonesty of Fianna Fáil on this issue.  They want to have an each way bet.  I have no doubts from reading the same ICTU statement that they are not satisfied with the tax yield of farmers, not satisfied that a credit will be issued to farmers having over 80 adjusted acres for this land tax payment and not satisfied that 92 per cent of farmers would be exempt from income tax.  Deputy O'Kennedy failed to say whether he was satisfied with the tax yield of farmers, whether they should pay more or not. That basic dishonesty can give farmers no confidence whatsoever in Fianna Fáil's false and hollow utterances about repealing this Bill.  There is no respite for farmers in what Deputy O'Kennedy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole purpose of this measure <Col N="2291" /> must be to increase the tax yield of farmers but Deputy O'Kennedy did not say whether he was in favour or not.  He did not address the ICTU comment.  That sort of hypocrisy and dishonesty is camouflaging the ICTU statement as sympathy for farmers when the truth is that there are very few Deputies who are genuinely concerned in honestly representing farmers.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Wexford I represent farmers and I do not need to be told by any farming organisation whether I represent farmers.  I see it as my job to do so in the best way I can.  If there is heat in the kitchen on this issue, Wexford is right beside the stove.  It was there that the litigation on the PLV system was initiated and I as a farmer contributed to the fund to abolish the PLV system because of the gross inequities in it.  I could have had four acres of land which carried a £1 valuation and a similar one acre which carried a valuation of £1.20p. The basic injustice and inequity was rightly repealed.  It must be remembered that 10 per cent of all agricultural borrowings are in Wexford.  It is probably the most productive and intensive sector.  I estimate that in County Wexford 7.5 jobs in every ten are dependent on agriculture, whether they are in Albatros Fertilisers, or Waterford Creamery, producing &ldquo;Yoplait&rdquo; and many other products.  I do not need to be reminded of the importance of agriculture and I do not need to be told about farmers' views in this regard.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council were very prudent, and they had a balance of £1 million prior to 1977.  Today they have a deficit varying between £2 million and £3 million.  No public lights have been erected in County Wexford off national primary routes, no services have been provided and there are no new roads. The resurfacing programme of 14 years has now increased to 35 years because there is no money.  The property tax paid in the form of rates has resulted in local authorities being starved of finance.</P>
    <P>I am not in anyone's pocket.  I am not afraid of the IFA and I will take them on <Col N="2292" /> in any election.  But there are aspects of this Bill which need to be looked at very closely.  The history of farm taxation has been a nightmare for politicians and farmers but it must be said that the farming sector are the only group who refuse to pay tax.  In my work on the Joint Committee on Small Businesses I have seen representatives from the motor industry, the SIMI, hoteliers, publicans and the electrical trade who were devastated by high VAT and other impositions.  They complained and said that they would vote against us, but they never refused to pay tax.</P>
    <P>There has been a litany of taxes &mdash; the 2 per cent levy, wealth tax, resource tax and rates &mdash; which farmers have refused to pay; and, while they are perfectly entitled to go to the courts on any issue and to lobby and complain about any unfair treatment, they must realise that every time they refuse to pay any tax, they are cutting a stick with which to beat themselves because, although they may win the battle on this issue, they will not win the war on public relations with the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>Politicians may come and go, but Governments are elected by the people. Unfortunately, too many urban people are under the wrong impression that there is a crock of gold in the agricultural community to be taxed and that is the basis of misinformation on which the urban-rural rift has evolved.  That misinformation is fuelled by farmers who appear to be unreasonable.  It is in the interests of farmers and their representatives to be seen to be reasonable.  I should like to think, whatever the outcome of the Bill, that once and for all, we may reach a situation which exists in France, Germany and the United Kingdom whereby they stick with their systems so that farmers can get on with the job and politicians can get on with their other duties.  This is such a sensitive and difficult area that we are all being distracted from the many other problems in the agricultural and other sectors.</P>
    <P>Any farm tax system will be criticised on either of two grounds.  If you make it an actual system, it will be criticised on <Col N="2293" /> the grounds that it is a disincentive, as has happened in the case of the current account system.  The argument is that the harder you work, the more you earn, the more you invest and the greater the return, the more tax you pay.  Of course there is a disincentive in that regard and I have met many farmers, especially in the dairy sector, who say that this system is a disincentive.</P>
    <P>The other factor is that somewhere between £12 million and £17 million is being paid in some instances by farmers to prove that they have no tax liability. Some farmers have said to me that they would rather give some money to the Government than pay an accountant.  In the first year, the accountant's fees of £300 are reasonable but many farmers in the tax net now find that the bill has gone to £600 or £700.  There are two contradictory systems.  A national system does not take account of ability to pay and the actual system has a disincentive effect.  No matter what system the Government introduces, they cannot win.</P>
    <P>There are two types of farms &mdash; business and subsistence.  Basically, the larger farmer runs his farm as a business.  He seeks to invest and develop and to get a return, whereas a man with six children on 30 acres is merely ekeing out a living. In the west, because of the farmers' dole, the policy is to keep them on the land, although there are difficulties in that regard.  Is the system of 80 adjusted acres fair?  When it is over 80 acres, is it a business and, under 80 acres, is it subsistence? Should there be a notional system beneath that and a factual system above it.</P>
    <P>It must also be said that the timing of this Bill is not good.  From 1979-81 farmers' income dropped by half.  Since then, there has been a slow but gradual recovery in real and nominal terms.  This year, with the price of cattle and sheep, the cut in grain prices and the increase in the price of fertilisers, it is obvious that the price squeeze is coming back.  In the more profitable areas of milk and beef, there are great confines on production in one from of quota or another.  Therefore, <Col N="2294" /> in many instances this impositions on farmers comes at a time when their incomes are depressed.  The outlook is not good either, which makes it even more unpalatable for farmers.</P>
    <P>However, they must realise that politicians have to talk to everybody, and I should like to give a few examples of where I find it difficult to sustain the current position for farmers.  According to AFT figures, agriculture incomes for last year amounted to somewhere around £800 billion or £900 billion and the total net receipt of income tax from farmers was about 5 per cent.  That is in contrast with people working in Enniscorthy who pay 24 per cent of their income in tax, which is very unfair.  They say to me that that is unfair.  I fully acknowledge that the income-labour unit on farms, because of farm sizes and so on, could be as low as £3,900 and the discrepancy between 24 per cent and 5 per cent may not tell the full story.  However, it is very hard to convince people of that.  We must remember that we are a very jealous people and a begrudging type of nation. In my canvass in the local election campaign I found that the people who were working in one house were very jealous of those next door who were on social welfare because they did not get a medical card or had to pay higher rent.  The same applies between urban and rural people.  Farmers must have an understanding of that position.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses I have no doubt that the heaviest tax paying community are those involved in small businesses.  They pay rates on their business regardless of whether they have a profit or loss.  Deputy O'Kennedy said that no other sector were treated in the way those caught under the Bill would be, but in my view that is not correct. Some of the specific points he made may be correct, but in general business rates, are just as unfair and do not bear any relation to anything other than the property value.  A garage proprietor last week had his PLV trebled and there was little he could do about it under the appeal procedure.  Politicians must explain <Col N="2295" /> equity to those involved in small businesses.</P>
    <P>I had a more difficult case to deal with in the course of my canvass.  I met a farm labourer whose gross pay was £94 per week and I found it impossible to explain to him why he should pay tax while his employer did not.  I am not saying farmers should be singled out for special treatment and I will outline later cases where they are being ill-treated in this regard. However, farmers, and their organisations, must have sensitivity to other people in the community.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said, we are the highest taxed community in the 22 OECD countries. Everybody is crippled with tax, but the problem is that the politicians do not have the guts to cut public spending.  In the context of very high taxation farmers must be sensitive to what other people have to pay and the type of burdens they have to carry.  They must also be sensitive to the fact that, for every pound of all tax we take in, we spend £1.20.</P>
    <P>The urban communities, and those involved in small businesses, must realise that farmers have to endure circumstances that no other sector face.  No other sector is subject to climatic conditions like farmers or to the ravages of things like brucellosis which can overnight destroy small dairy farmers.  Those farmers may have their farmes locked up for years and do not get adequate compensation. Last year I bought a number of lambs in the springtime at £38 per head, the same price that I paid the year before.  I sold them the following spring and I averaged £52 per head although in the spring of 1984 I averaged £76 per head.  There is not anything farmers can do about that.  They cannot diversify into a fish and chip business.  They do not have any control over their income because they are a primary producer.  The price lead system is EC operated primarily and farmers here do not have any discretion about the level of price they can demand for their output.  That must be realised in the overall urban-rural rift.</P>
    <P>If we examine the taxation system of farmers in other countries &mdash; I am thinking <Col N="2296" /> of the German and French systems &mdash; we will see that there is ample precedent for a two-tier system of taxation such as we are proposing.  In other countries the lower half is based on turnover. If a farmer is beneath a certain turnover he pays tax on a notional system and if he is over it he pays it on accounts with a credit.  While there may be aspects of the Bill that farmers do not like, there is a long-term benefit in it in terms of farmer taxation policy for realising the difference between subsistence and business type farmers and operating on some form of notional basis to overcome the difficulties of smaller farms.</P>
    <P>The principle of the farm tax is a replacement for the rates.  The adjusted acre is a replacement for the PLV.  I do not think anybody can dispute that. However, farmers have forgotten that there are advantages as opposed to the rates position.  Farmers under 80 acres will get some exemption and farmers under 20 acres will be totally exempt. The inequities of the PLV system are completely removed.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to section 2, which deals with points about access, shelter, drainage and so on.  I am not a lawyer but I am glad to see those points included.  I would hate a slipshod system under which farmers would not have a case.  Deputy O'Kennedy is not doing farmers any service in saying that this is so detailed that one could not make any sense of it.  The effort is to be as generous as possible to get all the ameliorating factors for farmers into this so that the tax will be on a fair basis, that the acre is a fair acre, and, I hope, a generous one.</P>
    <P>Last September the three Fine Gael TDs in Wexford issued a statement, which was much maligned in Fine Gael and other places, expressing our anxiety and fear about the proposed land tax.  At that stage the Bill had not been published and we were not aware of the details of the national plan.  I can recall at our meeting with the county executive of the IFA making it clear that we saw it as our role in signing the party pledge to vote for whatever the Government decided on and we pointed out that we saw it as <Col N="2297" /> our role to represent farmers at party meetings.  Since then in our discussions with many Minister we operated on the basis of getting the best possible deal, but the major issue on which we unreservedly spoke against was that we did not want double taxation.  Deputy O'Kennedy this morning ignored the fact that the ICTU required double taxation, the paying of the farm tax, no credit over 80 acres and no exemption under 80 acres from income tax accounts.  That was the point we felt was unfair.  As in a lot of cases, eaten bread is soon forgotten.  It must be realised that that is not proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The subsequent stance of the IFA was regrettable.  Many of my friends lost their council seats last week although they were not responsible for the land tax.  I do not mind if the Front Bench of Fine Gael suffer, because if they decide that the Government should take a certain course of action at a general election they will sink or swim on that issue.  It was very unfair that councillors who would be very vocal on behalf of the IFA position within Fine Gael should be decimated in the local elections last week.  Over the years the IFA have been given a reasonably good service by Fine Gael, but that organisation has done severe damage to our party.  It was very unfair of them. TDs will survice because they have a personal vote, but those who suffered last week were innocent victims.  There is fault on the Government's side for the way this was handled just prior to the local elections, but the way the issue exploded was not helpful to the Fine Gael Party.  The bullying and intransigence of the IFA was verging on the undemocratic. Certainly, it gave little recognition for the work and service some people have given to the IFA on issues such as taxation, disease eradication grants or social welfare payments.  Eaten bread was very soon forgotten.</P>
    <P>I will be explicit about my position on the Bill so that there will be no misunderstanding. I represent the farmers of County Wexford and I will support this Bill but amendments must be made because <Col N="2298" /> there are inequities in this legislation.  I hope the Government will realise that while there may be no political losses or gains in Dublin city in this Bill, politics will stretch into the rural areas and rural TDs will have to bear the brunt of it.  It is not only for political reasons that I ask that amendment be made but in the interests of justice and equity.</P>
    <P>My first amendment would be that the rate of tax be linked to an index of agricultural incomes as laid down by either the Central Statistics Office or An Foras Talúntais.  The Government have consistently said this tax will be linked to the tax requirement of the day.  The Minister for Finance told me that could be to the benefit of farmers.  It has been said in the national plan that tax levels in the economy will be held at 36 per cent of GNP and if there is a reduction farmers will benefit.  Frankly, I and the farmers would be prepared to take our chances on being linked to increases and decreases and to cut out the tax requirement because the fear is that, as with all taxes, they are only going one way and that is up.  I hope this amendment can be included on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My second amendment, which is a major departure from what is in the Bill, relates to severe hardship.  I have given a lot of thought to this.  I meet many farmers who are suffering great hardship.  A farmer could owe £70,000 on 50 acres of land; I know people who owe £45,000 on 36 acres.  They are in receipt of home assistance from the South-Eastern Health Board.  I know another who owes £500,000, but I will not go into detail on how he got into these difficulties; I know people with large families who are surviving on very small holdings and I also know widows who have set their lands but are not getting a great deal of money because in areas along the coast the value of land is not high and the most a person can get for setting is £50 a year.  Many people are developing their farms, and there are many other hardship cases &mdash; some with money problems, some with family problems and others with developmental problems.  It will be almost impossible to adjudicate on who is worst off, <Col N="2299" /> someone who owes £1,000 an acre or somebody who lost six out of 26 cows through brucellosis.</P>
    <P>In my opinion these difficulties can be got over by one simple mechanism.  The Minister should include a hardship clause in this Bill and if a farmer could prove he had a nil income tax liability, he would not have to pay farm tax in that year. That nil income tax liability would only arise if a farmer satisfied the inspector of taxes that he did not have a taxable income because of hardship.  This is the fairest system because it is related to the tax code.  It is simple, it is fair and it is seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>Over the years considerable friction has been caused in County Wexford by the poor law valuation system.  I would not have confidence in discretion being left to the county manager.  I have the highest respect for the Wexford County Manager, but it might not be realised in the Custom House the difficulty that has arisen in my county because all the litigation was based on Wexford cases.  If the adjudication of hardship is left to officials in the county hall, this will lead to great difficulties.  This adjudication must be fair and must be seen to be fair.  If a farmer can prove to an inspector of taxes that he did not have a tax liability on hardship grounds, I do not see why he should have to pay tax under this Bill.  I beseech the Minister to investigate this possibility.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a most insensitive section and caused acute political difficulties in the local elections.  This relates to the display in the Garda station of the adjusted acreage of farmers and nonpayment of the land tax.  I do not know why a Garda station was picked, or whether it is coincidental that in my constituency many claims for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are made through Garda stations since there are only four major employment exchanges in the county.  This is the wrong way to go about selling this Bill.</P>
    <P>If I have 100 acres and it has been adjusted down to 70 acres and another farmer has 100 acres which has been <Col N="2300" /> adjusted down to 60 acres, then I should know about that because if I am appealing my case I can refer to your land, as business people do under the current PLV system.  I hope this section can be amended so that the adjustment of the land can be available &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;available&rdquo; as opposed to displayed &mdash; in a valuation office in the valuation hall so that farmers about their business can make comparisons.  I do not want this section to pass as it is worded because in my view it criminalises farmers by displaying this information in Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I have had great difficulty trying to explain something about which there should be no difficulty, and that relates to the full credit of land tax payments to local authorities for farmers with over 80 adjusted acres.  Over the years it has been stated that full credit will be given but farmers seem to doubt that this will happen.  This case only needs clarification and I hope that and the 80 acre threshold will be cemented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another amendment I would like to see made in the Bill &mdash; there has been some confusion about this &mdash; is where holdings are split between father and son or favoured nephew or niece that they would be treated as separate holdings. At present we have an incentive through the suspension of stamp duty collection for farmers who transfer land to full-time farmers who are under 35 years of age and who have some agricultural qualification. This Government have said by continuing this measure each year, that our priority is to get more land into younger hands, but the opposite will be the case if we include the words &ldquo;genuine transfers of land to the younger generation&rdquo;. The traditional position is what is mine is mine, what is my father's is his and what is my son's is his.  People who have already made transfers should be treated as having individual holdings with individual tax liabilities.  I hope that in a few years' time there will not be an argument as to what was a genuine transfer to a son and what was not, or what was a tax evasion measure or a genuine land transfer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> The other amendment I should like to see relates to the adjustment of land procedure.  Much of this adjustment procedure will be subjective.  There are so many factors to take into account that it will be a matter of opinion as to what is the best acre of land and so on.  There is also the question of a time delay.  My understanding from the Government was that the Land Commission had already, through their workings over the years, developed a procedure which had been accepted by the High Court for arriving at one adjusted acre.  In other words, five acres of bog were worth one adjusted acre, as were ten acres of mountain &mdash; and one excludes roadways and ditches. I am not sure about the position and perhaps that could be clarified.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the profile system has not worked.  That is not good enough.  Surely that matter is within the domain of the Government.  I accept that it is not the farmers' fault.  What really irks me is that I can go to farmers who have 67 adjusted acres and who are going to pay less tax under this legislation and they are complaining bitterly.  The propaganda campaign is such that it has convinced people who would be better off under it that they should be so hostile to this Bill.  Part of the reason for that is that many farmers with under 80 adjusted acres have never seen a taxman in their lives and would freely admit that.  They have never seen a profile from.  It is not altogether their fault that they have not. It is not good enough that those forms were not sent out to farmers.  They were prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>If farmers who had been sent out tax assessments for £6,000 or £7,000 &mdash; because the way it is done is that one thinks of a number and trebles it &mdash; they would welcome this Bill wholeheartedly. However, by virtue of the fact that they have never seen a taxman, it is a case of the devil they never knew compared with the devil they now see coming in the form of this land tax.  It may mean that what the IFA did to Richie Ryan in the seventies could be the case in 1985 or 1987.  Many farmers would be delighted with this. Many members of farming organisations <Col N="2302" /> who are now upset with the legislation may be quite pleased in the fullness of time.  We cannot overlook that.  It is unforgivable that farmers are basing their comments and reaction to this legislation on ignorance of the fact that they were liable for income tax since 1983, but by virtue of the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have failed abysmally to get their act together this has not been collected. I am not saying that farmers should be victimised.  What I am saying is that this system should at least be tried. If it had been made to work, the whole reception of this Bill could have been different.</P>
    <P>It must be stated that there are benefits to this Land Tax Bill.  Naturally, if one is fighting tooth and nail to pressurise the Government into not proceeding with it, one would not stress these points; but they should be made.  The current receipts of income tax from farmers are of the order of £35 million.  One of the ways in which farmers have avoided paying tax is by claiming capital allowances.  These have been limited to 30 per cent, which is unfair relative to manufacturing industry, but to some extent if I build a shed, drain land, or buy a tractor, I can write off 30 per cent of that amount in one year against income tax &mdash; but I can only write it off so many times.  Therefore, the income tax yield from farmers is depressed by virtue of the state of farm development. There is a set of figures which suggest that if farm incomes were to continue on the growth ratio for, say, 1982, 1983 and 1984, the income tax yield from farmers in the 1986 and 1987 tax years would be of the order of £86 million because it has worked its way through the system.</P>
    <P>In many cases there would be obvious benefits for many farmers in this land tax, by virtue of simple arithmetic.  There are also benefits accruing from the fact that farmers to some extent, especially in the more rural areas, are cute, cautious people, and they worry.  What they hate is not knowing where they stand and to some extent with this land tax, although it is notional, at the beginning of the year they will know their liability and can plan <Col N="2303" /> accordingly.  I do not accept that that is such an unreasonable imposition.  That is the way farmers have always worked with rates.  That must be seen as a benefit, as well as the fact that £12 million to £17 million will be saved &mdash; not all of it for those farmers over 80 adjusted acres-because they do not have to go to an accountant.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the 20 acre threshold beneath which there will be no tax liability is most reasonable.  It must be realised that farmers enjoy public services as much as anybody else.  Their children go to school and get hospital treatment, they drive on the same roads and benefit from the same public lighting, and the best of good luck to them.  I would not hold that against them for one minute.  But the point I am making is that the great problem facing this whole country is that we must pay for our services. Unfortunately, Fine Gael and Labour are the only parties prepared to tell the people that and they are getting mighty little thanks for doing so.  One of the benefits of this land tax is that at least the proceeds will go to local authorities. There is no doubt that local authorities have to be restructured in terms of finance.  That is a very positive benefit.</P>
    <P>A point has been made about a farmer's number of dependants.  Deputy O'Kennedy cited the single farmer as against the farmer with six children and I appreciate that point.  First, the man with more dependants gets a much better deal from the State.  I am not saying that that is a good tax point, but if you are married, with six children, you get children's allowances and educational and health services that the single man never requires.  Secondly, in January of next year the children benefit scheme will have particular unique benefits for farmers with under 80 adjusted acres.  The more children they have, the more they will benefit.  There is a reorganisation of the child benefit scheme.  Whereas on the social welfare side some of the children's allowances and dependants' allowances have been cut, on the other taxable.  If dren's allowances have been taxable.  If <Col N="2304" /> you are not taxable according to income and are on a national system, you will be able to obtain all the benefits of the new child benefit scheme.  This applies to farmers with under 80 adjusted acres.  I maintain that the only way that you can get over injustice is to have a single mechanism and if someone can produce a certificate stating that he or she has a nil tax liability, surely no other sector can complain.  If people say that they are stony broke, they should not be expected to pay tax.  Deputy O'Kennedy's point about family size would be relevant to the nil tax liability.</P>
    <P>There are some queries that I should like the Minister to clarify when concluding on Second Stage.  These are relevant to the levies, health, youth employment and 1 per cent.  As long as that situation remains unclarified, you can rest assured that it will be more difficult to sell the farm tax because it will be construed as being £13 an acre instead of £10.</P>
    <P>There has been a difficulty in the past few years regarding the gross and net amount on which the levies are calculated. Farmers have not been allowed to claim capital allowances and they have been assessed on an income that they do not have.  If a farmer has 40 calves which he eventually sells as 40 bullocks and makes £200 a head on paper and if he buys a tractor costing £8,000, he cannot write off that tractor against the levies. Farmers are being asked to pay levies which are assessed on income that they do not possess.  I accept that borrowings have been allowed for the calculation of levies but that does not solve the problem.  I and other backbenchers have spoken to various Ministers about this matter.  There are two issues that must be determined: first, what will be the future operation of the levies and, secondly, in making the rearrangements the issue of gross and net income must be clarified.  I hope the Minister will clear the air on that point.</P>
    <P>In respect of land tax for farmers with less than 80 adjusted acres there is a major problem for people involved in the agri-business.  In the budget, VAT was increased from 5 to 10 per cent for agricultural <Col N="2305" /> contractors.  Because 92 per cent of farmers will not have to keep accounts these contractors fear that the business will go to those in the black economy because farmers cannot afford to go to registered agricultural contractors.  There are many such cases of people in the silage cutting business, in the ploughing business and in the corn sowing business. They have told me that when they are registered for VAT and when they charge the rate at 10 per cent they get less for themselves.  A farmer's son who is not registered for VAT and who operates in the black economy can charge less and still get more for himself than the registered operator.  As farmers will not have to keep accounts that difficulty will increases and it will apply throughout the agri-business sector.  Because we are taking people out of the accounts net, registered operators in the agri-business sector will be hit severely by the black economy.  I should like to know from the Minister if there is any way around that problem.</P>
    <P>For farmers with less than 80 adjusted acres, what is the position with regard to their entitlement to higher education grants, medical cards and other meanstested benefits?  What will be the position in this regard if we do not have figures for such farmers?  Because they have less than 80 adjusted acres, will they be deemed to have a national income of less than £7,000 a year?  Will it be that a certain number of adjusted acres will be the threshold figure?  There can be a great variation between the earnings of a dairy farmer on 62 adjusted acres and a dry stock farmer with the same acreage.  This whole area must be clarified.</P>
    <P>I understand that delayed payments of the tax will be liable to interest charges. If a farmer pays the tax, subsequently appeals the adjustment of the acreage and wins his case, will the refund of land tax carry an interest charge?  If there is an overpayment in respect of corporation profits tax, interest payments are paid by the Revenue Commissioners to the company concerned.  I appreciate that there are no interest charges in respect of VAT and income tax rebates.  If it <Col N="2306" /> will take such a long time to make the necessary adjustments and appeals, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, one can realise there will be a lengthy period during which the money will have been paid.</P>
    <P>This matter is of considerable interest in County Wexford.  During the PLV rates campaign some people paid the rates while supporting the IFA campaign, while others refused to pay.  I and others who paid are right suckers because the other people won the case and apparently they do not have to pay.  There is no refund to those who were honest enough to pay.  In that case it did not pay for farmers to be honest.  The same situation will apply in respect of water rates if there is backtracking on that.  What happens is that dishonest people end up looking smart and clever.  The whole business is most unfair.  What is the position with regard to the people who paid rates prior to their abolition but while the constitutional case was pending?  A number of these people feel downright foolish.  I do not know what is the right thing to do, whether people should get a refund or whether others should pay.  I simply point out that the discrepancy is there and I hope it does not recur in this case.</P>
    <P>I say to the farmers and those who represent them that it may be the case that the tail is wagging the dog.  I do not know.  Fine Gael are a national, broadlybased party with many urban Deputies. I think that when the Government consider this matter there is a consensus against farmers based on misinformation. People believe farmers are getting away with murder, that they are paying nothing. That is totally untrue and unfair.  The unions have a lot to answer for in that regard because they have whipped up feeling.  However, the farming organisations also have a lot to answer for because they have given the impression, rightly or wrongly, that the bottom line is &ldquo;We are not going to pay&rdquo;.  They tell me privately that is not so, but the impression is given and that is the important point.  I ask farmers and the farming organisations to be mindful of this in their stance from now onwards.  Like many other people, since 1969 they have played <Col N="2307" /> their part in ensuring that every Government have got the boot from the electorate. I do not think the country has gained a lot by it.  There have been sufficient farmers, taxpayers or people who are unemployed to throw out whoever was in Government whether after a period of six months or five years.  There is a lesson to be learned from that.</P>
    <P>If I was a farmer I would not take too much solace from Deputy O'Kennedy's speech.  He is riding the horse of Peter Cassells every bit as much as he is riding the horse of Joe Rea.  He said that the unions were right and that there would be common marches against this tax, but he is not telling the truth.  The truth is that the ICTU want land tax and income tax paid above and below 80 acres.  The IFA do not want that.  They just want the accounts system.  For Deputy O'Kennedy or Fianna Fáil to pretend that they will repeal this tax and the fact that they are making such play out of the ICTU factor suggests that this promise will turn out to be like so many promises made by every party when in Opposition.  The farmers best bet is through rural Deputies who are genuinely aware of their problems and anxious to ensure that there is equity and fair play in society.</P>

      <P>Apart from the begining and end of his speech, Deputy Yates confirmed everything Deputy O'Kennedy said about this legislation.  He showed his utter frustration with the manner in which this legislation was brought in and his almost contempt for the way in which the advice which he and many other backbenchers had given to the Government was rejected.  Above all else, his speech was an endorsement of what Deputy O'Kennedy said &mdash; that there must be equity in any taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is panic legislation designed to take money from farmers regardless of their ability to pay.  It has already received the thumbs down sign.  Unless the Government take heed of the suggestions made it will create more difficulty <Col N="2308" /> between farmers and PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy dealt with the particulars of the Bill in great length, the anomalies, difficulties, dangers and the various pitfalls which the adjusters will have to take account of.  In his speech the Minister spoke about the fact that somewhat similar proposals were put forward by the current President of the IFA in 1979.  Like the President of the IFA, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Labour Party have changed their stance.  In their policy document dated November 1982, prior to the election, it was stated that all farmers with a taxable income should pay tax and health contributions, that that should be the central core of any taxation system.  If one has a taxable income one should pay tax on it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach changed his mind on a number of occasions, but that is nothing new.  In an interview in <i>Magill</i> in July 1979 he stated he was convinced that the inequities to which such a levy would give rise would offset the benefits that would accure and the proposal was rejected in favour of a straightforward tax on farmers. He also said that farmers should be taxed on the basis of accounts on the same basis as any other business.  That is fair comment.  However, this measure does not propose to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said taxation was a necessary if unpopular support of all organised societies.  It is, but he left out the important words &ldquo;just and equitable taxation&rdquo;. This legislation is neither just nor equitable. In his speech Deputy Yates raised the question of justice and equity, and this them ran through his contribution.</P>
    <P>What did the Minister mean when he said that the income tax system is already bearing a disproportionately large burden of overall taxation effort and that, like other progressive administrations, we should try to develop a better balanced spread of taxes?  I can see the broad outline of that, but will the Minister be letting people who should be paying income tax off the hook as a result of the provisions of this Bill?  As a result of the inequities in the Bill some people will pay less tax than they should, and that a lot correct.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> The issue of farm accounts has been raised.  I know many farmers, particularly young farmers, who keep accounts as a matter of form because they see farming as a business and accounts must be kept in all businesses.  There is little point in a farmer carrying on an enterprise if at the end of the day it does not show a profit. Young farmers are keeping accounts so the argument that it would be of help to farmers not to keep accounts are facetious. If farmers do not keep accounts they will be in severe difficulty.  If would be pointless for them to continue losing money on a particular enterprise.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I should mention though that it is envisaged that there will be adjustments in the amounts of the grants in relief of rates by reference to the revenue from the farm tax.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is talking about is reducing the amounts from central funds in relation to the yields from the farm tax.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said that in certain areas in Wexford people who are receiving home assistance will have to pay this tax. In many areas along the western seaboard the Department of Social Welfare will be paying unemployment assistance to many people while at the same time these people will be assessed for this tax.  I do not see any equity in that.  One must contrast the manner in which this tax has been introduced with the manner in which the property tax was introduced. There was no income level.  Is it correct that a person with 25 adjusted acres will pay £250 in 1986?  Is it £10 an acre for the whole 25 acres?  This is another point that was glossed over during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>There could be a situation in which farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance would also be liable to pay tax. In the case of the property tax a person would need to be earning £20,000 per year and have a house valued at more than £60,000 before liable for that tax, but in this case everyone with more than 25 adjusted acres will be liable to the land tax regardless of income.  One <Col N="2310" /> must ask why this is being done.  Perhaps in certain constituencies, especially in Dublin, there are many more people, some of whom are supporters of the Government, who would be paying property tax if it had been introduced on a proper basis or if it had been introduced in the way in which this land tax is being introduced than would be the case in the entire western region in relation to land tax.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Minister's speech there is the approach that almost begs the question of whether we are on the way to the reintroduction of rates on houses.  If this is the case, the Government should be honest enough to say so. Instead, they are indulging in the charade of trying to convince people that a great job is being done in terms of reducing the balance of payments and reducing borrowing while at the same time charges are being transferred to many people by way of water and other service charges, charges which would be met normally by way of general taxation.  Under this legislation many farmers who should not have to pay tax will be asked to do so.</P>
    <P>One must ask how adjusted acres are to be determined.  The Minister referred in his speech to defining an adjusted acre as an area of land having the equivalent production potential of one acre of the best land in the country in ideal growing conditions.  Deputy O'Kennedy went into that matter extensively but we still have to hear of how this will work in practice. Every acre of land will have to be tested. In many cases even areas as small as roods will have to be tested because, as the Minister will be aware, the difference in soil in parts of the same field can be extraordinary.  Therefore, one cannot visualise the procedure being completed before 1986, even taking into account the Minister's statement that the larger farms will be dealt with first.  This major task will be beyond the capacity of the limited number of people who will be assigned to it.  We are told that these will number 200, that half of them will be officers from the Land Commission while the remainder will be recruited on a temporary basis <Col N="2311" /> for this purpose.  I understand that recruitment is being undertaken at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has outlined fully the problems that could arise later in the event of the determination of adjusted acres being appealed by individual farmers. As I do not have confidence in that area, I shall not speculate on it; but obviously there will be involved a legal bonanza for the legal profession.</P>
    <P>There will be a very elaborate procedure involved in the whole system of appeals.  First a farm tax commissioner would determine an adjusted acre, then the farm tax tribunal would be involved and subsequently the High Court.  This procedure will in many cases leave the courts, and particularly the High Court, inundated with appeals, and this is despite the fact that already they are years behind in hearing some cases.</P>
    <P>There is the fear &mdash; and since this was referred to by Deputy Yates it is obviously a fear that is being experienced throughout the country &mdash; that what we are experiencing here is similar to what we witnessed in relation to the introduction of VAT, that is, that when the Minister for Finance needs more money he will talk to the Minister for the Environment and that instead of a tax of £10 per acre there will be a farm tax of £13 or perhaps £15 per acre.  The Minister has indicated that he is prepared to consider amendments, but as the Bill stands the rate of tax is to be prescribed by the Minister for the Environment.  Section 9 provides for the levying annually of a farm tax.  Therefore, unless safeguards are provided, the Minister of the day will be empowered to apply whatever rate he considers appropriate. That is not a correct approach.  I have no doubt but that the Bill will become law and that it will be in operation at least until the next general election.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates made a very valid point in relation to the question of interest.  I too, should like to know whether interest will apply in the other direction also because it seems likely that in many of the cases of appeals, the liability will be reduced.  In other words, will those farmers <Col N="2312" /> who are successful in their appeals have returned to them not only the additional tax they have paid but also the interest on that money?</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the proposal to display in Garda stations details of the liabilities of individuals.  Tax is a very private matter.  To have a farmer's or anybody's liability displayed on a notice on a wall is wrong.  What such notice will not show is that farmer could have paid his tax.  Many people will misrepresent such notices and will simply read what is there, that farmer A, B or C owes so much, while that tax could well have been paid.  The Minister should closely examine that obnoxious section to ascertain whether it can be changed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said we are very jealous people.  I do not fully agree with that.  At the same time if a farm labourer is paying, say, £800 or £900 in income tax himself and sees that his employer is liable to only £300 or £400, he is unlikely to be happy about that situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to rates on business, a manager has the power not only to postpone them but to waive them completely, which does not appear to be the situation in relation to farm tax.  The hardship in many cases mentioned by Deputy Yates will render it almost impossible for certain land to be sold.  For instance, let us suppose there are 25 adjusted acres to be sold on which there are a couple of thousands of pounds due in land tax.  Such arrears would render the sale of that land much more difficult.  It makes the whole system of buying and selling that much more difficult.  One might well question whether power should evolve on the manager not alone to postpone but to waive the payment of tax altogether.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Kennedy, I feel that the length of time entailed in bringing this tax into being has been underestimated. For instance, the Minister has less than a year to have the various adjustments effected and I presume he will do so in relation to all of the rating authorities, not just picking a couple of counties, and will have all of the larger farms rated. I presume he is talking about land of between 60 and 80 adjusted acres, to have <Col N="2313" /> all of that land rated in all local authority areas.  It is a mammoth task and one I do not honestly believe the Minister will be able to fulfil.  Indeed, that will give rise to even more inequity in that some people will be paying land tax in 1986 while others who may be sited adjacent to them may not be paying tax although they have a larger income.  Is it envisaged that 1986 will be the commencement year?  Is it envisaged that in 1987, if a smaller farmer was assessed, he would have to pay two years tax, or will it be applicable from the year of assessment only?</P>
    <P>This is not a good Bill.  Its provisions will levy a form of tax on the farming community which is wrong and which I believe the Minister and his party believe to be wrong.  I believe that what they are endeavouring to do is get more money from the farming community.  That is not something I would oppose.  But it should be levied on the basis of ability to pay, on the basis of income and, if that is done, then there can be seen to be some sense in it.  As the Minister himself said:</P>
    <P>I believe that the Bill will ensure a more realistic contribution from the farming community to the provision of local services and that this will be achieved in a manner which involves no disincentive to agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I believe it is wrong to say that we need so much money from any sector of the community, that we will get it by means of imposing a levy or a tax that does not take into account one's ability to pay. Certainly, the provisions of this Bill do not appear to take into account the very many hardship cases that would be involved, which are so varied, many of which were mentioned by Deputy Yates, such as problems occasioned by disease, borrowing and many other factors.</P>
    <P>In the joint Programme for Government, in the chapter on taxation, it was said that in drawing up new tax proposals account will be taken of the cost of the care of dependent children.  That has not been covered under the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister for Finance on the introduction of the 1983 Budget said that public perception of tax equity demands <Col N="2314" /> that all income earners shall be liable for tax on an equal footing.  There has not been such recognition in this Bill and there are many more examples that could be cited.</P>
    <P>When one talks to accountants, the point made by Deputy Yates is one that is put across very forcibly, that is, the relief given to farmers, which has now reached saturation point in many cases in relation to capital expenditure.  It means that in 1986 the yield from income tax on farmers will be approximately doubled. That is a figure that most accountants contend to be a reasonably true estimate and that in itself will give the Government the return from the farming community they seek.</P>
    <P>The Minister should forget about this tax and devise a system under which farmers and everybody else will pay equitably. The Minister should not implement a system that has already divided the farming community and caused further division between urban and rural inhabitants, in many cases because of a lack of understanding of the position.</P>

      <P>My valuable time is <Col N="2316" /> being taken by this, with all due respects to Deputy Blaney.</P>
      <P>Anything I say is not in a farmer bashing context.  I have stated my position many times on public platforms and again more recently at a meeting of the IFA in the Dunraven Arms Hotel in Limerick some months ago before the local elections.  Labour Party policy on this question of taxation and farmer taxation is that we accept that there are many thousands of small farming families who acording to the Foras Talúntais survey are not in a position to pay tax. The same applies in the urban sectors. We maintain that anybody who cannot pay tax should not be liable for tax.  The Land Commission should have been retained as a fair instrument that had credibility with a lot of people.  It should not have been done away with.  It could have been used effectively in the type of exercise that is under way.  We have always supported the concept of small farms, going back to the old days even before the Labour Party was founded. We had our origin in the Land and Labour League set up by Davitt, Parnell and others.  Many of our traditional supporters in east Limerick, west Clare and south Tipperary are an historic residue of that land and labour movement.  It is our policy that the land should hold as many farming families as possible and we totally oppose the concept of big ranch type agricultural outfits.  We recognise that our agriculture is probably the most under-capitalised in Europe.  It should be brought up to the most modern requirements. Having said that, we go on to say that something will have to be done about taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at a function as Mayor of Limerick some months ago when Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien, the distinguished chairwoman of the Commission on Taxation, was speaking.  She reiterated what she said in London last year: that, if something was not done soon to introduce equity to the Irish taxation system, there will be a revolt.  At the first meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party when I was elected to this House I said that the <Col N="2317" /> most urgent job for this Government was to introduce equity into the taxation system.  Unemployment is a major social problem giving rise to many social ills, but it has not yet become a major political problem.  Taxation is a major political problem.  That has been reflected in the local elections last week.  What amazes me is that anyone would profess surprise at what has happened.  People predicted long ago that this would be the situation. The urban backlash against the imposition of water rates is merely a reflection of the resentment of the industrial sector at what is happening in the area of taxation. It is important to remember this. I invite my friends on the opposite side of the House to reflect on this.  &ldquo;Ní thig leis an gobadán an dá thrá á fhreastal&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The waterhen cannot watch the two sides of the stream.&rdquo;  One cannot ride two horses on this issue.  This is the foremost political problem and it is gathering speed.</P>
    <P>When we assumed responsibility for our own affairs in 1922 eighty out of every 100 people lived on the land.  The Irish were never an urban society.  At that time only one out of every five lived in cities.  In another short 15 years the exact opposite will be the case where four out of five people will be living in the towns and cities.  This is happening throughout western society due to increasing mechanisation where those societies have moved from blue collar to white collar status as defined by Alvin Toffler in his book <i>Future Shock.</i> That concentration of people in urban areas requires services and these will have to be paid for.  I was amused if not intrigued by my colleague, Deputy Ivan Yates, talking about the need for greater sensitivity in dealing with farm taxation.  I wish somebody would show the same solicitude for the PAYE sector, who are paying taxation under four distinct and definite headings.</P>
    <P>I told an IFA meeting at the Dunraven Arms Hotel some months ago &mdash; and our friend Joe Rea was present &mdash; that if the farmers of today are not prepared to pay their share their sons will pay the political price long before they think they will, and they will be glad to pay it.  All the <Col N="2318" /> political energies of the people in the last century were directed against the landlords and towards securing a return of the land to the people.  Under various Acts around 1903 the land came back to our people, but we have the same fossilised mentality among the farming community that they displayed in the last century &mdash; this idea about &ldquo;Talamh gan cíos as seo amach agaibh&rdquo;&mdash; from now on we do not pay any rent on the land.  That land belongs to the people of Ireland, and Seán Ó Faoláin pointed out in his book <i>The Irish</i> that the lowing of cattle is the <i>leitmotiv</i> of Irish history.  Land will always be the problem, but they will have to pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>There was blackguardism going on in some farming organisations &mdash; and I am using that word advisedly notably in the IFA.  In spite of what he thinks he is doing, Mr. Joe Rea, speaking from just below the hip, is the best friend the Irish trade union movement ever had.  If John Carroll of the Transport Union, or Bill Attlee of the FWUI, or Matt Merigan of the ATGWU, made the kind of emotive statements that he is making they would be denounced as people sowing the seeds of social revolution and dissension.  Joe, like Ian Paisley, might be more of a help to his opponents than he intends to be and he would want to take note of it. Somebody referred to the IFA campaign against the constitutionality of the Griffith PLV of 1850 and 1851.  That was not conducted by the IFA as a body, but five of them upfronted it.</P>
    <P>When we paid rates at that time the position was this &mdash;and I have these figures from top officials of the Department.  I will state them now and I defy anyone to challenge me.  If I am wrong in these figures I will be delighted to be corrected.  Before the rural agricultural rates were deemed unconstitutional, out of every 100 farmers in this country 94 paid no rates, only 3 per cent paid 50 per cent of what they were liable for and only three farmers out of every 100 paid their full liability.  During that time people could come into the county councils, as they did in Limerick, and look for higher education grants.  When <Col N="2319" /> the official told such a farmer that he was not paying rates he would say that he was liable to pay rates although he was not paying them.  That was social rebellion on advice from the leaders of their organisation. The official would go out to check with the higher authorities and would have to come back and admit in a crestfallen manner that our friend was right that, although he was not paying rates, because he was liable in law he could get a higher education grant.  How many workers in the PAYE sector would get that entitlement to the grant?</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates expressed concern for his people.  What about County Limerick where a farmer with nearly 200 acres and about 90 cattle could nominally sign the land over to the son and present himself at the regional hospital in Limerick with a blue card for treatment there while he had more land and wealth than some of the big business in Limerick city?  The ordinary fellow working for 40 years with a company like CIE is taxed on his couple of bob pension and cannot get what that farmer gets.  Mr. Joe Rea is doing this nation a service.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am not given to colorful or emotive language.  Mr. Rea is heading up a situation and the ICTU have made their position known.  Deputy Yates referred to a possible recurrence of marches.  We have gone beyond the stage of marches, and I have spoken at every tax campaign in this country.  I welcome what Mr. Joe Rea is saying.  He urged the farmers to barricade and stampede the Fine Gael clinics.  Nobody took up the challenge and told the workers to stampede the Fine Gael clinics and put their point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome at least one convert in that, however belated. The ICTU have a magnificent record. They have never adopted political strikes here, in sharp contradistinction to what has happened in other countries.  They have never had political strikes on party lines.  If this campaign by the IFA led <Col N="2320" /> by Mr. Joe Rea continues to its logical conclusion the ICTU will have to give serious consideration to taking on full belt all Governments and following the lines set by the workers in Waterford Glass last year: let us have a full stop and bring the economy to a halt, because no country can operate without the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>Not alone are the PAYE workers being savagely treated; they are being bled white by the unfairness of this present system.  They are paying more than 87p out of every £ in taxation, and the farmers are paying less than 2p in the £.  At the same time the farmers are getting handouts, roads, education.  Let me give some recent figures from the Minister for Education's Estimate.  Every child in a primary school is subsidised to the extent of £550 per year.  A child at secondary school is subsidised to the extent of £1,000 per year.  In a third level institute, depending on where it is, the subsidy is £2,500 to £5,000 per year.  Therefore, a farmer, his wife and four children, one in a primary school, two in a secondary school and one at third level, are getting an annual subsidy of £6,000.  Multiply that by the years that they receive it.  Yet they do not want to pay a fair contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade.  They are finding every device for moving away from the system.  The only answer to that is to introduce a fair system or make us all farmers and give us all the same benefits that they are getting.  The ICTU said yesterday that they welcome this absolutely minimal step in the direction of equity as compensation and replacement for the abolition of the PLV system in rural areas.  Suppose the Supreme Court had found that the PAYE system was unconstitutional.  Be sure that this House, this Government or any Government would find an adequate substitute in a very short time, which has never happened in the case of the farmers.  The workers are all watching this.  Take a simple example under the proposed scheme.  This morning's <i>Irish Times</i> reports that the ICTU issued a document yesterday which stated that a farmer with <Col N="2321" /> £10,000 based on 75 acres will pay about 7.5 per cent of that money.  A single man PAYE worker with the same income would pay £2,900.  That is 29 per cent.  A married couple with two children on the same income with one person earning would pay £1,800, 18 per cent.  The inequity there is obvious.  The ICTU are saying that the Supreme Court did not rule against the principle of paying tax and rates on land but against the manner in which it was done.  I am glad that this distinction has been made because it has never been made previously.</P>
    <P>Again Fianna Fáil are trying to ride two horses.  They scooped the political pool in 1977 when they abolished rates on domestic properties.  It should be pointed out that the Coalition Government had two quarters or a half of that done away with already.  In 1978, when Limerick Corporation were given an 11 per cent increase, we all screamed and held up our hands and applied to the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Sylvester Barrett, and told him that that was not enough money to run Limerick city.  He told us that he was giving us the same money as we had given ourselves last year and that when we were free to increase it we did not do so.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with saying that we could have made a mistake.  Is it time to look at the question of bringing in some combination of a tax on general property side by side with income tax? Last week during my canvass I visited houses in my ward that would fit comfortably into the upper class belt of any country in Europe or America where one would expect such wealth.  Their gardens were like many public parks so well kept were they.  I complimented one professional man &mdash; I would like to take anyone to his door &mdash; on how beautifully his garden was maintained and he told me that he had three houses to maintain. That man, on the valuation of his house in 1977, would be paying somewhere in the region of £3,000 on those houses.  That is the tax on wealth.  All he will pay to Limerick city this year is £50 water rates.</P>
    <P>Who would change that?  I have seen <Col N="2322" /> millionaries, former Members of this House, who when they heard about the water rates took out their cheque books, made out cheques for £50 and said that otherwise they would be paying £1,000 rates on their houses.  I am not talking about the white man's approach to the Indian, like we heard from Fianna Fáil &mdash; speaking from two different sides of the mouth.  If we are at all serious it is about time we took a look at it.  We spoke about sensitive issues like divorce &mdash; Deputies know my views on that &mdash; being dealt with on an all party basis.  The most sophisticated people are the electorate and they can play political groups off magnificently one against the other, whether they do it subtly or in the bullying fashion we have seen from the IFA recently.  If we are to do something out of a patriotic sense of duty to the future of the nation and our young children, I suggest to the House that it is very timely to set up an all-party committee, taking account of the political dimension as well as the financial side of it, to look at the whole question of taxation.  There are two sides to taxation.  There is equity and yield.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a paper by Mr. Liam Coughlan, a graduate of NIHE Limerick, who is now a lecture in taxation with Limerick city VEC.  He speaks about equity and the need for it.  He questions the equity and rationale of excluding certain types of income from normal personal taxation.  However, laudable this might have been in times gone by, when one talks about artists, authors and inventors, the fact is that the more people who are taken out of the system the more unfair it becomes for those who are left to pay the piper.  His proposals are absolutely pertinent to the situation we are facing.  He wrote a thesis on taxation in Ireland and pointed out where reform is needed and how it could be brought about.  He makes two very good points, which are:</P>
    <P> (1) setting up of a Government Oireachtas Committee to report back within the year with a tax reform package <Col N="2323" /> which would include many of the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  This package would be designed to yield the same or higher levels of revenue.  Major structural changes are needed urgently and the Government should act as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>(2) tightening up of controls on State spending, elimination of abuses and wastages in Government Departments and especially in the area of capital expenditure. </P>
    <P>He makes another point, which is:</P>
    <P>That consideration be given to the idea of self-assessment for the self-employed.</P>
    <P>He goes on to make other points on that. I believe it is very timely, because a major political earthquake is looming up if we do not do something about it.</P>
    <P>I want to quote from a submission made to the Government by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies in Ireland, their pre-budget submission for 1984.  Speaking about the black economy, they said to the Minister for Finance:</P>
    <P>One of the results of the penal system of personal tax at present in force is the existence of the &ldquo;black economy&rdquo; and related tax evasion.  A great deal of effort is undertaken by tax evaders to generate income outside the normal tax net; indeed some go to extreme lengths to evade tax who would not be liable for tax in fact.  The activities of the &ldquo;black economy&rdquo; has, without doubt, undermined the competitiveness of those business who comply fully with their obligations under the Tax Acts.  The solution to this problem lives for the most part in the return to a simpler and fairer regime of personal tax...</P>
    <P>I am a trade union official by instinct and outlook, and one cannot change what one is.  I have often stood up here and attacked Ministers for their tradiness. Every Government in the history of the <Col N="2324" /> State have funked the farmers on the question of taxation.  I use that word in its most pejorative and insulting sense. The IFA are only the same size as my union with 170,000 members.  We have only to look at the way they have bullied and kicked every Government about in relation to the whole question of taxation. We have stood up here and correctly lambasted the professional people for what they are doing.  I invite the accountants and respectable professions like them to look at their record in assisting these people who can afford to pay consultants to tell them how to evade taxation.</P>
    <P>We all know cases in our areas where members of the various professions can go to auctions and pay £5,000 in notes for antiques rather than pay cheques and have them on record.  We all know what is going on.  That system has to stop. What is being proposed is only a pathetic gesture along that road.  As far as the trade union movement are concerned, we criticise industry and we often hear from the more extreme elements on the other side of the House what should be done to companies who do not pay their taxation.  I weep at the concern expressed by Deputy Yates for some of the farmers who might not be able to pay up.  Some person should do a quick exercise, such as I heard of recently in one of the south-eastern counties when speaking to some of the higher local authorities there, to check out where all the new car registrations are coming from.  If this is done it will not be found it is the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I ask for the same solicitude for small companies.  I know a man who came back from abroad after being engaged in the textile industry.  He opened a factory in a small town on the west coast where the only public buildings were the public toilet and the Garda station.  There was no traditional industry in that area.  This man employed 40 young people.  He was in the CMT, the cut, make and trim business. It is a very hazardous type of business, because you can be screwed by the multinational companies and the big chain stores, who can say: &ldquo;We can get a pair of slacks for £3.50, we want you to <Col N="2325" /> come in at £3.&rdquo;  This man was working on a very small margin all the time.  He was not avoiding paying tax.  He brought down the officials of my union and the experts and asked them to look at his problem.  He said he would pay the tax increases and told the tax people what he was looking for.  He wanted time to pay them the money that he admitted he owed them.  He was told he would get one and a half years to pay.  He said he could not do it, that he would want there years to do it.  He said he would pay it bit by bit as he went along.  He has now declared himself insolvent and 40 jobs are gone.  I heard the same thing about another person in Wicklow, where 120 jobs were lost.  This might be a more realistic area to show solicitude.</P>
    <P>I would like quickly to take up some of the points made in the debate this morning.  A Deputy said that there was a nil liability shown for tax liability.  Does that apply to a farmer who has 18 acres and four brood mares and who pays nothing? He is not liable for tax but he might have £100,000 between the four brood mares.  Would the Minister say that man is not liable for tax and that he might get away with it?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the blackguarding going on &mdash; I heard this from the other side of the House &mdash; and asking why the system of income tax was not left as it was.  Farmers have told me that before Ranks closed Limerick they were selling wheat to that firm and were buying it back cheaper under an EC subvention. They were selling it back again at the same high price until the officials in the Department of Agriculture spotted it, came down and had to dye the wheat blue so that they could stop what was going on.  We had a situation whereby they could declare under the income tax system that they had so many aborted calves last year and they could fool the taxation system.  We know what went on in the switching of tags in relation to the TB eradication scheme.  That is the kind of system under which it is proposed to introduce some equity.  I give it the least possible welcome.  It is a minimal and pathetic step in the direction of equitable <Col N="2326" /> taxation.  Unless something is done by the authorities about tax equity the workers will not put up with it and I will be full square behind them.</P>

An leisciúleacht nó neamhéifeacht nó neamhshuim is ciontach leis seo?  Pé scéal é, tá scrúdú á dhéanamh ní hé amháin ag an Aire ach ag an Rialtas ar éifeachtacht an Údaráis.  An é nach bhfuil aon rud socraithe go fóill ag an Rialtas nó an féidir leis an Aire a rá anois anseo go bhfuil sé cinnte go leanfar le Údarás na Gaeltachta agus an rud atá i gceist, nó an cóir níos mó cumhachtaí a thabhairt nó cumhachtaí a bhaint dó?

      <P>Ag an bpointe seo níl sé ar intinn agamsa deireadh a chur leis an Údarás agus dúirt mé sa fhreagra nach féidir liomsa a bheith freagarthach as ráflaí a thagann amach ó na meáin chumarsáide. Ba mhaith liom mar sin féin a rá go bhfuil mise agus Roinn na Gaeltachta ag déanamh iniúchta ar obair an Údaráis agua ar nós imeachta an eagrais, go bhfuil scrúdú ar siúl ag Comhchoiste Oireachtais ar chomh maith ar bhun speisialta mar a dheineann siad le comhlachtaí Stáit eile go deimhin, agus chomh maith leis sin, go bhfuil scrúdú inmhéánach á dhéanamh ag Roinn na Seirbhíse Poiblí, rud a tharlaíonn go minic in a lán comhlachtaí Stáit eile chomh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá sé seo ar siúl agus níl aon cheann <Col N="2328" /> de na iniúchtaí seo críochnaithe go fóill agus go dtí go mbeidh said críochnaithe agus go dtí go ndéanfar scrúdú ar na tuarascálacha a thangann as an iniúchadh atá ar siúl níl mise ábalta a rá go baileach cén toradh a bhéas air seo.  Is í an aidhm atá leis an obair seo ar fad ná cur le éifeachtúlacht an eagrais mar eagras atá i mbun oibre sa Ghaeltacht ar son Gaeltachta na Gaeltachta agus ar son na Gaeltachta féin.  Sin a bhfuil ann.  Níl aon rud eile i gceist.  Tá an tÚdarás ansin le cúig bliana. Ba coincheap nua é agus tá sé in am breathún siar féachaint cén toradh atá ar a chuid oibre agus breathnú ar aghaidh ag féachaint ar féidir feabhas a chur ar nós imeachtaí agus obair an Údaráis.

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom, mar fhreagra ar an rud adúirt an Teachta Mac Giolla, a rá nach í easpa suime i gcúrsaí na Gaeltachta ach trí mhíthuiscint fágadh amach ceisteanna.  Bhí mé anseo nuair a bhí an Ghaeltacht á plé agus faoi chaibidil agus thaispeáiníomar ar gach aon taobh den Teach cén suim a bhí againn sa Ghaeltacht.

An n-aontódh sé nach dtáinig aon rud deimhnitheach ón Aire ná ón Taoiseach &mdash; taobh amuigh den méid adúirt an Taoiseach anseo sa Dáil &mdash; mar fhreagra ar cheist.  Níor tháinig aon phoiblíocht ceart faoi céard atá i ndán don Údarás san am atá le teacht ach amháin na cúrsaí amhrais atá cothaithe agus atá ag déanamh díobhbhála do obair an Údaráis faoi láthair.</P>

Tá deacrachtaí <Col N="2329" /> agus go deimhin tá a fhios ag an Teachta mar iar-Aire go bhfuil deacrachtaí ag baint leis an Údarás toisc go bhfuil deacrachtaí ar leith ag baint leis an timpeallacht agus leis an gceantar go bhfuil freagracht orthu as.  Feicimse mo fhreagracht féin sa chás seo mar chúnamh don Údarás le cuidiú leo an job is ferr a dhéanamh, agus ba mhaith liom a rá chomh maith, rud nach ndeirtear go minic nó minic go leor, táimid ag caint anseo faoi chaiteachas airgid phoiblí agus tá sé de dhualgas ní amháin ormsa ach ar chuile dhuine sa Teach seo, ar chuile thaobh den Teach, cinntiú chomh fada agus is féidir go bhfuil, ní hé amháin san Údarás ach i chuile Roinn Stáit eile agus i chuile chomhlacht Stáit eile go bhfuil luach ár n-airgid le fáil ag an Rialtas ar son mhuintir na hÉireann.

      <P>I asked this question because the Minister informed me last November or December that such a review group had been established and that they would submit a report to him by 1 June 1985.  What is the position in regard to the report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The review group to which the Deputy referred was set up on 7 November.  The original intention was that they would report to me by 1 June. However, despite their best efforts they have not done so and I accept the reason for the delay because they went into the whole question of what they were undertaking very deeply within the terms of reference which applied to them.  It now transpires that, because of the in-depth scrutiny of the question, the date of the delivery of the report has been deferred. <Col N="2333" /> I have intimated to the group that I would prefer to get a comprehensive report two months later than a somewhat less comprehensive one on the deadline.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would be much preferable to get it that way.  I am told I will have the report some time in September.</P>

      <P>I am quite happy with the reasons given to me for the delay. I should like to compliment the review group on the amount of work they have done.  Those people have been meeting regularly.  Their last meeting was on Monday, 24 June and further meetings are in the course of preparation.  I am quite happy that the reason for the deferment of the deadline is satisfactory in that the people involved have gone into the matter in great detail.  Much of the work they undertook proved to be somewhat more complex than was originally anticipated. As I told Deputy Mac Giolla, I would much prefer to have full comprehensive report in September than have a half-baked less comprehensive one on the deadline.  I am sure that would suit the Deputy and would be better for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if, in view of the fact that this country still has a smaller area under forestry than any <Col N="2336" /> other EC country, he will indicate the measures the Government are taking to increase areas under forestry; if he is satisfied that the powers to acquire land for forestry at present are adequate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While the proportion of the land area of this country devoted to forestry is undoubtedly low, I would point out that the planning rate <i>Per capita</i> is the highest of any developed country.</P>
      <P>The Government are fully committed to expanding the area under forestry by both the State and private interests.  In so far as State forestry is concerned the economic plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-87,</i> aims at the establishment of planta-ions at an annual average rate of 7,500 hectares.  It is also Government policy to encourage private planting and, to this end, very generous grants and a free technical advisory service are now readily available.  I am glad to say that there is evidence of an increasing interest in private forestry in recent times.</P>
      <P>The statutory powers in relation to land acquisition for State afforestation are quite adequate.  I might add that the annual level of offers of land to my Department for foresty is of the order of 12,000 hectares at present and the funding allocated for land purchase is the highest ever provided for the purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if, in view of the importance of forestry and the low level of forestry here &mdash; 5 per cent as against an EC average of 23 per cent &mdash; he will indicate if he recognises the fact that in Europe it is expected that in the next 25 to 30 years there will be a grave shortage of timber.  Already it is a huge item on the important bill of the EC.  Will the Minister agree that now is the time to expand our forests?  Does the Minister intend to increase the level of planting?  His reply does not indicate any increase in the level of planting and I want to know the plans, if any, for increasing the amount of forestry so that we will be able to contribute to the expected shortage of timber in the next 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2337" /> We would be able to provide timber if we started now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of what the Deputy has referred to in relation to the shortage of this commodity in the European market and the increasing shortage in the years ahead.  What I have said may have escaped the Deputy's attention.  We are in a unique position in that 85 per cent of our total afforestation is in State hands.  On the European front it is 50:50 or better on the private sector side and I endeavour every time I open my mouth to encourage private afforestation here. Deputies should undertake to do that because it is in the interest of the future of our economy that they should do so. There is evidence to show that, because of the generous grant-aid available, and the free technical advisory service, the private sector is showing a very keen interest in this.  I can see a major expansion in that sector.</P>
      <P>In regard to State involvement I should like to remind the Deputy, and the House, that like everybody else I must stay within the confines of financial requirements but, despite that, we are providing money at a rate higher than was ever provided for acquisition and management of State forests.  However, it is the private sector that needs encouragement to take up this very viable and worthwhile operation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that in many areas where planting has been done by the Department there is no liaison &mdash; we all accept that it is good to have more trees planted &mdash; between his Department and the Department of Agriculture in regard to the amount of bogs that have been taken over?  There is a serious problem in many areas of the west through overplanting.  No consideration has been given to the provision of turbary.  I should like to ask the Minister if a cost benefit analysis has been carried out as to whether it would be of more <Col N="2338" /> benefit to develop marginal land for farmers in backward areas or to plant trees on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A cost benefit analysis has been carried out on comparative figures by An Foras Talúntais.  I do not have the detailed information with me, but I can tell the Deputy that on marginal land &mdash; I mean marginal land in the technical sense; we are not talking about one cow per acre but one cow per ten acres which would pertain in our part of the country &mdash; the return on timber grown would be greater than the return on milk production.  That figure has been given to us by the experts and it is a question of getting the message across.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not so far carried out investigation.  We are considering investigating this concept, on the basis of small pilot areas initially, to see the potential.  We are talking here about what amounts to an agricultural pursuit as against totally commercial forestry pursuits, about planting on lands which will be used for other purposes right through the forest rotation crop.  We are prepared to look at this matter and things are in train.  This concept has been undertaken, in New Zealand particularly, with fairly mixed results, I am advised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a pilot scheme is being successfully run in this country by a private individual or individuals?  Does he not think that his Department should be looking into this matter, given that one of the great drawbacks to the encouragement of afforestation is the slowness of cash flow on the capital investment which is made initially to get the forest under way?  It is many years before the money will start coming in from that investment.  Perhaps, if we were to combine day farming with it, that might help in some way to eliminate or reduce the problem concerning cash flow, in as much as there would be much earlier sales than from afforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking in the dark to a certain degree because we have not had any definitive results from any investigations carried out.  However, the people who own the land are private people and if they see a viable project, no doubt &mdash; as in the case the Deputy mentions &mdash; they will take it up.  One is talking here about basically agricultural land which will be used by the farmer for grazing or other purposes during the rotation of the crops.  My own view, for what it is worth at the moment, is that we would have grave difficulties as a State forest agency going into this area on a large scale.  That is because the land is used for other purposes during crop rotation. This matter is being investigated by my Department and we must await the outcome of that investigation.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I did not intend that the Minister's Department would look at it as being a public effort, but would consider the possibility of providing incentives from grant aid which might be necessary to encourage people to move into this area.  I say that against the background of the serious and ongoing problems in the agricultural sector, where there is overproduction in many areas. Many commentators are pontificating on the need to look at our output from the agricultural sector when we cannot dispose of the produce that we have in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we should look at alternative land use because of overproduction in the traditional farming pursuits.  As I have said, my Department are prepared to look into this matter.  If at the end of the day there is shown to be a viable product here, the question of incentives and encouragement in the form of grants and such like can be investigated then.  There is no point in sending people up a blind alley, not knowing what results there might be from such pursuits.  We are undertaking that type of investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is brief, if nothing else.  The question arises because of the number of boat owners who are in financial difficulties.  If the State is not prepared to become directly involved, what steps are the Government taking to ensure that there is a viable fishing felt capable of challenging the competition from the Spanish fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Deputy that a question is coming up later dealing with detailed incentives and assistance given to fishermen in trouble.  In relation to this question.  I never cease to be amazed at the philosophy that suggests that because something is not paying its way in the private sector the taxpayer <Col N="2347" /> should take over and lose his or her money.  On this issue of State involvement in fishing, we had experience in the fifties.  Indeed, Bord Iascaigh Mhara became involved in three boats on a trial basis, just to prove the point.  The end result of that was enormous losses simply because the incentive was not there on a personal basis, as would be the case of skipper-owned ships.  The profit motive was not there because these people were working for the State, resulting in the loss of sums of money.  I have no intention of allowing people under my aegis to become involved directly in the ownership and operation of fishing boats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his lecture.  Could I ask him to what does he attribute non-profitability of the at present privately owned fleet? Would he not agree that perhaps it is the anarchy of the market place and the failure of the privately owned industry which appears to be incapable of developing an integrated industry, from the catching to the processing and marketing of fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many factors which affect the current state of the fishing industry, including market problems. I would not put it, as the Deputy does, as anarchy.  However, there are certain market problems.  The Deputy and the House must remember that we are part of and party to an EC Common Fisheries Policy which covers a whole range of activities within the fishing industry, including marketing to an enormous degree.  In co-operation with other member states of the EC, we are trying to regulate the market.  The problem in fishing, like other areas, is overproduction of some species.  There are also problems with regard to transport and quotas. The Deputy and the House should remember that the fisheries policies came into existence just over two years ago. While much has been done to regulate matters there are still areas that are causing problems.  The market is depressed and filters down to the level of the fisherman, <Col N="2348" /> who is at the end of the queue. He is suffering from this depressed state because of market prices.  They cannot be artifically pushed up because they depend on supply and demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he is aware of the widespread illegal salmon fishing which is at present taking place off the west coast; and the efforts being made to control the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received reports of the illegal salmon fishing which is taking place off the west coast.  The enforcement of the fisheries laws in relation to salmon is primarily the responsibility of the Regional Fisheries Boards.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service have provided two minesweepers to assist the boards in their efforts to combat illegal salmon fishing. These vessels while on patrol have on board an authorised officer of the relevant fisheries board and a member of the Garda Síochána.  I am satisfied that the boards with the assistance of the Naval Service and the gardaí are doing all in their power with the resources available to them to contain the level of illegal salmon fishing often in very difficult circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I draw the Minister's attention to the position in the Shannon catchment area, particularly in the vicinity of Loop Head in the month of the Shannon where there has been widespread illegal activity for some time and where the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board are unable to deal with the position because they do not have a fishery protection vessel?  Is the Minister aware of allegations made by the vice-chairman of the board that, by not sanctioning the purchase of a fisheries protection vessel <Col N="2353" /> the Minister and his Department have allowed the position to deteriorate to such an extent that it has become almost uncontrollable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problem in the Shannon estuary area. There is a boat available which is unsuitable for carrying on fishery protection functions in the open sea.  It is confined to estuary activities.  An application was made to the Department concerning the purchase of a more suitable craft, but I was unable to respond favourably to the request.  The board were interested in purchasing a boat which has now been sold to another party.  I am aware of the necessity for additional protection craft in the regional boards.  I have met those concerned with the Shannon estuary area and accept that they have a valid case.  It is a question of getting finance.  Despite a substantial increase in finance this year in that subhead, if I acceded to the request made, I would be depriving other people of needed finance.  I agree that we will have to resolve this difficulty through the provision of suitable craft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that salmon stocks in the Shannon are at a crucially low level and are further endangered by this illegal activity.  Is the Minister aware that the livelihood of the traditional salmon fishermen is threatened? What action does the Minister propose to take to identify trawlers which have recently fished without licences and in blatant breach of by-laws and regulations in the mouth of the Shannon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be aware of the recent activities by the protection agency, the Naval Service.  They have had success in recent times in apprehending illegal fishermen.  In that area they have taken in the region of 4,000 yards of illegal netting.  Fishermen in the Shannon estuary area are not left without any protection in that the Naval Service, within the resources available to them, are doing worthwhile work in <Col N="2354" /> detecting and tracking down illegal fishermen in very difficult and at times dangerous circumstances.  They are being threatened and so on by people who are treating the law with absolute contempt. The Naval Service are doing and will continue to do their duty in the Shannon estuary area and along coastal areas where there is a problem.  Deputy Daly is suggesting that this is a new phenomenon but it has been going on since the time of Adam.  Deputy Daly had a meeting with the board in his time when he was Minister.</P>

Various other factors, for example, the level of activity in the private building sector and resistance on the part of some major sawmillers to distributor pressures for unduly low prices, would also influence any such situation.</P>
      <P>In so far as timber supply is concerned, my Department have undertaken to make available 600,000 cubic metres of sawlog this year and, in fact, approximately half of that volume has been offered to date.

      <P>The Government have recognised the difficulties being experienced by fishermen in meeting their financial obligations and agreed a special aid package earlier this year.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> On a point of order, and in this respect I am not implying any criticism of the Chair, I seek your guidance in relation to the interpretation of Standing Orders in the matter of Question Time.  It was understood clearly that ordinary Question Time would be between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m. and that priority Question Time would be between 3.30 and 3.45 p.m.  I understand there is some doubt as to whether the Standing Order in question allows for that, but from the point of view of the House it is important that we should clarify the position once and for all because it has been a long-established principle that Question Time is from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. In the event of questions concluding earlier than 3.30 there might be difficulty for Deputies who had left the House to do other jobs in the belief that they would not be required until a certain time. Therefore, I should like it to be established clearly that Question Time be from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m. with priority questions being taken from 3.30 to 3.45 p.m., but, if there is a question of having to amend Standing Orders, I should like to have the Chair's guidance before we proceed further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister does not propose speaking <i>ex cathedra.</i> My interpretation of the relevant Standing Order is that Question Time commences at 2.30 and concludes not later than 3.45 p.m.  If what I refer to as the balloted questions are disposed of <Col N="2358" /> before 3.30, we move to priority questions; and if they are concluded before 3.45 we move to the next business unless some steps are taken to the contrary.  The Minister is not quite correct when he says that there is a long-standing practice that Question Time begin at 2.30 and continue for a full hour.  In the good old days or the bad old days, depending on one's view, Question Time occasionally did not last for an hour.  My understanding is that in that event the House moved to the next business.</P>

      <P>This matter was raised on the Adjournment on 30 April and I dealt with it also when I moved the Estimate for my Department on June 13.  It is worth while repeating today what I said two weeks ago.  The Government decided recently on a financial package for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The package is comprised of grant assistance, including £3 million in 1985, a State guarantee for borrowings, a requirement for the board to take cost cutting and revenue increasing measures and to dispose of assets.</P>
      <P>The State assistance is contingent on the conclusion of negotiations which have been under way for some weeks between Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the dock labour force.  Industrial peace at the port is vital if the port is to prosper.  I am confident that these measures will restore Dublin port to viability and revive user confidence.  As I said on the Adjournment recently, the Government cannot save Dublin port.  That is something that can be achieved only by the parties involved &mdash; management and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometime ago I met both management <Col N="2360" /> and unions and offered them timely advice.  Regrettably, the urgency of that advice is being ignored.  Therefore, I was most concerned to hear that, notwithstanding the financial help offered by the Government, negotiations between Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the unions have run into problems.  I do not propose commenting further on those problems at this stage because I do not consider that it would be helpful for me to do so.</P>
    <P>The situation arising now is much the same as that which arose on 13 June when lay-offs to take effect from 14 June were averted and when Dublin Cargo Handling Limited agreed, at the behest of the Minister for Labour, to withdraw notices. This was after the Labour Court had intervened.  The Labour Court had discussions with both sides this week and issued a recommendation on 22 June.  My understanding is that the union held a meeting on Sunday last but that members did not vote.  Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the Minister for Labour have urged the union to hold a ballot for members but so far the union have not responded.</P>
    <P>I must repeat that the Government cannot save Dublin port.  The port can be saved only by those in the port.  I urge strongly at this very late stage that the trade union involved organise a ballot of the members.  This is something small to ask in the light of securing their own future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in expressing the hope that even at this late stage a solution can be found but, as I understand it from what was set out by the Labour Court, all of those conditions laid down as A, B, C, D, E and F would have to be complied with before agreement could be reached.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate that the Dublin Port and Docks Board have a long Dublin tradition as far as families are concerned. The difficulty arises because members are being asked to vote out the jobs of members of their own families.  There is not that great difference between the redundancies that are necessary and what <Col N="2361" /> is considered to be viable by Dublin Cargo Handlers Limited.  Can the Minister foresee any prospect of carrying anything above the 120 figure which has been advanced continuously by Dublin Cargo Handlers and which is disputed by the people in the port with a lot of expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy B. Ahern is a person for whom I have a great deal of respect.  However, I have to say that, in the run up to today's situation, some weeks ago he gave an interview on radio which undermined completely an agreement signed by both sides.  I am referring to the Horgan Dublin Docks Review, in respect of which both sides committed themselves to the figure of 120.  Deputy Ahern, in that radio interview and again today, was seeking to intervene and meddle with negotiations that have gone on.  Again last week it was agreed by both sides to go to the Labour Court.  They have gone to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court have come up with a recommendation, a variation on the Horgan recommendation, and all that is asked now is that the matter be put to a ballot.  Surely every Member of this House would agree that this is a matter that should be put to a ballot.  As I understand it, agreement is very close, or could be achieved very soon, and that what is dividing the parties now is not very great. It is a small thing to ask that a ballot be held in order to secure the future of the port.</P>
      <P>The Government, in grave financial difficulties, have come up with money to help in the situation this year, next year and the following year.  As I have said repeatedly, it is not Deputy B. Ahern, myself or the Government who can save the situation.  It is the people in the port themselves.  I want to emphasise that I believe there is a very good future for Dublin port provided there is long term peace, and doubts about the reliability of service in the port and the loss of business caused thereby are ended.  Then I believe there would be a resumed growth of business in the port which, more than anything that I or anybody else may say in this House, will secure its future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister. I argued that money should be put up for redundancy.  Therefore I support that proposal, in order to render Dublin port viable, as it should be, because other ports are benefiting from its loss of trade. We all accept that good industrial relations are vital to the success of the port and there appears now to exist a very small difference.  I am endeavouring to express a viewpoint on what is blocking final agreement on this deal, which is that those people who become redundant tomorrow, who have accepted redundancy arrangements, will be asked to vote for other people losing their jobs, people who will not be in the same strong position as they are.  In other words, the people who are accepting redundancy will be joining those people who know their jobs are secure.</P>
      <P>If we take it that there are 120 who know their jobs are secure, that 50 or 60 have accepted redundancy, that amounts to 180.  There are 30 others who will be voting, and the result of the ballot will be 180 against 30.  As the Minister knows, because of the tradition in the port, one would be asking father to vote against son and brother to vote against brother, which does not seem to be a very good idea.  To avoid placing people in that position I am asking that that small stumbling block be removed.  We all want Dublin port to continue to be viable, to prevent a situation arising in which, on Monday morning next, people begin picketing, and we are into another long contentious debate.</P>

      <P>I was shadow Minister for Labour in this House for four years between 1977 and 1981, the position now held by Deputy B. Ahern.  I never sough to perform the role of the Labour Court, especially across the floor of the House. It is not for this House to undermine the <Col N="2363" /> industrial relations machinery put there by the State.  Certainly it is not for this House to say that a ballot should not be held of members affected.  Of course, a ballot should be held.  That is the remaining problem.  If the ballot is in favour of the Labour Court recommendation I believe the problem will have been solved.  Again I urge, as has the Minister for Labour, that the ballot be held and I do not think it unreasonable to expect this House to join us in that endeavour.</P>

Is the Minister aware that several shipping and forwarding companies have been in communication with my office today, in a state of total chaos, because they do not know what arrangements to make for shipping at present?  Would the Minister do whatever he can to clarify this situation for the customers, who are paying for management and labour anyway, so that the position may be clarified for them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point Deputy Wilson has made.  Indeed those people who used the port of Dublin over the years have been in a state of torment and decline for a long time.  It is an effort to bring a conclusion to that torment and decline that we are seeking agreement.  It is worth recalling again the recent history.  It was agreed by both sides to enter into a Dock Review Group under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan of <Col N="2364" /> the Labour Court.  They came up with a joint agreed report, which each side signed and which, among other things, committed them to a figure of 120 dockers to remain.  That agreement has now been reneged on.  That matter has been referred to the Labour Court again.  The Labour Court have come up with a slight moderation of that agreement in favour of the dockers.  In order to end this torment, all we are now asking is that a ballot be held, which is not an unreasonable request.  The Labour Court have also increased somewhat the redundancy money available.  Therefore, what the Labour Court have decided is even more favourable to the dockers than the Horgan recommendation.  I am joining the Minister for Labour and the Dublin Port and Docks Board in asking that a ballot take place.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister if his colleague, the Minister for Labour, would set out what he had said in his last paragraph directly for the Marine Port and General Workers Union.  If the conditions and terms were set out by the Minister, stating that extra finance is available to those people who lost five or six weeks' employment I believe the problem could be resolved.  I do not want to be argumentative in any way.  I believe that if what is at stake was clearly stated, it would be accepted.</P>

      <P>The unions concerned are fully aware of the Labour Court recommendation.  It is a matter for them to put it to their members and that is all we are asking.  The History of Dublin port industrial relations has been shocking.  In the main that has been the cause of decline of Dublin port.  People have been cutting their own throats for far too long. We are endeavouring to prevent them doing that in order to secure the future of at least some of them and to adequately compensate those who have been made redundant.  With very limited funds available to the Exchequer a very generous provision has been made.  To date the Exchequer had no liability for Dublin port.  It never happened before that <Col N="2365" /> Dublin port received assistance from the Exchequer.  We have made that provision in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. We are asking reasonably that a ballot take place.  I would urge that all Members of this House agree with that and not seek to interject themselves into the negotiating process.</P>

      <P>As an urban member of the Fine Gael Party I find it difficult to continue to justify to my electorate the so-called equity that exists between taxpayers. I can no longer accept that the PAYE sector should continue to be expected to pay the sort of contributions they are paying when the farming community constantly say that they want to pay their fair share of tax, but every time a proposal is put they say: &ldquo;This is not the system which we will accept,&rdquo; despite the fact that it can be proved that Mr. Rea advocated the introduction of a land tax. As soon as that tax is ready and on the table, Mr. Rea is the one who rejects it as not being an appropriate form of taxation for farmers.  The PAYE sector and other income tax paying members of the public have no choice as to the form of taxation, but the farming community have had time and time again the power of veto.  Not only that, but when we try to introduce taxation and try to vary stock valuations, for instance, they come in and demand the watering down of it so much so that they are now paying less than 5 per cent of their incomes in taxation.  I accept that there are poor farmers who are finding times difficult, but not every farmer is finding the times difficult.  For far too long the big ranchers, represented by Mr. Rea, have been hiding behind the small farmers who would find it difficult to make a contribution.  People who cannot afford to pay should not pay, but everybody should make a contribution according to their means.  There are ranchers on the east coast, in the midlands and in the south who are making practically no contribution in tax.  These are the <Col N="2379" /> same people who, at the drop of a hat, are drawing out money in large grants for everything.</P>
      <P>If one takes the income tax and rates contributions by farmers in 1979 as a percentage of what the Government spent on direct grants to agriculture, it was about 30 per cent.  Now it is of the order of 13 per cent of what the Government are spending.  The money the Government are spending comes from the PAYE sector.  The Government are not taking it from the farmers and distributing it to the farming community but from the PAYE sector.  It is not electorally worth a damn curse for this Government to pursue that course.  We will still get only one out of three seats in East Galway.  It is time we copped on to ourselves and said to these people that neither electorally nor morally nor for any other purpose can we continue to justify the existing tax arrangements.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not go far enough.  I am sorry that Mr. Rea has not pushed us even that little bit harder because a very strong backlash is waiting to be unleashed and Mr. Rea has gone a long way towards projecting that backlash.  I am sorry for farmers.  Most farmers are civic minded and will tell you that they want to pay their fair share of taxes, but the IFA leadership has not done anything that reflects well on farmers.  I believe that the PAYE sector marches have been ignored and that some form of special action will have to be taken if we are to do something about this form of financial apartheid which is operating in the tax area where sections of the community receive priviliged treatment in comparison with other sections who have sought to air their grievences by way of orderly protests which were not listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was disgusting to see people turning out in big numbers last week to vote for a party who promised to abolish this land tax if returned to office, and to see Dublin people in big numbers being conned into voting for that party who want to continue to operate under this tax regime a form of apartheid comparable to the way <Col N="2380" /> coloured people are treated in South Africa.  That is what it amounts to.  Time and time again a privileged group in this community have exercised the veto, and those who are being discriminated against have been foolish enough to support a party who have pledged themselves to continue to screw them into the ground.</P>
    <P>During the period of Government 1973-1977, my party introduced capital gains tax, wealth tax, a capital acquisitions tax, corporation tax and farmer taxation. The electorate did not thank us for trying to introduce a fair tax regime and in 1977 we were thrown out.  Capital gains tax was mitigated to a great extent by the then Government.  The wealth tax was repealed.  The capital acquisitions tax was mitigated to a great extent.  Corporation tax has not kept pace with inflation and farmer tax is less than 5 per cent of income and not worth a curse.  The community must take a certain amount of responsibility for the way the tax regime operates because they tolerated the Fianna Fáil Government who between 1977 and 1981 removed fair and equitable tax provisions in the wealth and capital areas generally.</P>
    <P>The people accepted that and continued to accept it and turned out in big numbers last week to support that party despite the fact that, during the campaign, the Leader of the Opposition said he would abolish the land tax.  It is not the first time they have done it.  They mitigated capital gains tax, and abolished wealth tax.  Steps taken to introduce tax equity have not been supported by the general public, so they must bear a certain amount of responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>If the level of PAYE continues as it is compared to the level of taxation being contributed by the farming group we, as joint parties in Government, will have to look jointly at where we are going.  We simply cannot continue to tolerate people who are paying less than 5 per cent of their income in taxation screaming blue murder and threatening blackmail on TDs at their clinics because of an attempt to bring them up even one rung of the ladder on the way to a farm tax system. Something is seriously wrong, and we <Col N="2381" /> may well have to bring the whole thing to confrontation sooner rather than later, rather than wait for Mr. Rea to do so.</P>
    <P>Does Mr. Rea think people are sitting around shivering?  If the road is confrontation we may as well have it now because right is on the side of those who are already being screwed into the ground. Very soon we will need a joint session of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties to look at the whole question of the PAYE tax contribution and the blackguarding we have been getting from the IFA leadership to the detriment of farmers.  This Bill helps.  It is a start, but it is only one rung on the ladder and we have a long way to go to get tax equity.  I do not mind explaining to my constituents that they have to pay high tax because, if the Government spend £10,000 million they must get in £10,000 million, but I mind having to explain to them that there is not a fair tax regime.  There is not a fair tax regime.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell has said many of the things I would like to say on this Farm Tax Bill surprisingly enough, or maybe not surprisingly.  He has a good insight into the IFA and knows what they have been doing.  He represents a constituency in Dublin, like mine, which is a deprived area with a level of poverty not seen in many farming areas. Those at work are paying exceptionally high rates of tax to which I will be referring. Therefore, there is great resentment on the tax question.  I have repeated this a number of times.  What people resent <Col N="2382" /> most is not the level of taxation but the fact that one sector pays all the tax and another does not pay.  People are prepared to make great sacrifices if they believe that the sacrifices are necessary for the country's sake, but if people in receipt of pensions and social welfare benefits are not contributing to the State anything like the level required there is great resentment. The question is asked continuously in places like Ballyfermot why only 1 per cent of working class children in Dublin can get a third level education despite the fact that the average PAYE earner is paying £1,800 taxation in the year. Deputy Michael Noonan was told in reply to a parliamentary question last year that there were 44,194 farmers in the tax net, the average payment charge was £570 and the actual amount they paid was £430 per farmer.  Their participation in third level education is ten times higher than that of the urban working class person in Dublin.  This is what causes such great resentment among the PAYE workers who are paying more than their share and yet they see those paying less than their share getting the same services plus grants and various incentives.</P>
      <P>Mr. Joe Rea has been emphasising the fact that we have been calling for land tax for many years.  I would like to give a very warm welcome to the land tax which is to be introduced at last.  Unfortunately its provisions are so weak and ineffective in many ways we cannot summon any enthusiasm for the Bill before the House.  The intention is apparently to use it to replace the loss of agricultural rates.  I suppose at best it may just about recoup the loss in agricultural rates to the Exchequer.  It could be just as ineffective as the property tax with all the complex procedures involved in the Bill.  The property tax only brought in £1.6 million last year.  That is not the major defect in it.  It is also seems to be replacing income tax which, as far as we are concerned, is not the purpose of the land tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We acknowledge that the Bill is introducing the principle of a land tax and that it is a step forward.  We support the principle involved and we will seek to <Col N="2383" /> improve the Bill on Committee Stage. The Bill is published against the background of the type of tax regime to which I was referring.  In 1984 the PAYE sector paid 85.5 per cent of all income tax, the self-employed paid 13 per cent and the farmers paid a mere 1.5 per cent.  That 1.5 per cent is a reducing amount.  In 1980 it was still a very small amount.  In that year the farming income tax was just over 2 per cent.  The PAYE tax element has been an increasing amount.  In 1979 the average tax payment by the PAYE worker was £915 and the average for a farmer was £488.  By 1983 the figure had gone to £1,875 for the PAYE worker and, as I pointed out here, in the year 1983-84 the average demand of the 44,194 farmers was £570 and the average payment was £430 per farmer and no income tax at all was paid by the remaining 120,000 farmers.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the total amount of tax taken from the PAYE sector was £648 million which had risen by 1984 to £1,682 million. That was an increase of 106 per cent.  At the same time wages and salaries had gone up from £4,379 million in 1979 to £8,610 million in 1984, an increase of 97 per cent.  There was an increase in wages and salaries between 1979 and 1984 of 97 per cent and there was an increase in tax of 106 per cent in the same period.  What happened in relation to the farming sector?  There was an actual decrease.  In 1979 the total tax taken from farmers was £52 million, which included £36 million in agricultural rates.  By 1984, with the abolition of rates, the total tax taken from farmers was down to £30 million, a reduction of 42 per cent; yet in those years income from agriculture increased from £759 million to an estimated £1,250 million.  They had an increase in incomes of 65 per cent and a reduction in tax of 42 per cent in that period.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder there has been anger and bitterness among the PAYE sector? Is it any wonder they get so mad when Mr. Joe Rea appears on television with loud bullyboy tactics saying that farmers will not pay any more tax?  If we take the 1979 figures as a base and if farmers' tax <Col N="2384" /> had risen in line with the overall increase in tax they would have paid £115.4 million in 1984 instead of £30 million.  If farmers' tax had risen in line with the increase in the PAYE sector they would have paid £135.2 million in 1984 instead of £30 million. If farmers' tax had risen in line with inflation they would have paid £104 million in 1984.  It did not rise in line with any of these.</P>
    <P>The farming sector is very definitely a separate sector.  Joe Rea and the IFA say they should be treated like everybody else, not separately.  Deputy O'Kennedy said the same thing this morning, that this land tax is treating farmers as if they were a separate sector.  They certainly are a very special separate sector and are treated as such in Europe.  They are the only sector who are not subjected to market forces and are totally protected under the CAP.  They are exceptional and there is no reason why they should not be treated as such in the matter of taxation to ensure that the system produces a tax yield from the farming community in accordance with their income and their land holding and the necessity to make such holdings productive.</P>
    <P>We have always believed in a land tax, not just to produce income for the Exchequer &mdash; that is one aspect &mdash; but as a weapon to encourage the more efficient use of agricultural land, our greatest natural resource.  Here is the nub of the question.  It is our land, the land for which people in urban areas fought as well as those in rural areas, the land for which people in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway fought as well as those in Clare, Tipperary, Galway and elsewhere.  It belongs to all the people.  This was recognised throughout our history, by James Fintan Lawlor and by Davitt at the beginning of the Land League campaign.  He wanted to ensure that the land would become the right of all the people of this country.  A similar view was held by James Connolly and Patrick Pearse in 1916.  Let not people think they can hide behind Patrick Pearse in their republicanism and reject Connolly.  Pearse accepted totally the concept of Connolly and wrote about it in his pamphlet <i>The Sovereign <Col N="2385" /> People.</i> What does a &ldquo;sovereign people&rdquo; mean? It means the people have sovereignty over all this country, over the land and the mineral wealth, from the sod to the sky.  While farmers have holdings of land, it is only by the agreement of the people.  Therefore they must use that land, not just for their own personal good or personal aggrandisement but for the good of the whole country, the common good.  That is written into the Constitution, no matter what way they try to get around it.  Private property is supposed to be used for the common good, particularly our land, our greatest natural resource which should be the very basis of our industrialisation and job creation policy.</P>
    <P>The farming community have a special obligation and responsibility to the nation.  Joe Rea and the IFA do not in any way give an indication that they have a responsibility to anybody.  They claim the land is theirs by right.  It is not theirs by right &mdash; it is theirs by the will of the people and they must understand that. The people are entitled to charge a rent for that land, call it a land tax or a resource tax or whatever.  The people are entitled to ensure that the land is used productively and not wasted.  It must be used for the benefit of the people.  With such rich land in this country there should be no poverty in any area, in my constituency or Deputy Mitchell's constituency or anywhere else.  We have sufficient wealth for all our people if it is used and developed properly.  A land tax is the very minimum that this House should be entitled to impose on the farming community as part of the stick to ensure that the land is used to its full potential.</P>
    <P>The major flaw in this Bill is that it is seen as a method of collecting money from farmers and as a replacement for income tax, so that farmers will not have to keep accounts and produce books for the income tax authorities.  The poor farmers are not able to do this sort of thing. They are incapable of keeping accounts, yet every little shopkeeper with far less wealth and property, less education and a much smaller turnover is supposed to be able to do all this and has to keep <Col N="2386" /> accounts of VAT, taxation and PRSI. The farming community are supposed to be too ignorant to do it.  Far more farmers and their sons and daughters have a third level education than in any other sector. It is not that they are too ignorant to keep accounts but simply that they do not want anybody to know what is happening or what they are getting.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that Joe Rea, for instance, told us what his income is every year and how much tax he pays?  He is very quick to publicise to the whole country how much the workers in the co-ops are getting when they look for a higher wage or threaten to stike.  What is Joe Rea's income and how much tax did he pay last year or in any year?  It is time we had publication of the amount of land held by farmers and their income.  The income of everybody employed by this State and semi-State companies is public knowledge. Why should the farming community be the exception?  The reason they do not want to keep accounts is that they do not want their income to be known. There is no reason why they should not keep accounts and pay income tax in accordance with their income.</P>
    <P>The land tax should be separate from the income tax code and not seen as a replacement of income tax for some farmers. It is wrong that those with less than 80 adjusted acres will not pay any income tax.  Very many farmers will benefit from this Bill.  The Government have estimated that only 10 per cent of farmers &mdash; 15,000 &mdash; will be liable for income tax if this Bill is passed.  That is a very retrograde step going back to the situation in 1977 or 1978 when only farmers who had a rateable valuation above £75 were assessable for income tax.  If the income tax and the rates payable in 1978-79 were indexed to retain their real value, the total farm tax yield would have exceeded £100 million in 1984.  According to the Minister, the total estimated take in 1987 will at best be in the order of £60 million or £65 million.  We already pointed out that they paid £52 million in 1979, so looking for £65 million in 1987 is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>The procedures for reclassifying actual <Col N="2387" /> acres into adjusted acres are exceptionally complex and will take a very long time to implement.  When they are implemented, the appeals procedures, etc. will take up a lot of the time of the courts and it is unlikely that anything will be taken in in the first couple of years.  The Agricultural Institute have published an interesting little booklet called <i>Irish Agriculture in Figures</i> and the 1983 issue quotes gross margins per acre in certain enterprises in farming.  It gives the margins for the various crops, wheat, feed barley, malting barley, sugar beet, creamery milk and so on.  The last figures available are for 1982 and, in that year, the gross margins per acre were: £214 per acre for wheat, £340 per acre for sugar beet, £293 per acre for creamery milk and so on.  It was exceptionally low for cattle.  £93 per acre.  These figures obviously increased since then.  For instance, the Agricultural Institute reported that farm income from full time farms increased by 15 per cent in 1983, so obviously there is a 15 per cent increase on the prices of the commodities to which I referred.  Even based on the 1982 figures, it is clear that a farmer with 80 acres &mdash; I am not talking about adjusted acres &mdash; could have a gross income of £24,000 per annum.  If you allow for farm inputs, this would still leave him with a net income well in excess of the national average and yet, under this Bill, that farmer will now face a maximum tax bill of £800 irrespective of what he earns. As I said, with the complex system of classification and appeals through tribunals and the High Court, it will be a bureaucratic quagmire.  You may be quite sure it will be exploited to the full by solicitors, lawyers and accountants.</P>
    <P>Nobody begrudges farmers the support and assistance necessary to make agriculture more efficient and neither can anyone deny that there are farmers living in circumstances of poverty.  However, farmers with substantial holdings &mdash; and there is no doubt that Joe Rea has a very substantial holding &mdash; and good incomes continue to expect lavish support from the Exchequer while refusing to acknowledge <Col N="2388" /> that they must pay a fair share of taxation.  That is intolerable and must be ended.</P>
    <P>Despite the hundreds of millions of pounds invested by the State in agriculture, the level of net agricultural production has shown virtually no increase since 1975.  However, farm incomes have continued to grow by as much as 15 per cent. At the same time, the IFA have waged a ruthlessly effective campaign to resist any demands that they should pay their fair share of tax.  They blocked the resource tax which was brought in and it was then abolished by Fianna Fáil.  The farmers refused to pay it and none was brought to court although people in urban areas who do not pay water rates are being brought to court.  An honest 10 per cent of farmers paid something in the region of £700,000 &mdash; the income from the resource tax was estimated at £7 million which was a minimal tax which farmers would not have noticed &mdash; and the farmers who paid the resource tax had their money refunded to them by Fianna Fáil when they abolished the tax.  Let us hope they will do the same for people who paid water charges when they abolish them as they promised to do.  The 2 per cent levy was also blocked and they are now blocking the land tax.  They just refused to pay any tax.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been used as allies on different occasions in regard to tax.  The Coalition introduces the resource tax, so the farmers voted for Fianna Fáil who abolished it.  Fianna Fáil brought in the 2 per cent levy and there were howls of opposition from Fine Gael who were in opposition at that time.  They allied themselves with the farmers and, of course, Fianna Fáil, backed down on the 2 per cent levy.  The IFA used the two conservative parties to get away with paying no taxes.  In the recent local elections Fianna Fáil, possibly thinking of the 1987 general election, totally surrendered to the IFA on the land tax issue, but I do not know if it will do them much good.</P>
    <P>The larger farmers, the 15,000 who will have to pay income tax as well as the land tax, are those whom Joe Rea is screaming about and whom Fianna Fáil <Col N="2389" /> are now backing.  Joe Rea and the larger ranchers have consistently refused to pay tax and have used the 110,000 farmers who were never in the tax net as bait and cannon fodder by telling them that they will be taxed to the hilt and driven off their holdings.</P>
    <P>The most cynical thing of all, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, is that they make their deal with the IFA and then come back to Dublin pretending that they are against the land tax because it will not take enough from the farmers.  They say that is why they are against it.  They tell the people in Dublin that they want to take more from the farmers, but down the country they tell the people that they do not want to have them taxed at all. They get away with it and the people in both areas seem to believe them &mdash; just as Kerry people believe Deputy Charlie Haughey is a Kerryman, the Dublin people believe he is a Dublinman, Castlebar people think he is a Mayoman and the people in Tyrone say he is from that county.  The party can do the same thing and be all things to all people everywhere. I suppose they will get away with it for a while longer, but it was a most cynical effort to fool the urban working class into thinking that they were defending their interests when in fact they were defending the interests of the larger farmers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil say there is only minority support for the introduction of the land tax.  I do not know how they worked that out.  If they believe that the thousands of workers who marched a few years ago against the PAYE rate of taxation have forgotten, that their demands are dead and gone and nobody is thinking of them any more, they are very wrong.  The people are thinking and asking why the trade union movement did not support that campaign.  They showed by taking to the streets that they were prepared to fight against this enormous burden of taxation. Those people want to know why the trade union movement let them down.  They believe the movement should have pushed that campaign to the limit, even to the extent of a general <Col N="2390" /> strike.  People in working class areas say they have been let down by the politicians, the Governments, and that they expected more militancy from the trade union leadership.</P>
    <P>However, that does not mean that they have sat down on the campaign.  They are thinking of how to fight against the system.  They are using many ruses in different places and there has been a growth in the black economy, which is one way of defeating it.  Fianna Fáil are making a great mistake if they think that those who marched in the PAYE protests have sat down, accepted and surrendered to the tax burden and are prepared to let everybody else get away with it.  They are not and Fianna Fáil are making a major mistake if they think that only a minority support the introduction of a land tax.  At their peril they will accept such an idea because they will be shown quickly that it is not true.</P>
    <P>Many people have deplored the animosity that appears to have developed in recent years between farmers and workers. It is something that should never have been allowed to develop.  One of the main factors leading to the animosity and resentment was the persistent refusal, and, in particular, the abrasive attitude, of the leader of the IFA, to agree to any system suggested in recent years. That refusal is causing more animosity by urban workers against the farming community. Unfortunately, only a small number of militant big farmers are fighting this campaign, but nevertheless urban workers view it as being all farmers who are objecting.  I have spoken to many farmers who have said that they realise they should be paying more tax but they were not going to offer the tax.  Nobody would expect them to approach Deputy Dukes and say: &ldquo;Here is some tax for you&rdquo;.  The vast majority of farmers are prepared to accept a fair and just tax system.  The majority of them are reasonable people who understand that they are getting more than their fair share out of the economy and are prepared to put their fair share into it.  They are embarrassed by Joe Rea's performance and by the lashing and refusal to pay any tax. <Col N="2391" /> They are embarrassed by the kowtowing of political parties to Joe Rea and the IFA instead of telling them: &ldquo;This is the tax and you will pay it or go to jail like anybody else&rdquo;.  That is what will have to be done with it or otherwise the division between urban workers and farmers will develop.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that farmers are the only people who are not paying their fair share of taxation.  There are many others such as self-employed, professional people and speculators of one kind or another who are getting away without paying their fair share of taxation.  Capital taxes have been continuously reduced in the last ten years and the wealth tax was abolished.  There are some benefits in the land tax.  I am not satisfied with the restrictions in it, but it represents a step in the right direction &mdash; the principle is more important than the revenue it will yield, which will be relatively small.  Certainly, it will be less than should be taken from the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about land that has been reclaimed.  We are all aware of the crippling effect of taxation here.  The sad truth is that taxation here is the highest in western Europe.  I agree that farmers have to pay tax but I am concerned about the classified adjusted acres.  Many farmers in my constituency in the last ten years reclaimed land and obtained grants under the farm modernisation scheme to do so. Those farmers may have between 20 and 50 acres that are very good today but ten years ago that land was marshy and rough.  I am concerned about such people.  After the commissioners visit such holdings to classify those adjusted acres I have no doubt that the owners will have to pay more tax than they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in the region of 160,000 farmers here but in the sixties there were 500,000.  What has happened?  Farmers have been driven off the land in rural Ireland because they were unable to make a living on their small holdings. Up to now the Land Commission took over land and distributed it to make small holdings <Col N="2392" /> viable, but the Land Commission has been abolished.  That was a sad day for the farming community.  I hope the Minister will ensure that small farmers will not have to pay £10 on their adjusted acres.  I do not know how the system will work for such people.  The fairest taxation system for farmers here would be the accounts system.  A farmer with 60 or 70 acres of good arable land is not paying big money when paying £10 per adjusted acre if he is a dairy farmer.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £18,448,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including certain services administered by that office and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose as in previous years to discuss the Fisheries and Forestry Estimates together and I shall move the Forestry Estimate at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      <P>The amount provided for the Fisheries Vote this year represents an increase of 13 per cent over last year's outturn and will be adequate to continue the development of our sea and inland fisheries resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1984 the value of landings of sea fish, excluding salmon, at ports at home and abroad by Irish registered vessels was £55 million.  The value of exports <Col N="2393" /> of fish and fish products during the year was £85.7 million.  The principal export outlets continued to be France, Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and, outside the EC, Nigeria, Spain, Sweden and Egypt.</P>
    <P>The importance of promoting the fish processing industry as a means of adding value to our fish landings and increasing employment in the fishing industry is recognised fully by the Government.  To that end generous State and EC (FEOGA) grant aid is available for approved projects.  Investment in shore base processing facilities continued in 1984.  During the year seven fish processing projects &mdash; all in Gaeltacht areas &mdash; involving a total capital commitment of £3 million which included State grants amounting to £0.7 million, were approved for EC (FEOGA) grant aid of £1.5 million.  I urge our industrialists to consider this area of economic enterprise to the benefit of themselves and the nation.</P>
    <P>The promotion of marketing of our fish and fish products at home and abroad by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) continues as an on-going priority item of Government policy.  An increased financial allocation has been made in 1985 to BIM in accordance with the Government's programme <i>Building on Reality.</i> The extra funds for marketing will enable BIM to increase our development work in the home and export markets and so broaden our national fishery marketing base.</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee on Marketing, which comprises representatives of all sectors of the industry, continue to meet under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael D'Arcy, Minister of State at my Department, and make valuable practical suggestions for the improvement of marketing arrangements for fish.</P>
    <P>The Egyptian market for bulk frozen mackerel, which is the highest volume species landed by the Irish fleet, has been reopened with significant exports to date in 1985.  In the case of the important Nigerian market for our frozen mackerel import licensing difficulties were experienced in early 1984.  At my request, marketing officers of Bord Iascaigh Mhara visited Nigeria to investigate the situation. <Col N="2394" /> Subsequently the licensing difficulties were resolved and I am pleased to say that the Nigerian market for our frozen mackerel opened up again in August 1984 and no problems have been experienced since.</P>
    <P>Exports of herring to Poland have increased substantially.  In the promotion of the Polish market for our fish the Minister of State at my Department visited Poland in 1984 and the Polish Minister for Fisheries visited Ireland in March 1985 in continuance of the trade talks.  Within the EC our exports to France have increased substantially and now account for about 27 per cent of our total exports.  Accompanied by BIM marketing officials I visited France in 1984 to promote the market there.  In early 1984 I visited Japan also in the interest of market promotion.  I am pleased to say that the established export trade with Japan in herring roe has been successfully broadened to include such high value shellfish products as crab and Dublin Bay prawns.  The USA market is also receiving attention and exports to that country have trebled over the past three years.</P>
    <P>During 1984 Bord Iascaigh Mhara continued their work of developing the home market for fish by such means as advertising and publicity, consumer education, fish cookery and advisory service, training courses for the distributive trade, and retail fish distribution and advisory service.</P>
    <P>The board's market promotion strategy is aimed at increasing the consumption of fish at home by creating a national awareness of fish as a valuable wholesome food, suitable for use at any meal. The success of the board's work in so increasing the demand for fish at home depends largely on close co-operation between BIM and the fish trade.  I therefore exhort fish traders to co-operate fully with Bord Iascaigh Mhara in their market development work at home and abroad. In the area of marketing I would like to stress the importance of quality and presentation at all stages of sale.  With notable exceptions the grading and handling <Col N="2395" /> of fish leaves a lot to be desired and I would urge all sections of the industry to take steps to remedy this situation in their own and in the national interest.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of Government policy to develop the sea fishing industry to its fullest extent my support continues for the on-going programme of fishery harbour development.  The amount allocated this year in subhead C.2 of the Vote for fishery harbour improvements is £2,700,000.  This sum is provided to pay for work in progress at the start of the year and to commence some urgently needed new work.</P>
    <P>During 1984 the work on the Howth development was completed with the exception of the final testing of the syncrolift, the installation of the ice plant and resurfacing as necessary.  Work on the syncrolift and the ice plant was completed recently and the necessary resurfacing is going ahead.  At Castletownbere storage accommodation for machinery and toilet facilities were provided.</P>
    <P>In 1984 also harbour works were undertaken at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford; Cahirciveen, Cashen and Scraggane, County Kerry; Seafield, County Clare; Dooneen, Youghal and Garnish, County Cork; Skerries, County Dublin; Kilcummin and Rathlacken, County Mayo; and Rathmullen and Portmore, County Donegal.  Site investigation works were undertaken at Schull, County Cork and at Carrigaholt, County Clare.  At the end of 1984 works were in progress at Killala, Inch Island, Bone Rock and Belderrig, County Mayo and at Portevlin, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>For 1985 I have approved a comprehensive programme of harbour improvement works.  This programme provides for the completion of works in hand and includes major development works at Greencastle, County Donegal, and Schull, County Cork, and the provision of a syncrolift at Killybegs, County Donegal.  As well provision has been made for further site investigations at Clogherhead, County Louth, and initial investigation at Darby's Point, County Mayo, and for works of a lesser degree <Col N="2396" /> at various other harbours and fish landing places.  Work on these projects will commence as soon as the necessary financial arrangements have been finalised.</P>
    <P>BIM will provide funds of approximately £4.8 million by way of investment in the fleet.  The main thrust of investment will be directed towards the modernisation and re-equipping of existing vessels.  Additional funds cannot be provided towards the construction of new vessels which require BIM loan finance, because of the substantially reduced repayments by existing vessels.  For the same reason, it has been found necessary to assign £2.5 million of the £4.8 million referred to above to meet instalments due by fishermen in respect of bank loans which have been guaranteed by the board.</P>
    <P>The scope of the board's marine credit plan has been increased to cater for white fishing vessels up to 33 metres in length and if a suitable proposal is received for such a vessel, which would qualify for a FEOGA grant, the board would be in a position to provide the necessary grant finance this year in respect of such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Recognising the difficulties being encountered by large segments of the fleet in meeting their financial obligations, the Government agreed a package of aid measures earlier this year involving the full remission of excise duty on fuel oil used in fishing and extra funds for marketing, exploratory fishing and harbour development, together with a re-vamping of loan repayments arrangements under BIM's marine credit plan involving extra subsidies on interest rates for a three year period.  I am confident that this package of measures will bring the vast majority of fishermen back to economic viability before too long.  BIM are in the process of finalising agreements with the banks and individual fishermen for the implementation of the new loan arrangements.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Common Fisheries Policy, the agreement on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas for 1985 at the Council of 19 December 1984 represented a major breakthrough, being the <Col N="2397" /> first occasion upon which TACs and quotas were introduced before the start of the fishing year.  The fact that this was achieved under the Irish Presidency gives cause for satisfaction.  In regard to the details of the quotas, I am convinced that we got a reasonable result, given the state of some of our stocks, particularly mackerel, which is such a vital component of the industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the comparatively new surveillance force of EC inspectors is already beginning to make its presence felt and has, for instance, clearly identified cases of over-fishing by some member states.  The Community's conservation policies, in particular, are the main guarantee of the availability of stocks in the future.  We know that the mere introduction of regulations does not ensure compliance with those regulations in spite of the best efforts of national Governments and we therefore welcome the additional assistance which the EC inspectorate can provide.</P>
    <P>There is one other area which, while it does not strictly come within my writ, is nevertheless of great concern to me.  I refer, of course, to the accession of Spain and Portugal and, in particular, the implications for the fisheries sector.  It must first be clearly stated that there was already a political decision dating back to 1979 to admit Spain and Portugal to the Community.  Thus our task was to agree the details of accession in the various sectors, including fisheries which proved to be particularly difficult.  We have aired these problems in the House on more than one occasion and I do not propose to deal with them in detail now.  However, I think we can take particular satisfaction from the continuation of the Irish box for ten years after accession and the tight restrictions on the number of Spanish vessels permitted to fish in our general area, which will be limited to less than 100 until the next century when the whole Common Fisheries Policy falls to be renegotiated.</P>
    <P>The negotiations were long and tedious and I take the opportunity of paying tribute to my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State, <Col N="2398" /> for their efforts in achieving agreed terms which represent a very acceptable deal for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Work is continuing apace in my Department on the drafting of a new White Paper on Fisheries Development reflecting the views expressed in the reports of the Sectoral Development Committee and the Sectoral Consultative Committee on Fisheries.  I would hope that this document will be available for publication later this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record my appreciation of the valuable work performed by all the staffs engaged in fishing protection duties, namely the Naval Service, the Garda and officers of the various fishery boards.</P>
    <P>The interest in fish farming up and down the county remains high and generous grants will continue to be available for both pilot and commercial scale projects to enable further development to take place in 1985.  I am glad to say that a start has been made with the implementation of the designation process provided for under the 1980 Fisheries Act and I am hopeful that further progress can be made with this and with licensing of individual projects in the current year. A number of public inquiries were held during the course of 1984 at which substantial objections were raised and I would hope that the series can be completed this year and the process of making designation orders proceeded with.  I would like to stress here that until such time as a designation order has been made it is not possible to proceed with individual licensing in any area.</P>
    <P>I now turn to inland fisheries.  The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, which were set up in October 1980, continue to work for the better conservation, protection and development of every aspect of our valuable inland fisheries.  A total of £4,445,000 is allocated to the boards in 1985.  I am glad to say that, in accordance with section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, the staff scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards was agreed to by both management and <Col N="2399" /> unions in December 1984 and is now being implemented.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of our inland fisheries is our salmon fisheries. Catch figures for 1984 show that the total weight of the salmon catch by all methods was 844 tonnes valued at £4.7 million as compared with 1,515 tonnes valued at £6.7 million in 1983.  This decrease of around 44 per cent on the 1983 catch is a cause of major concern.  In view of this, if salmon stocks are to be preserved and rehabilitated there can be no relaxation in the various conservation measures at present in force and, indeed, more stringent measures may be necessary.  Illegal salmon fishing continues to be a major factor in the decline of salmon stocks and I am considering what further steps can be taken to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I have recently had a meeting with the Central Fisheries Board which represents all aspects of inland fishing and the views of the board to improve the way in which our salmon fisheries are managed will be considered in the context of the White Paper on Fisheries now being prepared. The development of our trout, coarse and eel fisheries are also of great importance and will be covered in the White Paper. The contribution of well managed fisheries to the welfare of our people in providing excellent leisure activity cannot be measured in pounds and pence.  The revenue from tourism can and the benefits to the economy are considerable.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the control of water pollution rests with the Department of the Environment and the local authorities. However, the fisheries boards continue to play a leading role in the battle against water pollution in the interests of protecting fish life.</P>
    <P>Progress continues in the rehabilitation of Lough Sheelin as a major trout fishery. The slurry transport subsidy scheme operated by the Lough Sheelin Management Committee had, by the time it ceased operation on 31 December 1984, succeeded in restoring the lake to an acceptable condition.  I am pleased to be able to say that approximately 52 million gallons of excess slurry were removed <Col N="2400" /> from the Sheelin catchment under the scheme since its inception in December 1980.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the improvement in the condition of the lake is maintained, a new management committee for the Lough Sheelin catchment has been set up by Cavan County Council.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Incorporated continues its research into the biology of the salmon and the factors relevant to its future survival as a species. A grant-in-aid of £70,000 is allocated to the trust for 1985.  Since 1972 the trust has been funded on a 50-50 basis by my Department and Arthur Guinness and Sons Limited.  This agreement expired at the end of 1984 and a new agreement was reached between my Department and Messrs. Guinness.  This ensures that the trust will continue its work as heretofore for the next five years to the end of 1989 when its future will be reconsidered. During this five year period the financial commitment of Messrs. Guinness will be met by way of transfer to the trust of some capital assets valued at an estimated £144,000.  These include a smolt rearing station which it is estimated will yield a profit to the trust of £45,000 in 1985 and a similar amount in future years.</P>
    <P>A sum of £142,000 is included in the Estimate to meet our contribution towards the expenses of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  It will be paid to the commission to offset part of its 1985 deficit.  The Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland will be paying a grant to the commission to meet the balance of its 1985 deficit.  I am satisfied that the commission is continuing to do everything possible to keep its annual deficit to a minimum consistent with fulfilling its obligations under the Foyle Fisheries Acts to conserve and manage the fisheries in the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the Forestry Vote for 1985.  The gross total being provided for forestry for the current financial year amounts to £49.406 million which represents an increase of 4 per cent over the <Col N="2401" /> provisional outturn of expenditure in 1984.  However, as in previous years, the demand on the Exchequer will, as I shall explain later, be reduced by some £14 million, arising mainly through timber sales and some other lesser sources of revenue such as rents from grazing and shooting lettings, the sale of foresters' houses and sales of surplus plants.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the main elements of the Forestry Vote, I think it would be appropriate at this juncture to refer briefly to a very important development since last year, namely, the establishment of the special review group on forestry.  In accordance with Government policy, as set out in <i>Building on Reality 1985-87,</i> the group, with membership from inside and outside the public service, has been set up to examine and report on the structure, organisation and operation of the Forest and Wildlife Service and to make recommendations on the most appropriate methods of exploiting the expanding forestry asset to the best national advantage.</P>
    <P>The establishment of this broadlybased review group is in line with the Government's overall strategy for promoting the national economic well-being and reflects a continuing commitment to promoting the ongoing development of our indigenous resources.  The progress of the State forest estate over the past decades has now reached the point where wood production &mdash; both pulpwood and sawlog &mdash; has begun to expand rapidly. The review group is taking a fresh and objective appraisal of the entire structure of the Forest and Wildlife Service and will put forward proposals aimed at ensuring that the organisation will be geared to the challenges of the future.  The group's deliberations are now well advanced and I have no doubt that their findings will be of major benefit in helping to chart the way ahead.  I await eagerly the outcome of their deliberations.</P>
    <P>I will now comment on the more important subheads of the Forestry Vote and, in doing so, I shall have something to say about the timber scene generally. Needless to say I will be happy, when replying to the debate, to deal with any <Col N="2402" /> lesser points on which Deputies may require information.</P>
    <P>Salaries, wages and allowances are provided for under subhead A.1.  the amount proposed for 1985, namely, £11.728 million represents a small reduction on the corresponding provision last year.  The overall staff complement has been reduced somewhat but the current year's provision takes account of salary increases operative from 1 January 1985.</P>
    <P>The next subhead which call for comment is B.I, which caters for travelling and incidental expenses and for which an increased provision of £298,000 is being made.  The major element of the subhead concerns travelling &mdash; and more particularly home travel &mdash; which is an inescapable feature of forestry operations, including such activities as inspection work of various kinds, marking of timber for sale, supervision of felling and extraction operations and so on.  It is particularly important that adequate funding be provided for these purposes to ensure an efficient service to the public and to generate maximum revenue for the FWS. I should point out that the level of expenditure incurred on foreign travel is quite low and arises mainly in the context of the need to service EC and other international organisations with which the FWS are involved.</P>
    <P>In subhead B.2 the increased provision for postal and telecommunications services reflects, apart from increased charges by An Post and Bord Telecom, the countrywide nature of the Forest and Wildlife Service activities.  Postal and telecommunications charges are expected to cost £793,000 in 1985 or 22 per cent more than in 1984.</P>
    <P>Subhead B.3 provides £270,000 for the purchase of office machinery and other office supplies.  There is an increase of 28 per cent over last year, the bulk of which is attributable to the provision of some essential computerisation facilities in the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.1 takes the form of a grant-in-aid for acquisition of land.  Under this heading a sum of £4.25 million is being provided which, when added to a balance of about £0.80 million remaining in the <Col N="2403" /> acquisition fund since last year, makes a total of £5.05 million available for the purchase of land for afforestation in 1985.</P>
    <P>While in present financial circumstances an allocation of this order, which exceeds last year's provision by £775,000, must be regarded as extremely creditable, the level of land intake still continues to be inadequate, especially having regard to the existing plantable land reserve situation.  However, I can assure the House that the money being provided for this purpose will be used to the best possible advantage in the interests of consolidating and expanding the national forest estate.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1984 contracts between my Department and landowners for the purchase of land for forestry purposes stood at 8,000 hectares, 20,000 acres, and it is estimated that some 6,250 hectares, 15,625 acres, will come into the possession of the Forest and Wildlife Service in 1985.  I would very much like to see a substantial increase in this level and I will continue to use my best endeavours to secure even more generous funding for land acquisition in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.2 makes provision for forest development and management and the proposed amount namely £27.687 million, accounts for almost 75 per cent of the total nett Vote.  Not surprisingly, this subhead invariably proves to be the focal point of the debate on the Forestry Estimate as it embraces the wide range of activities inseparable from the development and management of the national forest estate, which now stands at almost one million acres.</P>
    <P>As the breakdown in the Estimates volume of the various components of the subhead is largely self-explanatory, I do not propose to go into it in detail but there are a few aspects to which I would like to refer specifically.</P>
    <P>In the context of part (1) of the subhead &mdash; which provides funds for my Department's 14 nurseries which produce the plant supply for the State afforestation programme &mdash; it is necessary this year to <Col N="2404" /> include some extra money for the purchase of seed.  The reason for this is that a succession of poor years for home production of seed of some species, particularly Sitka Spruce, has resulted in depleted stocks and purchases from abroad have become necessary to provide seed for current use and for a build up of a reserve stock.</P>
    <P>Part (2) of the subhead relates to the various elements involved in the establishment of plantations, in other words, the current year's planting programme. It is expected that the level of funding proposed, which is at about the same level as last year, will result in the afforestation or reforestation of some 7,000 hectares.  I would draw attention to the fact that, out of the total subhead C.2 provision of £27.687 million, upwards of £19½ million represents wages, reflecting the fact that the Forest and Wildlife Service continues to be a major source of rural employment.  Indeed, the labour content of this subhead, together with the wages provisions in some other minor elements of the Vote, means that the FWS currently has a total workforce of approximately 2,450, the majority of whom are engaged in manual and machine operations at 246 forest centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another facet of subhead C2 which merits special mention &mdash; and one in which Deputies on all sides of the House usually show a very keen interest &mdash; is the forest amenity programme provided for in part (3) of the subhead.  Some 20 years have passed since my Department originally decided to exploit the amenity and recreational potential of State forests in the public interest.  It has been an extremely rewarding process achieved at comparatively moderate cost and I am glad to say that progress is continuing satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>At present the Forest and Wildlife Service is primarily concerned with the upkeep of a network of 11 forest parks and more than 400 other lesser amenity developments which have been provided throughout the country.  Over 90 per cent of the relevant provision relates to labour costs necessary to maintain these amenity <Col N="2405" /> areas in the interests of the 1.5 to 2 million visitors who use them annually.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned a proposal to provide a holiday chalet complex in Killykeen Forest Park, County Cavan.  I am pleased to say that work on this project, which is being assisted by the EC Regional Fund and which involves the construction of 20 self-catering wooden chalets, made almost exclusively from Irish timber, is now at an advanced stage. I have no doubt that, when operational, this novel and exciting development will considerably enhance the economy of the locality.  I am also pleased to say that my Department, again with assistance from the EC Regional Fund, is actively considering the establishment of a long distance walk in the Cooley peninsula.  It is envisaged that this walk will link up with the &ldquo;Ulster Way&rdquo; and eventually with an &ldquo;All-Ireland Way&rdquo;.  It is proposed to include an interpretative centre in the Carlingford district as a feature of the project.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in subhead D for the payment of grants to encourage the expansion and promotion of private forestry. While obviously there has been tremendous progress in the sphere of State afforestation over the years, a contribution of any major significance from the private sector has still to emerge.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious, and indeed quite determined, to see an early substantial increase in the level of private planting and I am encouraged by the interest in such activity which has been shown of late in some quarters and especially by investment agencies.  The available grants are extremely attractive and expert advice is available from technical officers of the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>This makes the slowness of the response to date all the more surprising. I hope later in the year to engage in more intensive publicity for the planting grant schemes but, in the meantime, I urge Deputies, through their normal contacts with landowners and other potential planting agencies, to encourage an interest in forestry in every way they can. In doing so they will be stimulating a <Col N="2406" /> development which will not only benefit those directly involved and their successors but will also augment in a meaningful way the important national asset which woodlands constitute.</P>
    <P>Subhead H covers expenditure on the wildlife conservation programme, the provision for 1985 being £178,000.  A major element of the programme consists of research into wildlife species and their habitats.  The Forest and Wildlife Service has recently compiled a comprehensive list of areas of importance for wildlife throughout the country and the appropriate maps have been sent to all planning authorities.  While, due to prevailing constraints, progress in giving statutory protection to a representative sample of these sites has not been as rapid as I would wish, nevertheless some progress has been possible.  I am pleased to say that in the past year the number of nature reserves established under the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been brought to 21 and these reserves are now being managed by the Department to ensure the conservation of the important ecosystems which they constitute.  Further areas are being examined by my Department with a view to granting them nature reserve status during the year.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our international obligations as a member of the European Community and our contractual commitments under international conventions ratified by Ireland, nature conservation cannot be regarded solely as a national responsibility.  My Department are responsible for implementing a range of Community directives and regulations as well as a number of international conventions relating to the protection of wildlife and natural habitats.  During the past year Ireland ratified another such convention, namely, the &ldquo;Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Public interest in wildlife continues to be keen and there is a constant demand for information and literature.  My Department meets this demand by distributing a range of educational leaflets &mdash; a service which is supplemented at a local level by the wildlife ranger corps who, <Col N="2407" /> in addition to giving lectures and advice, contribute articles on wildlife to local newspapers.  Incidentally, subhead G, which provides for game development and management, relates almost entirely to the pay of these wildlife rangers whose duties also include enforcement of the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>The Wildlife Advisory Council, established under section 13 of the Wildlife Act, continues to provide me with on-going advice on various wildlife conservation matters and it would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge wholeheartedly the dedication of this voluntary group and their valuable contribution to the conservation scene.</P>
    <P>Subhead I refers to agency, advisory and special services.  The main provision in the subhead relates to the funding of timber technology research undertaken on behalf of my Department by the IIRS. The expenses of bodies such as the Wildlife Advisory Council and the review group to which I referred earlier are also borne by this subhead.</P>
    <P>I come now to subhead J &mdash; Appropriations in Aid of the Forestry Vote.  As Deputies will see, total receipts for 1985 were projected at £12.861 million, it now seems likely that this forecast, the bulk of which concerns timber sales, may well be undercast and that receipts may turn out to be slightly higher than the eventual outturn for 1984 which amounted to just over £14 million.  Through 1984 the market price of home grown sawlog from the State forests increased steadily in line with the price of imported sawn softwood. This trend continued into the early months of 1985 but now shows some signs of levelling out as the lower level of activity in building continues not only in this country but also in Europe and even further afield.  There is, however, no sign of any general collapse in the price of imported sawnwood although occasionally some small lots at keen prices may be on offer.</P>
    <P>I understand that many highly efficient mills throughout the world are currently operating at a level of no more than 60 per cent of their normal production, with <Col N="2408" /> very tight profit margins.  It would be unrealistic to expect the general scene in Ireland to be different.  Indeed, since there is now substantial excess sawing capacity in this country, the average production level here could conceivably be lower than 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn the attention of the trade here to the problem of national over-capacity in sawing relative to the real availability of sawlog supply from the State forests.  This supply, which amounts to 600,000 cubic metres in the current year &mdash; admittedly somewhat lower than the theoretical annual production &mdash; is the best that can be achieved in the light of various silvicultural and other constraints. There are, however, some 150 mills of varying size and efficiency striving for supplies and, even now, some other individuals are &mdash; unwisely, in my view &mdash; seeking to open additional new mills.  This is quite unrealistic in the prevailing supply situation and there are bound to be some casualties because in a free market only the most efficient can survive.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned at recent reports of sawmill closures, whether temporary or permanent.  I accept of course that these occur for well-founded commercial reasons, but I reject any suggestion that they relate solely to the supply or price of the timber made available by my Department.  Such factors as the prevailing scale of activity in the housing sector, the extent of overheads relative to possible production levels in existing supply and market conditions, the staffing situation in older mills compared with the more modern enterprises using newer technology, product quality and mix, management expertise, production and marketing efficiency &mdash; these are but some of the many complex factors affecting viability and profitability in the timber industry no less than in other industries.</P>
    <P>The policy and practice of my Department in regard to the disposal of State-owned timber has been fully documented in the report of an inter-departmental committee on the tender-quota system of timber sales which was published within the past year and copies of <Col N="2409" /> which I circulated to all Deputies.  Most of the recommendations in that report are in the process of implementation.  Specifically, the sale of timber by auction is being introduced as an addition to the tender system, the first such sale being scheduled for the latter part of next month.  Moreover, the criteria for assessment of sawmills for purposes of awarding quotas are being reviewed by my Department in association with the timber trade itself, the IDA and the IIRS.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, subsidised prices for sawlog sales under the quota scheme have been discontinued and market price is now being charged for such allocations.</P>
    <P>For the moment, however, I have deliberately deferred the setting up of a timber advisory committee as recommended by the inter-departmental committee because I feel it would be more prudent to await the review group's examination of the structure of the Forest and Wildlife Service before doing so.</P>
    <P>I must now refer to repeated criticisms in regard to timber supply contracts entered into by my Department with our two major pulpwood processing concerns, namely, Medite of Europe Limited at Clonmel and Finsa Forest Products Limited in Scariff.  I would remind the House that, when various pulpwoodusing mills closed around the late seventies, no positive interest was shown by Irish enterprise in establishing a replacement outlet for the large volume of pulpwood involved.  Such pulpwood processing outlets are essential to the development of the long term supply of sawlog for the sawmilling industry.  It is normal practice, here and elsewhere, to give some contractual guarantee for a substantial part of the necessary supply in order to attract investment of the magnitude required for pulpmill development. Indeed, such supply contracts reflect both the very high level of investment involved in these mills and also the high production level required in order to establish minimum viability and service the investment.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that, at the time when the contract with the larger of these companies was being negotiated, <Col N="2410" /> there was a serious crisis in Irish forestry with regard to pulpwood.  Forests were in arrears as regards thinning and temporary exports and sales of firewood helped to remedy the problem until this company began production and, incidentally, opened up a major new outlet for sawmill residues.</P>
    <P>Forestry is one of the few areas which, generally speaking, has traditionally enjoyed the support of all parties in the House.  Certain Deputies now in opposition were the Ministers with responsibility for Forestry when the House commended the establishment of the Medite mill and the first restructuring of the chipboard mill in Scariff.  I was the Minister concerned when a second restructuring of the latter mill took place. It is worth recording that no Member of the House objected to the limited supply contracts then negotiated with these companies when many new jobs were created and maintained.</P>
    <P>In so far as pulpwood utilisation is concerned, it has been the longstanding policy of successive Governments to encourage industry which would manufacture products with high added-value and good export potential, create jobs in the mills themselves as well as in ancillary harvesting and transport services and pay a fair price to the State relative to the value of the product involved.  That continues to be the policy of this Government. As soon as adequate supplies of pulpwood and sawmill residues to warrant another processing industry become available, similar criteria will be used by my Department, in consultation with the IDA, in the context of recommending to Government the type of enterprise to be established, whether with native or foreign investment.  If this should also involve some contractual guarantee of pulpwood supply, I would not hesitate to recommend it; and from past experience I would anticipate the continued understanding and support of the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let me say clearly now that any sawmill interests seeking pulpwood supplies who can convince my Department and the IDA that a new project proposed by them <Col N="2411" /> is in the best national interest <i>vis-á-vis</i> other prospective projects will have my unhesitating support in their claim for a contractual guarantee of supply.  I could not, however, at the present time give any one sawmill or group such a pulpwood supply contract which would bestow on it unfair advantage over the many other competing mills.</P>
    <P>Contractual guarantees of sawlog supply, however, are an entirely different matter.  Whereas there are only a few major pulpwood using mills, there are some 150 sawmills of varying sizes and it would be quite impractical to give guarantees to all of them, even if this were permissible from an EC standpoint.  I would suggest to the House that the quota scheme for large sawlog &mdash; to which I referred earlier &mdash; is a positive, welldesigned concept for giving a degree of security of supply to those mills most likely to use it in the best national interest and which are therefore, because of their enlightened and creative managements in the spheres of production and marketing, also likely to be the most efficient and profitable.  Quotas for small sawlog are much more difficult from a practical point of view and I cannot at this time undertake to introduce them.  However, while making no positive commitment at this stage, I am investigating whether some limited arrangements for major users of small sawlog could be worked out.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the biggest dangers facing Irish forestry and the sawmill industry lies in underselling the quality of Irish timber.  There is no economic or technical reason why well-sawn, graded, dried and finished Irish sawnwood should command a lower price in the construction market than imported timber, allegedly of better quality but, in practice, sometimes found to be of dubious grades. I would earnestly urge architects and specifiers to look again at the qualities of Irish timber and discard some longstanding, unfounded prejudices about it.</P>
    <P>On a more optimistic note I look to progressive mills in sawmilling to translate the results of heavily-funded research by my Department &mdash; both directly and <Col N="2412" /> through its financing of work by the IIRS &mdash; into market-penetrating quality products with increased added value, thereby generating new jobs in efficient mills and seeking out, either through their own efforts or with the co-operation of relevant State agencies wider export markets within the EEC and elsewhere.  These are challenging times for us all but, if the dedication and commitment of the staff in all disciplines throughout the Forest and Wildlife Service are reflected in the timber-based industries, then the foresight of successive Governments in forestry investment will be realised handsomely and the long-awaited return on the taxpayers' investment in this vital national asset will be realised.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, it would be remiss on my part if I let this occasion pass without drawing the attention of the House to the fact that 1985 has been declared by FAO as International Year of the Forest.  The basic short term objective is to call public and political attention to the threats to the world's forests and the need to conserve forest resources. Member nations of FAO have been asked to give special recognition to the forest in 1985, including the mobilisation of people &mdash; especially youth &mdash; to participate in forest-oriented activities.  The fact that FAO's decision to declare 1985 as International Year of the Forest was not finalised until very near the end of 1984 has meant that the preparation and stimulation of suitable programmes and events by many countries, including Ireland, could not be developed as speedily as they would otherwise have wished. However, my Department are currently formulating a series of events for the second half of the year and will welcome involvement by any outside agencies who may be in a position to make some contribution to the success of the venture.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be as comprehensive as possible in dealing with the Fisheries and Forestry Votes but I appreciate that there may be matters which I have overlooked and on which Deputies may wish to be informed.  As already stated, I will endeavour to deal with any such points in my reply to what I trust will be a <Col N="2413" /> constructive debate on two of our greatest natural resources, namely fisheries and forestry.</P>
    <P>I now commend both Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimates presented here this evening, in our view, are totally inadequate to meet present requirements and will do very little, if anything, to restore confidence in either the fisheries or forestry sectors of our economy.  At a time when major investment is required to stimulate development, to create new employment opportunities and to protect jobs in existing industries, in both the fishing and forestry industries, we have a continuation of the same disastrous policies being pursued by the Minister and the Government which have brought hardship to many people involved in the fishing and timber industries already.</P>
      <P>After the massive rejection of this Government last week in the local elections one would have expected the Government would be changing their ideas, views and ways of dealing with the present unsatisfactory position.  This Government are showing very little indication that they learned any lesson from the events of last week, particularly in presenting Estimates here this evening totally inadequate to meet present needs. Not alone are they insufficient to create any new development or incentives in both sectors but I would predict that a further damaging curtailment of services will take place before the end of 1985 on the figures presented to the House here today.  There is little prospect of any worthwhile development taking place in either sector of our economy while this situation obtains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish fisheries today do not provide a good living for many of the people who participate in that industry.  Generally speaking it can be maintained that whether one be a fisherman with a boat of one's own, a crew member on someone else's vessel, a worker in a processing plant or a shareholder in a fishermen's co-operative, one is unlikely to get a decent return on one's labour or capital.  This should not and need not be so.  Our <Col N="2414" /> fishing industry is a chain made up of many links which fails to work because many of these links are weak and unsupported. As an island nation we have failed to exploit to the full the potential of our fisheries.  Viewed from an economic or social perspective sea fisheries is in decline with fishing boats being repossessed and stocks endangered.  In such a situation today's Estimate constituted merely a holding operation, totally inadequate to meet the ever-deteriorating position and hopelessly devoid of any new ideas and incentives which might stimulate what is an ailing industry.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister, who was enthusiastic when he took up office, has lost initiative also and is now prepared to mark time while the industry flounders from one crisis to another.  The general public demonstrated last week that a general election was needed but I do not think we will see one.  That would be the major initiative needed to get the necessary type of development under way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an endeavour to change the present demoralising situation. No meaningful development will take place in sea fisheries until such time as we see a new fisheries policy.  A national fisheries policy has been promised since the Common Fisheries Policy negotiations were completed.  As we have said on numerous occasions the Common Fisheries Policy was regarded by all of us as the cornerstone of our development for the next 20 years.  Therefore it was essential that, alongside the Community policy, we would have a national policy, which would be presented at a very early stage after completion of the negotiations of the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has continuously promised us a White Paper to deal with the fishing industry and he gave a promise again at Question Time today that it would be forthcoming later.  I should have expected that the Minister would have availed of this opportunity to unveil what <Col N="2415" /> is contained in this much awaited document. The fact that it is delayed further will depress the industry, leading to speculation that the delay is caused by an absence of any worthwhile policies or ideas at Government level.  We in Fianna Fáil recognised this when we put forward our policy document on Roinn na Mara, a detailed and clearcut policy statement setting out what were our views on the development of our resources.  That policy document was widely welcomed and carefully studied by many people who genuinely acknowledged that it was a worthwhile, progressive document whose policies, if implemented, would ensure that the economic potential of the resources in and under the sea would be fully developed and exploited.  We shall have to await the implementation of that policy document until we return to office.</P>
    <P>The Irish sea fishing fleet is now in a state of financial crisis.  Never before has there been such a high level of boat loan repayments outstanding.  The promise earlier this year of a financial rescue package for the fleet has been shamefully broken.  We have instead a completely watered down proposal which does not go anywhere near resolving the current crisis in the fishing fleet.  The figure involved is now well over £8 million for arrears on loan repayments which, in itself, constitutes a major handicap and impediment to progressive development of the industry.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interests of the Government and of BIM to ensure that the rescue package promised is implemented.  The rescue package would have been implemented if the Minister and his officials had had their way and if the Department of Finance had not vetoed the worthwhile proposals which they had under consideration.  These proposals now have been watered down due to financial curtailments so that they have become a meaningless formula which has been rejected by the IFO and by the fishermen.  Both fishermen and boat owners are disillusioned.  Loan repayments are mounting and BIM are unable <Col N="2416" /> to continue funding new ventures.  The promise of a financial rescue package has only damaged the situation and created further difficulties.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year by way of Private Members' Motions and parliamentary questions we raised the issue of the enlargement of the Community and the effect it would have here.  The failure of the Government to secure, on the accession of Spain and Portugal, an agreement which would protect our fisheries in an enlarged Community was a major disappointment. It was evident from the progress of the talks that the Government were adopting a weak position in the negotiations.  Several times we sought assurances from the Minister which would have protected our national fishery interest, but without success.  It is clear that the final agreement negotiated spells immediate and imminent danger for the fishing industry.  The arrest of so many Spanish trawlers for illegal fishing is only the first indication of what is to be expected when enlargement takes place on 1 January 1986.  The size of the Spanish fleet, which represents 70 per cent of the entire Community fishing fleet, represents an immediate and dangerous threat to our fishing industry.  The Government, by failing to secure an adequate transitional period, proper limits and controls over Spanish activities, have put the jobs of thousands in the fishing industry at risk.  There is no indication from this Estimate that the Government are proposing new initiatives to ensure that controls are stepped up on illegal activities by foreign boats.  I had expected that in this Estimate we would see new major expenditure on fishery protection services.  I compliment the existing service for doing an excellent job, but it needs to be supplemented. The Minister should provide additional resources to meet the changing circumstances arising from enlargement of the Community and to meet this new threat which faces the Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that the TAC for mackerel may be substantially reduced for 1986.  In the whole area of <Col N="2417" /> TAC's and quotas the enlarged Community represents many difficulties for Ireland.  A reduction in the TAC on mackerel will have a damaging effect on some of the Irish fishermen unless our percentage share of the TAC is substantially increased.  I would urge the Minister to seek an immediate increase in our mackerel quotas bearing in mind the importance for our fleet and for our processors of the mackerel industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Adequate quotas in this species are essential for the future development of the fishing industry.  The situation has changed dramatically since enlargement and the Minister is fully aware of it.</P>
      <P>It is important to press the Commission to implement suspensions against the Dutch fishermen for blatantly exceeding catch limits especially in mackerel.  Allegations have been made that Dutch fishermen have been taking more than double their mackerel quota with the full knowledge of their Government.  The Minister should take action to prevent massive over-fishing and the Commission, under the articles of the Treaty, should take proceedings against the Netherlands for over-fishing.  The total disregard for Community quotas which these member states are showing must be put to an end.  The Minister should take immediate action to draw attention to the well-documented statements which have been made that the Netherlands and Dutch fishermen are massively over-fishing their quotas and are flagrantly violating the arrangements which have been negotiated by the Community. Unless action is taken there will not be a mackerel fishing possibility for any member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the weakest aspects of the Estimate is the small amount of financial support which is being provided for fishery harbour work in general and for structural development.  In almost every part of the coastline there are demands for the improvement of landing and handling <Col N="2418" /> facilities.  Many of the works which so urgently need to be done will never be done under the present system.  It is not necessary to go over the various proposals and the urgency of them.  I need only mention Rossaveal, Burtonport, Clogherhead, Carrigaholt in my own constituency and Kilmore Quay in the Minister of State's constituency, where many of these harbours are almost in danger of callapse.  I would refer the Minister to the magnificent work done in Doolin where it was possible under a joint venture organised by Clare County Council to undertake a very major development.</P>

      <P>I would not have continued on that were it not for the fact that the Deputy came in a few minutes ago to try to interrupt what was a very orderly debate until she arrived.</P>
      <P>In every area huge financial support is needed to tackle the infrastructural problems in the coastline areas and in the islands.  This is where financial funding could be sought from the Regional Fund of the European Community for a scheme organised by the local authorities and supervised by the Department in conjunction with the council and with the Board of Works.  All these bodies working together could undertake a major crash programme of repairs, reconstruction and the provision of adequate landing places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into detail on all the aspects, as other speakers will cover them, but I will refer to inland fisheries. Inland fisheries are at a critical turning point.  Unless the Central Board and the regional boards are given support soon, poachers and illegal fishermen will take over in every area and the good work that has been done in the past will have been in vain.  Already senior personnel in the inland fisheries services are admitting openly that the battle against the poacher is being lost.  Almost every day we hear of violent attacks on fishery officers, protection boats being rammed, slash hooks and concrete blocks being used against waterkeepers, widespread illegal activities and numerous other incidents of harassment and intimidation of fishery protection staff.  In some cases, due to the lack of facilities and back-up support, officers have been put at risk.  Is it any wonder that waterkeepers and fishery protection officers are disillustioned and frustrated at present and are endeavouring desperately to keep up the fight against all the odds?  I have never seen the situation in relation to poaching and illegal activities so bad previously.  The Minister must give assurances that fishery officers will be protected and that those who interfere with them in the course of <Col N="2420" /> their duties will be dealt with severely. No waterkeeper or member of fishery boat staff will undertake protection work and the whole system will break down unless these assurances and this support are given to the fishery protection staff.</P>
    <P>The carry on off the west coast and particularly off the west coast of Clare over the past few weeks since the salmon run began is almost unbelievable.  The Shannon catchment, which is the backbone of the salmon industry, has been devastated.  Huge nets have virtually blocked the mouth of the Shannon estuary since the salmon run began.  Not only has the stock been damaged but the small inshore salmon fishermen have had their livelihood almost wiped out.  You can speak to traditional salmon fishermen who have been involved in salmon driftnetting along the Shannon estuary in Kilrush, in west Clare, in Kerry and right up to Limerick city, in Clarecastle, and any one of them will tell you now that their livelihood has been wiped out, that their industry is being put in jeopardy, that the stocks are in danger of being wiped out by the illegal activities of a few irresponsible and reckless people whom I would not describe as fishermen and who are flagrantly violating the laws and regulations in the mouth of the Shannon. This situation must be controlled.</P>
    <P>I was appalled to watch on television the vice-chairman of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board making statements to the effect that he had been waiting for weeks and weeks for sanction from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to undertake the purchase of a vessel which he claimed would be adequate to deal with the situation and which would help to solve part of the problem there.  This is deplorable and I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply this afternoon to the allegations made by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board. They are a responsible board who have stood up to intimidation since their establishment. In the interests of conservation since the salmon netting controls came into operation they failed to issue either authorisations or licences on the mouth of the Shannon or on the Clare coastline <Col N="2421" /> because they believed it vital and essential to keep the mouth of the Shannon and the Clare coast free to allow the escapement of salmon into the Shannon catchment.  It is depressing for the genuine, traditional salmon fishermen of Clarecastle, Kilrush and everywhere along the Shannon estuary and around the coastline &mdash; because their livelihood is affected also &mdash; to see the vice-chairman of a responsible body like the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board blaming the Minister and the Department for failing to provide them with the few pounds necessary to help restore law and order where law and order is breaking down at such a pace that they will not be able to control the situation unless something is done about it soon.</P>
    <P>The situation is so much out of control there now that boats are coming from various areas with no authority whatever to fish in that area which is under the jurisdiction of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  The board issue two or three licences there and the licensees are responsible people who comply with the law, the by-laws, controls and so on.  The people I have referred to are not only interfering with the livelihood of the two or three properly licensed people there but are damaging the prospect of Shannon salmon stocks being replenished. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>One way in which the situation might well be dealt with on the Clare coastline would be to licence a number of genuine Clare fishermen who have sought licences for a number of years since the controls came in in 1963 or whenever they were introduced.  A number of fishermen along the Clare coast who are deprived of licences genuinely feel that they are entitled to fish there.  They are traditional fishermen who have been involved in fishing activity all their lives.  That is why when I was Minister I made an order to give power to the Shannon Fisheries Board to issue eight licences along the coastline there. It was done as a conservation measure, so to speak, because it was licensing genuine traditional fishermen and giving them authority to fish in an area which is being <Col N="2422" /> raped now by people who have no leave or licence whatsoever to be there and who are flagrantly breaking the law.  I believe that if seven or eight traditional fishermen along there were licensed they would be a protection service on their own.  They would act responsibly and ensure that nobody else acted irresponsibly. It is unfortunate that the fisheries board at the time did not see fit to issue those licences.  I appeal to the Minister now to use his good offices with the fisheries board to make them aware that it is in the interest of conservation to issue the licences where the order is there to issue those seven or eight licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interfere with the regional boards, and the Deputy should know better than to suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made an order which entitled the fisheries board to issue licences.  In my opinion, once that order is made and applications are tendered the board have a legal obligation to issue them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am referring to that issue I might as well raise another one which has developed recently in relation to certain boards refusing licences.  I refer to eel live fishing licences.  The Department have issued authorisations for eel fishing operations in various board areas.  The boards have set themselves up as an authority to determine that even though the Minister issues an authorisation to fishermen to fish for eels they will not issue them with a licence.  The boards are not acting properly in that way, and the Minister has an obligation as Minister to point out to the boards that they are not complying with the legal situation as I know it and as I think he knows it.  The same applies to eel net licences as to salmon net licences, and where the Minister has made an order empowering the board to issue licences and people apply, the board has a legal obligation to respond to those applications and to issue those licences. Boards without any authority are refusing to issue licences.  I do not think that they <Col N="2423" /> have the authority to refuse to issue them.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the delays and the frustration caused to many genuine applicants for aquaculture and fish farming licences.  I do not want to go into this in detail because I am sure there is a genuine reason why the Minister is not speeding up the issue of those authorisations, but I have received some complaints from people who have been waiting a long time for authorisations to develop oyster fisheries in particular and because of delays in designating the areas these developments cannot take place.  These are important developments and research shows that there are opportunities for job creation and revenue generation, especially in isolated areas, but because of some bureaucratic nonsense licences and authorisations are not being issued and inquiries are not being held to determine who is entitled to acquaculture licences.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter immediately and see that the process is speeded up.</P>
    <P>We see huge potential in the development of acquaculture and mariculture and I welcome the kind of initiative which has been taken in my constituency by the West Clare Co-operative who have undertaken the development of mussel and other fisheries in an ideal location at Carrigaholt.  Some 38 agencies deal with the issue of a simple licence to engage in mariculture along the coastline.  This type of bureaucracy is stifling the prospects of early development and of job creation in isolated coastal communities where prospects of any other type of employment are very remote.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards have been doing excellent work within the limits of the financial resources available to them.  The Minister has not come near to meeting their requirements in dealing with problems of pollution, poaching and various illegal activities.  The boards are in the best possible position to deal with these problems but they are not being given adequate finance.  Last year several boards had to abandon their meetings because they did <Col N="2424" /> not have sufficient funds.  The Central Fisheries Board and their staff have done excellent work in stocking and restocking and controlling a difficult situation.  I compliment the Central Fisheries Board and Kevin Linnane who has produced some excellent films on salmon and trout fisheries.  I hope many people will get an opportunity to see these films and appreciate the work which can be done with proper management and investment in our inland fisheries.  These films were shown quite recently in Leinster House and anyone who saw them must have been impressed not only as to the opportunities for job creation but also by the potential revenue which could accrue to the State through the proper development and exploitation of our salmon and trout fisheries.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Forestry Estimate is totally inadequate to deal with the crisis in the Irish timber industry.  This industry is poised for major expansion and offers fairly significant economic potential to the nation.  The contribution which the development of the timber industry can make in higher direct financial returns to the State, in greater employment in both the harvesting and processing of timber and in the potential level of import substitution indicates the necessity for new policies and strategies.  Under this Government the planting programme is in decline and is not reaching the stated objectives.  We need a revitalised, vigorous new forestry policy which would make this country self-sufficient in timber.  It would stimulate economic growth and make the optimum use of marginal land, much of which is not producing anything at present.  It would distribute income more evenly since much of this marginal land is in isolated areas where activity could be stimulated. It would improve our balance of payments since timber imports are in the region of £1,000 million.  It would create new wealth and form the basis of further industrialisation.  It would save us foreign exchange and earn valuable foreign currency. It would also improve tourism and enhance our research projects.  It would create new jobs and spread those jobs <Col N="2425" /> into areas where they are most needed, thus creating a more healthy economic environment.  Instead the whole State planting programme is in decline.  Is it any wonder that the Irish forests have been described as uncontrolled jungles? These are not my words but ones which have been widely spoken by people who are familiar with the business and who say that because of the shortage of staff within the Department and the failure to carry out the necessary thinning there are trees which have been knocked down by gales during the last few years which have not yet been cleared away, thus impeding the development of the forests.  This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to consider the establishment of a commercially oriented body to exploit fully in the marketing area the huge potential of our forests. We must continue to press ahead with private afforestation and encourage as many people as possible to utilise the western package.  To date it has been totally under-utilised.  Substantial grants are available from the Community to private individuals for the development of forestry.  The Minister and the Minister of State were on the right lines when it was suggested that there was a need for a new leasing policy which would involve some joint venture arrangement between the Department and private individuals interested in investing in forestry.  We understood this new arrangement was to be put before the Cabinet and we felt it would attract more people into forestry development and utilise State and private resources in a joint operation aimed at our becoming self-sufficient in timber. Perhaps the Minister will give some indication that he is in a position to press ahead with that proposal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the investigation the Minister has set in train to find means of supplying the major users of small sawlog.  I would ask him also to examine the position of the small mill owners who are now in some difficulties.  I spoke to one mill to day which is finding it extremely difficult to get small sawlogs because the lots which are on offer are too large.  The Minister might find a way to support these <Col N="2426" /> small mill owners who are finding it difficult to continue operating.</P>
    <P>I welcome the very valuable report issued by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  This is an excellent document covering every aspect of timber policy which sets out quite clearly the existing potential and the need for initiatives such as a European policy for the development of the timber industry.</P>
    <P>It spells out very clearly the views of people involved in the industry and an official of the Minister's Department carefully analyses the situation and clearly sets out the way in which the development and exploitation of our timber resources can be utilised over the next couple of years.  Perhaps we will get an opportunity to debate this very valuable and useful report before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Forestry and Wildlife Service for their excellent work in developing amenities in forestry areas throughout the country. There are now in the region of 400 amenities and about two million visitors come every year.  We must compliment the staff for the magnificent work which they are doing in this area.  It will be even more important in the future and more diligence will be required to avoid the difficulties which have arisen in most member states where acid rain and other problems are creating major hazards for forestry. I urge the Forestry and Wildlife Service to be vigilant in ensuring that we have a continuation of the magnificent developments which have taken place in the amenities already provided.  However, we have been appalled to see the huge increase in the number of forest fires during the year and I am sure the Minister agrees that the damage done by fires to forestry development and amenities is very great.  We must encourage anybody who has any responsibility in this area to put an end to this menace.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views in relation to game stocks.  Representations were made to me recently in relation to the Greenland white-fronted goose.  As the Minister is aware, when I <Col N="2427" /> was Minister we imposed a ban on the shooting of this goose because of the risk to the species and the danger of wiping out stocks.  I know that surveys have been undertaken regarding the white-fronted goose and perhaps the situation in regard to stock now warrants having another look at the ban to see if there is a need to maintain it any longer.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this is the International Year of the Forest and I also encourage the Minister to press ahead with the Trees for Ireland project which was initiated by Deputy Haughey when he was Taoiseach. In 1982 when he was in the United States he took a major initiative in encouraging people in the United States to plant trees here.  I know the Minister followed up that scheme and I should like to hear how it is progressing.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed with the Estimate because, although there is a need for major investment, initiatives and incentives which would encourage the development of fisheries and forestry resources, we are not getting them in the Estimates and, accordingly, we will oppose them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Estimate and, unlike Deputy Daly, I am not as frightened as he appears to be. Some of his remarks on the Estimate surprised me, especially when one looks at the record of Fianna Fáil in office in relation to forestry and fisheries.</P>
      <P>In relation to forestry, I should like to remind Deputy Daly of the proposals in <i>The Way Forward</i> in 1982 which stated that there would be a planting target of 7,500 hectares per annum.  That was the first reversal of forestry policy here since 1880.  If you look at the figures for the amount of land acquired from 1977 to 1981 you will see a steady decline from year to year.  In 1977,8,178 hectares were acquired; the figure steadily declined and by 1981 it was down to 5,561 hectares. Those figures speak for themselves.  Any statements to the contrary mean nothing, because action in office speaks louder than words in opposition.  While I disagree with most of what Deputy Daly said, there are points with which I am in agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Daly spoke particularly about fishing and the industry in general.  I agree with him in his comments regarding fishery protection. We must look at the problem which exists on the Shannon Estuary and right across the Clare coast.  I agree with everything he said on that issue.  I am most disappointed that concrete action has not been taken by now.  I made representations months ago to the Department of Fisheries asking them to provide money to the Shannon Fishery Board to purchase a boat which would alleviate the serious problems at the mouth of the Shannon and the Clare coast.  The fishermen on the Shannon Estuary have been deprived of their livelihood this year.  Some of them have not caught any salmon and I know of another who has caught only two salmon so far this year.  The Minister will have to seriously examine the licensing system on the Shannon Estuary and the charges for those fishing on the Shannon. Every weekend there are miles and miles of monofilament net which is catching the gear of small fishermen.  Not alone are the small fishermen not catching anything but their gear is also being hauled off. The Minister should take account of that and act on it urgently.  I wholeheartedly endorse what Deputy Daly said on that matter.  I hope that the Department will act on the situation immediately and that we will have action by the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to harbour development, Clare has not been as fortunate as other counties.  A major disaster had to take place in Doolin before we got action.  I <Col N="2429" /> should like to compliment the Departments of Fisheries and Forestry and the Environment and Clare County Council on the tremendous work carried out at Doolin.  I should like to appeal to the Department of Fisheries to seriously examine the position in Carrigaholt.  In the course of his speech the Minister told us that an examination was carried out on the pier there.  That is fine, but we do not want examinations, White Papers or reports.  We have had too many of them for too long.  We want action.  I am sure the Department, having considered this matter, will act a little quicker than they have to date.</P>
    <P>I have a funny feeling that the Department of Fisheries work at a snail's pace.  From my experience as a public representative I wonder what speed the Department work at.  They should get out of first gear fast.  We must view our fishing industry as one with tremendous potential. It has an opportunity for great development. The Department and the industry have been in the same old rut for the last 12 years operating the same system and literally falling into the same line of action.  Nothing new has happened. There has not been a radical change although we joined the EC.  We have not expanded in the way we should have in recent years.  We must look at this urgently, realising that many of our young people are unemployed.  We must bear in mind that we have a fine natural resource that has not been properly tapped.  There is a duty on us, and on the Department, to act urgently and exploit that natural resource.</P>
    <P>Many things need to be done.  Harbours need to be updated and facilities at them improved.  Training courses must be implemented fast and a lot of the bureaucracy in the Department eliminated. At present we are being choked by bureaucracy.  I should like to refer to a co-operative proposal in my constituency to establish a fish farm where the people involved might as well be trying to get gold dust as to get a licence to proceed with a small fish farm outside Carrigaholt. <Col N="2430" /> The amount of bureaucracy involved in granting permission to a co-operative to start a small mussel farm off Carrigaholt is laughable.  It is more than two and a half years since the co-op sought a licence and they are as far ahead today as they were when they put in their original application.  It is a fiasco.</P>
    <P>We are operating within a system that commenced 60 years ago and has not changed with the times.  There is an onus on us to change fast.  In isolated areas like west Clare and West Cork, or in the west of Ireland, if action is not taken on these issues there will not be any hope for the young people.  Outside of getting involved in agriculture they cannot hope for employment except within the fishing industry.  I hope there will be a new sense of purpose in the Department.  It would exist if there was a proper push.  I do not know if that will mean that all civil servants in the Department of Fisheries will have to be switched to another Department.  That is something the internal administration will have to examine. Suffice it to say that there is a need for urgent action.</P>
    <P>Forestry is another area where there is tremendous potential but somehow we are stifled by bureaucracy.  Over the last 30 or 40 years the forestry division has done a fine job but at this stage it may have outlived its usefulness.  At this stage should we be looking for something other than a forestry division?  I suggest that the Government seriously consider setting up a forestry authority.  Government Departments are run by civil servants who carry out policies that have been part of the system for decades.  Things operate in an organised manner and fall into certain rules and regulations, but the Civil Service lacks a business management approach for a major industry.  Forestry is a major industry that must be managed by business people or people other than civil servants.</P>
    <P>My suggestion of establishing a forestry authority may sound radical and be unacceptable, but we must consider what will happen if our young people do not get employment at home.  Are we to continue <Col N="2431" /> to entice foreign firms to establish electronic or computer industries?  Why do we not develop our natural resources to the full and then go elsewhere?  There is a need for a radical examination of our approach towards industrial policy.</P>
    <P>A new forestry authority could create a lot of employment here.  We must remember that we have the least amount of acreage under afforestation of any member state of the EC.  That should be examined.  It is accepted that there is a serious problem in regard to timber imports in the Community.  There is a great potential for timber exports and we should be taking radical steps now to ensure we make the maximum use of our land, particularly the poor land that is suitable for afforestation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the problem of land acquisition and what follows from it.  In my dealings with the Department I have come to the conclusion that land acquisition is ridiculous.  It is ludicrous that a person who signs a contract with the Department for the sale of his or her land is not paid for it four or five years later.  I am aware of many such cases.  I accept that the forestry division is not entirely responsible for the delays and that a number of other Departments are involved.  I accept that legal factors can mean a long delay.  When the person eventually gets the money, it has reduced in value so much that he no longer finds it attractive to sell land to the Department.  I ask the Minister to seriously examine the present system of land acquisition and ensure that, from the initial signing of a contract of sale, at most only a year elapses before the person is paid for his property.  The approach adopted by the Department up to now has not encouraged people to sell to the Department and the bureaucracy involved has encouraged people to sell elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is great potential in this area which we are not exploiting to the full. We should seriously consider scrapping the Department of Forestry and setting up a forestry authority.  That might be a radical move but it should be seriously <Col N="2432" /> considered given the enormous work which needs to be done.  The civil servants have done their job but there is need for a major change in the approach which had been adopted in the past.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Forestry is welcome but there are areas where I hoped more finance would have been made available.  I recognise the constraints under which the Minister has to operate but I believe that given the constraints imposed on him he has done a very good job giving a fair proportion of the finance to the areas which need it.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Department of Fisheries the very serious position that exists in relation to fisheries protection on the Shannon Estuary and the west Clare coast.  Urgent action needs to be taken and I hope that before this Dáil meets next Tuesday the Department of Fisheries will have taken corrective action on the Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the lack of progress being made in respect of the development of Clogherhead Harbour in my constituency.  The fishermen have every reason to be despondent about this matter and can be forgiven for believing that nothing of consequence will be done in respect of this harbour for a long time to come and that the promises made to them will not be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>I have personal knowledge of Clogherhead. I began my teaching career there when only a few small boats fished out of that harbour.  Clogherhead is now one of the most important fishery harbours in the country.  I have no doubt that if the survey on the development of fishery harbours, which took place some years ago and which designated particular harbours for major development, had taken place in recent times, Clogherhead would have been one of those designated harbours and badly needed development would have taken place long ago.  This is one of the fastest growing fishery areas in the country.  More fishing boats can be found there than in some of the designated ports on which very large sums of money were spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2433" /> The harbour is in a chronically bad condition.  If one were to stand at the centre of the pier in rough winter weather the swaying of the pier is such that one could be forgiven for expecting it to break in two at any moment.  The condition of the pier is only one part of the problem. Safe berthing for the Clogherhead fishing fleet is another.  A few months ago during a storm the pier was particularly badly damaged; in fact, it was nearly swept away.  It is undermined at the front and at the back.  I dread to think what will happen to that pier next winter.  I understand that only minor repairs will be carried out by the county council.</P>
    <P>There are 29 fishing boats in the Clogherhead fleet and the dock can take 13 boats.  If the weather is bad there is no safety at the pier and the reminder of the boats must dock at a number of other places &mdash; at Mornington and Howth. Apart from the problems arising at these places it should be obvious that this type of situation provides a very poor base for the development of fisheries at Clogherhead, which is a traditional fishing area. The jetty at Mornington is privately owned and is for sale.  It was attached to a fishmeal factory which is no longer in operation and should the factory and jetty be sold to a private concern, the jetty will no longer be available to the Clogherhead fishermen.  This would be a calamity because they have nowhere else to go and certainly no other place which is as convenient to home.</P>
    <P>I suggested some time ago that the Department should purchase the jetty and develop it to provide proper berthing facilities but the Minister said the Department were not interested and did not propose to purchase it.  I ask him to reconsider that decision because I believe that with the full and proper development of Clogherhead Harbour, and with proper facilities provided at the jetty in Mornington, we would have an excellent base in the area for the further expansion of fishing facilities.  This would not only help the fishing industry but would help the recovery of the economy generally.</P>
    <P>A number of Clogherhead boats tie up at the Drogheda Port.  At this stage I <Col N="2434" /> should express my appreciation of the consideration shown by the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners for not only facilitating the Clogherhead fishermen but also for their help and co-operation in including the needs of these fishermen in their plans for their development of the Drogheda port until such time as proper facilities are made available in Clogherhead.  At Drogheda however there are considerable problems for the Clogherhead fishermen who are tying up there.  They must keep men aboard the trawlers over the week-end because the trawlers must be moved each time a ship enters or leaves the port of Drogheda. The fact that the Clogherhead fleet cannot berth at Clogherhead is most unsatisfactory and is unacceptable.  The work to develop the harbour must proceed forthwith.</P>
    <P>A survey was cared out by University College Cork on the development of the Clogherhead Harbour.  The reply given to every Dáil question about the development of the Clogherhead Harbour was that the work could not proceed until such time as this report was received by the Office of Public Works and then studied by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and Louth County Council.  This report was made available a considerable time ago.  When I made further inquiries I was informed that it had been sent to Louth County Council for their consideration and comments.  I requested a copy of the report from both the Minister and the county council but I failed to get it from either source.  I was informed that it was not usual to supply such reports until they were fully considered and decisions made on them.  In this instance I am strongly of the opinion that this is a totally incorrect approach.</P>
    <P>My purpose in requesting the report was so that the opinions of the people most concerned, the Clogherhead fishermen, could be ascertained.  This is a ridiculous situation because if this report is adopted by the Minister in whole or in part, it will affect the future of the fishing industry in Clogherhead but the Clogherhead fishermen, who are the experts, do not even know what is in the report and <Col N="2435" /> therefore will have no opportunity to contribute to the development of the harbour which will affect their future.  It is not good enough to say that they will be consulted at a later date.  They should be consulted now and I can assure the Minister that they have a lot to offer in this area.  I have also been in touch with Louth County Council in the matter and they informed me that they have considered the report and have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss the project further.  When I spoke to them, admittedly not recently, they had not as yet had the meeting.  If such a meeting is not held, I hope that there will not be any hold-up on account of letters passing between the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Louth County Council and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Clogherhead fishermen want immediate action.  I recommend that the Minister set up a committee consisting of representatives of each of these three bodies, make the money available to get the work under way, tell the people to go ahead with the job and also give the Clogherhead fishermen an opportunity to have an input into the project.  If this is done the end of the Clogherhead development saga could be in sight, but if it is not done and time is taken up with futile letters passing between those concerned and with minor changes, we can only assume that the Minister and his Department are engaging in delaying tactics. Might I point out that by the time they come to a decision there might not be a pier left at Clogherhead.  For the sake of fishery development in my constituency, I hope that this development, which is of national interest, will be the subject of immediate action.</P>
    <P>I had intended appealing to the Minister to get the work started immediately. However, I have a feeling that such a request would be futile, in view of what he had to say about Clogherhead.  I quote from his speech:</P>
    <P>As well, provision has been made for <Col N="2436" /> further site investigations at Clogherhead, County Louth,...</P>
    <P>Later on, he states:</P>
    <P>Work on these projects will commence as soon as the necessary financial arrangements have been finalised.</P>
    <P>All I can say to the Minister is that the fishermen of Clogherhead are sick, sore and tired of investigations.  There have been investigations prior to the UCC report and then the UCC report which held up work on the development of the harbour for a very considerable period and now all the Minister is offering to these fishermen are further site investigations. As I said, the pier is in such a bad condition that it is possible if we have bad storms in the winter that there will be no pier left.  The least I would have expected is that the Minister would have provided money in this Estimate to start work on the development of the harbour rather than simply stating that he is prepared to make financial arrangements for further site investigations.  I urge him to reconsider this whole situation and to ask the Government immediately to make money available to start this work.  It is not sufficient simply to have the county council carry out some repairs.  I want to emphasise the extremely bad condition of the harbour.</P>
    <P>Another matter which should be attended to immediately and to which I have already referred in this House, which would considerably help to improve the efficiency of the fishing fleet at Clogherhead, would be the provision of proper facilities to provide the fleet with ice.  The ice plant which is now there is in a most unsuitable position and is much too small.  To get ice to the trawlers, boxes of ice must be filled, loaded on lorries, taken down to the pier, unloaded there, lowered to the inside boat at the pier and then carried across sometimes as many as ten boats.  In this day and age, that would hardly be regarded as a highly efficient service.  One would only have to witness this exercise to recognise the dangers involved, apart from any other considerations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2437" /> I mentioned that the ice plant was too small.  In fact there are occasions during the summer when boats have to put to sea without ice, which is very serious.  If they are unable, either because there is not sufficient ice or for any other reason, to get ice to the boats, then the time spent fishing is severely curtailed, especially in summertime.  It could be as short as one day's fishing before returning to port and this is both expensive and inefficient.</P>
    <P>As I said previously in this House, I would suggest that the area west of the dock be examined with a view to developing it and installing a sufficiently large ice plant there.  There is sufficient depth of water and boats could move in and get their consignment of ice without having to undergo the difficulties and dangers of the present outmoded method.  More ice could be stored and the general efficiency of the fishing operation at Clogherhead would be considerably improved.  I would suggest that this is one way in which the Minister could effectively assist the Clogherhead fishermen.</P>
    <P>The place in the landings table occupied by Clogherhead has disimproved in recent years when the increase in the number of boats there should have shown the opposite trend.  The reason for this is the deteriorating condition of the pier and the lack of safe berthage.  This combination results in Clogherhead trawlers being forced to land their catches at other ports such as Howth, which is a designated major port although its fishing fleet has only a fraction of the number of trawlers from Clogherhead.  The result is that other ports show higher landings in some instances because of landings made there by Clogherhead trawlers, while Clogherhead loses out through no fault of its own.  I make this point simply to forestall any attempt which might be made to lower the status of the Clogherhead harbour on the basis of landings there.</P>
    <P>On the fishing industry generally, if you were to ask any fisherman what were the major problems in that industry, he would say that the price of fish is a problem, allied to the cost of fuel.  To <Col N="2438" /> the fisherman, the enormous difference between the price paid to him for his produce and that paid by the housewife for the same produce is inexplicable.  The fishermen feel that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry should be concentrating on marketing, so that a better return will be available to the fishermen. For example, in respect of plaice some time ago the fisherman was getting a particular price per pound but the housewife was paying about eight times that price. Even though the fish were filleted when sold to the housewife, the difference in price was enormous.</P>
    <P>The fisherman's costs are very high; he is highly taxed, oil being one of the major costs.  There are commission and tariffs to the market to be paid and very many other expenses involved, such as repayments to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It is quite clear that a very worthwhile income is needed to meet these expenses.  The whole market system must be streamlined, in the interests both of the fishermen and the housewife.  What I have said relates to the home market aspect of the business.  If the Minister has any plans to set about improving the marketing of fish here, I should be glad if he would let me know in his reply what those plans are.</P>
    <P>If this very important industry is to prosper, there are two major elements, apart from marketing at home, which must exercise our attention.  First is the processing of fish here and, second, is the development of markets for our fish in other countries.  I know that the Minister referred to this matter.  Much more can be done to develop our processing industry and our markets abroad.</P>
    <P>Far too few of our fish catches are processed at home and very many jobs are being lost because of a lack of real effort to develop the fish processing business. Large quantities of our fish &mdash; cod, prawns and so on &mdash; are exported whole to Britain and processed there.  Therefore, we lose much-needed jobs here and our fishermen lose out, in that better prices would be obtainable here if processing were developed and if we were not putting all our fish into one basket, as it were.  We send some of our fish to <Col N="2439" /> countries other than Britain but in much smaller amounts.  Again, in the main they are sent in bulk to these countries and processed abroad.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to have this whole matter of processing fish at home examined and efforts made to establish it on a firm footing.  I am not going to pretend it will be easy to overcome all the problems involved, but it must be done if we are to gain a full return from a great natural resource.  It may well be that old attitudes deeply entrenched on all sides must be changed and very often such change can be painful.  However, the long-term needs of the industry must be quickly identified and the problems tackled if the future of our fishermen is to be assured and the maximum number of jobs ashore related to the industry made available.</P>
    <P>I should like to make reference to the interference by submarine traffic in the Irish Sea with fishing in the Clogherhead area.  There have been a number of episodes in the Irish Sea which resulted some time ago in the feeling among fishermen in that area that it is becoming unsafe to fish there.  One would have thought that the sinking of the <i>sheralga</i> and the admission of liability, albeit after a long period had elapsed, by the British Government would have meant an end to this type of interference in the Irish Sea.  However, many incidents along the east coast have been reported since then culminating in the incident involving the trawler <i>Oriel.</i> This underlines the fact that the great powers are not in the least concerned about the safety or livelihood of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <P>With regard to the loss of the <i>Sheralga</i>, the British Government have accepted that one of their submarines, the <i>Porpoise</i>, was responsible for the sinking of the trawler.  This admission had to be extracted from the British Government. Quite obviously they were unwilling to accept responsibility, but because of the certain known movements and future movements of the submarine they had little option but to accept that their submarine was involved.  However, since then my information is that the owner of <Col N="2440" /> the trawler has failed to get a reasonable compensation agreement with the British Government, with the result that he has been without his boat and without compensation since the boat was sunk some years ago.  As I understand the position of the trawler owner, he has been offered a sum of money in compensation for the loss of his boat and for loss of earnings which is far less than the cost of replacing the vessel.  In fact, it is only a fraction of the cost of replacing the vessel.  I feel very strongly this is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The British submarine was responsible for the loss of the boat.  The trawler owner and crew were pursuing their lawful business of fishing when the accident occured. Had the accident not occurred they would have been fishing during the whole period since then and they would continue to fish in the <i>Sheralga</i> for many years to come, earning their living as they were entitled to do.  It is nonsense to suggest that a sum of money which is a long way from being sufficient to replace the boat should be offered.  How is it expected that the skipper and his crew will be able to continue to earn their living at sea in these circumstances?  The trawler owner, his relatives and his crew have suffered financially and the stress and strain they have endured have been exceptional.  This matter arose a long time ago and it should have been settled a long time ago.</P>
    <P>There are two points I should like to make here.  First, the Government should put pressure on the British Government to ensure that the trawler owner is given proper compensation and enabled to return to sea with his crew.  The second point is this: the Irish Government are aware of the fact that a British submarine sank the <i>Sheralga.</i> Will the Minister inform me of what action the Government took in response to this matter and will he say what has been the response of the British Government?  The action taken by the Irish Government and the response of the British Government could be the base from which a thorough examination of the entire problem could be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> Recently I was in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs with regard to the matter.  Incidentally, when I asked what the Minister had done I was referring to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. In reply to my query the Minister said the Department had been in regular contact with the British authorities concerning the question of compensation to the owner of the trawler and that they had emphasised their interest in a speedy and satisfactory settlement of the case.  While I appreciate what has been done, I say that all of us must increase our efforts in respect of this matter.  The family in question are a small family who are endeavouring to get their rights from a large nation, without success to date. Through our Government, and in any other way possible, we must exert all the pressure we can to ensure that the family get what they are justly entitled to get.</P>
    <P>Clogherhead is in my constituency and is, therefore, a Border constituency.  I am interested to know how much of the cross-Border money allocated by the EC for cross-Border purposes is being made available for the development of Clogherhead harbour and for the development of fishing facilities in County Louth, whether sea fisheries or inland fisheries. There are few better ways in which the money could be spent than on our fisheries. In the first instance it would put fishing at sea on a sounder basis and would be of considerable help in tourism development if applied to improving inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister has not got direct responsibility for the prevention of pollution in rivers and in the sea. However, he referred to the matter in his speech and, as he has responsibility for the development of the fishing industry generally, I am sure he takes particular note of the problems arising from pollution and the serious damage caused to our fish stocks.</P>
    <P>There are rivers in my constituency that once abounded with salmon, as did the seas contiguous to these rivers, but in recent years very few salmon have been caught there.  This is an immeasurable <Col N="2442" /> loss to the fishermen in these areas who made a living out of salmon fishing and it has damaged a once prosperous tourist trade.  A major problem is not alone to find out who is causing the pollution but also to find out who is responsible for containing and eradicating it.  When one tries to have the matter investigated one tends to be sent from one authority to another.  We should try to place the responsibility on one authority, whether State or local, and have them follow up the matter as one of urgency.  The damage being done to our fisheries by pollution is incalculable and cannot be tolerated.</P>
    <P>In this speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to say that my Department, again with assistance from the EC Regional Fund, is actively considering the establishment of a long distance walk in the Cooley peninsula. It is envisaged that this walk will link up with the &ldquo;Ulster Way&rdquo; and eventually with the &ldquo;All-Ireland Way&rdquo;.  It is proposed to include an interpretative centre in the Carlingford district as a feature of the project.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that this work will be done in the Cooley peninsula.  It is one of the most beautiful districts in the country. It is famed for its natural beauty and history.  I am glad to see that this money is being spent.  From the point of view of tourism it will be well spent.  I have always been interested in promoting that area. When I was Minister for Tourism the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte issued a booklet <i>From the Mournes to the Boyne</i> which has been helpful to tourists.  It is vital that the Minister ask the Government to provide money and start work immediately on the development of Clogherhead harbour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Faulkner in relation to his remarks about <i>Sheralga.</i> We received many representations on this matter, as I am sure every Deputy in the constituency did.  It is very frustrating trying to deal with this matter.  The Department of Foreign Affairs are not <Col N="2443" /> making the effort to assist in solving this problem.  It is not possible for a trawler owner to negotiate with the British Government or the Department concerned. It would require a much more high-powered effort on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>The family have suffered a lot of frustration as a result of this incident.  I am very familiar with the subject and would make a special plea to the Minister to set a light under whoever is dealing with this matter.  It should not take this length of time to resolve such a problem.  If it takes so long to negotiate the value of the boat and the amount of compensation for loss of earnings, how long will it take to solve the problems of Northern Ireland?</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Faulkner in asking the Minister to use his good offices to have this matter finally resolved.  I understand that the offer originally made was ridiculous by any standards.  It will require the good offices of the senior officers of the Department to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Faulkner, but I must clarify some of the points he made. I have been a member of Louth County Council and from the first time I took office I have been involved in a number of meetings with fishermen from Clogherhead. There were many promises made by successive Governments.  I would remind the Deputy that his party were in Government for the majority of the time that the problem with the pier was under consideration and that he was a member of a number of those Governments.  That is not to cast any aspersions on him, but I would not want to create the impression in the House or in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> or the <i>Dundalk Argus</i> that all the problems in Clogherhead arose since November 1982.  They were promised 20 piers before November 1982 and many of those promises were made by Ministers representing Fianna Fáil Governments. Deputy Faulkner was a senior member of Fianna Fáil Governments for 15 years. While I might disagree with the manner <Col N="2444" /> in which this matter has been handled by the Department, I do not want the Minister of the day to carry responsibility for what is a deplorable situation in Clogherhead.</P>
    <P>Every Minister has visited Clogherhead for the last 20 years since the cracks on the pier began to appear.  If we put everyone together we would be able to build a pier from Clogherhead to Carlingford Lough.  That is not counting officials who have visited the pier or the Deputies or candidates seeking election.  Every local and general election in that area has been fought on the issue of the pier at Clogherhead.</P>
    <P>The Department of Fisheries, OPW and Louth County Council are all dealing with the matter.  There are a number of consultants, engineers and so on.  The hydraulic testing took a substantial period of time.  The matter went through the Department of Fisheries, OPW Louth County Council and then back to the Department.  I was going around in circles trying to follow up the matter.  We would need the submarine the Deputy spoke about to keep track of the issue. Even at this stage we are not too clear what the situation is.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this matter in his speech.  I should like him to clarify what he means.  I have been trying to have a meeting with the officials of Louth County Council or the officials of whatever Department is responsible for making a decision and I have failed to do so.  I could not get a copy of the report.</P>
    <P>The fishermen will have an input to make concerning the form the pier will take.  At present there is a big &ldquo;Danger&rdquo; sign on the pier.  One cannot drive a car down it and we are afraid that someone will fall into the holes in the pier.  During the recent storms the front part of the pier fell into the sea and the boats could not dock.  As has rightly been said, were it not for the fact that the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners and those in Howth co-operated fully, the fishermen would have had to dock their boats in Clogherhead village.  This matter is not being treated seriously.  It is one of the most important fleets in the country.  In <Col N="2445" /> a reply to a question I asked, the Minister said he was treating the matter as one of priority.  I do not doubt that, but as a Deputy from the area it would not appear to me as if the people who are advising the Minister are treating it with priority.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give a positive commitment in that regard in addition to what is contained in his speech.  The men have to cope with that problem in addition to coping with the deplorable situation in the industry.  I suppose if I were in Opposition I would be making the same sort of case as the people opposite are making but we must put this matter into proper prospective.  The problems of the fishing industry did not begin after November 1982.  They were there before then.  Fuel costs represent about 70 per cent of the cost of maintaining a boat.  I can only speak for the Clogherhead area and I am aware that fishermen in that area are in substantial arrears of payment.  I have here a document from BIM concerning the owner of one boat who is substantially in arrears.  These arrears resulted from his boat having been out of action for between six and nine months.  During that time the owner was trying to negotiate money to have the engine replaced, so he was not able to engage in any fishing for that period with the result that the payments were mounting.  When he was able to return to fishing he was so much in the red that he would have needed to be earning about £150,000 per year to come to terms with the arrears and with the current payments. Therefore, I consider the submission from the IFO to be reasonable and the Minister should consider that submission in relation to this factor.</P>
    <P>In their recent report the IFO, dealing with this subject, say:</P>
    <P>The answer is that fishermen will think what they have long thought &mdash; that they will have to continue operating from inadequate (indeed, frequently primitive) harbours, with the dearest boats in Europe.  Consider, for example, the financial package available to French fishermen of 5½% interest repayable over 8 years with the <Col N="2446" /> murderous repayments Irish vessels have to meet &mdash; frequently as high as 19/20%.  Consider also the huge difference in the price of fuel (subsidised) against the dearest fuel in Europe.  And consider the level of mainland Continental fish prices against Irish prices when transport costs are taken into account.</P>
    <P>That is a fair case.  In places such as Clogherhead, Howth and so on, where there is much unemployment, there is great opportunity for increasing employment but this would involve the implementation of an overall national and constructive policy.</P>
    <P>In the report of the sectoral development committee there are set down a number of very interesting points.  We might compare that report with the recommendations of the IFO.  There is very little difference in emphasis.  The SDC report was produced in October 1984 but all these months later there is no sign of either a White Paper or a Green Paper or of whatever kind of paper the Government intend introducing in this regard.  At a time when unemployment is at such a high level, fishing is one of the few industries in which employment can be increased.  It is one of the areas of Government into which the least amount of money is invested.  In many cases the boats are too small.  The fishermen at Clogherhead, for example, find it necessary to take their boats from there to the Aran Islands to fish off the coast there.  This involves a huge cost in respect of fuel alone and there is also the human factor whereby these men must leave their families on a Sunday and travel all the way by sea to the Aran Islands in boats that are too small for fishing in the Clogherhead area.  These men fish for prawn.  Our priorities are all wrong.  It would cost a good deal less to provide more employment in the fishing industry than it would cost to provide, for instance, a £6 million factory in Drogheda.  That factory has been idle for two years and two others have been provided since perhaps at a total value of about £10 million. Apart from a few security guards and <Col N="2447" /> a few alsatian dogs, these premises are unoccupied.  There are more people employed at Clogherhead than are employed in a number of major factories established in the area in recent years. We could double the number of people employed in fish processing if only our priorities were right.  It is impossible to extract a simple decision in relation to a harbour.  Because of the lack of a proper harbour the fishermen of Clogherhead cannot have an ice plant and this again puts them to additional cost and inconvenience.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no clear indication that anyone cares about the fishing industry.  The only people who have made money out of the industry in the area I come from are solicitors or accountants. Boatowners who go from the area to Galway are lucky if they can pay £100 each to the men after they have fished all week.  Can anyone think of any group of workers in industry who would be prepared to work seven days per week in the type of conditions in which these fishermen work for £100 each?  They would be better off if the boat owners allowed BIM take back the boats and sell them or do whatever they wished with them.  The men could then sign on for the dole.  At least they would be with their families all week instead of their families having to worry all the time as to whether the men would return safely from the Aran Islands and they would be getting as much money as if they were working.</P>
    <P>We do not want any more ministerial visits to Clogherhead.  We want positive replies from the Minister responsible for dealing with this subject.  Perhaps I am being very parochial in this but I sought to speak on this Estimate because of a very strong sense of frustration about what is happening at Clogherhead.  If we got a reasonable response from the Government not only would we be able to create jobs but we would also be able to develop the tourist industry.  We are talking about one of the greatest tourist areas in the north-east, as I am sure the Ceann Comhairle will appreciate.</P>
    <P>The whole situation was summed up <Col N="2448" /> very well in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> of Friday, 18 January 1985.  This letter was from Mr. Michael J. Murphy, who is chairman of the Labour Party Fisheries Committee in Limerick and contains the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>The prognosis is not good.  There has been little recognition by successive Governments of the importance of fisheries.  For example, while the IDA poured £2,800,000 into foreign enterprise between 1970 and 1980 the IDA investment in developing fish processing, in 1981 and 1982, was £1,466,387: BIM grant-aided processing facilities between January 1st, 1980 and May 31st, 1983 to the extent of £123,551.</P>
    <P>The result of this level of investment is that it takes two Irish fishermen to produce one processing job while one EEC fisherman on average produces six processing jobs: a differential of 12 to 1.  The bulk of our fish is, of course, exported unprocessed.</P>
    <P>The Spanish have a fleet of 17,500 vessels, two-thirds of which fish away from home waters; the Irish have 3,000 vessels which fish almost exclusively around the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>That there is still, despite the years of neglect, a significant development potential for Irish fisheries is beyond argument.  The Spanish intention bears evidence of this, as do indeed the Dutch who are presently building huge beam trawlers to exploit the Irish Sea and six trawlers in excess of 200 feet for the Atlantic fishery.</P>
    <P>That part of his letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> really summed up the position.  It was by coincidence I happened to come across that letter.  It was not because it was written by a member of my own party.  If he was down in Clogherhead and made that statement I am sure all of the fishermen there, irrespective of their political allegiances, would agree with him.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister and his Minister of State that theirs is an area in which they can create jobs, saving from virtual extinction a very valuable, natural, Irish resource industry and develop it.  But they can do so only if they convince their <Col N="2449" /> Cabinet colleagues of the need for more money for harbour development, to subsidise and help our fishermen through a very difficult time.  If they do not do so the majority of our fishermen, certainly the majority of those in the area I represent, will not be in business in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the Estimates for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  While recognising the potential and value of our fishing industry to our economy, I am neither expert nor sufficiently qualified to deal with that subject.  Having listened to the debate I realise there are sufficient Deputies on both sides of the House who are well qualified to deal adequately with that aspect of the Estimate.  I followed with interest the fishing exploits of Deputy Taylor-Quinn and the leisurely walk of Deputy Faulkner along the proposed new walk in the Cooley peninsula.</P>
      <P>Fisheries and Forestry comprise rather strange bed fellows.  To the extent that they both represent very important areas of economic development I feel strongly that they deserve greater parliamentary recognition and a much higher priority rating in terms of economic commitment on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated I will confine my brief observations to dealing with the forestry aspect of the Minister's Estimates.  I do not wish to spend my time condemning Government failure over the years to maximise opportunity for forest development except to say that part of our problem, particularly that in the sawmilling industry at present, arises from the fact that there are too many customers for the relatively limited output of our State forests.  The present contracting arrangements in operation within the Department of Forestry in relation to the sale of the produce of our State forests leaves very much to be desired in terms of the efficient operation of the sawmilling industry.  The immediate, obvious challenge confronting the Government and this House is whether <Col N="2450" /> at this time we make a commitment in the national interest to expanding and developing the timber industry so that future generations can benefit from the decisions we need to take.</P>
    <P>I said I would not look back over our lack of commitment in the past except to say that we did not get our priorities right in terms of economic commitment and development.  That aspect of the Estimate was referred to by Deputies on all sides of the House who spoke here this evening.  I have always held the view that, for a country of our size and composition, our priority always should have been the development of our natural resources. Forestry, after agriculture, is one of the most important and obvious resources for development.  I suggest that one of the reasons for our failure in this area is the absence of any kind of long term economic planning and a realisation that the return on investment in Forestry is relatively slow and would not give an economic return during the lifespan of any particular Government.  I have expressed the view in the past in this House that there are certain areas of economic development requiring long term planning and investment and that these areas should not be subjected to the changes and variations in policies arising from changes in Governments which have taken place with such frequency in recent years.  The House will readily recognise that forestry is such an area.  I put it to the Minister that he and the Government should give serious thought to developing these important aspects at this time.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed to see no evidence of any trend in that direction in the Estimate before us this evening.  It saddens me to observe that the Minister and the Government have ignored the opportunity of creating perhaps thousands of jobs were there an adequate and full commitment on their part to the development of forestry.  We are living from hand to mouth, with no long term planning and no real vision.  We talk much in this House about oil exploration and about attracting foreign industry. Yet we close our eyes to a natural resource awaiting development for years. <Col N="2451" /> We did the same with regard to the food processing industry.  It is a shame on the part of everybody associated with economic planning that that kind of situation was allowed to develop.  It is a shame on the part of the Minister and the Government, in a crisis employment situation, that they failed to recognise credible, productive areas of potential development where jobs could and can still be productively created.  What kind of Government have we which pursue negative economic policies deliberately geared at creating unemployment, opting for a continuation of social welfare payments as distinct from creating opportunities to provide employment?</P>
    <P>I said to the Minister today at Question Time that I know of no other area which has greater potential for job creation and which would give a good return to this nation.  Every forester would readily admit that staffs are inadequate to deal with the appropriate maintenance of young forests which have been planted at great national expense.  What is the sense in pursuing economic policies where one Department, the Department of Social Welfare, seems to have an unlimited reserve of money to pay out unemployment benefit to a large unemployed population, when at the same time areas of potential economic development which could provide employment are being ignored by the Government in their policies?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the many very dedicated people in the forestry and wildlife sections of the Department who pioneered forestry development down through the years and who were responsible for giving us a base for the limited industry which we have today.  I know that many of them, some now in retirement and some gone to their reward were men of vision who had their efforts frustrated by the heavy and cumbersome hand of the Civil Service.  The evidence of that form of bureaucratic control lives on in the Department today and continues to restrict the development of the forestry industry.  What is even more disappointing is the fact that the Government <Col N="2452" /> in <i>Building on Reality,</i> which is still the only economic development document available from the Government, failed to recognise the potential and to provide the necessary financial resources for the development of the forestry industry.  The Estimate before us is confirmation of the Government's failure and lack of commitment in this area.  In the final analysis Government policy and the allocation of resources necessary for promoting the industry is the only means by which it can be developed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the Government to bring before the House a long term plan for the economic development of the forestry industry.  I have no doubt that the House will give the necessary approval to any such plan and neither have I a doubt that future generations will benefit from such a commitment in terms of employment and economic development.  It is important that the House recognise that Ireland has the lowest area of land under afforestation in the European Community.  Six per cent of our land is under forestry compared with 20 per cent in the European Community. The productive capacity of Irish forests is one of the highest in Europe. Ireland has an average output in terms of cubic metres per hectare of 16 as compared with 11 in the UK, three in Scandinavia and a European average of two and a half.  Surely those two instances are clear evidence and a clear indication that we have tremendous potential which we have failed to develop in the national interest. Surely no further evidence is needed of the potential capacity in the forestry industry and what it could be if there was any commitment to its development. Without doubt we have more favourable conditions for the production of timber than any of our partners in the EC, yet the Government and the Minister have failed to recognise that potential.  Our economy has suffered and will continue to suffer unless there is a commitment to a long term uninterrupted development of our forests.</P>
    <P>What plans has the Minister for the development of 3.3 million hectares of land which is marginal for agriculture but <Col N="2453" /> suitable for forestry?  This aspect of national development must present one of the greatest challenges in terms of future economic development.  It is nothing short of a disgrace that we have 3.3 million hectares of land which has potential for development, which could yield a worthwhile economic return and which could provide valuable and urgent employment yet even in this Estimate there is no commitment in relation to job creation in forestry in the short term or in relation to the long term development of forests.  We cannot afford to leave such a large potentially productive resource underdeveloped.  A priority development programme for forestry would prove to be a positive and sustainable base for job creation.  I wish the Government and the Minister would recognise that potential.</P>
    <P>I realise that there are other speakers and I do not have the amount of time I would wish but I will refer briefly to the processing side of the forestry industry. This area is in urgent need of attention if we are to avoid serious job losses in the industry.  Through most of my contribution I have talked in terms of creating jobs but as far as the saw milling industry is concerned jobs are being placed at serious risk throughout the country.  On an Adjournment debate here last week I referred to the threat to the future of 50 saw mill workers in Irish Forest Products in Mountrath who have been laid off for six weeks and whose future is seriously in doubt because of the present serious crisis in the saw milling industry.  What is happening in Mountrath will happen in Abbeyleix Sawmills tomorrow and in all of the small processing and saw milling factories throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Energy who has responsibility for that aspect of economic development should make available to the saw milling industry, saw logs at a price which would enable them to keep in production and to retain their present employees at least.  Something which is very obvious at present is the lack of co-ordination between Government Departments.  Surely it would be better <Col N="2454" /> to make saw logs available at a realistic price to the saw milling industry than to have the saw mills lay off their workers and another arm of Government having to step in to pay those workers and compensate them by way of redundancy payments and unemployment payments. There should be a level of co-ordination and co-operation in the national interest between various Government Departments. In a time of crisis for the saw milling industry something should be done to protect the present employment which is under serious threat.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take the time of other speakers who wish to contribute so I will conclude by appealing to the Minister and the Government to recognise the fact before it is too late that this major national industry is now under serious threat for a number of reasons.  One reason which I did not refer to is the declining market for timber products here and that has arisen because this Government have undermined the construction industry which has always been a sector which utilised timber products. Because of the increased 10 per cent VAT rate on the construction industry this market has seriously diminished. Stocks are accumulating in saw mill yards throughout the country because the demand is no longer there as a direct result of Government policy in relation to the construction industry.  It would be far better and more financially rewarding for the Government if instead of increasing the VAT rate to 10 per cent they left the saw milling industry in a competitive position instead of having in the near future to pay out through the Department of Social Welfare an increasing level of social welfare benefits to workers who have been forced into redundancy because of the recession in the construction industry and our failure to invest in and develop the forests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken in previous years about the state of our fisheries and particularly about salmon fishing.  The salmon industry is at grave risk.  I am not satisfied that all the actions necessary to maintain stocks of salmon are being <Col N="2455" /> taken.  Extensive poaching is taking place off the Clare coast.  Some years ago I asked the then Minister for Fisheries to arrange for protection vessels to visit the Shannon estuary on a frequent basis.  This would help to protect our stock since the ESB hatchery station is at Parteen.  The fish are not being allowed to get up the river because of the operations of licensed and unlicensed trawlers, some of which belong to national figures, people who are exploiting the sea and taking away the bread from poor inland fishermen along the tributaries of the Shannon. The salmon fishery stocks will be wiped out unless fishery protection vessels visit the area frequently.</P>
      <P>Poaching is taking place not only along the Clare coast but also along the coasts of Mayo and Donegal.  The law is being broken by unlicensed boats and we have seen fishermen blatantly and violently resisting the forces of law and order at sea.  The Minister must take a stronger stand and if he succeeds in keeping the Shannon estuary clear of poachers, whatever few stragglers are let through the Donegal nets, at least we will have some fingerlings and some fish in the Parteen hatcheries to keep stocks going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently mariculture has become an important enterprise.  Salmon has been a major boost to this country.  On the River Fergus there is a joint venture between a private company and local fishermen in an effort to improve stocks in the river. I do not see why voluntary bodies should invest money and spend their time minding growing fingerlings while the sea is being raped by wealthy people from Dublin, Kerry and Donegal.  Why should we do that in County Clare?  The Minister has a duty to see that the protection vessel comes to the Shannon estuary more often to protect the small rivers in North Kerry, Clare and Limerick.  I deplore the violence used at sea when the protection vessel tried to arrest some poachers. Successive Governments have ignored the fact that there is illegal fishing.  There is also inequity in relation to licences. There are even people who hold licences <Col N="2456" /> and auction them.  It is not good enough to say, as Deputy Daly did, that the various fisheries boards are doing a good job in spite of limited funds.  Certainly they do not prevent people from poaching and fishing illegally.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to stop the decline of the salmon industry.</P>
    <P>The debate on the Estimates for Fisheries and Forestry usually ends up being rather dull and repetitive.  Deputies on the Opposition side criticise the Minister of the day for not doing anything about fisheries and forestry.  This Government have an opportunity to inject some new life and ideas into what have been failing industries.  There is no reason why forestry should not be a thriving industry. The same applies in the case of fisheries. We lack a sense of direction.  These industries have been seriously inhibited by their immediate association with a Department of State.  The Government should consider the setting up of two semi-State companies, one to run fisheries and another to run forestry.  They should get some new ideas and management into these two areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland said it was a disgrace that the Government were not looking after forestry, but he ignored the fact that money must be found somewhere,.  He does not seem to think there is any economic crisis.  He does not seem to remember that this Government took over at a time of serious financial difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Things are worse now.  The Deputy's party started the rot with deficit budgeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not realise how bad the situation was until we came into office.  When one inherits a ragbag one can do very little with it.  Deputies opposite would want to put their heads together and see if they have a proper policy for fisheries and forestry.  In 1982 we inherited a nice little dose down in Scarriff where they could not come to a proper agreement about supplies.  That matter has been straightened out.  Finsa are now in production but are not utilising the full amount of wood allocated by the <Col N="2457" /> Minister.  This is indicative of decline in the building industry and loss of market share.  There are better products on the market and competition is very stiff, some of it from abroad.  We must improve the quality of our products.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department should examine seriously the cost of handing over the Department's responsibilities to two semi-State bodies, somewhat like An Post and An Bord Telecom. These two bodies have been hugely successful. This kind of development would give an injection to what I believe to be two dull, uninteresting and slow moving sectors in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my disappointment and that of my party at the Estimate this year.  We have no option but to oppose it.  The Minister suggested that there was an increase of 13 per cent over the outturn on last year. I remind the House that the Estimate in the year 1982 was in the region of £18.782 million and in 1984 there was a decrease of some 2 per cent over that year.  The increase in the Department of Forestry in real terms is a reduction also, being an increase of only some 4 per cent to bring it up to £49 million this year.</P>
      <P>We must look at both fisheries and forestry and realise that we are dealing with renewable resources and that there should be a greater investment there.  We can justify a greater investment dealing with a renewable resource at this time and in difficult times like this we do not need to be reminded that a quarter of a million people are unemployed, an increase of some 85,000 people since our Government left office.  We must reduce this and we want to assist the Government in any way possible to reduce the rate of unemployment.  The industries of fisheries and forestry, with a greater investment by the Government matched by an investment by private enterprise, would reduce, not by a great extent perhaps, the rate of unemployment particularly in regions where unemployment is high; along the western seaboard it is twice the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2458" /> The fishing industry is in severe difficulties. Indeed, it is almost paralysed due to the lack of interest and initiative by the present Government.  Investment in the industry in real terms has been reduced year after year and it would appear that the Minister and the Minister of State are not making sufficient effort within their own Government to obtain further moneys for this industry.  If they are, I fail to see where the money has been made available to an important industry like fishing that employs 13,000 people, most of them in areas where the rate of unemployment is almost twice the national average, on the western seaboard and the south-west coast.  The value of our landings last year, as the Minister pointed out, was in the region of £55 million excluding salmon and exports of fish last year amounted to £85.7 million.  That plays a part in ensuring a reduction in the deficit in the balance of payments, but I fail to see that the Government realise fully or appreciate this.</P>
    <P>The industry is facing a challenge and we all must face this challenge if we are to overcome more easily the problems that confront us.  We could have done it much more easily but for the recent agreement entered into when the terms of the Spanish accession were finalised. Our Government, our Minister for Foreign Affairs and our Minister for Fisheries and Forestry did not achieve for this country the best available deal at that time, but we must accept reality and we have to live with the fact that we have a ten year transitionary period and we must try to mix it with our European partners. However, we will not have much opportunity to mix it and to buy bigger boats because the Government say in <i>Building on Reality</i> that the development of the fishing industry must now be based on improved productivity rather than fleet expansion.  If we are to mix it with the Spaniards and our other European partners we must expand our fleet and buy larger vessels of greater horsepower. <i>Building on Reality</i> prevents us from doing that from day one.</P>
    <P>We must all agree with the conclusions <Col N="2459" /> of the sector development committee who refer to the modernisation and adaptation of the fleet, exploratory fishing, market research and marketing of our fish, the expansion of aquaculture, more secondary processing with which we must all agree, and I add to that the necessity to ensure that we have greater import substitution.  To say the least, it is embarrassing to quote figures in relation to the tonnage of fish imported into this country.  From 1978 to 1982 the tonnage increased from 7,400 to 31,000 tonnes and in value terms from £10.3 million to £25.5 million.  The fish imported into this country is 41 per cent of the total domestic consumption.  We must all strive to reverse this trend.</P>
    <P>In addition to the problem with the Spaniards we must refer to the serious problem of the high operating cost of boats, low fish prices and the other general recessionary pressures that have caused serious financial difficulties for the industry.  While we agree on the conclusion of the SDC, I was rather surprised to learn after the budget speech that no finance whatsoever was made available in the budget to carry out the recommendations of the SDC.  That was a study carried out by all sections of the industry and they were unanimous in their conclusions, but now we must await a White Paper.  We have had this report for the last 12 months and the White Paper will take another 12 months at least.  I see no reason why.  We have a full knowledge of the industry, the Department and BIM have it, and the industry and those in private enterprise are all available to give their advice; still it will take 12 months to issue the White Paper.  I believe that the reason we must wait 12 months is that when it becomes available there will be no money and that there is no initiative by the Government &mdash; perhaps by the Minister but not the Government &mdash; to grant any extra money to implement the necessary steps which will be agreed after the White Paper is issued.</P>
    <P>A report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 24 March 1985 stated that the income to the <Col N="2460" /> industry was only 1 per cent up and that only 1 per cent of the complete labourforce was involved in the fishing industry. I am afraid that the thinking running through the Government is that the return on investment is not as great as they would like it to be, that we do not see the fruits of it as quickly as we would like and for that reason, because no short term gains are to be derived from this, the Government are not prepared to invest more money in it.  This is unlike references to forestry by previous speakers.  The fruits of investment are not seen in the lifetime of a Government; we are only passing through and a decision should be taken now which will have beneficial effects in ten or 15 years' time.  The Government should see that.  The Minister has a responsibility to impress upon his colleagues in Cabinet that we require a greater percentage of the national cake for this vitally important industry.  The Government seem to be abandoning the industry rather than trying to assist it. What has the Minister derived from his visits abroad, to Japan, New Zealand and Europe?  He should visit the Irish ports as often as he goes abroad and he should stay there and see precisely what the problems are, and not do as he did when he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs went to Europe on the last day of the negotiations and when they found that the kitchen was too hot flew home and left the final negotiations to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he will confirm it.  I refer the Minister to a decision taken in November 1983 when the export refund on mackerel was terminated. The Minister gave a solemn promise at that time that he would do his <Col N="2461" /> utmost to ensure in lieu of that that there would be special compensation measures. So much for special compensation measures.  We have seen absolutely nothing made available since then.  It came when nobody was forewarned, when contracts were entered into by industrialists in the fishing industry to sell their fish to third countries, bearing in mind that an extra subsidy would be available.  However, it was obviously known in the Department that this was going to be terminated and the industry were informed when it was much too late and many people suffered losses as a result of that decision.  No case was made by the Minister and we have not heard anything about the special compensation measures. Does the Minister propose to have discussions with his counterparts in Europe regarding an extra subsidy for herrings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal and the west coast are largely dependent on mackerel and our boats are not versatile enough to change over to other types of fishing.  We must ensure that there will be no further reductions in mackerel quotas. We can obtain increases in species which are no use to us, but the question of reduction in mackerel quotas just cannot be accepted.  There are suggestions in Europe at the moment that the total allowable catch of mackerel for 1985 will be something in the region of 160,000 tonnes, of which we will have &mdash; as in other years&mdash;21.3 per cent, which would give us a quota of something in the region of 35,000 tonnes.  I appreciate that this can only be recommended to the scientific and technical committee and I ask the Minister to ensure that nothing like this will be accepted, because a quota like this would be detrimental to the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister took pride in the fact that last year, when we held the Presidency, they agreed on a total allowable catch. It was unfortunate that there was any agreement because, if it had not been agreed, the Minister would not have to order the boats not to fish out of our ports for mackerel although we could sell them to third countries who are crying out for fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, when the Minister gets so ruffled, he is not too happy with the state of the industry and with the attacks coming from my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period from 1976 to 1982 there has been an increase in the cost of fuel of 300 per cent, a severe tax on fishermen and on the industry generally.  From 1980 to 1983, there was an increase of 134 per cent at a time when the CPI was in the region of 56 per cent.  The price of fuel in this country is much higher than in any other European Community country.  It is 18 per cent higher than the average cost of fuel in Europe.  Over the same period the price of fish has reduced by 19 <Col N="2465" /> per cent in real terms.  Therefore, with the increase in oil and the reduction in fish prices, there has been a significant decrease in profitability.</P>
    <P>The rescue package was introduced by the Minister many months ago, but as late as three or four weeks ago the industry and the IFO did not know what it contained.  It was a cosmetic exercise, an announcement of millions being made available by way of a rescue package to the industry.  A substantial amount of it was already covered in the budget, to which I will refer later.  It is unfortunate that, although we have a Common Fisheries Policy, no serious steps have been taken to formulate a national policy. While we have the very important document from the consultative committee, it will still take 12 months to get a White Paper.  If we have to wait until we have a national policy, it will be much too late.</P>
    <P>The initial rescue package which was presented to the Department of Finance should have been accepted by them. However, the rescue package eventually agreed cost only 25 per cent of the original one which we understand was presented to the Department.  I am sure that the Department of Fisheries and BIM felt it was necessary, but the Minister for Finance and the Government decided that the industry, the Department and BIM were looking for far too much.  The extra £500,000 for fuel oil is not satisfactory. The £1.2 million for loans is not satisfactory.  The £500,000, which had been included in the Book of Estimates, for marketing and exploratory fishing is not satisfactory.  The £2.7 million for harbour development &mdash; £2.2 million was included in the budget &mdash; is not sufficient for that work.  We welcome the provision of a synchrolift at Killybegs and the commencement of the works at Greencastle but it would be remiss of me not to mention the long awaited harbour development work at Burtonport.</P>
    <P>Many small harbours around the country await maintenance and repair but money has not been made available to Donegal County Council, or any county <Col N="2466" /> council, to carry out such work.  Our harbours are deteriorating to such an extent that it will cost a lot more to repair them in five or ten years time.  The Government should make money available to county councils for repair and maintenance work.</P>
    <P>I will be parochial now and refer to a grant of £18,000 made available by Roinn na Gaeltachta for a which on Inishbofin Island.  That winch is badly needed.  The Minister should try to ascertain why the which has not been provided.  He should also inquire about a grant for the leading lights at Aphort on Aranmore Island. They were to have been provided by the Office of Public Works when completing the slipway on that island but we have been told that the grant may be withdrawn if the work is not carried out soon.  Lights there are essential.  An extension to Aphort pier is essential but the response from Roinn na Gaeltachta has been negative.  The base for it has been there since the time of the British and all we have to do is build on it to accommodate the extra boats using the pier in recent years.  Such work should be considered for 1986.</P>
    <P>I must point out that power points are essential on all small piers.  I do not think any official from the Department of Labour would accept that a cable running 200 yards on a main road is safe.  It is dangerous.  The Department and county councils have a responsibility to provide safe power points under lock and key at all small piers, irrespective of the number of boats using them.  The pier at Kincasslagh should be resurfaced by the Department.  Many of the piers around Donegal are in need of repair.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the history of the Burtonport project.  Some years ago it was agreed that Burtonport harbour should be dredged at the cost of £1 million and that the finance should come from the Government, 50 per cent from Fisheries, and 50 per cent from Roinn na Gaeltachta as was customary down the years.  On numerous occasions when we met the Minister, the Minister of State, and their officials, we were given to understand that the job would be done <Col N="2467" /> with a 100 per cent grant from the Government immediately money became available.  Obviously, it was very embarrassing for the Minister when he could not secure sufficient money because he decided that there should be an increase in the allocation from Fisheries to 75 per cent, no contribution from Roinn na Gaeltachta, leaving the onus on Donegal County Council to provide the remaining 25 per cent.  In fact, Donegal County Council have not yet been informed of that decision by the Government. The Minister, realising the financial constraints on the county council and the necessity to dredge Burtonport harbour, should have a rethink about that work and where the finance should come from.  In his capacity as Minister for the Gaeltacht he should have another look at this project.</P>
    <P>We would welcome a grant of 75 per cent but we were under the illusion for some years that a 100 per cent grant would be available.  For that reason there is an onus on the Minister to have another look at this and consider making a full cost grant from the Departments or 75 per cent from Fisheries and 25 per cent from Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister said he was disappointed that the industry was not taking advantage of FEOGA grants for the modernisation and restructuring of boats up to 33 ft.  We can all be disappointed about that but while the industry is in such serious difficulties that cannot be done.  The Government must give the lead.  We must give credit to the industry for having matched Government investment down the years when they were in a position to do so.  It is unfortunate that the industry is not in a position to invest now.  There was also reference to exploratory fishing.  An intensive programme of exploratory fishing is necessary to provide the processing and retail sectors with more fish.  A reliable fresh fish market would help the fleet to return to profitability.</P>
    <P>An increase of £500,000 for marketing and exploratory fishing is not sufficient. There should be a greater investment in <Col N="2468" /> exploratory fishing.  We must have a greater increase in quotas for the species off our coast, particularly mackerel.  In the sharing of total allowable catches it appears that we are being treated as a country with a fully developed industry, equal to developed industries in Europe. It should be remembered that our industry is only in its infancy and far from being developed.  The Minister should revert to the 1976 Hague Agreement which recognised our difficulties.  Our difficulties now are more serious and the Minister should strive for a similar agreement now.  Under the Hague agreement we were allowed to double the catch over a period and we got room to develop but we do not have any room to develop under the common fisheries policy.</P>
    <P>Some people may not be fully aware of the ratio of jobs ashore to jobs at sea.  There is a fallacy that we are at the bottom of the league in Europe, that one job at sea can create seven jobs ashore. The ratio in Denmark is one at sea to one ashore and in Germany it is one at sea to three ashore but a factor in regard to that country is that a substantial amount of the raw material processed in Germany is conveyed overland from other countries and is not necessarily caught by German boats.  The ratio in Holland is 1:1.5; Norway, 2:1; UK, 1:1.  We should make that known because too many people are critical of the industry, the fishermen and the Department because we do not have more jobs ashore.  We can compete with other countries as far as that ratio is concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to herring, will the Minister confirm if duty-free herring still come in from Canada and third countries. While that was acceptable some years ago when the North Sea and the Baltic Sea were closed it cannot be now since stocks have recovered there and the seas have been opened.  I understand that there is still no duty on herring from Canada and third countries.  We should pressurise our partners in Europe to add a duty to herring from those countries. Those imports are having a serious effect on the European market resulting in a reduced price for herring from here.  As <Col N="2469" /> well as suffering from low prices, we suffer because of our remoteness from the market.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture and fish farming are covered in this report.  We can increase the number of those employed in that industry by a reasonable number over the next few years.  At present 3 per cent of those involved in the industry are in fish farming and there is scope to double this figure over a five or six year period.  While the numbers in terms of labour may double, the figure will more than double in terms of value and prices.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we are fortunate in having some areas with non-polluted waters. Great strides are being made in fish farming, particularly at Dunkineely where private enterprise, the ESB and BIM are working together and we will see results in a few years.  These people have made a tremendous investment in this area and they may not get any return for two or three years.  Eight or ten people are employed there.  It is time for everyone to cease being critical of people who are prepared to invest in industry, and especially fish farming which is an extremely high risk business.</P>
    <P>More money should be made available for the training of young fishermen in the training centre in Greencastle which the Minister of State opened last year.  There is room for expansion there.  More young people are interested in attending this centre but are unfortunately unable to gain admittance because of the size of the school.  This might be considered by the Minister when he is preparing next year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have to refer to section 84 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.  Since that time no aquaculture licence has been granted.  If one is interested in fish farming one must obtain a licence from the Department of Communications.  They can only issue a draft licence until such time as an aquaculture licence is obtained from the Department.  If the Minister does not have the information at hand, perhaps he would tell us later the number of licences that have been granted since 1980.  I cannot understand why it has taken so long to issue these licences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2470" /> I would like to refer to the salmon industry and salmon fishing off our coasts.  Is there anybody in this modern age who is prepared to use a method of fishing which is not the best?  The fishermen want to use monofilament nets because they are best.  There would be no difficulty in reaching agreement with the Department because these people are willing to fish only between sunrise and sunset, no night fishing, and a five day week, but I believe the officials are not willing to meet the wishes of the fishermen. They are prepared to continue this antiquated system.  The bigger boats are allowed to use these nets but the small fishermen in their 30 foot or 40 foot boats are not allowed use the most up to date methods available, although the Government are quite happy to take the VAT they pay on their nets.  The fishermen would be prepared to get involved in a restocking programme with the local anglers, the regional boards and the Department.  They would agree to a percentage of their catch being retained by the co-operatives to ensure that enough fish was available for restocking purposes.</P>
    <P>If too many fish get up the river, that also can create problems.  The Minister referred to the reduction in the number of salmon caught last year.  We are all aware of the reasons for this.  If we go back over the years we will find that once in every five years stock numbers fall. This year it appears that fish numbers will be up not only on the 1984 figures but on the 1983 figures too.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the local angling associations for the very good job they do in helping to restock.  These people do not benefit directly or indirectly from this: they do it for their love of fishing and their interest in developing the industry.  The Minister's officials should consider making more money available through the regional boards or the local anglers association for restocking rivers.</P>
    <P>I want to express my gratitude to the crews of the lifeboats.  They do an excellent job.  They are available at all times but, unfortunately, they are most often <Col N="2471" /> called out during atrocious weather. These people receive no financial rewards and are prepared to help the many people who unfortunately find themselves in difficulties.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to forestry.  It is regrettable that there is no common forestry policy in Europe and that we do not have a national forestry policy.  More money must be made available by the Department for thinning because we cannot afford to have uncontrolled jungles. I welcome the auction system mentioned by the Minister, even though there might be a transitional period before we have the full auction system in operation. I believe those involved in this industry will welcome this move.  The Minister said if there was sufficient raw materials there would be more processing plants. In my county we have sufficient raw materials and a processing plant should be considered for that area over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy) Michael D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contribute briefly to this debate because of my responsibility in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I thank all who contributed to the debate which has been an extremely good one, apart from a few nasty remarks from Deputy Gallagher who makes a very good contribution but spoils it by some very unfortunate remarks, but we do not worry about that.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry is a natural resource and its value to the economy is somewhere in the region of £150 million annually.  It has considerable potential for job creation, and more importantly, it has considerable potential for wealth creation which the country very badly needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated by the Minister in introducing the Estimate, the provision for fisheries this year represents approximately a 13 per cent increase on the 1984 output.  This is an indication of the Government's commitment to and interest in the area.  The Opposition have consistently <Col N="2472" /> made the claim that there is a reduction of 2 per cent, but that is incorrect. The value of fish landings and imports have continued to expand in recent years, despite the difficulties which have faced the industry.  These difficulties, I am glad to say, are being gradually overcome, particularly in relation to prices.  Prices for most varieties have improved considerably over the past 12 months and with the total removal of excise duty on fuel oil used in fishing, the net return to fishermen is increasing. Because of the high dependency on oil, operating costs are difficult to control and it is therefore important that the best possible marketing strategy be adopted for our fish catches.</P>
    <P>The marketing development strategy aimed at expanding the Irish market for fresh and processed fish products was drawn up and introduced back in 1984 by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The main components of this market strategy are as follows: to protect the established Friday market for fish, to expand the demand in market share on other weekdays in the household and the catering segments of the market and to increase import substitution. The home market development objectives which formed the basis of the board's promotional strategy for the period 1984-88 include the following: Increased <i>per capita</i> consumption of fish; increased market share of fish against the main protein alternatives; increase in the number of housewives serving fish twice or more per week to 16 per cent by 1988; development of retail fish sales in supermarket outlets so that 50 per cent of fish is purchased in supermarkets in 1988 compared with around 22 per cent in 1983; improvements in fish distribution and increasing import substitution in processed fish.  Our aim is to secure a 25 per cent share of the market for those imported prepared fish products which could be manufactured here.  BIM have been allocated an additional £.350 million for marketing in 1985 with a total of £685,000 for that purpose.  In addition, an increased allocation of £190,000 has been made available for exploratory <Col N="2473" /> fishing.  This assistance, together with the revised arrangements for loan repayments and removal of the excise duty on fuel should help considerably in the return of the fleet's viability.</P>
    <P>Investment in fish processing is also continuing at a satisfactory level, with both State and EC aid.  This investment not only provides an outlet for fish landed by our fishermen but also provides employment in areas where little alternative employment is available.  My major objective is to expand the level of exports of fishing products, especially processed fish.  The Market Advisory Committee, which I chair, are succeeding in developing new outlets for the fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There will be smoked mackerel and smoked herring.  I am glad to say that the first 22 tonne consignment will leave Wexford within the next three weeks.  We have also designated a well known firm from a major port in Donegal, one in Dublin and one in Galway &mdash; four areas.  One might pose the question, why export fish to a place like Canada? During our research into this market, which was done by the Market Advisory Committee at the request of the industry who said that this market was available, it was found that the Canadian market is wide open in relation to a demand for different species of fish.  While it is a very large fish producing country, nevertheless there is tremendous room for markets there.  I am very glad to say that fish could leave this country and be on the shelves there in two days.  This was something on which research was carried out, also.  We can also compete rather well on price.  Ten names were given in and four firms were selected.  I appeal to those firms to make sure that they uphold the highest possible standards, because that is all that will be accepted over there.  It takes three to four years to build up these markets.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the Opposition that it is my intention, through this advisory committee which represents all sections of the industry, to attempt to get two large markets outside this country, in countries which have not been explored in the past, on an annual basis.  We were successful last year.  We brought in Poland which had not imported fish before, except on a very limited basis, and we will also bring in Canada.  As far as the industry is concerned, that is a very worthwhile development.  One of the greatest problems that I found in the fishing industry is the very bad state of the market.  I think that this has been accepted by the industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question was asked by Deputy Daly which I have been requested to <Col N="2475" /> answer, in relation to the Greenland white-fronted goose.  A ban on shooting was imposed three years ago to enable research to be carried out and that report is expected within the next couple of weeks.  I shall then ask the Wildlife Advisory Council to examine that and report back to me.  It is right that I should not comment any further.</P>
    <P>Several points were made but I have been asked just to deal with the fishing side of things and the problems in relation to that.  Deputy Pat Cope Gallagher and each Deputy raised the question of the development of our harbours.  I am prepared to accept that there is a problem in that regard, but this is something which did not come about in the last two or three years.  We have had that problem over ten or 12 years and I question the wisdom of the previous Governments in allowing all the money to be put into our five major harbour sites at the expense of all the small harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am contributing. The Minister has to reply.  I am replying to questions in small areas and contributing to the debate, as well.  It is the Minister's duty to reply, not mine.  That is the regulation in relation to an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to harbours, we are providing £2.7 million for this year.  I am prepared to accept that this is inadequate. However &mdash; and this is where the Opposition fail to recognise the point &mdash; the Government's policies have been to cut down on public expenditure.  Nevertheless, as a result of prudent budgeting on the one hand and the reduction of public expenditure on the other, there are benefits accruing to the industry as a whole.  In 1977, the interest rate was around 12 or 13 per cent.  Within two years it was 20 per cent and inflation was also 20 per cent.  Today inflation stands at 5 per cent.  I am prepared to accept that interest rates have not reflected the sudden reduction in inflation but we are hopeful over the next couple of years that <Col N="2476" /> we will have interest rates down from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.  I am also hopeful that over the next 12 months we will have a further reduction in interest rates, which will reflect itself in the entire industry and will be very beneficial to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the Deputy is incorrect.  More people will not be out of work.  The greatest enemy of industry was the high inflation and interest rates. From 1978 to 1983 when there were high interest rates and high inflation rates great damage was caused to industry. We are hopeful that the policies of this Government will be beneficial to the entire economy.  Every fisherman and every industrialist has an overdraft.  They have working capital and they have borrowings. All of us would love to spend another £4 million or £5 million on our ports but the policy of the Government will not be changed with regard to public spending, except perhaps in minor ways. We will ensure that public expenditure is controlled and as a result, interest and inflation rates will come down.</P>

      <P>That is the Deputy's usual performance.  We would be very surprised if he did.  He always makes some nasty remarks so far as the Minister and I are concerned.  We have our senior civil servants and we do our job properly. After another two and a half years the benefits that will have accrued to the fishing and forestry industries will be obvious to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2477" /> There has been some criticism regarding the aid package put forward by this Government.  People fail to realise that fishermen have loans for boats at 9 per cent and the same rate applies in respect of the refurbishing of the boats.  Other sections of industry would be happy to have that rate of interest.  In addition, the aid package included a reduction in the price of oil by 7p per gallon.  I reject the claim of the Opposition that the aid package has not done a good job.  The majority of the people who qualify have now applied and they are making repayments.  There will be a considerable reduction in arrears to BIM and I hope that within the next six or eight months all those who are entitled apply for the scheme and benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I have made my case in relation to marketing.  I will continue to work with the committee.  The people on that committee represent the industry.  I am not interested in their politics; I am only interested that they should make a reasonable contribution.  Last year there were 20,000 tonnes of mackerel in storage in Killybegs.  Both money and storage space were running out but the committee, with the help of the Minister, worked extremely well in disposing of that amount of mackerel to Nigeria and Egypt.  If the Deputies opposite want further confirmation of that they may contact the industry in Killybegs.  The people concerned there have thanked us personally. Today there is no mackerel in Killybegs because all of it has been sold.  That is the result of work that was done properly by the Department of Fisheries and BIM.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to try to reduce the volume of fish withdrawn from the market.  There has been a quite an amount of dumping in the past six or eight years.  The reason was that we did not have a marketing system.  In 1984 some 12,800 tonnes were withdrawn, in 1983 the figure was 14,000 tonnes and it was higher in 1982.  The Minister was asked for a report on the benefits accruing from his visit to Japan.  We are happy to say that the Japanese are over here now <Col N="2478" /> and contracts have been drawn up for the supply of herring roe from this country. There is one factory in Galway that employs 140 people and a new factory is being set up in Wexford that will employ 120 people.  These contracts are a direct result of the Minister's visit to Japan and I have no doubt that other factories will follow.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to deal with afforestation because this will be dealt with by the Minister.  The policies pursued by the Government are beneficial to the industry as a whole.  However, these are not being taken into consideration by the Opposition and in some cases by the fishermen themselves.</P>
    <P>After the disastrous salmon fishing season of 1984, I am glad to say that catches have improved considerably this year.  However, that does not mean we can forget the conservation measures that are necessary.  Because of the life cycle of salmon and of most fish conservation measures must be operated over a long period if they are to prove successful. Tomorrow I am meeting with representatives of all those involved in the salmon industry.  As the House is aware, there are extreme difficulties in relation to this industry.  I condemn utterly the people who are prepared to take the law into their own hands.  As Deputy Daly said, we give full support to the protection staff in the regional fisheries boards.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar na Meastacháin seo. Caithfidh mé a rá nach bhfeicim dóchas ar bith do na hiascairí san méid atá curtha <Col N="2479" /> os ár gcomhair ag an Aire.  Níl samhlaíocht ar bith ag baint leis an ráiteas atá curtha amach ag an Aire agus de réir mar a fheicimse, ní ag dul chun cinn a bheidh cúrsaí na hiascaireachta ach ag dul indonacht mar atá sé le cúpla bliain.</P>
      <P>I have to agree with many of the Deputies who have spoken here tonight who stated that in the presentation of the Estimate there was no imagination or positive thinking shown.  Indeed, there is little hope for the future of the fishing industry as a result of what we have heard from the Minister tonight.</P>
      <P>All of us have to accept that because of the problems created by the entry of the Spanish fleet to our waters we are at a crossroads so far as the industry is concerned.  I would not agree with those who have said that during the years nothing has been done for the fishing industry. In line with the resources available to us we built up an industry of which all of us can be proud.  We have seen the benefit of the investment that has taken place along the coastline.  There are various degrees of benefit or progress in the different ports.  Donegal and other areas were very much ahead of the rest.  We can be proud of the standard of living that has been brought about in these areas as a result of progress made over the years. Perhaps we do not agree with the rate of progress and would like to see more rapid growth, but one of the problems is that too many agencies are involved in development.</P>
      <P>When BIM were set up as a development board they were little more than a lending agency which had the right to select suitable fishermen for craft. Beyond that they had very little power in relation to the development of the industry.  The Board of Works, the Department of Finance, the county councils and in some cases the Department of Transport and Power all had to be consulted on various aspects of the industry.  That led to delays and frustration. As a result the rate of progress was not what we would have liked it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A huge Spanish fleet will be operating in EC waters and at present we have <Col N="2480" /> only about six boats which are capable of competing with that fleet.  I take issue with the Minister regarding many of the items which he mentioned tonight.  Take, for instance, harbour development.  We were given a figure of £2.7 million but that is not for development this year because most of that money is already committed to other works.  We must develop our harbours so that they will be in a position to cater for bigger boats. There are very few ports at present capable of taking large boats.  Killybegs is one such port but even there the situation is not entirely satisfactory.  We must take positive steps to ensure that our fleet is expanded in a methodical way.  If our fishing industry is to survive we must be in a position to compete with our partners in Europe.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister in relation to the refurbishing of boats and grant aid for this purpose.  I do not understand what is meant by that.  Is the Minister talking about 65 ft boats or 80 ft boats? How is it proposed to refurbish these boats?  What exactly is involved?  In his speech the Minister said that more new boats were being provided but that no additional funds could be provided towards the construction of new vessels which would require BIM loan finance. That is a sad statement when we should be taking steps to improve our fleet.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the development of a natural resource and we realise that the possibility of creating jobs in many areas in the future will be rather limited. We could expand this natural resource which would provide more employment. We can be cynical and political, especially when we see a figure of £2 million provided for the employment of experts, publicity managers and so on to assist the Department.  Deputy Bell spoke about Clogherhead this evening.  Perhaps the £500,000 which was provided for his party leader might have been better used for the development of Clogherhead pier. The Government are going astray in the policies they have adopted.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in the fishing industry is in relation to the marketing of <Col N="2481" /> fish and the price the fisherman gets for his fish.  The Minister in his speech mentioned a number of areas &mdash; for example, the Egyptian market, the Nigerian market, the Polish market for the sale of herring, the French market, the Japanese market and the USA market.  The Minister of State told us that the greatest market of all was in Canada.  How was it that the Minister did not refer to the fact that we had such a wonderful market in Canada?  I hope it is correct, but exporting fish to Canada sounds very much like bringing coals to Newcastle.  The Minister of State did not specify the exact species of fish that is marketable in Canada.  I hope we will see some worthwhile development as far as the price the fisherman gets for his fish in these markets is concerned. However, I am doubtful about it.  Fish is every expensive to buy, but the price the fishermen get is completely different from what the housewife pays for it.  BIM would have to take the blame for not being more positive in making markets available locally for fish landed in the various ports.  Most of the fish caught on the west coast comes to Dublin whereas, with the co-operation of BIM, local co-operatives could easily have that fish distributed in the nearby towns.  At present fish are transported by lorries to Dublin to the various merchants who then transport it back to the west for distribution in the various towns.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State for his initiative in trying to have something positive done in the area of marketing, but though the committee have been sitting for some time there are as yet no worthwhile results in terms of the amounts of money going into the hands of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>Some time ago during a Private Members' motion, the Minister of State said in relation to harbour development that he questioned the wisdom of investing huge sums of money in five main harbours at the expense of approximately 40 smaller ones.  I cannot understand what the Minister was talking about, because with an expanding fishing fleet and the move towards larger boats <Col N="2482" /> adequate harbour facilities must be provided. This brings me to another point, and that is that when talking about the development of smaller ports we must have some definite policy as to where our larger boats should fish and we must do something positive to protect our small inshore fleet.  The part time fisherman, though not as important to the industry as the full time fisherman, has an important role to play, too.  Most fishermen who fish on a seasonal basis do so to supplement the incomes from their small holdings or are following a tradition that has been continued around our coast for many years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must have a two-tier development.  We must endeavour to develop our inshore fleet while providing the necessary facilities for our larger fleet.  The question of harbour development in my part of the country is very serious and this is true of the Minister's county also.  Development in these counties has been slow by comparison with what has happened in other parts of the country.  I am disappointed that the Minister in referring to Darby's Point, where there is a considerable fleet and where the landings for this year are expected to be of the order of £1 million in value, said that an initial investigation is being undertaken in relation to development of that harbour.  In other words, we are only at the initial stage of considering the possibility of development there. This question has been tossed about for a number of years but the development is necessary because, apart from the fact that the local fleet has expanded, the situation arises very often whereby boats from Donegal or the Aran Islands land at Darby's Point but find it impossible to berth because of the overcrowded situation there.  I trust the Minister will have news for us soon regarding something positive being done at this harbour.</P>
    <P>Another area with which the Minister is familiar is Blacksod where some boats find it impossible to land during low tide. Consequently, they must anchor out for most of the year.  It is very unsatisfactory that this should happen and that the fishermen should have to row into the <Col N="2483" /> shore in punts during the fishing season, having worked a hard day at sea and maybe at night also.  It would be much more satisfactory if they could bring their fishing vessels all the way in.  I do not think I am unreasonable in asking the Minister to ensure that steps are taken to rectify these situations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are many other small areas in need of development but I shall not bore the House with details of these.  Instead, I will speak with the Minister personally about them in the near future.</P>
    <P>The inland fisheries boards are doing their best in regard to the preservation of our salmon and trout stocks and they should have our support.  More money should be made available for development that would enable work to continue in the winter months such as taking care of the spawning of fish and so on.  The cost in that regard would not be likely to be very high but in any case there should be more interest in that kind of work.</P>
    <P>The whole area of the preservation of salmon must be considered more seriously.  I am not convinced that we are using the right approach in meeting the fishermen on this question.  I am aware that the bigger boats have posed a problem and that traditionally salmon fishing was the preserve of the small inshore fisherman, but the owner of the bigger boat who has substantial commitments does not accept that he should be as restricted as the smaller man in regard to fishing for salmon.  Communications seem to have broken down in this regard. Perhaps if a different approach were adopted the matter might be resolved and we would be able to avoid the kind of confrontation that takes place year after year in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Another very serious problem is the whole question of the stocks of crayfish and lobster.  The time has come for the Minister and the Department to act very quickly in this regard, particularly in relation to the crayfish stocks.  The introduction of tangle nets has had a serious effect on the stocks of crayfish.  Since the tangle nets were first introduced much damage <Col N="2484" /> has been done to our stocks of cray fish. Two-thirds of the fish that get caught in these tangle nets are lost, with about onethird only being landed.  Anybody fishing crayfish at present in traditional areas where formerly large stocks were available will find such stocks greatly diminished. I remember that in 1953 with 40 pots it was possible to land five or six dozen crayfish in one day but the situation now is that one would not catch that amount in a month.  Unless the Minister takes immediate action stocks will be wiped out entirely.  Unless something is done about the use of tangle nets for crayfish we will not have any left.  We will then have lose a valuable stock, a species for which we always had a good market particularly in France.</P>
    <P>Lobster have been over-fished as well with the situation worsening year by year. One must consider the position of our inshore fleet who, in the main, were the fishermen involved in that kind of fishing over the years; traditionally that was the kind of fishing from which they earned their living.  Unless positive steps are taken I dread to think what will be the future position.</P>
    <P>There are a few things I want to say about forestry.  I mentioned one or two already today at Question Time.  I know that the brief of the Department of Forestry is to plant as many acres as they possibly can.  I am worried about the situation in many areas in the west where large tracts of bog are being taken over and planted by the Department of Forestry without any liaison with the Department of Agriculture or other Government Departments.  In some areas in the west, in the middle of bogland with the rate of planting at present taking place, people will not even have these bogs in which to cut turf in the future. There is something wrong when that kind of planting goes ahead without any liaison with other Government Departments.  In many cases I believe the acreage involved would be more beneficial to the small farmer.  I am sure the Minister is aware of developments in Doohooma and other such places where farmers have had ten or 20 extra acres added to their holdings <Col N="2485" /> and on which they can now graze five or six more cows, adding considerably to their incomes.  As many people here have suggested, one wonders whether it would not have been better that such farmers would have planted trees, watched them grow, rather than develop the land under the present system, with de-ploughing and so on.  In such instances, perhaps it would be better that the extra acreage be made available to the small farmer, giving him the benefit of the farm modernisations grant and other EC grants rather than grants for growing trees. There should be some liason with the Department of Agriculture in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I might refer now to the development of amenity and recreational areas which has taken place in our forests over the years and which is very worthwhile.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the many forests in our county that can be developed and used in that manner.  I might mention the Letterkeen forest in the Dromore area.  There is a beautiful forest there, with lovely scenery.  The same applies in Murrisk and the Killaries area, in Louisburgh, Drummin, all around that area, with scenery comparable to anything in the country.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of doing something in our county by way of having some of these forests made accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>One problem that has arisen in the case of one forest is that when the local authority erect gates or grids to prevent animals going through they will not then take over such a road as a public road, which creates problems.  It is a question of the Department and the local authority involved getting together to hammer out these difficulties that might arise on account of the Department of Forestry opening such roads to the public.  If I might revert to the Fisheries Estimate, while realising our present financial position, that it is not easy for the Minister or the Government to provide the necessary sums of money to gear out our fleet properly to meet the problems with which they are faced in relation to our EC partners, <Col N="2486" /> nonetheless we must do something positive because, if we merely continue the holding operation we are doing, the future of the industry will be anything but bright.</P>
    <P>The Minister should sit down with his officials, take a serious look at this whole question, ascertaining how far we can go by way of positive steps in order to prepare our fishing fleet to meet the competition with which they are faced at present and that they will face when the Spanish fleet becomes fully operational in EC waters.</P>

      <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State that negotiations have been concluded with the Canadian authorities to export several species of fish to Canada.  I understand that one species being exported there is crab.  I am particularly glad to hear that because we have one of the most modern crab processing plants in the country in my constituency.  Fishermen from north east Donegal as far north as Malin Head and as far south as Mayo and Galway transport their crabs to Meenaneary in south west Donegal.  Only last week or the week before the Minister in his other role as the Minister for the Gaeltacht approved a grant of almost £150,000 to this processing plant so that they could expand their plant and increase their workforce.  It will be good news for the workers to learn that some of their product will probably be exported to Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that this year's Estimate is in excess of £18½ million, an increase of 13 per cent on last year's Estimate.  That is a concrete indication of the Government's commitment to the fishing industry.  We are going through difficult economic times.  The Minister's Department have succeeded in keeping abreast of inflation and it is most reassuring that the Department of Fisheries will have their Estimate more than doubled. In spite of the doom and gloom that is being preached about the fishing industry there are many indications that progress is taking place in that industry.  For instance, the landings of fish in 1984 were <Col N="2487" /> in excess of £54 million and that is up from £47 million in 1972.  We hope it will be in excess of £60 million this year. Another interesting statistic is that exports last year were about £90 million and in 1982 it was about £72 million. These are concrete indications of expansion and development in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special measures that were adopted to help the fishing industry last year.  In the budget the remission of excise duty on fuel oil to fishermen cost the Exchequer £500,000.  To individual fishermen that means anything from £2,000 per annum, to £14,000 per annum. That is a significant amount especially to the people going through difficult times. Also a special aid scheme was introduced for fishermen in relation to loan repayments. It was an incentive to those who had fallen behind in their payments to BIM to purchase their way into this scheme which cost £1.2 million.  I understand that a number of fishermen in arrears in their payments to BIM have availed of this measure but I hope more will be enticed into the scheme before the end of the year.  Funds were also made available for marketing.  This is important because one of the complaints as to why the fishing industry is in such difficult times is that the price fishermen get for their fish has not kept up with inflation.  There is a very close relationship between demand and supply and one of BIM's priorities at the moment is to promote fish as a source of protein.  We have traditionally been fish eaters on Friday only.  I welcome the decision to encourage housewives to purchase it a number of days a week and to have it available in restaurants not just on Fridays.</P>
    <P>The processing industry is very important especially in the west.  We have a high rate of unemployment in the west. Indeed in my county it is in excess of 20 per cent.  There is great potential in the processing industry.  I welcome the announcement made yesterday by the Minister that he has been informed that a FEOGA grant of £638,000 has been <Col N="2488" /> sanctioned for a processing industry in south west Donegal near Killybegs.  I hope that will contribute towards creating more employment in that firm.  These last few years the Government have grant-aided through the Department of the Gaeltacht, the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta 14 or 15 processing plants. The emphasis is right because much more employment can be created on land.  In some of the European counties the ratio between those fishing and those working in fishery-related industries on the mainland is 1 to 6, 1 to 7 or 1 to 8, whereas in this country it is on a 1 to 1 ratio.  There is great scope for further improvement.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate this year £2.7 million has been allocated for harbour development. I am glad that a significant amount of this money will go to Donegal.  For many years representations were made by the fishermen and the people of Green castle to have development work started on the harbour there.  We are glad that money has been sanctioned this year to start work.  In my area there is the premier fishing port of this country, Killybegs.  For a number of years now they have been awaiting their synchrolift and I understand the funds have been sanctioned for that purpose.  The second most important harbour in Donegal is Burtonport.  The co-op, the fishermen and the people there are anxious that funds be made available to dredge the harbour and extend the pier.  About five years ago at a certain by-election in the county rash promises were made by the new Leader of the Opposition that there would be no difficulty and that it was to start almost immediately.  He did not start it while he was Taoiseach although he has been in Government twice since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister has met a number of deputations from Burtonport and it is high on the agenda.  If the dredging of that harbour cannot be commenced this year I hope that at least next year urgent consideration will be give to it.  Not alone does it facilitate the fishermen who use the harbour, it has a number of other uses also.  Since the Arranmore ferry was launched officially by the Minister about a year ago the traffic between Arranmore <Col N="2489" /> and Burtonport has increased very much. This harbour serves another purpose in that a number of industries, in particular the Gweedore industrial estate, bring in raw material from Hamburg through Burtonport.  They have experienced difficulties on the last few occasions when they were bringing this raw material in. Therefore, I consider the dredging of the harbour more important than the extension of the pier.  It is costly, nevertheless it would give a great boost to that area. In view of the fact that Greencastle and Killybegs have been sanctioned for this year, I hope that Burtonport will be given top priority as the next development in Donegal.</P>
    <P>There are a number of smaller harbours also.  There was big development at Bunbeg in my area a number of years ago and I understand that stage three of that work has yet to be completed.  I ask the Minister to consider that along with Cladaghnagerragh in the Kilcar area and Portnablagh further north.</P>
    <P>Probably the most significant event in the fishing industry during the year was the negotiations to bring Spain and Portugal into the Community.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the successful completion of these negotiations.  It is reassuring that no Spanish fishing vessels will be allowed in the Irish box before 1 January 1996. That will give our fishing industry and our fleet time for further development so that we can compete with the Spaniards when they are allowed in eventually.  I understand also that even after 1996 further bilateral negotiations will take place between us and the Spaniards for a phased entry of their fleet and that no matter how many are allowed in the number of vessels will not exceed 93. Regarding the accession of Spain and Portugal into the Community we can exploit their entry because they are great consumers of fish and there is a huge market of a quarter of a million tonnes per annum there.  I hope that the Department and BIM will be aware of the potential market there for our fish and expecially our processed fish.  The Minister of State has announced that a <Col N="2490" /> meeting is to take place tomorrow with the IFO and other representatives of the fishermen and that one item on the agenda is salmon fishing, protection and conservation.  I welcome this meeting. Those of us here who are associated with the coastal regions know that at this time of year we have difficulties in that area. The salmon fishermen are as anxious as anyone else to conserve salmon stocks because they realise that they depend on those stocks for their own and their children's livelihood.  My only regret is that these meetings were not held at some time other than in the middle of the salmon season.  However, they are taking place tomorrow and I hope that the meeting will be fruitful and that each side will understand the difficulties of the other.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the Forestry Estimate which is almost £50 million this year.  We all regret that, even though we have a temperate climate here that is very suitable for forestry, we have the lowest percentage of territory under forest of any country in Europe.  That is a source of regret to us all and it shows that this important area has been neglected by various Governments for a long number of years.  However, I welcome the establishment of the special review group on forestry.  Deputy Denis Gallagher mentioned a number of conflicts, which exist also in areas other than Mayo, where we must be very careful. The forestry section are inclined to plant trees in what will be used as turf cutting areas.  The various Departments involved should co-operate to make sure that we are not sacrificing one source of energy in order to provide another source.  There is great potential in forestry, considering the amount of timber imports into this country every year in excess of £100 million. That gives an indication of the potential.  Not alone could we save on imports but we could create employment where it is so badly needed.</P>

      <P>There was a certain amount of tongue in cheek in many of the Opposition speeches here.  While they made fine contributions in many cases and very sensible statements, there was a thread of demand for extra expenditure in all the areas of both fisheries and forestry without anybody telling us where the money was to come from.  I will deal with fisheries first.  There were claims that the Estimate was inadequate, that we had no policy for fisheries, that the fishing industry was on its knees.  That air of depressing doom and gloom emanating from the other side can only make things worse.  Let us at least give the facts as they are and not go overboard about the depressed state of things.  The industry is not at an all-time high, but much of what has been said is the normal ritualistic noise which is expected of Opposition speakers.  That is why we are all looked upon by the public at large as at times playing games in here.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the allegation that the Estimate is inadequate, neither do I accept criticism of the aid package.  Certain allegations have been made about the aid package &mdash; for example, that the IFO were not aware of its existence.  IFO representatives were invited to a press conference which I called an one of their senior representatives attended and listened to what was going on.  For some untold reason on a subsequent occasion he denied all knowledge that such a thing as the aid package existed.  This scheme will be in operation on 1 July.  I gave information today to Deputy P. Gallagher on the numbers involved and we are expecting more fishermen to come into this worthwhile scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Daly and others raised the matter of the protection service operated by the regional boards.  I thank him for his support.  We in this House must be seen to support the law of the land as passed by this Legislature and implemented by agencies set up here.  Any kind of soft undertones in relation to what is going on do none of us any good.  I appeal to people who are in breach of these regulations to reconsider their position. If the Members opposite were on this <Col N="2493" /> side of the House I do not think they would stand for these blatant breaches of the law.  People who are breaking the law will not get away with it, regardless of threats and the kind of carry-on we have seen recently.  The regulations are not there for some vindictive reason but to ensure the conservation of salmon stock. I will not go into details of the contradictory statements made on this matter, except to say that Deputy Pat Cope Gallagher, using a kind of contradictory logic, mentioned a request for money for angling clubs for restocking fisheries while seeking at the same time the use of monofilament nets off our coast.  We have here the most suitable and appropriate natural restocking facility in western Europe with the passage of wild salmon stock through our estuaries.  It is a question of allowing adequate escapement of that stock and nature takes over from there.  We have the rivers and pools and clean water.  That is all that is needed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly mentioned the giving of licences by regional boards.  As a former Minister he knows that the Minister allows a maximum number of licences to be given by any board.  It is up to the board to decide to give the licences to qualified applicants.  If they do not have the number of qualified applicants to take up the number of licences given by the Minister, then those licences are not given out.  The regional boards are the people who set the criteria and assess the qualifications of the applicants.  In some cases licences are held back because in the opinion of the relevant board the applicants do not meet the required criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem, but it is not a reason for giving extra licences. That would be like saying that if you appoint more weathermen you can improve the weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of harbours, Clogherhead is very high on the list of priorities but it is a question of getting adequate financing.  The people of Clogherhead are <Col N="2494" /> entitled to attention and deserve it.  We have provided this year for the model survey to be carried out.  As Deputies Faulkner and Bell said, many surveys have been carried out in Clogherhead. Part of the pier collapsed during the winter.  This is being looked after through minor repairs in the interim.  However, due to this event it has been decided that the initial intention of extending the pier in a straight line out to sea would not be the most appropriate way to do things.  A revision of the model must be undertaken and the proposal now is to extend the pier diagonally from the end of the existing pier.  It is hoped this would avoid any future difficulties.  The old model used by UCC is still ther and it will not take much to have it rearranged and set things in motion.  Model surveys and diving surveys must be done.  These things take time and we are talking about substantial expenditure on marine works, which are notorious for eating up big sums of money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat Cope Gallagher mentioned a range of items and I will go through them quickly.  The export refund subsidy was withdrawn without notice by the EC Commissioner, not by me.  As soon as I became aware of that I went to see the then President of the Commission, Mr. Thorn, who told me that he would review the position.  Having reviewed it, he said that he did not see any reason why it should be put back because the market was quite healthy and we were about to establish further markets in Nigeria and Egypt, which we subsequently did.  I am sure that Deputy Gallagher will agree that the mackerel season this year has been very good, markets have been fairly buoyant and I look forward to a continuation of that position. Every effort will be made by me and the Department to ensure the continuation of buoyant markets.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem with regard to the question of quotas.  As the Deputy knows, I do not set the quota; it is set in consultation with our colleagues in the EC on the basis of scientific data made available by ISIS.  The vibes which I am getting at present from that source are <Col N="2495" /> not too hopeful in relation to quotas for 1986 and I hope that the rumours are not true because, if they are, there will be a serious problem.  There is no point in telling me to get a bigger share of the total allowable catch&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy asked that.  I attended my first meeting of the Fisheries Council on 21 December 1982 and discovered that the actual apportionment of the TAC on a variety of species had already been settled and all that was outstanding at that stage, before agreeing on a Common Fisheries Policy, was the Danish problem.  That was settled on 25 January 1983 and that was that.  We have, I think, about 21.3 of the TAC.  I fully understand the problems which Deputy Daly had as Minister and the fight he had to put up to get that figure, but the idea of trying to renegotiate it is just not on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher also mentioned the fact that we had no money for larger boats.  The marine credit plan has been extended to enable boats of up to 33 meters to be grant-aided and to encourage diversified fishing.  There is money available but, surprising as it may seem, no suitable applicant has come forward to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps larger boats should be grant-aided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are always problems and we have to draw the line somewhere. Perhaps the Deputy is correct; I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the issuing of agricultural licences under section 54 of the 1980 Act.  That caused serious problems, as Deputy Daly knows, and we did not get over the constitutional hump in that regard until October 1983. The minute I got the green light I set out to hold public inquiries around the country, nine of which I held in rotation in order to get designation orders out, which would be followed by licences for projects by applicants who would apply <Col N="2496" /> for licences.  The Deputy might be surprised to learn that of the nine public inquiries held &mdash; after which, in my naivete, I expected to issue nine designation orders &mdash; only one order has been issued. The reason for this is that there were substantial objections at all the public inquiries by local authorities to any interference with their activities at local level in relation to the level of purification of water and the discharge into marine waters of effluent of all kinds.  That is where I am stuck at present.  I understand that the new local authorities are meeting for the first time next Thursday and many Members of the House are members of local authorities.  I appeal to them to use their good offices and influence with their colleagues to allow us go ahead to get this kind of massive development off the ground.  It will give employment where it is badly needed and where there is nothing else available.</P>
    <P>In December 1984, at my behest at a Council meeting, the Commission accepted in principle my proposal that an export refund on herring would be allowed.  Subsequent to that meeting they wrote to the Irish processors.  You asked me tonight, Deputy Gallagher, through the Chair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher raised a point about herring refunds.  The fact is that the Commission allowed this.  They made inquiries with the Irish processing industry who, because of difficulties in that there was no market for their herring, could not respond because the level of price and refund established would depend on where they got a market in a third country.  They failed to do that and it took them four months to respond to the Commission on this issue.  The Commission sought more information and I was told in the last few days that there are possibilities of establishing a market in third countries that will give us a base here from which we can seek some level of refund from the Commission. The machinery and the formula are there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Denis Gallagher referred to the Spanish fleet.  The fact is that we got a ten year total derogation.  After that there will be very restricted intrusion. There will also be a facility at that stage to discuss the matter again.  I am long enough around to know that vigilance is of the utmost importance in this case, and vigilant we will be.  I hope that whoever is dealing with this matter in ten year's time will be vigilant.  I do not think we need have any undue worries about what will happen in ten year's time provided we do the right thing in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marketing of fish is a problem. There is oversupply of certain species.  I have been suggesting that we should try &mdash; it is easier said than done, of course &mdash; to diversify into species which we did not deal in traditionally but for which there is an outlet.  The response one gets from the fishing community is &ldquo;Get a bigger quota in mackerel and herring&rdquo;. That is all very fine, but we are treading on very dangerous ground.  We are talking about our dependance on mackerel to the tune of 60 per cent of our total catch at a time when the scientific data rumoured to us is that we are going to have to take a 50 per cent, or more, drop <Col N="2498" /> in our quota.  That is an area over which our control is limited.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to look at this in a rational, reasonable and sensible way, we are going to be in trouble.  While everything is going well nobody cares, but when the bubble bursts everybody begins screaming &ldquo;Why is it that somebody else does not do something about this&rdquo;?  I am saying that the signs of trouble are now on the horizon for some of our most popular species.  I would like that point understood.  I am not saying that so that I will be able to say in a year's time or five year's time &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;; but, unfortunately, that is the position as I see it from the vibes I am getting.</P>
    <P>In regard to the <i>Sheralga</i>, I should like to state that I sympathise with the people involved.  My Department are not directly involved but I will again contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has in the past been using every means at his disposal to bring home to the English authorities the efficacy of giving fair play to the people who were nearly drowned and whose boat was lost as a result of the incident.  I can assure Deputies Faulkner and Bell that I will bring this matter to the attention of my colleague in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>There is a fair degree of tongue in cheek about forestry.  Forestry has a very bright future here provided the investment in it is handled in a way that is sensible and viable.  We are unique in regard to forestry.  In my opinion the State has done more than its share &mdash; I am talking about the taxpayer &mdash; in that we have 85 per cent of the cake.  It is a profitable enterprise in the long term and I have been trying to encourage private investment in forestry, as can be judged from the applications we are receiving. We want more of that.  I should like to ask Members to try to encourage people and institutions to seriously consider investment in forestry as a long term viable profitable business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of growing trees on bog, I should like to point out that we stopped that some years ago for the very good reason that it does not make sense at a time of very expensive <Col N="2499" /> energy to grow trees on top of deep bog. The most suitable land for growing trees is shallow or cutaway bog.  Generally speaking, we no longer grow trees on large tracts of deep bog where there is energy to be extracted.</P>
    <P>The Trees for Ireland campaign is really not a matter for Forestry, it is an international cultural project which I am pursuing.  The project was initiated by the Fianna Fáil Leader some years ago.  The idea is that we should have in every county a forest, or part of one, designated to people of Irish extraction now living in America who would pay towards the plantation.  I hope to be in a position to announce fairly rapid progress in that regard in the next six weeks or two months.</P>
    <P>With regard to forest fires, I should like to warn people of the danger of forest fires to life and limb and a major taxpayers' asset.  I should like to thank the fire services in the different counties and the many volunteers and officials in my Department who in many cases go beyond the call of duty in trying to contain the terrible forest fires.</P>
    <P>I have been accused by Deputy Hilliard of changing forestry policy.  There has not been a change in forestry policy.  We adopted the Fianna Fáil policy that was in operation when we took office in December 1982.  We have the same target for planting.  If anything the only perceptible change is the emphasis I am trying to place upon private investment in the afforestation area.  I am sure that when Fianna Fáil were in office they tried to do something similar.  Out there there is a potential area of investment which we all have a duty to promote.  There is money in the private sector and we should try to induce people to invest that money. There are jobs available, but it is incorrect to say that thousands of jobs could be created in the forestry section.  We should not cod ourselves about that.  I would say that hundreds, rather than thousands, of jobs could be created in forestry provided we got a degree of investment to bring about the developments necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2500" /> I must deny categorically any tinkering with the price of sawlog by the Department to raise prices to artificial levels.  We are not doing that.  The price of sawlog here is set by market forces within the country without any interference from us or by us.  I must nail that allegation.  There are jobs in jeopardy on the processing side simply because there is an urgent need for rationalisation within the sawmilling industry.  The people involved know that, but when something causes problems in a particular area they blame the Department of Forestry. That is normal practice and I accept that &mdash; my skin is, thank God, thick enough to be able to resist any temptation of kicking back.</P>

      <P>The British Department of Health and Social Security advised this Department on 21 August 1984 that they were investigating her possible entitlement to a United Kingdom pension which was subsequently awarded with effect from 1 March 1980.  Arrears for the period 11 March 1980 to 24 December 1984 amounting to Stg£12,456.89 (IR£15,247.11) were received here on 19 April 1985 and she has been in receipt of British Widow's pension at a rate of Stg£48.99 a week since 25 December 1984.</P>

    <P>Her Irish Widow's non-contributory pension which is subject to a means test was then reassessed to take account of the British award and a pension order book at the revised rate of IR£45.45 a week from 7 June 1985 (which will be increased to £51.80 a week from 12 July 1985) was issued to the designated post <Col N="2368" /> office on 10 June 1985 for collection by her.</P>
    <P>An overpayment of IR£14,805.80 dating back to 11 March 1980 arose on her Irish pension as a result of the British award and this has been recovered from the arrears of United Kingdom pension. The balance of the arrears amounting to IR£441.31 have now been sent to her by payable order.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed an old age contributory pension on 12 November 1984.  His insurance record shows that he would have an entitlement to an old age contributory pension, at a reduced rate, on reaching age 66.  As stated in reply to the Deputy's previous question on 13 December 1984, the Department's records show that he entered insurance in January 1936 and quoted his date of birth at that time as November 1919.

      <P>Entitlement to an allowance under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme is, under the legislation, a matter to be determined by the health board having regard to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, who are responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme in the Dublin <Col N="2372" /> area, that the person concerned is in receipt of a weekly supplementary welfare allowance of £38.10 since 17 June 1985 in respect of her child and herself.  This is the statutory basic rate of supplementary welfare allowance for a person with a child dependant, who has no means. Under the regulations governing the scheme an allowance cannot be paid in respect of her husband while he is in hospital but such an allowance could be paid should he be discharged.</P>
    <P>In addition to the basic weekly payment there is provision under the scheme whereby a health board can make a single payment to meet an exceptional need.
