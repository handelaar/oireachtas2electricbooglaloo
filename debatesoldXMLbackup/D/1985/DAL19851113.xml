      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Section 20: In page 12, lines 41 to 50 deleted, and in page 13, lines 1 to 8 deleted, and the following substituted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" />&ldquo;20.&mdash;(1) Where a person who is either an officer or a servant of the Board is&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, or</P>
    <P>(b) elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities, or</P>
    <P>(c) regarded pursuant to section 15 (inserted by the European Assembly Elections Act, 1984) of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, as having been elected to such Assembly to fill a vacancy.</P>
    <P>he shall thereupon stand seconded from employment by the Board and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, the Board any remuneration or allowances in respect of the period commencing on such nomination or election or when he is so regarded as having been elected, as the case may be, and ending when he ceases to be a member of either such House or such Assembly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to protect the employment of staff of Bord Altranais who may be nominated for Seanad Éireann, or elected to either House of the Oireachtas or to the Assembly of the European Communities, or regarded pursuant to the European Assembly elections legislation as having been elected to the Assembly, until the commencement of such nomination or election.</P>
    <P>Under the present provision of section 20(1), which is the standard provision for statutory bodies, a person would stand seconded from employment by the board from the date of his or her nomination as a member of the Seanad or appointment to the European Assembly, or nomination as a candidate for election to either House or to the Assembly.  Objections were raised in Seanad Éireann to the provision regarding nomination as a candidate for election to the Seanad on the grounds that, under the current Seanad <Col N="2014" /> electoral legislation, a person can be so nominated without his or her consent and cannot then withdraw his or her candidacy. It is contended that valuable persons may be lost to statutory bodies because of nomination for election and they may not, in fact, succeed in being elected.</P>
    <P>I agreed with the Senators that this is an undesirable situation and, accordingly, I decided to amend section 20(1). I felt, however, that any amendment should also provide protection for persons who are nominated for election to Dáil Éireann and to the European Assembly and my amendment provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the amendment and I want to thank my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, for agreeing to take the amendment this morning to enable the Bill to be enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the amendment. The Minister has given the reasons for this amendment and I agree with what he says.  It is in the interest of the staff of An Bord Altranais that this amendment should be passed.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 16 and 17, &ldquo;mentioned in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of that subsection&rdquo; deleted, and &ldquo;therein mentioned&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendments reported and agreed to</P>

    <Title>National Development Corporation Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that in speaking against the provisions of this <Col N="2015" /> new body I am doing so with some reservations. I know the Minister has no wish to provide this corporation now or at any other time.  In putting this measure together he is simply acting on instructions. It is sad that the time of this House has been spent putting through a measure which Fine Gael see as being in conflict with their right wing views, while Labour see it as the single and complete answer to all the problems facing this country. In my view both sides are wrong in their approach.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong with using public or private enterprises to do a particular job.</P>
      <P>The yardstick for deciding this matter should be to find out which structure would give the best results in present circumstances.  The main party in Government have no confidence in this corporation except as a means to quieten Labour Deputies.  This action is obviously the wrong one for Fine Gael.  Not alone is it the wrong one but it is a dishonest one.  The Labour Party belief in the magical powers of the proposed corporation makes people wonder about such a simplistic approach.  The agency is not fundamentally good in itself; it is only good if it can deliver the jobs.  If they can deliver the jobs, they will only be delivering the jobs the Government failed to deliver.</P>
      <P>Where similar bodies have been set up in other countries they have been unsuccessful. The original contention when setting up this corporation was that they would sell off successful enterprises and use the funds to set up new projects but because of Labour's opposition to this move, this will not happen.  It seems to me that all the Labour Party want is to have this corporation set up.  This has been their dream as far back as 1969. They see State ownership as the way to develop all industry.  The Minister has backed away from the proposal to sell off successful enterprises and instead he has made a woolly statement about what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a conflict between the two parties in Government over what should happen to a successful enterprise, what would be the position if the enterprise <Col N="2016" /> were less than successful?  The attitude of these two parties so far as the National Development Corporation is concerned reminds me of two goats, each going their own way.  The truth is that the National Development Corporation as proposed will be well nigh unworkable if these parties see it from opposite viewpoints.  It would be a recipe for disaster.  State enterprise, private enterprise or cooperating enterprises should be used as means for creating jobs.  The late Seán Lemass, who was the doyen of industrial development, would use any method available to get appropriate results.</P>

      <P>The late Seán Lemass had his own views but he was the man who was responsible for the development of this country in the fifties and sixties. He left a base which over the last few years the Coalition Government have made little effort to retain.  The Grogan report, which is on the Minister's desk, relates to the huge amount of imports of building materials and ready-mixed concrete from Northern Ireland which are damaging our home industry.  We have no objection to Northern producers exporting their goods&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating my remarks to the corporation and what we should do to develop our resources.  In talking about the NDC we must talk about industry in general.

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do without the NDC if the Government develop the areas relating to concrete and pre-cast concrete blocks, where at present we have massive imports.  Similarly in forestry we have huge imports.  We should be allowed to deal with the areas neglected at the moment but which if developed would mean that the NDC would not be necessary.  Grogan Associates were asked to look into the importation of concrete and quarry products from Northern Ireland.  In the five counties along the Border, stone, gravel and sand imports were at 35 per cent in 1984; concrete blocks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Leonard, the Chair is well aware of the problem the Deputy is trying to ventilate and I am reluctant to stop him doing so but if the Chair were to permit that, the Chair would then have to allow a wide ranging discussion that would cover everything from aviation to drainage, and the Chair cannot do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position if the Minister recommends a National Development Corporation and we say that instead of setting up the NDC we should develop forestry, concrete products and areas in which we have lost hundreds of jobs?  Those areas should be developed as alternatives to setting up the NDC.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Leonard would bear with the Chair.  The Chair does not object to the Deputy making reference to these things but the Chair cannot permit an in-depth discussion on them.  To do so would be an absurdity on the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend that. In view of the information we are getting as a result of parliamentary questions and so on, I am satisfied that there are many <Col N="2018" /> areas on which the Minister and his officials should concentrate so as to develop our natural resources, rather than the setting up of the NDC which the Government are only setting up to placate their bedfellows in the Coalition.  I have a right to identify the areas which should be developed.  The fruit and vegetable industry should be developed.  We had a committee of junior Ministers set up last year but we have heard little of their proposals to deal with that area in which there are also massive importations with resultant serious unemployment.  For instance, we have the infrastructure which includes tomato houses lying idle due to the inactivity of the Department in providing grants for solid fuel burners.  These burners were belatedly provided although we had requested aid in this area so that people would be in a position to compete with the other EC member states who are exporting their goods here.</P>
      <P>We have a report from the IDA, the 1981 report on the timber industry.  What has been done to implement that report? It is more important to implement that report than to set up the NDC.  This report outlines the defects in the system and the action needed to be taken.  In reply to a question last week I found that the imports of chipboard amounted to 67,000 tonnes, costing £16 million.</P>

      <P>I must try to keep the Deputy on the rails.  What is relevant here is whether this corporation should be set up, not whether something else would do something else.  If the Deputy refers to the explanatory memorandum he would see that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism of a limited company to be called the National Development Corporation.</P>

      <P>There were also discussions on deficiencies in the system in the very areas I outlined which we should be concentrating on and applying ourselves to.  It is a matter of bringing in legislation for probably the wrong reasons.  Legislation brought in for the wrong reasons is never good legislation. When you bring in legislation to please, it is like giving a child sweets when he is going to bed.  To bribe them along like that is not a good policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have within the Department already, set up by way of reports and examinations in various fields, many areas where they could develop with great benefit and apply their staff, activity and energy rather than in this NDC.  I hope the Minister will see the serious <Col N="2020" /> objections which this party have to wasting time on legislation which is unnecessary and which will not address itself to the many problems which beset us.  If any private individual &mdash; for example in the industrial top bracket &mdash; were to be asked his views on whether we should have an NDC or development along other lines he certainly would not go for an NDC. There is little use in my pursuing this since I am restricted in what I am allowed to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to know Deputy Leonard supports the Labour Party's policy in relation to the NDC. Certainly he did not put up any argument against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's problem, but he did not put up any argument against it, good, bad or indifferent, other than to say that it was Labour Party policy.  He is correct.  It has been Labour Party for many years and is Labour Party policy.  It was Fianna Fáil policy also but it was not introduced in legislative terms and I will deal with that in the course of the few words I have to say.  If we have succeeded in convincing our partners in Government, the Fine Gael Party, that the NDC will be good for the country, we did not do that over the last few weeks.  We did that before we entered into Government.  It was part of the <i>Joint Programme for Government</i> as agreed between the two parties and is clearly written down in that document.  It is not only Labour Party policy.  It is also the policy of the ICTU and has been for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has been a member of that congress for about 30 years at various levels, I am fully conscious of the amount of debate and discussion that has taken place regarding an NDC.  Therefore, it is a fulfilment of the policy of the ICTU and their affiliated unions.  As Fianna Fáil consistently support &mdash; or endeavour to support &mdash; the ideas of the trade union movement, I find it difficult to understand <Col N="2021" /> how anybody can stand up in this Dáil and say that the NDC is some figment of the imagination of the Labour Party and will not do this or that.  We should be getting our heads together in a more constructive manner and trying to suggest ways and means that will help the NDC to succeed.  However, maybe in Opposition the task is always to tear the thing down rather than help it to succeed, but it is clear that Fianna Fáil are not opposing the Bill.  It will be interesting when we come to the vote.  I am very curious about this because I have not yet heard one speaker from the Opposition side oppose the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, history is full of that type of thing.  The NDC can do a large number of things, given the opportunity to work.  The establishment of an NDC has been an important part of Labour Party policy for a number of years.  The proposed Bill contains many features which the party support fully.  It is essential that the corporation be allowed to function properly from the beginning. For example, adequate capital must be made available for new projects and investments.  The £300 million share capital allowed by legislation is very welcome <Col N="2022" /> as far as the Labour Party are concerned. The board of the corporation must be carefully chosen, with a wide range of skills and expertise, including people with strong commitment to public enterprise. In this connection we should forget about selecting people on the basis of their political affiliation and concentrate on getting the best possible expertise into that board based on ability.</P>
      <P>The practical brief of the corporation must be very wide ranging.  It must seek to establish and aid the development of strong, well managed Irish companies across a wide range of manufacturing industry and services.  I would like to refer here briefly, to the tanning industry. You, Sir, will be aware that that industry, which many years ago played a prominent part in Monaghan, Louth and elsewhere was allowed to die.  The Minister of State will be very well aware of that because his constituency has suffered as a result of it.  There is no reason why the NDC could not set up a State tannery.  The tannery industry failed and thousands of jobs and millions of pounds were lost simply because the tanneries were not properly equipped and were mismanaged. There was no co-ordinated national policy in regard to them.  Subsequently as a result the footwear industry went to the wall and is now nearly defunct.  I suggest to Deputy Leonard that that industry would be very viable in the Monaghan area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The corporation must not be a grant giving agency.  That in my opinion is the job of the IDA and it will expect adequate return from its investment.  It must not be a rescue agency like Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>The corporation should become involved in many sectors of industry, in high technology areas, in natural resources and in considering ideas from the private and public sectors with a view to bringing them to fruition in well managed projects.  The corporation must not, and I am sure will not, be interested in theory or research for its own sake but must apply the results of research in our third level institutions in projects which will provide real and lasting jobs.  Above all a successful NDC will give public sector enterprise a new lease of life. Existing semi-State concerns should in many cases find it attractive and profitable to co-operate in projects with the NDC.</P>
      <P>In passing I should like to refer to a visit the Chair and a number of Members made to Canada where we saw at first hand what can be done for the fish industry. We learned that fishing fleets there are restricted to fishing for five months of the year because of weather conditions, yet there are more than 200 fish processing plants in the general area of Montreal.  The NDC could have investigated prospects in that area.  We have an abundance of fish in the waters surrounding the country and our fishermen are crying out for new markets and new opportunities.  That is one of our greatest natural resources and there is no reason why it should not be listed as a high priority for the NDC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill covers many of the key points contained in the Programme for Government. In fact, the maximum share capital at £300 million is £100 million higher than the figure in the programme.  I should like to congratulate the Minister, and the <Col N="2024" /> Cabinet, for having the wisdom to see the necessity to write in a figure as high as £300 million.  However, there are two important divergences in regard to the holding company role and borrowing powers.  The NDC will not be a holding company for existing State companies. That is to say it will not take control of existing commercial semi-State companies. The reason for this is that major financial and operating problems in many of the existing State enterprises need to be solved.  This fact has been accepted by trade unions and employers.  It would not be correct to saddle the NDC in the beginning with a host of problem companies. It is far better to let the NDC get cracking in the first instance with new projects and job creation.  There would be little point in handing over to the NDC unsettled policy problems of certain State companies.  It is better to permit the NDC get down to the task of creating new projects and new jobs.  It will be important for the NDC resources and staff not to be diverted from its primary project, development of the job creation role.</P>
    <P>The corporation can, however, manage or act as a holding company for any new State-sponsored commercial enterprise.  In my opinion it would be desirable if effective links were to be established between the NDC and existing State-sponsored commercial enterprises. The corporation does not have power to borrow for capital purposes but merely a minor power to borrow temporarily for current expenditure.  The corporation, therefore, must depend on share capital or equity from the Exchequer of up to £300 million and on retained earnings from its projects or investments and from the sale of its assets or investments. This is known as the revolving investment fund for employment.  One advantage of the borrowing restriction is that it means that the corporation will not have to service debt payments from the beginning. I know the Minsiter will agree that this has been one of the major problems of the State and semi-State sector.  The Labour Party do not want to set up State companies just for the sake of setting them up.  We all think of the failures in that <Col N="2025" /> sector but seldom consider the successes such as Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and other who have been very much involved in job creation.</P>
    <P>The ICTU document, Confronting the Jobs Crisis, referred to the National Development Corporation.  The corporation is not only the creation of the Labour Party but is also the idea of the trade union movement which has strong links with the Labour Party.  The Telesis and the NESC reports recognised that a condition which must be met by Irish companies breaking into export markets is the achievement of a minimum scale of operation.  We should therefore concentrate greater efforts on developing a number of Irish firms with the scale, technological and marketing capabilities necessary to compete internationally in high productivity industries.  This can be done by the State through the NDC.</P>
    <P>While the Programme for Government of December 1982 envisaged such an innovative development role for a national development corporation in the development of the indigenous source sector of the economy and advanced technology projects, the White Paper on Industrial Policy effectively nullified this proposal.  There are certain important differences between the White Paper and the Bill.  The Bill envisages a strong innovative development role for the NDC and that is one of the most important differences.  Public sector enterprises should be used to secure the co-ordinated development of resource based industries. The NDC should be given the role of establishing new public undertakings where suitable projects are identified in this area and of working with existing enterprises to expand and diversify their operations.  The NDC must be adequately funded and this should be done from the outset.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear on how the £300 million will be channelled.  Perhaps the Minister will give us that information. What criteria will be used in the provision of the money and at what stage?  The NDC will have the role of establishing new public undertakings and the funding of up to £300 million as projects are <Col N="2026" /> developed will be adequate.  The NDC should be empowered to undertake appropriate investments, in association with BIM, for the co-ordinated development of marine resources, including mariculture and associated land based industries.  Potential for growth in traded services, including education, training and health care services where Ireland has both expertise and a reputation worldwide should be systematically examined.  The National Development Corporation, in conjunction with the relevant State agencies, could play a major role in developing this area of activity. The Telesis report recommended that Ireland should concentrate greater efforts to develop a number of large firms with the scale, technological and marketing capabilities necessary to compete internationally.  It emphasised that we must move into the larger scale high productivity industries such as machinery, transport equipment, electronics, consumer durables, chemicals, technical instruments and more highly processed food products and that we should concentrate on developing specialised niches in some of these lines involving innovative applications of advanced basic technologies developed elsewhere.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the hint.  We believe that the National Development Corporation can involve themselves in Irish private companies but not undertake major large scale operations and technological and marketing strengths necessary for competitive success in this type of industry. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions consider that the National Development Corporation must be given a major role in initiating and developing, in conjunction with existing public enterprises where appropriate or, where necessary, by the establishment of new enterprises, selected industrial projects in these areas.  The ICTU say there must be a new growth of public enterprise.  The National Development Corporation must be brought to <Col N="2027" /> provide for direct involvement with a dynamic public enterprise sector in the high growth areas of manufacturing in national resource based industries.  Trade unions therefore are opposed to the proposal that the National Development Corporation must, within predetermined time limits, sell off their investments to the private sector.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, this will be a contentious issue as time goes on.</P>
      <P>Under section 14 of the NDC Bill that agency are now not required to sell off investments within mandatory predetermined time limits.  The section provides for flexibility considering the particular circumstances of the investment.  Under section 31 the Minister cannot exercise power or control in relation to any particular investment.  That was one difficulty that arose when the National Development Corporation Bill was being put together.  We were fearful that what we would be doing would be setting up new industries under the NDC and, where they were good money spinners or were of use to the State for employment purposes or investment, they would be immediately sold off to private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Enterprise Agency, which is still in existence, was set up on 25 June 1981 as a limited company by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  Contrary to what Deputy Leonard has said, there was no Dáil legislation in connection with this.  The original undertaking had been given in 1979 in the Fianna Fáil National Understanding which was worked out with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Government of the day.  The commitment to establish the National Development Corporation was given in the Fine Gael-Labour Joint Programme for Government in December 1982.  In view of the Opposition's criticism of the National Development Corporation, it is worth restating the brief of the National Enterprise Agency for which the Opposition, when in Government, were responsible.  First, it was to establish organisational responsibility for commercial exploitation of new development <Col N="2028" /> opportunities by the State where such opportunities were not being exploited by the private sector and, secondly, to provide a mechanism to ensure that commercially orientated research and development are effectively applied in the economy.  I submit that those are largely the sentiments expressed in the Bill for the setting up of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was also envisaged that the NEA would engage directly in manufacturing, service and trading activities, either by themselves or in partnership with other organisations in the public or private sector, that they would be operated on a commercial basis and that there would be appropriate representation of employer and trade union interests on their board of directors.  The board was made up of four nominees from the ICTU, four from the employer organisations, the CII and the FUE, and four more appointed by the Government. Over the past years there have been several changes on that board.  In reality, the NEA never really achieved any of their aims.  As a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure, I had the opportunity recently to talk with the senior executives of the NEA.  Their submission and the record of the proceedings, which were in public, are there for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>Since their inception the NEA were hampered by a lack of funds, inadequate staffing and the temporary nature of their board.  For example, directors Mark Hely-Hutchinson, Harry O'Sullivan and Mr. H. Lunn retired by rotation in accordance with the articles of association and, being available, offered themselves for re-appointment.  Those gentlemen, who have given long and loyal service to the State would, I am sure, tell you that they were totally, utterly and absolutely frustrated in their efforts.  I feel that the same thing could happen in relation to the National Development Corporation.  In other words, if the Government of the day or the Minister of the day wanted to kill the corporation, it would be very easy to do so.  If Fianna Fáil came back into power and wanted to <Col N="2029" /> kill it, they could kill it quite easily.  That is what happened with the NEA.  Let us make no mistake about that.  There were several changes in Government.</P>
    <P>The original idea or concept of the NEA which I have given was a good one, primarily along the lines of the NDC, but the NEA were never given the teeth, or the money.  They were never given the expertise and were frustrated in their efforts from the very beginning.  They were, have been and will continue to be a total failure.  Their last annual report for 1983, for example, stated that the agency received £250,000 in grant-in-aid from the Department of Industry and Energy to meet administrative expenses. They also received £3 million in capital from the Department of Industry and Energy.  The capital funding for 1982 was £5 million but for 1982 and 1983 none of the capital funding was drawn down.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what I am talking about in relation to the operation of the NDC. The very same thing can happen and we must learn from the lessons of the National Enterprise Agency.  It would be a good idea for the Minister to examine the operation of the NEA and I am sure he and his colleagues have done so.  As far as the trade union movement are concerned, the NEA were a total, utter and absolute failure.  They suffered from a number of drawbacks but the most obvious one was lack of Government will to ensure their progress.  They are now to be replaced by the National Development Corporation and I hope that the will and support of Government, whichever Government they may be, to make the agency work will be there.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about who is politically right or wrong; we are talking about an organisation which is being set up for the express purpose of providing jobs for our people and for the control and operation of those jobs by the State, on behalf of the taxpayers who are providing the money.  The NDC differs from the NEA in that it will have legislative force once this Bill passes all Stages in both Houses.  This will entitle the NDC to significant State funding, a permanent staff, a board and a degree of innovative <Col N="2030" /> independence which the NEA never enjoyed.  The Bill attempts to bring the NDC as close as possible to the Labour Party position as outlined in the Programme for Government in December 1982.</P>
    <P>The NDC will have a special responsibility for the development of the indigenous resource sector of the economy.  It will develop a comprehensive plan for the revitalisation of the food processing industry through profitable innovation by the State sector, the private sector and the co-operative societies.  The commercial exploitation of our forest resources will also be a key priority area for the corporation.  The corporation should particularly promote development by the State sector alone, or in partnership with private investors, of advanced technology projects to ensure that Ireland is in the forefront in adopting new technologies and products of wide-ranging export potential.</P>
    <P>The Joint Programme for Government committed the new Government to initial funding of £200 million for the NDC, with a borrowing limitation of £500 million.  We welcome the increase in that funding.  The NDC will act primarily as a State investment company and will take equity stakes in new and expanding enterprises, initiate joint ventures and, on occasion, make available loan capital.  I would suggest in this connection that lessons can be learned from developments that have recently taken place but which have not received the headlines given to closures.  In Westport the footwear industry which had been the mainstay of the town closed down.  Reliable Shoes had been established there for over 50 years.  It was taken over by another company which subsequently closed.  The workers got together and formed a co-operative, with the help of some local funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of my previous rulings, I would ask the Deputy not to proceed to a detailed discussion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the NDC <Col N="2031" /> can develop areas such as this.  There is plenty of talent and there are many skilled people anxious to go to work. Their skills can be used more effectively if under the NDC these co-operatives are funded from State funds.  I have personal experience of another venture which is about to be launched following the collapse of Clark's in Dundalk which caused serious problems.  A group of people are getting together to use their skills.  The State agencies have been very helpful but that type of initiative and skill can best be co-ordinated with the funding and expertise provided by the NDC.</P>
      <P>The primary intention is to assist in the development of the traded goods sector, particularly in natural resource type industries, and those with strong supply linkages elsewhere in the economy.  I understand that the corporation will participate only if the venture is in their opinion profitable and efficient or capable of becoming so and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion growth and providing viable employment.  Perhaps the Minister might develop these criteria when dealing with that section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill mentions the particular areas of tourism, natural resources, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, marketing and related services.  The NDC may also promote, with financial assistance if necessary, the exploitation of research carried out in the universities or other third level educational institutions, the National Micro-Electronics Applications Centre and the inventions centre of the IIRS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particularly welcome from a Labour Party point of view is that the Bill targets co-operatives as the prime area for participation. I hope and pray that the NDC will concentrate on this area.  I spent most of my life from the age of 16 dealing with the problems of the working class and I have seen men and women who worked all their lives cast on the scrap heap by companies such as Clark's of England when they no longer wanted Irish workers.  These companies simply went back to the UK or wherever they came from.  I hope that the NDC will help us <Col N="2032" /> develop native industry with skilled, well-educated Irish people to own and control those companies, perhaps even on a small scale.  I will be watching the NDC very closely whether I am in the Dáil or elsewhere to see if they succeed in that area and do not become another NEA.</P>
    <P>It would be more satisfactory if the Bill actually specified workers' co-operatives or industrial and agricultural co-operatives, rather than the term &ldquo;co-operatives&rdquo;. It should be spelled out more clearly in the Bill.'</P>
    <P>The share capital of the corporation is £300 million but the October 1985 Bill reduces substantially the NDC's ability to borrow.  While this reduction eliminates the risk of large borrowings which would be funded indirectly by the taxpayer, it may prove to be a serious drawback in their potential for investment, particularly investment in natural resources such as fisheries or forestry which would require substantial initial capital outlay.  One of the problems in developing native resources is that one has to have money before one can borrow.  I am suggesting that the initial outlay is most important.  Financial returns on investments or dividends will become part of the revolving fund which is to be the NDC's float for investment in further attractive enterprises.  Ministerial clarification will be necessary on the question of how this funding is to be applied. For example, section 8 (3) provides:</P>
    <P>(3) The Minister for Finance may, with the consent of the Minister, take up by subscription shares in the Corporation, having regard to the amount of capital investment proposed by the Corporation and the amount of capital available to the Corporation derived from its own funds.</P>
    <P>This puts the thing in a chicken and egg fashion &mdash; the Minister for Finance may, with the consent of the Minister for Industry take up by subscription shares in the corporation having regard to the amount of capital investment proposed by the corporation and the amount of capital available to the corporation from their own funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> Ministerial clarification is necessary there.  It must be envisaged that viable projects will require initial heavy capital outlay and it may take some years before funds begin to roll back to the NDC. Section 11 deals with the board of directors. Most interested parties acknowledge that the success of the NDC will depend in good measure on the board of directors.  It will be necessary that they should have a steady commitment to the development of a progressive State sector.  The board will consist of nine members, including the chairman, and they will be appointed for five years.</P>
    <P>Proponents of a State investment company of necessity must put their trust in the ability of the appointed experts to select economically and socially advantageous projects.  Labour in Government must ensure that the board will not prove to be a handicap to the principles enshrined in the Bill.  Earlier I referred at length to the charade of the NEA which, of course, was not properly structured. It was a failure.</P>

Section 13 (b) is concerned with the realisation of investments made by the board as soon as it is financially and commercially prudent, in such a manner as to enable the corporation to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by the board and to ensure that funds will be available for employment through the revolving investment fund.  Though ensuring a steady flow of finance into the revolving fund, the section in practice could be interpreted as legislating approval to sell off viable State enterprises into the private sector, thus depriving the State of thriving industries. I said earlier that I hope we are not setting up a mechanism for developing good <Col N="2034" /> industries from natural resources and then handing them over for private gain. It can be envisaged that the private sector would covet the successful enterprises but that struggling operations would be left in State hands &mdash; we would sell off all the good fellows and be left with the cripples.</P>
      <P>Section 28 (b) concerns NDC share capital in subsidiaries.  The NDC may not hold more than half the nominal value of the share capital of an enterprise.  This might cause future problems if the subsidiary were to move in a direction not wholly acceptable to the NDC.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this section for us.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, it will be necessary to consider Labour Party policy on fisheries, agriculture, food processing and transport. A committee of the party are at present preparing a policy paper on forestry. We hope to use that policy to monitor the development of the NDC to ensure that they will be 100 per cent successful.</P>
      <P>Investment is the key to the solution of fundamental production problems.  State investment has been falling.  The volume of State capital spending fell by 15 per cent in 1983 and 4 per cent in 1984.  <i>Building on Reality</i> proposed further cuts in State capital spending in the next three years.  The Government appear to have decided that because some past State investments were poor, most capital spending is suspect, if it is by the public sector.  That is not the opinion of the ICTU, its affiliates, of my union, the ITGWU, or the Labour Party.  I hope it is not the Fine Gael policy.  The Government must ensure that the level of spending on the NDC will be the maximum available.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government for having increased the amount of money being made available to the NDC as against the £200 million made available earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State capital spending in 1985 will amount to £1,800 million.  Central Government will spend £1,040 million of this and State bodies will spend £760 million.  The three big spending areas which stand out in the Public Capital <Col N="2035" /> Programme are industry, at 19 per cent, infrastructure, 40 per cent, and housing, 21 per cent.  Between them they account for most of total State capital spending. Industry has the lion's share of economic investment and it ought to be generating most output and wealth.  Unfortunately, that is the area which has been cut most.</P>
    <P>The bulk of capital spending on industry is accounted for by agencies which give grants to private firms to bail them out when they are in trouble, or in other forms of support.  Agencies like the IDA, SFADCo, Udarás na Gaeltachta, the ICC, Fóir Teoranta and the IIRS receive hundreds of millions every year.  According to the White Paper on Industry, £430 million was spent by the State on industrial development alone.  State capital spending on industry involves a great proportion of taxpayers' money, all going to prop the private sector.  There must be a limit to our patience while we wait for Irish private industry to perform on its own initiative.</P>
    <P>Foreign investment here is inadequate in its size and linkage effects.  Therefore, the time is overdue for the Government and their agencies to take the initiatives themselves to seek out and to invest in new industrial projects.  We believe this is part of the NDC's function.  This is Labour Party input into the Government. We agree there with the Opposition.  If they say that the Fine Gael Party in Government are agreeing only to the NDC because it is Labour Party policy, and if that is correct, I do not see anything wrong with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the proposed National Development Corporation will constitute the answer to any of our major problems at present. Most semi-State organisations, other strata of bureaucracy and Government policies are wrongly geared towards solving these problems and are not helpful. The political will, backed up by cohesive planning policies and finance, is what is required to get the country moving again. I am firmly convinced that the National Development Corporation does not constitute the answer to the problems confronting us now having regard to what must be done in relation to industry, trade, agriculture, horticulture, tourism, afforestation, administrative decentralisation and in regard to integrated regional policies.  I propose to illustrate how the National Development Corporation is not the appropriate body to confront the types of problems obtaining in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that our unemployment and emigration figures have reached alarming proportions.  Nobody would oppose any proposition likely to reduce those two evils which have devastated and are about to break the spirit of our youth today.  The Fianna Fáil Party neither agree with nor believe that the National Development Corporation will resolve such problems.  We view it as yet another organisation which could duplicate the work being carried out already by other organisations, leading also to a duplication of many existing services.  If the £300 million were allocated to other agencies in a manner I propose to detail it would be far more advantageous than spending the same amount of money on the National Development Corporation. <Col N="2037" /> For example, the National Enterprise Agency, duly expanded, would be suitably geared to deal with any situation that might arise in regard to the National Development Corporation.  I foresee duplication in regard to the National Development Corporation, the IDA and in particular to the ICC, all being engaged in joint ventures and private investment. It is my opinion that the National Development Corporation could do no more than would an expanded National Enterprise Agency.  No matter what new organisation is established I am convinced that nothing will happen without the political will to take the necessary decisions and have them implemented, coupled with the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>I shall give a few examples of how I believe the National Development Corporation cannot help in situations in which we are led to believe it could, mainly because of lack of political will on the part of the Government, and that applies in relation to my constituency of south Kerry.  I have been in touch with the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism for some time past in connection with the establishment of a meat processing plant in the Killarney area.  I have made representations to the National Enterprise Agency and the Minister setting out clearly what is required.  The Minister may contend that the National Development Corporation would be in a position to get this project off the ground.  However, I would ask him how the proposed corporation could do so while fuzzy thinking obtains in the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and within the IDA?  I might ask him additionally: will this fuzzy type of thinking be transferred to the proposed National Development Corporation?</P>
    <P>I put down a parliamentary question here recently in relation to this matter. To say the least of it, the reply I was given was incorrect. With regard to the grant aiding of this meat processing plant in Killarney the reply I was given was to the effect that the Minister understood <Col N="2038" /> from the IDA that, following consultations with the Department of Agriculture &mdash; with primary responsibility for the meat industry &mdash; a statutory instrument for the development of the sheep meat industry had been drawn up.  He stated also that this statutory instrument precluded grant assistance in respect of new slaughtering capacity on the home market, the project in question being ineligible for grant aid.  It was made very clear to the Minister and the IDA that this project would be geared primarily towards the export market.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would deal with this matter when replying. I cannot see how the National Development Corporation could be successful while policies being implemented by various Ministers are opposed to progress in regard to the establishment of industries and job creation.  In replying perhaps the Minister would state how exactly the NDC can assist in the matter of the proposed closure of a major footwear industry in Killarney town when the IDA failed to assist or do anything whatsoever in this regard and when it had been evident for some time that this industry was in danger of closing.  I raised this matter in the Dáil on numerous occasions.</P>

      <P>I presume that the National Development Corporation is involved in the promotion of industry and the creation of jobs.  What can the National Development Corporation do in the case of a proposed industry where a huge sum is spent on constructing and equipping a factory but which gives no date for starting work?  I refer the Minister to a reply from him to a Dáil question on 14 May relating to Schotte, a German company, who intend to set up business in Killarney.  I was told that the start up date was mid-summer 1985 and that over <Col N="2040" /> 60 people would be employed within two years.  A few days ago I was told that this industry may now start in January but that there is nothing definite yet.  How can the National Development Corporation deal with that sort of thing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not satisfied in Kerry with the way in which the Central Development Committee operates at present and we are convinced that the National Development Corporation will act in much the same manner in relation to proposals put up by the county development teams.  County development <Col N="2042" /> teams have a vital role to play and if they do not have access to the National Development Corporation and are not able to put forward pojects and proposals for approval, then the Bill will not serve its purpose.</P>
      <P>This proposed legislation will not work because Government policy in relation to many areas is negative.  In the absence of regional policies it will be very difficult for the National Development Corporation to work.  If the proposed £300 million which is to be allocated to this organisation was given to other agencies such as the IDA, the ACC and to an expanded National Enterprise Agency, it would be far better than setting up another bureaucracy.  There is a great need for plans and policies to create employment.  Emigration is now running at the rate of 70,000 or 80,000 per year. I am well aware of the problem through dealing with people who are seeking holiday visas to go to the United States and who hope to be able to remain there.  I also see young people leaving Killarney every week for England.  People also ask me for help in relation to visas for Germany, Holland and Denmark to seek employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the National Development Corporation have a role to play, it may be in the promotion of initiative forms of agriculture and horticulture, about which I feel very strongly.  There is unlimited potential here for the development of agriculture and horticulture.  Grants should be made available to farmers to intensify in these areas, particularly in horticulture. Food processing plants should be set up on a co-operative basis.  I am anxious that the undertaking we are discussing here should not be operated by a semi-State agency.  It is not possible to beat the co-operative spirit and I should like to see the farmers, landowners and those involved directly in intensive forms of agriculture and horticulture involved in the venture.  There is a tremendous opportunity here.  In Munster alone thousands of jobs could be created for young people if the Government concentrated on intensive forms of agriculture and horticulture. They are determined to get this <Col N="2043" /> legislation through the Dáil and I consider this is one area where the National Development Corporation should commence their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  My point is that there are other agencies that could do the work but as the NDC are about to be set up it is an area in which they could become involved.  If we are to create jobs at the rate required we must get back to the basics, to the land and the sea, but particularly the land.  It is our great natural resource and we must tap its potential to the full to get the maximum benefit.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry got some of this proposed £300 million his Department could do a good job in the acquisition of land for planting and the promotion of afforestation.  It is not necessary to set up a new organisation or a new stratum of bureaucracy to promote afforestation.  What is required is cash.  The number of jobs in forestry could be increased to a maximum of 18,000 to 20,000 by the year 2000 if the political will and the necessary finance existed.  The Government could do better by giving some of this proposed £200 million to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry than by setting up the NDC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed is an organisation or a person to co-ordinate the existing agencies. We have many agencies involved in job creation and there should be some Minister, organisation or committee to co-ordinate them.  Perhaps an expanded National Enterprise Agency would be better geared to do that than any other organisation.  It is frustrating for young people who may have worthwhile ideas regarding job creation or projects to find themselves pushed from one organisation or financial institution to another.  We have the National Enterprise Agency, the IDA, Fóir Teoranta, the Central Development Committee, AnCO and the ACC.  I have a particular interest in the Central Development Committee <Col N="2044" /> and I should like the Minister to tell us what is the role of that committee.  From my experience in Kerry it appears they have no power or functions or else they have no money.  They are not recommending the payment of grants where they should do this.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the NDC being any more useful in the promotion of tourism than are the existing organisations involved in this work.  We know that Bord Fáilte are involved mainly in marketing but there is more to tourism than marketing.  There is also the question of better facilities and of improving hotels and guesthouses to provide additional accommodation and amenities.  However, if the Government could allocate only £2 million for improvement works to hotels, how can they give sufficient money to the NDC to do a decent job for hoteliers who want to provide amenities and facilities in their premises?  It is well known that the grant of £30,000 per hotel will cover only 66 hotels within the limit of £2 million proposed.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a hasty measure packaged by the Government to cover up for their declining popularity, as seen in the opinion polls.  However, I am convinced that this measure will not help the Government to increase their rating because the people will see this legislation for what it is.  All this represents is the setting up of another organisation, another layer of bureaucracy to deal with matters that could be dealt with adequately by the existing agencies, assuming there was the political will for doing that.  However, neither the political will nor the necessary finances are available so far as this Government are concerned. The Bill is merely a piece of window dressing for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>One might be forgiven for thinking, on the basis of the contributions from the Opposition, that we were living in a world of fantasy because they are both agreeing and disagreeing at the same time with what we are doing. They might at least make up their minds as to whether they are for or against this Bill.</P>
      <P>As a Member of the House I wish to express my appreciation to the Minister for his endeavours, his commitment, his hard work and his expertise in this whole area of trying to provide a proper climate for job creating.  The Opposition have said that the NDC may have been the brainchild of Labour but I do not necessarily agree with that view because Fine Gael in their policies have always promoted something on the lines of the NDC.  The corporation has taken the form as outlined in the Bill.  I would remind Fianna Fáil that Fine Gael have been positive always in their approach to job creation.  In that area it has been a pleasure to work with Labour and to bring forward a development that can work in the best interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has put a lot of work <Col N="2046" /> into various industrial policies &mdash; White Papers and so on &mdash; and out of all that is born this legislation.  At the outset, the Minister said that the purpose of the Bill is to establish a National Development Corporation and he went on to say that it was an integral part of Government strategy to try to overcome the <i>malaise</i> of what we inherited on coming into Government.  The Opposition would be well advised to read the Minister's statement and to read the Bill, though obviously some of them have done so.  It has been a pleasure during the past couple of years to listen to the positive approach adopted by some members of that party in regard to trying to solve our problems. However, the main Opposition speaker on this legislation, Deputy Lyons, referred, by way of his main criticism, to the various closures, liquidations and receiverships of companies.  He did not pose the question as to how much of that problem was caused by the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil from 1977 to 1981. It was stated in the House last evening when we were talking about our foreign debt that the figure in that regard has increased from £800 million in 1977 to £8,000 million today.  Most of that increase was caused by the extravaganzas of the Government who were in power from 1977 to 1981 and who to a large extent were corrupt.  I appreciate that this has been said time and again but the sooner it sinks into the minds of the people, the sooner we may be able to move forward and try to create a climate that will help solve some of the employment problems of our young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is laying the statutory basis for what exists already in non-statutory form.  The Opposition have referred to similar type structures for which they were responsible and say that what we are establishing will serve the same purpose.  That may be so but we are now providing the statutory base.</P>
    <P>The second very important point made by the Minister was that businesses, both new and old, are starved of investment funds in the form of share capital and that they must rely to an unhealthy extent on money borrowed from banks.  We all <Col N="2047" /> know what has happened.  The farming industry particularly recognise the damage that has been done to their inventiveness and their commitment to increase productivity on the land as a result of the level of borrowing they were pushed into and the subsequent problem of the variations in interest rates.  If we had had a corporation of the kind we are setting up, they could have invested on a share basis, on an equity basis, in farming. If that had been the case we might not now have the difficulties that have arisen.  On these two points made by the Minister I would say merely that the Bill before us is something new.  It is not like anything we have had already.  It is well worth while.  In the various sections the Minister has included a variety of safeguards to ensure that the corporation will realise the purpose for which they are intended.</P>
    <P>The NDC idea is innovative.  The corporation will have a wide remit in terms of investment.  There are many industries crying out for additional investment for expansion purposes.  Market problems may leave some companies in much difficulty for a certain length of time and because of the high level of bank interest rates there is no respite for them.  The NDC investment fund should to some extent assist in that area.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that technology is changing and that the technology of today will be obsolete ten years from now. Consequently there is a continuous need for innovation, change and investment by way of trying to keep abreast of what the market place is demanding and of ascertaining the main areas of consumption. Only a fund of the kind we are talking of in this instance can be of assistance in this area.  Of course there will be losses but we have invested heavily in job creation in the past number of years. Inordinate amounts of taxpayers' money have been invested in trying to create jobs but despite that there are 230,000 people unemployed.  That problem has not arisen because of a wish on the part of any Government that that would be the case.  Rather it has arisen because of <Col N="2048" /> policies pursued by different Governments though there are other factors involved also.  I would not see great value in the NDC providing the necessary funding for a whole variety of industry but the Minister has provided in the Bill for limiting the level of equity that can be invested in any company.  Therefore, the £300 million should find its way round a large section of industry.</P>
    <P>We do not have a venture capital market, a fact to which the Minister has drawn attention though he has been involved to a large extent with outside financial agencies in trying to set up that sort of market.  He drew attention to this in his speech.  He sees the need for setting up a venture capital market here which can and will assist industry.  Every Deputy would have to agree with that.</P>
    <P>The National Development Agency will become the main State vehicle for investment in industry.  It can, and will, promote indigenous industries.  A great deal of attention is drawn to the development of indigenous resources, whether in agriculture, fisheries or forestry, but people are not prepared to invest in these areas because of the high risks involved. The State must become involved in risk taking, even if there are losses.  Unless we do something to redress the chronic unemployment situation, we will be going down the same slippery slope.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been severely critical of the need for this corporation. Fianna Fáil in Opposition strongly opposed the setting up of the IDA.  We all recognise the great contribution the IDA have made to the Irish way of life since 1952.  At that time Fianna Fáil made statements like &ldquo;putting the cart before the horse&rdquo; or &ldquo;a cart with no wheels&rdquo; when we were setting up the IDA, and they are making similar objections to this Bill.  They have tried to split the relationship between Fine Gael and Labour.  A number of them said this Bill was the result of Labour ideology being imposed on Fine Gael.  I do not accept that and I never have accepted it.  In my view Fine Gael and Labour have always worked very harmoniously together in Government, and for the good of this country. <Col N="2049" /> I am, and always have been, a strong Coalitionist.  I can state categorically that all Coalition investments in the promotion of industry have been worth while and there have not been any abuses.</P>
    <P>There may be a measure of conflict between the IDA and the NDC but all these difficulties can be ironed out.  They are responsible for different areas.  The IDA are a grant aiding authority and the NDC will be an equity capital venture agency who can make loans, but they will be limited.  I hope Fianna Fáil Deputies who have yet to contribute will take note of these differences.  These two agencies can combine their resources.  The IDA have built up a very strong organisation nationwide and the NDC will be able to become part of that structure.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulty facing industry is the variation in markets and because of that there must be continuous monitoring of the markets to see where there is a demand for new products.  We have never invested to any great extent in that area, although Córas Tráchtála Teoranta and other State agencies have done a very good job in this area.  This new agency will have the remit to develop in the service area.  In America they are moving back towards the smaller industrial units, many of whom cannot function because of capital difficulties and shortfalls.  This organisation can and will assist in that area.  I do not see why so much alarm is being generated, why it is being said that this is another white elephant which will mean pouring taxpayers' money down the drain.  I do not believe that will happen.  From the point of view of small industries, this agency can be of considerable benefit in creating more jobs.</P>
    <P>The multinationals and the Irish industrial whiz kids moved in to my area, but they were not able to make a success of the Waterford Iron Foundry.  There were no jobs available until a group of small businessmen moved in.  Now, 12 months later, they are employing 250 or 260 people.  They are extending and expanding their business and they are providing a commodity for the home market which up to now had been imported.  It is this type of company which the agency must <Col N="2050" /> assist.  The corporation has a very wide scope.  It can extend to almost every area. I hope it will be of particular interest to people who want to set up their own businesses and that it will encourage them to manufacture products which at present are being dumped on our markets.  This would be of considerable benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulties in this country over the last ten or 15 years our tourist industry has been very adversely affected. I recommend that the NDC provide funds for that industry because it has great potential for reducing the numbers on our live register.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to limiting the level of investment to any company.  It is only right and proper that that should be the case.  If the figure goes beyond £1 million there must be consultation with the Minister.  That safeguard has been built into the Bill.  The National Enterprise Agency was set up by the Opposition. It has some merit, and was inspired by the need for that type of agency.  We do not condemn the Opposition for setting up the National Development Agency but it has not the same statutory basis or statutory responsibility as the National Development Corporation and it is not answerable in the same way.  The people who will man the NDC will, I am sure, be able people just as are the people in the IDA.  The Minister in setting up the board of this corporation will not bring in political hacks but people who have proved themselves to be competent in the area of industry, commerce and trade.  We can monitor the performance of those people and we can be sure that the National Development Corporation has a bright future.  It will be of considerable value as has been the IDA to the development of industry.</P>
    <P>People get involved in companies to make a profit.  That is the object of investment. Over the last number of years there has been a lack of commitment to investment in industry because there are more profitable investments in other areas particularly in insurance companies which control a fair share of savings.  Insurance companies have invested in property <Col N="2051" /> markets which are non-productive.  They sold policies which because of high inflation were giving a turnover at 20 per cent increase in the year, and sometimes people realised an increase as high as 50 per cent in any one year.  These companies did not invest in jobs and in wealth creation areas such as industry.  We must try to get people to save money in more productive areas so as to generate jobs and wealth.  Under last year's budget a scheme was brought in by the Minister to allow a clawback for people who invested in industry.  That is successful and is increasing in momentum.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister in the House are to be complimented for that idea. Anything that will shift investment from the traditional safe gilt edge investments into investments that will produce jobs must be made worth while.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation can sell off its investments if the company is doing well.  The Minister should take care to ensure that extreme caution is exercised here.  It is easy to get somebody interested in something which has been built up by State investment, which is doing well and making money. Such companies can be sold off and people can draw the profit from them.  It would be like selling off State forests. The State has built up a considerable resource in State forests and nobody wants them to be sold off to private enterprise so that somebody can make a quick profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be opposed to that objective as the forestry should be held for the benefit of all those interested in creating jobs.  If the NDC is properly monitored it could release money for investment in other areas.  That is the idea behind allowing it to sell companies. Section 30 sets out the objective of the Bill to create a maximum amount of viable employment.  Other agencies have contributed to this area over the years. There is a need to look at all those in the context of the NDC.  That was suggested <Col N="2052" /> by Deputy O'Leary and I agree with him there.  I also agree with him that there is a greater possibility in directing quite a lot of these funds into the area that he suggested.  Agricultural land has been under-utilised and there is under-investment in agriculture, so there should be more investment in the processing of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>This corporation has been highly criticised by the Opposition and others have expressed doubts because the idea has not worked elsewhere such as in America and in France.  That is not a valid reason why we should not try it.  The idea has worked very successfully in the Netherlands. If it worked in the Netherlands with a population of 12 million people where there was a need for huge job creation efforts, surely it can work here.</P>
      <P>I have tried to stay as close as possible within the constraints of the Bill.  This is a very welcome development which I hope will be successful.  I support it because it has been introduced by Deputy Bruton. I have confidence in the man and in the work he has put into this Government since he came into office and I compliment the Minister for the thought and expertise he has committed his officials to since he came into this Ministry.  If we have another five or six years with Deputy Bruton in that ministry, the National Development Corporation will be well on its way to being very successful.</P>

      <P>This is a new development and it is necessary to try to do something about the growing disenchantment with politicians.  Fianna Fáil might feel that they had the support of the country if there was a general election tomorrow, but general elections will yield nothing unless we can make some attempt at reducing the number of unemployed. We have various forms of levies instituted over the last number of years. People will eventually see that they are not realising the targets which were originally intended and that will give rise to a lot of unrest.  I give my blessing to the <Col N="2053" /> National Development Corporation.  I hope and believe it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe Deputy Dowling's blessing on the proposed corporation will be required.  If it is to work it will require a considerable blessing.  I always listen with great interest to Deputy Dowling's contributions in the House, and somehow we seem almost to coincide in our opportunity to speak in the House but I must say that while he made a very gallant effort to defend the Government and the Minister in relation to the Bill, I am not at all convinced by the argument he has put forward.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of adding my voice to the debate on the proposed NDC.  For almost three years this House and the country have awaited the introduction of this Bill.  We were told that it would be a first major step on the part of the Government to deal with our economic and social ills and we were led to believe that it would lay the foundation stone for industrial development and job creation.  Deputy Dowling said, correctly, that unemployment and job creation must of necessity be the greatest single challenge facing this House at present. Before the Minister brought the Bill before the House I was very critical of the lengthy delay of three years and, despite Deputy Dowling's optimism in relation to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, continuing in office, I feel that at this stage the time taken to produce the Bill almost coincides with the life span of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had looked forward to the publication of this Bill.  I had hoped that the product of three years' deliberations would have resulted in a Bill which would be positive and credible in content and would, even at this late stage, provide some remedy for our economic and social ills and some ray of hope for the many people who, in desperation more than hope, had awaited the publication of the Bill.  I must confess my disappointment.  I listened with interest to the Minister's speech.  I listened with care and interest to Deputy Dowling's speech and I could easily identify with his opening comments and with the <Col N="2054" /> Minister's opening statement relating to the need for urgent action in the area of industrial development and job creation. The early part of the Minister's speech identified clearly the problems facing this country, but alas, here the positive approach ended.  I listened in the House and on the monitor in my office to the many contributions from all sides of the House, particularly to Government speakers, in the hope that my political voice &mdash; I am frank enough to admit that probably we are all politically biased in one way or another &mdash; in assessing the Bill did not cloud what I thought would emerge in the debate as the hidden merits of the Bill.  I was anxious to increase my knowledge and to get a greater insight into what the Minister was hoping to achieve.  That is the way that any Bill should be approached.  A teasing out process should take place.  In this area of job creation and industrial development nobody would really want deliberately to play politics.  My only regret is that I do not think that the Bill which the Minister has brought before the House will resolve any of the problems which the Minister believes it will resolve.</P>
    <P>I listened in vain to those contributions from the Government benches and I must say now, having listened to them, that they were mainly politically motivated and were a political defence of this proposed legislation.  In the first instance I want to ask the Minister why he took almost three years to bring his Bill before the House if it is as useful as he claims it is.  If it is going to resolve the problems which he claims it will resolve, why did he have to wait for three years to allow this House to debate the proposals contained in it?  Members who spoke in support of it were not in any way convincing either in the content of their contributions or the arguments they put up in defence of the Bill.  Despite what Deputy Dowling said, the Bill does not really bring forward any new proposals.  It will not do anything in relation to job creation and industrial development which could not have been done under the existing State agencies already in operation.  It is <Col N="2055" /> a pity that we wasted three years in trying to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>We all tend to play politics, depending on which side of the House we are sitting, but I would like to believe that this proposal will be the commencement of a reversal of a trend which has been with us in recent years, of continuing closures of industry and a growing level of unemployment and all the other economic problems facing us at present.  I want to ask the Minister &mdash; I do not think this question is politically loaded &mdash; why the Government spent the last three years pursuing an economic course which undermined and dismantled all the objectives which the Minister claims this Bill will achieve.  I refer as an example to the deliberate undermining, perhaps not fully intentional on the part of the Government but it happened nonetheless, of the economic climate in which existing industry could operate.  Is it not true that the last three years have shown an unprecedented level of closures of factories, large and small?  Is it not true that people who had money to invest looked elsewhere or did not do anything with their savings because of the economic climate that has prevailed here for the last three years?  Is it not true that foreign investors who usually look to Ireland as a rewarding and expanding area for potential productive development are no longer interested in coming here?  Is it not true that those highly organised and well managed industries who succeeded in surviving the difficult economic climate creamed off their profits and invested them abroad?  Any Government who deliberately create such a climate that makes our economy uninteresting and unrewarding are defeating themselves if they bring forward proposals similar to those before us.</P>

      <P>I do not have any intention of getting involved in an argument <Col N="2056" /> with the Minister and I can assure him that I listened attentatively to his speech when he was introducing the Bill, but it is my belief that it was ridiculous of the Government to pursue policies in the last three years that undermined all sectors of the economy.  I will produce evidence to support that view later and I am sure the Minister will accept it.  The Minister is hoping that the provisions of the Bill will reverse the trend of the last three years which resulted from Government policies.  Any ordinary political commentator or a person with any type of interest in economic management or politics will agree with that comment.  Even though the Minister may pull his jacket up over his ears he will have to listen to what I have to say.</P>

      <P>I could spend a lot of time, perhaps boring the Chair and Members and embarrassing the Minister, listing the problems that have arisen due to the Government's mishandling of the economy.  Government is all about how the economic affairs of a country are managed and the results achieved.  The Government had their own plans &mdash; they may have believed in them for a while &mdash; of how to deal with the country's economic ills but they failed.  Deputy Dowling, who deserves credit for the objective parts of his contribution, was a little upset because this side of the House are drawing the attention of the Government to the country's problems.  He fell into the political trap of reminding the House the problems the Coalition inherited from Fianna Fáil.  That argument may have been acceptable two years ago, but <Col N="2057" /> approaching the end of the life of the Government it is no longer credible to refer in the House or outside to what the Government inherited from Fianna Fáil. We are entitled to judge the Government on their performance and the results of the policies pursued by them.  I must remind the Minister of the extent of our national debt and what it was when the Coalition took office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am astray, but I bow to the wishes of the Chair. Deputy Dowling made a passing reference to those matters.  By way of passing reference I should like to remind the Minister, if he needs reminding, that the national debt, as Deputy Dowling said, is out of all proportion to what it was when the Government took office.  Following the general election we were reminded almost daily of the level of national borrowing and the disgraceful performance of the last Government. What is the level of national borrowing today?  What is the level of unemployment? No Member wants to make political capital out of the disastrously high level of unemployment but it is no harm to remind the people that on taking office the Government gave an assurance that something would be done quickly about the level of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents, we are told, the first real attempt by the Government to find a solution to unemployment and I read its provisions carefully to see if it contained proposals for the creation of jobs.  I acknowledge that some of the provisions will help job creation but I wonder why it has taken three years to bring the Bill before us if it was to lead to the creation of jobs.  There is not anything technical about the Bill and no reason why, if it has any merit, it should have been brought before us for debate 12 months after the Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take a number of years to get <Col N="2058" /> employment in the construction industry back to the level of three years ago.  I should like to ask the Minister to identify for us how it will be possible for sections of the construction industry to benefit from the proposals contained in the Bill. It is my considered view that, for the purpose of talking about venture capital and equity, this new Bill is not really tackling the root causes of our economic problems, although the corporation would help in a correct economic environment.</P>
    <P>To come back to my original point, unless you have the correct economic environment &mdash; and the Government have full control over the creation of that environment &mdash; there is absolutely no possibility that legislation of this nature can succeed.  May I remind the Minister that, before he goes down the road of tackling the aim of the creation of new jobs, he must first stabilise the existing economic climate, and this is one area in which the Government have failed totally. They gave lip service to the need for job creation, but have done absolutely nothing to stabilise the present economic climate.  The Minister may shake his head, but there are certain criteria for judging whether he and the Government have succeeded.  I have already listed these and do not wish to draw the attention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to me again by going over that area.</P>

      <P>What will this proposed National Development Corporation do that would not have been undertaken by the National Enterprise Agency?  I am not getting away from the terms of the Bill when I draw a comparison between what is now before the House and an existing agency which would have done the same kind of work.  The Minister acknowledged the fact that the NEA operated well.  I give him credit for that. The agency operated very well, in my opinion, in a climate of knowing that they could be dismantled but could, with additional support, have been an effective agency in containing the industrial decline over the past three years.  It must be a source of embarrassment to the Minister, in bringing this Bill before the House, that the preceeding agency has operated so effectively.  The Minister would be far more credible if he acknowledged this and avoided the unnecessary <Col N="2060" /> duplication of State agencies in the production of another tier of bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the National Enterprise Agency, acknowledging that within the limited resources available to them they were doing an extremely good job.  I ask the Minister, or any Member of this House, to examine the annual report of the NEA and the success they achieved in relation to the various projects which they assisted, to measure their success in relation to the limited resources available to them.  It is wrong for any Government deliberately to disband a successful State agency for political reasons.  It is wrong that politicians &mdash; and Ministers in particular &mdash; should be so naive as to fall into the trap of introducing change for the sake of change.  There are no great political kudos in pursuing that kind of political or economic policy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to be honest enough, in concluding, to acknowledge that the National Enterprise Agency did an extremely good job.  I ask him to tell the House how he thinks that agency would have succeeded and expanded if given the support which he is now giving to a new agency.  I do not believe for one moment that there will be any new achievements or developments under the name &mdash; and I am deliberately calling it that &mdash; of this further layer of bureaucracy which he is about to set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first year of the present administration, if the Minister had examined the performance of the National Enterprise Agency and seen within their operations the potential for industrial development, he would have given them the support they needed at that time.  I cannot understand &mdash; and I am saying this very genuinely &mdash; why after three years the Minister is bringing a Bill before the House to set up a new agency with new personnel.  Deputy Dowling referred to his ambition or desire to put credible people on the management of the National Development Corporation.  He referred to a term which I dislike, that of &ldquo;political hacks&rdquo;.  The vast majority of those promoted to management positions in the many State agencies while having <Col N="2061" /> their political affiliations have.  I should like to feel, all done a credible job.  When Deputy Dowling referred to political hacks he was probably insinuating that somehow or other people on this side of the House were associated in the past with the appointment of political hacks. Viewing the performance of this Government over the past three years.  I do not believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that the National Enterprise Agency operated well.  It should be put on the record in this debate that their performance within the limited scope available to them was excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accuse the Minister and the Government of having wasted three years pretending that they would bring before the House a Bill to tackle our social and economic ills.  These three years have <Col N="2062" /> been economically disastrous from an industrial viewpoint and the courage, confidence and morale of our people have been undermined and destroyed.  This Bill is merely a political smoke screen. The Minister and Fine Gael never believed that the proposals had anything new or positive to offer which could not be achieved within the scope of the existing State agencies.  They know in bringing forward the Bill now that it will not make any difference.  They hope that the magical figure of £300 million will have some kind of psychological effect on our people.  There are people who believe that the Government are providing £300 million for industrial development.  The Minister knows it is not true because the Government have not provided even £1,000 never mind £300 million.  Absolutely no provision has been made for the financing of the proposals contained in this controversial Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the theory that public confidence in the Government is necessary for success.  If there is not an air of confidence and a belief that the Government can resolve our economic ills, then the Government cannot possibly succeed.  I refer particularly to the need for political leadership in Government.  I am not making an unfair political comment when I say there is an air of despondency and that even committed Government supporters, members of the Government parties, do not believe the Government can do anything right.  I am meeting such people day after day.  I do not blame them for being despondent and disappointed. This Government came into office full of promise, perhaps full of hope, maybe with the very best intentions.  What has been the result?  I do not want to make an emotional political speech but there are certain criteria used by ordinary citizens to measure the performance of Government.  Under each of these criteria the Government have failed dismally. How are we to believe that this Bill can be an instant, over-night, magical formula for resolving the problem of industrial development and job creation?</P>
    <P>I will not question the Minister's good intentions in relation to this Bill.  He is <Col N="2063" /> a sincere man and has tried hard as a Minister.  Possibly he believes that the Bill will do some good but its introduction in the third year of office of this Government means that we will not see any return from it in terms of industrial development and declining unemployment. No financial provision has been made for the implementation of the proposals in this Bill and another budget will be needed to give it economic teeth.  At that stage we will be in the run-in to the end of this Government's term of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in the light of statements in the Central Bank Report that the current budget deficit will exceed 8 per cent of GNP in 1985, the highest ever experienced, that growth in GNP is now forecast to be only 1 per cent this year, and that as a result of a larger decline then previously forecast in employment in industry and further declines in employment in the building sector and in the Public Service, an overall fall in non-agricultural employment is forecast, he still maintains that Ireland is one of the healthy economies in Europe and that a turning point in employment and living standards has been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been careful to quote selectively from the Central Bank Report.  In the very first paragraph in the report the bank states that it is encouraging to note that with some exception, stability is being restored to many areas of the economy.  The Central Bank Report goes on to note the improvements which have taken place in <Col N="2067" /> inflation, in the current balance of payments deficit and in interest rates.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with these matters fully in my reply to the Deputy on 23 October.  On that occasion I also dealt with the question of the Exchequer finances which the bank notes is the major exception in the trend towards stability.  I need hardly elaborate again on the reasons why there is such an intractable problem in this area.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the evidence now emerging in relation to unemployment, where the rate of increase has slowed considerably, and in relation to personal consumer expenditure where the slide in retail sales which had been going on since 1980 has been reversed in recent months, that a turning point has been reached.</P>
      <P>Recent EEC estimates indicate that in terms of GDP Ireland had a higher growth rate than any other country in the EEC in 1984.  For 1985, the EEC are forecasting a GDP growth rate for Ireland which is higher than the Community average and ahead of all other member countries except the United Kingdom and Italy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to have any sense of reality in dealing with this matter with the Taoiseach.  First of all, may I ask him if he would agree that the current budget deficit this year will be either £1,300 million or £1,350 million, or perhaps even more, and that this will be &mdash; both in volume terms and as a percentage of GNP &mdash; the greatest single current budget deficit ever recorded in this country?  Lest he thinks I am alone in this view would he refer, in replying, to the statement in the Central Bank Report to the effect that the position now is that the current budget deficit will exceed 8 per cent of GNP in 1985, the highest ever experienced?  Would the Taoiseach give me his view, if he does not agree that it will be somewhere between £1,300 million and £1,350 million, as to what it will be in amount and as a percentage of GNP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The current budget <Col N="2068" /> deficit this year, in so far as it is possible to estimate it at this stage with what is always a certain margin of error, will, we expect, exceed 8 per cent of GNP and, therefore, be of the order of magnitude of £1,300 million, possibly somewhat less, possibly fractionally above, as best as we can estimate at present.  The figure is higher than in any other year recorded. It is two-fifths lower than the figure in 1982 that would have occurred had we not taken drastic action in the budget of 1981 and January 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside all the little fairytales which the Taoiseach has the habit the bringing into this matter, the fact is that the Taoiseach now admits to me across the House that the current budget deficit this year, after three years of his Government, will be the highest ever recorded both in volume terms and as a percentage of GNP.  Would he also agree with me that, by the end of this year, the national debt will be well over £20 billion as against £12.8 billion when he came into office at the end of 1982 and that this represents the highest ever amount of borrowing by any Government in this country in their periods in office? Would the Taoiseach simply acknowledge that fact and then we shall be able to get somewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure where the Deputy intends to get.  The facts are that the level of borrowing, although significantly reduced as a share of GNP, nonetheless remains high.  The facts are that the increase in the volume <Col N="2069" /> of public spending of 38 per cent between 1977 and 1981 pre-empted the resources available, at present growth rates, for 15 years ahead.  Unless we can accelerate growth rate significantly it would take 15 years to undo the damage done by Fianna Fáil during that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has now acknowledged by not contradicting and by implicit agreement that the total national debt is now well over £20 billion as against £12.8 billion when he took office and that this represents &mdash; no matter what fairy tales he may build around it &mdash; the greatest single amount borrowed by any Government in the history of the State.  Will the Taoiseach refer to the statement in the Central Bank report, which I mentioned in my question, in regard to employment?  Does he accept the statement in the Central Bank report to the effect that with further declines in employment in the building sector and in the public service, offset by some improvement in private service employment, an overall fall in non-agricultural employment is forecast?  Given a continuation of the long decline in numbers at work in the agricultural sector, a further increase in the labour force and a rise in the unemployment rate of around 17½ per cent on average for the year as a whole in prospect, does he agree that in the view of the Central Bank &mdash; and he can run around the world looking for other quotations if he wishes &mdash; there will be an overall fall in non-agricultural employment this year?  Answer yes or no, do not waffle.</P>

      <P>That has been proved correct.  I also said that we had an inflation rate which I believed was the fourth lowest in Europe. That is what I said in respect of those two matters.  They are correct and the Deputy cannot contest them.  He should stop misquoting me and deal with facts although they may be unpalatable.  There has been a reduction in interest rates and inflation and the level of borrowing today is two fifths lower than the figure which we were faced with in 1981.  I know the Deputy will not face these facts but it will take a very long time to get borrowing back to the level at which it was when he left office in June 1981&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has talked about quotations and I should like to direct your attention to the quotation which he just made from the Official Report.  He said on 11 July &mdash; and it is difficult to believe that he said it &mdash; that this is now one of the healthiest ecomomies in Europe.  The Official Report strangely records that the Taoiseach said that this is now one of the healthy economies of Europe which is a bit different from what most of us recall the Taoiseach saying at the time.  There must have been incredulity among economists when he said this but I physically heard him say it.  After three years of the Taoiseach's administration does he not admit that the facts which I have given are incontrovertible and that the fiscal targets and economic policies which he set out are now in total ruin?  Can he offer any suggestions to the House as to how he will repair the catastrophic state of public finances, the level of borrowing and the current budget?  I also want to ask the Taoiseach if the IMF wolf is at the door.  He will know what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That wolf was at the door on 30 June 1981 when I took over. We got him away from the door and we have kept him away since then.  He will be kept away as long as the Government are in office and as long as the party opposite do not return to office.  I repeat that what we achieved last year was the joint highest growth rate in Europe starting from a position of financial chaos four years ago.  The Deputy is not willing to face that.  Our inflation rate is lower than that of our neighbour; interest rates are <Col N="2073" /> lower than those of our neighbour for the first time in history and we have a basis for development and growth.  Only through the acceleration of growth can we have any hope of getting back to the levels of taxation and borrowing of 1977. It is because of the 38 per cent increase in the volume of public spending which he and his predecessor in those disastrous years imposed on the country that we are in our present position.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> The only reliable estimates for migration flows are those for net migration, that is the difference between the inward and outward flows betweeen successive censuses of population.  These estimates are obtained by relating the intercensal population changes to date for births and deaths in the same period. For the post 1981 period, which was the most recent census year, very tentative estimates only of net migration can be made until the results of the 1986 census of population become available.  These estimates of net migration are based on provisional mid-April population estimates which in turn are subject to revision in the light of the census results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional mid-April 1985 population <Col N="2074" /> estimate is 3,552,000 which is 109,000 above the 1981 census figure of 3,443,000.  The natural increase in the population, that is, the excess of births over deaths in the same period was 141,000.  thus for the four years April 1981 to April 1985 it is estimated that there was a net migration outwards of 32,000 persons which is an average of 8,000 per year.  As I stated earlier, a firm estimate for the five-year period 1981 to 1986 will be available after the 1986 census.</P>
    <P>The migration assumption underlying the labour force projection made in the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> was based on a special study prepared by a group of demographic experts, including experts from outside the Civil Service.  The results of this work were published in April 1985 in a report entitled <i>Population and Labour Force Projections 1986-1991.</i> The group made assumptions about future trends in key demographic variables including migration.  With respect to migration, the assumption was that over the period 1981-86 new outward migration would be in the range 5,000 to 10,000 per annum and in the period 1986-91 in the range 7,500 to 15,000 per annum.  The assumption in the plan is consistent with lower limits of the range.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the latest estimate from the Central Statistics Office is a figure of 14,000 people emigrating?  As he has pointed out, the figure in the national plan is 5,000 to 10,000.  In view of that, will the Minister of State not agree that the figure in the national plan is a gross underestimate of the true situation?</P>

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I do not understand the Deputy's question with regard to the national plan.  If the Government were dishonest they would have taken the highest figure because it would have suited the other figures in the plan.

I do not accept that the Government were wrong in their assumption in the national plan.  The figures with regard to net migration are as stated.  I repeat the only way we can get a firm figure is to await the outcome of the 1986 census.  I am quite satisfied that the Central Statistics Office do everything in their power to get as accurate an estimate as is possible, but I admit it is not possible to be positive about the figure quoted.  It is as near as can be assessed given the circumstances.</P>

Bhí orthu fanacht ar feadh ocht n-uaire a chloig sula rabhadar in ann na daoine a iompar go dtí an t-ospidéal, cuid acu gortaithe go dona.  Caithfidh an tAire admháil nach bhfuil sé sin sásuil.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the volume and value of fish imports in 1984 and to date in 1985; and the efforts he is making to substitute home produced fish products for these imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Imports of fish products, excluding fish meal in 1984 amounted to 26,476 tonnes at a value of £29.1 million. The comparable figures for the period January to August of 1985 which is the latest period for which the information is available were 17,019 tonnes and £22.1 million respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have recently increased their promotional work on the domestic market and are undertaking a <Col N="2085" /> programme to encourage increased home consumption of fresh fish and to help Irish fish processors to secure a larger share of the home market particularly for fish products which can be manufactured here.  Meetings with supermarkets are also being arranged by the Minister of State, at my Department, Deputy D'Arcy, with a view to encouraging them to sell more Irish processed fish products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a disgrace that a maritime nation like ours should be importing so much fish having regard to the cost of those imports and also to the very important factor of the extremely high rate of unemployment?  Would he not agree also that more action should be taken by the Government through their agencies to ensure that this position is redressed?  The Minister has told us that fish imports in 1984 amounted to 27,000 tonnes at a value of £29.1 million and that up to the end of August this year the value of fish products imported amounted to £22.1 million.  Is the Minister satisfied that everything possible is being done and every effort made to redress this position?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may rest assured that I am making and will continue to make every effort with my Department to ensure that the result of the talks will be achieved.  We are very backward in the fish processing area.  We have been very slow to make strides in secondary processing particularly.  I am talking about the preparation of fish products up to the point of cooking.  That is an area that we have not been developing to the extent that I should like to see it developed.  My Department can go so far and we can catch enough fish to enable us to reach the high level of development that is desired but we are talking here about private investment being prepared to invest its money.  Private investors can avail of the various grants from the other agencies such as the IDA or Údarás na <Col N="2086" /> Gaeltachta, as the case might be.  However, I cannot force people to invest in projects in which they do not wish to invest.</P>

The selling off of State forests came up in the context of on-going discussions which were commenced in 1980 by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Fitzgerald, and from the Deputy's time in my Department he is well aware that discussions took place which were not concluded when he left office.  They are still not concluded simply because I am not satisfied that the proposals put to us from the private sector are satisfactory and that the taxpayers' interests are being looked after.  The Deputy is well aware of the context in which this discussion took place.  These discussions were started when he was in office, during the time of his immediate predecessor and the office holder before him.</P>

The Minister will be aware that one matter which is causing widespread concern at present is the question of quotas and the inadequate quota arrangements we have.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for lunch I made a fairly lengthy contribution on to the National Development Corporation Bill.  I accused the Government and the Minister of childish political manoeuvring for the sake of bringing before the House another Bill which has no impact and will certainly not do what it is intended to do or what has been stated it will do by the Minister in relation to job creation and industrial development. I do not think there is any real credibility in introducing a Bill simply for the sake of change.  I do not mean change for the better in the economy but simply a change of wording and a formula of words which will eventually find their place in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>I made the point that the NEA, set up under a Fianna Fáil Government, had stood the test of time and had done an extremely good job in relation to job creation and supporting industry.  I said to the Minister before the adjournment that, instead of bringing in a Bill to establish a new layer of bureaucracy, he should have supported the NEA three years ago. If he had given them the same level of support as he is talking about in terms of this Bill, we would not have the many problems which have compounded themselves over the past three years.  I made the point also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not go over the ground I covered in my earlier contribution. It is relevant and important again to establish the context in which this debate is taking place.  For any legislation to be successful in the area of job creation and industry support you must in the first instance have a favourable economic climate.  In the Bill the Minister is endeavouring to do one thing while his colleagues in Government by their actions are undermining any efforts he is making at job creation.  Earlier I outlined five economic indicators which clearly indicate that Government policies in the area of economic development in the last three years have failed.  For that reason one must be very doubtful about the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are not dealing with a complicated piece of legislation and there is no reason why there should have been a delay of three years before it was brought to the House.  If the Minister believed that the provisions would mean a start on the task of tackling our economic problems he would have introduced the legislation earlier.  I would be happy to support any move by the Minister to resolve the unemployment problem.  I would support any move by him to help industrial development. The Minister believes the provisions in the Bill will deal with our economic problems and in that regard I accuse him, and the Government, of negligence in the last three years.  The Bill is simple in terms of the form of words used, but finance has not been provided by the Government to implement its proposals.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Minister that I will return to the Chamber when he is replying in the hope of hearing him <Col N="2160" /> deal with the points I am bringing to his notice.  The Minister will not succeed in putting me off my train of thought by his interruptions because I feel too strongly about these issues to be distracted in any way.  If the Bill is to do what the Minister has told us, why is it that we have had to wait three years for it during which time every facet of our economy has been undermined?  Had the Bill been introduced two years ago we would have been in a position to assess whether it achieved the objectives set out.  I would like to think that the corporation will at least commence to tackle the problem of unemployment and industrial development but I do not think that will happen although I wish the Minister well in his efforts.</P>
      <P>It is the duty and responsibility of the Government in the first instance to stabilise and improve the economic climate for industrial expansion.  It may not be the direct responsibility of the Government to create all the new jobs, but it is their duty to create a favourable economic climate. That climate has not existed here for some time.  The only sustainable jobs are those created as a result of increased production and greater wealth.  It is true that we are well served by the various elements of the public sector and we all acknowledge the important role that sector has played in our economic development up to now.  It is also true to say that some areas of the public sector are seriously undermanned, something which is not often mentioned in the House.  That is costing the State a lot in terms of lost revenue.</P>

      <P>I wish to comply with the ruling of the Chair and I shall do my best to relate my remarks to the terms of the Bill.  However, the Chair must agree that the Bill purports to relate to a very wide economic area as far as job creation and industrial development are concerned.  It is extremely difficult to debate any legislation designed to deal with our economic problems without referring, perhaps in passing, to some economic indicators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>We must concentrate our efforts on the productive areas of the economy.  If we succeed in expanding our industrial base we will get over the first hurdle in rebuilding the economy. The Minister implies that that will be achieved following the establishment of the corporation, but I have serious reservations about that.  The Minister's reference to the need to spread investment over a wide area pleased me.  He said also it was his intention to give some priority to the development of our natural resources, an issue I have highlighted for some time.  I was pleased when I was in the company of some friends in the Public Gallery yesterday to hear Deputy Alice Glenn, in the course of her constructive speech, refer to the need to develop our natural resources.  The wheel has turned full circle when urban Deputies are beginning to realise the importance of our natural resources.  They should have been the base for further expansion.</P>

      <P>I was referring to a contribution by a Government Deputy.  I am supporting what the Minister and Deputy Glenn said about the need to develop our natural resources.  I do not think I am straying away from the terms of the Bill. Forestry, and the development of land <Col N="2162" /> suitable only for forestry development offer good prospects for job creation.  If we are serious about developing forestry the Forestry Division should be removed from the Civil Service and placed under the control of a concern such as Bord na Móna who have a commitment to the development of natural resources.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude because I think I have exceeded my time.  To summarise, the Bill is extremely disappointing. It will certainly not achieve what the Minister has said it will.  The sad thing is that it will take so long to bring any of its sections into operation that the Minister and the Government and perhaps other Members of this House might not be around to see how successful it will be in its implementation.  It will take the budget of 1986 to make financial provision for the implementation of sections of the Bill and another six to eight months to get the new layer of bureaucracy off the ground.  By that time I shall be very surprised if this country does not find itself in the throes of a general election.</P>
      <P>The Government have wasted three years in which some credible steps could have been taken up under the aegis of the existing agencies such as the IDA and other bodies set up by the previous administrations for the purpose of doing exactly what this corporation propose to do.  If the National Enterprise Agency had got the support from the Minister which they deserved three years ago we would be much further along the road towards resolving some of our outstanding economic problems.  Even at this stage of the debate there is absolutely no indication from the Minister or the Government that they are attempting to get their act together &mdash; by that I mean the overall co-ordination of Government Departments.  Does it make any sense that the Minister endeavours to do one thing today and tomorrow the Minister for Finance undermines those efforts by various tax re-organisations?  This has been happening for some time.</P>

      <P>The Minister may not believe it, but I have listened to every word spoken in this House during this debate.  That is because I feel extremely strongly about every aspect of the Bill.  I was present for a considerable number of hours and when I was not in the House I can assure the Minister that I listened to the debate on the monitor and I am very familiar with the whole subject.  I hope the Minister takes it as a compliment that I spent about two hours of my time last Sunday reading his introductory speech.</P>
      <P>I dearly wish something could be done to find a solution to our problems.  I have already acknowledged that, like every other Deputy, I can be politically biased. There is no doubt in the world about that. However, this is not an area into which we should allow political bias to intrude. I read the Minister's speech and listened to all the contributions, including those of the Minister's backbenchers, in the hope of finding some little merit in what the Minister is trying to do.  I am sad to say that I am not convinced that what he is trying to do could not have been done over the last three years under the aegis of the National Enterprise Agency, the IDA and other bodies very genuinely set up for the purpose of dealing with our economic problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and indeed any Bill that it is hoped will provide jobs for school leavers or those made redundant.  Various people have pontificated about this corporation being their brainchild or, equally glibly, damned the whole thing as having nothing constructive to be said for it.  As in all things, time will tell.  I hope that the launching and development <Col N="2165" /> of the NDC will ensure that our unemployment figures will decrease.  We are all aware that they are very high.  Unemployment has affected all of us from time to time as we have met people in our clinics and elsewhere who never had a job or have recently been let go.  We should all be concerned about getting as many of these people back to work or into work as the case may be.  I do not care what type of body is set up to achieve this, as long as it is successful.  Anything else is immaterial.</P>
      <P>People have spoken of the problems which the NDC will have to face &mdash; and these will have to be faced eventually &mdash; but the main aim must be to get the corporation working in areas where other agencies have not gone before.  With our high unemployment problems, our expanding population and the development of technology, we must look further and harder at ways of providing these people with jobs.  Recently I learned of a certain firm which acquired quite modern machines, with the result that several girls working in the firm were let go.  A case was made that the machines could work more quickly then the girls but, at the end of the day, there was the human problem of people losing their jobs.  With progress in technology, in certain areas people will be replaced by machines and we must see whether we can provide jobs for these people in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter which worries me in relation to the NDC is a possible duplication of services already given by bodies set up some considerable time ago and which have been working well.  Bodies set up to attract employment or to provide training all need a bit of a shake-up.  Some were set up when times were different and there should be a continuous review of their operation.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and we have seen in our deliberations over the past number of years how public money has been wasted. Some crazy decisions were taken by people who admitted to us in the course of our deliberations in that committee that, had it been their own money, a <Col N="2166" /> different decision would have been taken.</P>
    <P>There must be tremendous scrutiny with regard to the expenditure of taxpayers' money, particularly in times when money is in short supply.  In this connection the provisions of section 15 specify that there must be ministerial or Government approval for certain projects before they are set up.  We must be vigilant at all times.  The progress of the NDC should be reviewed as it develops to ascertain whether it needs revision or updating from time to time.  Indeed perhaps we should be re-examining the functions of many of the existing bodies, identifying areas where there is duplication.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks the Minister said there would be an operational agreement drawn up between the IDA and the NDC in order to co-ordinate their respective functions to ensure that the best value is had from both bodies.  For example, certain functions of the IDA might well be undertaken by the NDC in the future or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is crazy to have two bodies both running in the same direction and endeavouring to achieve the same goal when, were their resources only combined, their target could be achieved more expeditiously.</P>
    <P>There must be careful planning of the operations of the NDC.  We must be particularly vigilant about ventures using a variety of funds &mdash; Government, companies, the banks, various lending institutions and so on.  Such institutions, with their expertise, without becoming involved in a load of bureaucracy, will mean that the more money that can be attracted into investment in these ventures from sources where it may lie dormant at present the better.  That must be a crucial commercial consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that if profits are not made then there will not be jobs.  We must remember that in any ventures we shall be competing with outside interests. It may be the case that some ongoing ventures could be developed better with greater expertise being brought in relation to them.  We do not want to see the NDC setting up various ventures <Col N="2167" /> which, while being worthwhile in themselves, will have the net effect of bringing others to a close.  There must be a clear consensus as to what has to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be duplication between the NDC and some of the existing bodies.  There is need for a review to be undertaken in this area.  Section 10 sets out the principle objects of the corporation. Subsection (1) (a) says:</P>
    <P>to invest, in consultation, where appropriate, with State-sponsored bodies, in any enterprise (including any enterprise which is wholly or partly owned by a State-sponsored commercial enterprise) which, in the opinion of the Corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment.</P>
    <P>Employment and the creation of jobs must be a prime target of the NDC.  We must look closely in difficult areas to ascertain what can be provided that is not being done at present.  For example, we should examine areas where at present part of the process may be undertaken here, where we may export a part of a product only, leaving its further development to another country.  Technological developments should ensure that we can undertake almost any process, transport being relatively freely available for such goods.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited a semi-State body in Galway, a fish processing plant, and spoke with some of the workers.  They were cutting up fish into various portions, cutting off the heads and tails.  These sections were being exported to different places, for example, the innards to Japan, some other portions to the European market and the remainder being retained here.  In many areas we should be able to undertake anything from A to Z.  We must change our attitudes.  We should not shift some of our raw material to other countries for its further process or development. If it can be undertaken at home, why not retain jobs here?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> When replying perhaps the Minister would give us the likely timescale into 1986 as to how he envisages this corporation being in operation after 1 January next.  Like any other body being established it will take a certain amount of time to get off the ground.  Also I would hope that the best possible people will be obtained for positions with the proposed corporation because the best people are needed to work toward the target of job creation.  We do not want another monstrosity built up doing very little except expending taxpayers' money.  The progress of the corporation must be reviewed after a couple of years, to examine where failures may have taken place and to ascertain how much progress has been made in relation to the provision of the requisite jobs.  When replying perhaps the Minister would outline the prospective time scale, as he envisages it, and what discussion has taken place with the IDA and these other bodies.  He says there is some agreement with these bodies and we do not want the IDA to be upset because this new body may encroach on their territory.  When a substantial amount of taxpayers' money is involved, it is important that there should be progress reports to this House to see that we are getting the best return for our money.  We must ensure that enterprises embarked upon are commercially sound and that we can compete with overseas interests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but the accountability aspect in relation to decisions is crucial.  What we have seen in some of the semi-State bodies is disgraceful as far as taxpayers' money is concerned and we must ensure that we do not repeat past mistakes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the Minister's speech in detail and there are many good ideas in it.  There could be a separate debate on many of the issues but, unfortunately, the Minister's speech will not be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to create employment.  I have no doubt as to the sincerity of the Minister and the Government in trying to tackle this problem, but <Col N="2169" /> I do not believe that the Bill will work. A major part of standard speeches by politicians must include a large portion concerning unemployment.  Since I was elected to this House in 1977, no speech by any politician has not referred to the great scandal of unemployment.  They said that if something was not done there would be catastrophic effects for the country.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on many occasions, inside and outside the House, regarding the dangers to the democratic system if unemployment is not tackled.  Successive Governments and political parties have all produced White Papers, Green Papers and reports dealing with various aspects of the problem.  They all have the same objective regarding employment creation. They were all sincere and I have no doubt that this Bill is a further sincere attempt to tackle the problem.  Politicians are great verbalisers regarding unemployment. Their election programmes, manifestoes and even personal election literature all address themselves to the problem.</P>
    <P>Parties lecture each other across the floor of the House day in day out saying that unemployment is the greatest problem facing us and, of course, it is.  Politicians are all inclined to think that the Opposition do not have the right ideas or policies and that if they were in office things might be different.  We have succeeded in fostering the belief, through all the mish mash of talk, reports, election promises, etc. that Governments create jobs and are an unending fund of employment opportunities.  Probably politicians do not mean this when they talk about unemployment, but the idea has been planted in the public mind that Governments create jobs.  If we foster the belief that we can create jobs by direct Government action, then Governments are blamed when jobs are not created, when unemployment rises and when people have to emigrate.</P>
    <P>When we discuss this Bill, we must take account of political conflicts.  The only reason we have such a Bill before the House is that the Labour Party have insisted on it.  They have been preaching <Col N="2170" /> this gospel for years and the enactment of a National Development Corporation Bill has assumed for them extreme reverence, a new god in their political deities. As Labour are part of the Government there is nothing wrong in getting some of their ideas into Government policy.  They are entitled to their say, but their approach is misguided.  At various times during the lifetime of the Government, the Labour Party seem to get apoplexy about various matters, for example, the local radio Bill.</P>
    <P>In the National Development Corporation Bill we see a fundamental socialist approach couched in free enterprise terms, namely profit.  It is trying to mix oil and water which is not possible.  I do not believe in criticism for its own sake and just because it is a Labour Party Bill does not necessarily mean that it is not a good idea.  However, I should like to outline some of my reasons for thinking that it is a bad idea.  One is always conscious when one goes on the record of the House in a critical fashion regarding a proposal such as this because, in 20 or 30 years' time, it may well have turned out to be a great success.  Various speeches by opposing politicians at the time when the Shannon industrial development authority were set up are still recalled in this House and outside.  However, one has to make an informed judgment as to the likely outcome of such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Anyway, I do not believe that the National Development Corporation Bill will be a success.  It shows confusion on the part of the Government as to what the role of the State should be regarding the economy and that is the approach I should like to adopt in analysing the Bill. We have never made up our minds regarding the role of State interference. Are we to be a free enterprise economy or a socialist one?  The level of interference in the day to day running of the country is greater than in most other countries in the western world.  We have a confused attitude as to what the proper role of the State should be.  The legislation before us epitomises this confusion. I am prepared to argue the merits <Col N="2171" /> of legislation which has a socialist approach and I have no difficulties in arguing the toss with some people in the Labour Party &mdash; for example, Senator Michael Higgins &mdash; who honestly and sincerely believe that the State should have control of the means of production, etc.</P>
    <P>Such people believe the State should be the real organ of all development and the follow-on argument of these people is that the State should be involved in all enterprises.  Similarly, I have no problem in rationalising the economic proposals put forward by someone like the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.  I may not necessarily agree with all her economic ideas but I understand the rationale behind them which, in a few short words, would be: &ldquo;Let the free enterprise system work unfettered&rdquo;.  However, it is impossible in this State to rationalise what kind of economy we are.  There is no need to look further than the enormous current budget deficits in the past years, the enormous amount of State indebtedness owed internally and to foreign institutions, the high levels of taxation and so on.  Yet, to the outside world we profess ourselves to be a free enterprise economy.  We have one of the highest levels of taxation in the world.  The role of the State here would make some nominally socialist countries in the eastern bloc look like havens of free enterprise.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another example of the horse-before-the-cart kind of legislation we have been enacting for some years.  I contend that because we have not as a political society been able to decide what type of economic approach we should have, it has stymied the development or natural evolution of politics in the country. Could anyone here explain to a foreigner at election time the difference between the fundamental economic approach of any of the three parties?  Any naturally inquisitive tourist would ask what party is for the free enterprise approach and what party is for the totally socialist approach.  The honest answer is that the three major parties, with the exception of certain individuals in all of <Col N="2172" /> them, would have to say that we are for a bit of everything.</P>
    <P>We have never defined what should be the level of State involvement.  The growth of the semi-State sector took place under the guidance of Seán Lemass. However, I do not believe it was ever the intention of the late Mr. Lemass that State enterprises should assume an internal growth of their own, to go on forever and ever.  Under Mr. Lemass the setting up State enterprises was to fill a vacuum and to get the industrial and economic sectors moving.  My belief is that fundamentally he stood for the free enterprise principle.</P>
    <P>I believe the role of the State in the economy should be as miminal as possible. That does not necessarily mean that I think free enterprise should run as wild as possible and that there should not be some level of State involvement.  If one believes that the level of State involvement should be as minimal as possible, one has arrived at such a conclusion by what one considers are the advantages of the free enterprise approach over the totally socialist approach.</P>
    <P>I find it easy to argue and discuss the merits of free enterprise with people who believe in the socialist approach.  However, I am absolutely and totally convinced that we get the worst of all worlds by having the &ldquo;mixum gatherum&rdquo; approach that is neither free enterprise nor socialism.  One has only to look at the Irish economy and the British economy, particularly the British economy before the mid-seventies, to see that this approach does not work.  What we are seeing in this Bill are ideas from the socialist party in Government as to their view of State involvement in the economy, tempered by the <i>laissez-faire</i> ideas of certain Ministers who do not believe in that approach.  Due to the composition of this Government, we see in this Bill prime examples of the confused thinking of the role of the State in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I am not so arrogant, even though people think I am, as to believe in the absolute correctness of free enterprise. <Col N="2173" /> However, I have arrived at the conclusion that free enterprise will maximise wealth greater than any other system, that in general terms it will lead to a more fulfilled life for the majority of the members of our society and that its methods are more in tune with the free will of the human being.  On the other hand, I readily accept and understand the reasoning of people who take a socialist or communist approach to the idea.  However, I have reached the conclusion that the free enterprise approach is better.</P>
    <P>Do we know what we are letting ourselves in for when we enact this Bill? There are various aspects that can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage but we should address ourselves to what we are letting ourselves in for in this instance.  From my reading of the Bill it is obvious that the Minister has fought a rearguard action in trying to make this Bill as sensible as possible, given that both he and I believe it was total nonsense in the first place.  The Minister said that the principal objective of the Bill will be to assist by means of investment in industry in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  Various sections in the Bill give the Minister and Government of the day considerable powers and influence over the decision-making process of the NDC. The investment programme, the quantum of investment, time limits and so on will be initiated directly by the Government.</P>
    <P>Do we honestly know what we are letting ourselves in for if we enact this legislation?  First, what do we mean by viable employment in the State?  Given the considerable powers of the Minister over the NDC, does anyone seriously think it would be possible in most cases for the corporation to disengage from lame duck and non-viable enterprises in which they might become involved? Surely in a socialist context all employment is viable because the profit motive is not the aim.  Let us assume, for example, that the NDC get involved in some aspects of the food processing industry in Navan, in the Minister's constituency. Let us further assume that the original <Col N="2174" /> time limit set for a reasonable return is five years and that the Minister is still in office and holding the same portfolio then.  If the industry in question is in considerable financial trouble, is non-viable and cannot make a profitable return, by any criteria the NDC should disengage from that undertaking.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to a general election or by-election does anyone think that, given that he has such powers over the NDC, the Minister will pull the plug on this industry in Navan.  If anything like that were mooted there would be deputations from local Deputies, Dáil questions and Private Members' motions asking the Minister not to do such a thing.  Politics being what they are, it would be political suicide to pull the plug on such an enterprise. I envisage a stream of such lame duck industries across the country and given the Irish multi-seat proportional representation system, it would not be politically possible to disengage the NDC from the majority of these enterprises.</P>

      <P>We cannot have it both ways.  This Bill will give the Government a direct say in policy decisions of the NDC.  If the Minister of the day in five years time wants to disengage the NDC from an industry we can imagine Private Notice Questions from this side of the House and that side of the House &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I readily go along with the sentiments in the Bill.  It is clearly set down that if an enterprise is not viable the NDC will pull out.  We must look at the political framework in which we work.  I have a lot of admiration and respect for the Minister because I think he is doing his very best.  However, given <Col N="2175" /> the best will in the world, the politics of the day will decide NDC actions rather than the merits of the enterprise.</P>
      <P>Let us assume the NDC had been set up years ago and that they had a large holding in Fords of Cork.  Does anybody seriously suggest, given the unemployment in Cork in the past number of years, that the NDC could have disengaged themselves from that company?  It would be political suicide, and the Government of the day would have been lambasted from one end of the country to the other.</P>
      <P>In fighting the rearguard action of putting in as many controls as possible, the Minister inadvertently put his successors in an impossible position.  The Bill has sections giving the Minister power over the amount of investment and to prescribe that initial investment must have a strict time scale.  These are all very worthy sections.  I appreciate that they are in the Bill in order to safeguard taxpayers from unfortunate investment and to give the Government some direct control. The reason for these protective clauses is so that the Labour Party would not go completely mad and so that the unfortunate taxpayers would not get involved in all sorts of ridiculous enterprises.</P>
      <P>However, I do not believe they will serve the purpose for which they were put there in the first place.  Instead of allowing the NDC to disengage, the Bill will have the completely opposite effect. Whatever one may say about CIE, at least the Minister and the Government of the day could come along and say they could not direct the State body to do anything.  With all the provisions in this Bill to allow the Government and the Minister of the day more say in the control of the NDC we will put successive Ministers and Governments into impossible situations.  Because of the implications of State participation in the economy, I believe we will end up with a new range of State enterprises, more Government interference, more State borrowing with the end result worse than now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will happen if the NDC get <Col N="2176" /> involved in non-successful enterprises? Let us suppose the NDC get involved in some worthwhile profitable undertaking. Let us also assume that the NDC will take a five year involvement in such companies. At the end of five years they will be disengaging themselves, and imagine the hue and cry there will be when the NDC go about doing that.  Both Deputy Dowling and Deputy Hyland said we should look at the Bill very carefully from that point of view.  Already, before the Bill has been passed, we have members of the Minister's party disagreeing among themselves.  We know of the criticism of the suggestion that the State should get rid of some of our forests.  If the NDC begin to disengage from successful enterprises there will be the same kind of criticism. No Minister of any Government will take that chance because there would be deputations from trade unions, politicians, chambers of commerce.  The workers will say that if the NDC pull out of successful companies their jobs will be at stake, and they will not be prepared to suffer that.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the fine words of the Minister in his opening statement &mdash; I suppose he believes every word he says regarding time limits, etc. &mdash; the reality will be far different.  So it will not be possible for the NDC to disengage from the successful enterprises either.  Therefore, we will end up having more and more State interference in the life of the country, greater and greater borrowing, greater numbers of civil servants and more people employed in industries who will consider themselves to be State employees.  It will not work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill will probably attract risk capital.  I agree with him that there is over-reliance in industry on borrowing, and one of the purposes of the Bill is to provide equity capital.  If such equity capital is available, if there is money about, why is it not being invested?  There are some fine concessions in the Finance Acts for people who would get involved in enterprises. Why are they not getting involved?  The reason is that the return is not there.</P>
    <P>If a person had £1 million to invest, is <Col N="2177" /> there any industry that would give him a reasonable return?  He would invest his money in capital bonds, insurance companies, savings certificates, building society accounts, even deposit accounts in banks.  One of the last things he would do is to invest it in Irish industry because the after tax return would be too low. Apart from the tax difficulties, the hassle in getting involved in a factory employing hundreds of people would deter him.  He would have all kinds of things to contend with, such as PRSI, income tax, VAT, the Unfair Dismissals Act, layers and layers of bureaucracy.  He would have trouble with the planning authorities, industrial relations problems, he could not get people to work on Monday mornings because they would be out sick after the weekend.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the reasons people will not invest in enterprises.  The hassle is too big and the return too small.  We have too much State involvement in people's lives and if one had £1 million to spare the last thing one would do is to invest it in industry because the return is not sufficient to offset the headaches.  The Minister referred to the money to be invested on behalf of pension funds.  No pension fund manager in his right mind would invest it in what we term productive employment.  He would put it into office blocks or bonds or shares.  The bureaucratic nature of the State here is too great.  The climate here is not right for free enterprise.  If we believe in free enterprise we must allow it to work.  The other system should be given a fair chance as well, but we cannot have a mix of both because it does not work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the NDC are empowered to act as a holding company for new projects initiated by public sector companies.  He said that the corporation initially will not be empowered to act as a holding company for existing State companies.  That would be considered, however, in the light of the progress of the NDC.  Therefore, the Minister does not rule out that the NDC will be getting involved at some stage with semi-State companies.  That would be the disaster of all disasters.  The Minister indicated that <Col N="2178" /> there is provision for an operating agreement between the IDA and the NDC.  I do not forsee any difficulty in that respect, but the Minister will have to spend a lot of time drawing up the agreement. I take it that companies that are set up with the corporation taking an equity stake will qualify for the normal grants from the IDA.</P>

      <P>The imposition of time limits is a good idea.  I do not foresee any difficualty in having these sections accepted but, as I pointed out earlier, I do not think the idea will work.</P>
      <P>After the initial period expires, be it five years or whatever, who will buy these concerns?  I appreciate that the Minister is working on the basis that there is not enough encouragement for people to invest in such ventures now but that, after the corporation's involvement when there will be lots of equity capital available, there will be buyers for the various ventures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that there is a sufficient number of people in the free enterprise economy now who would take over ventures that would be regarded as being successful.  However, let us assume the Minister is correct and that there will be people willing to invest in these companies.  I would expect that there would be grounds for selling the stakes in the companies, stakes that would be traded over the counter in the Stock Exchange.  The Minister made reference to the development of this type of market but the corporation will be confined to maximum investment limits and these will have to be with ministerial or Governmental approval so that, by and large, we are talking of small type industries. I would not envisage private investors in five years time locking themselves into such companies with a minority <Col N="2179" /> shareholding because in such circumstances their rights would be very limited since what would be involved would be a private company that had not traded on the Stock Exchange.  The investor in such a minority shareholding position would have no control in respect of the running of the company.  The Bill indicates that only small industries will be involved and that the corporation will take only minority stakes in those industries.</P>
      <P>If we do not succeed in selling off the companies they will remain private companies not trading on the Stock Exchange, and I cannot envisage sensible business people buying minority share-holdings in that type of company.  For those reasons alone I cannot envisage a market for the companies after whatever period the Minister decides they should be sold.  Two of the most sensible and best Deputies in the House, Deputies Dowling and Hyland, said this morning that we should be very careful about moving out of the companies that prove to be successful, that instead we should use State resources to build them up.  I foresee a problem in this regard before the corporation are established at all. One can imagine the hue and cry at party meetings that would follow a move by the State to extricate itself from some very successful enterprise.  I cannot see the State doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authorised share capital investment in the corporation is to be £300 million but that does not mean anything. The State will invest in the corporation and the corporation will invest in these industries, but where is the money to come from?  Presumably it will have to be borrowed.  I should like to know also what rate of return will be acceptable when the corporation are thinking of taking a share in some venture.  Who will decide what the rate of return ought to be on the investment?  As we will be borrowing the money, I submit that the rate of return should be equal to what is borrowed in the first place.  If the money is borrowed at, say, 12 per cent, I cannot envisage many industries producing a return of that order.  As the corporation <Col N="2180" /> will be the minority shareholder they will not have any real say.  That means that the corporation will have the same rights as anyone else would have in a minority shareholding position, so I do not think the corporation will work.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the present policy on industrialisation, a factor that is linked with this Bill.  For a long number of years the State has been grant-aiding the wrong type of industries.  When we began grant-aiding companies in the sixties and seventies, it was not the intention in encouraging foreign based industries here, that that should be the be all and end all of industrial growth.  In the past couple of years the IDA have recognised that these industries are not providing the answers to our problems.  There is no reason why some of them should be here at all.  For example, there is no reason for believing that cameras can be made better in Newbridge than they can be made in Gibraltar.  There is no reason for believing that that type of industry should be more successful here than would be the case elsewhere but we have been investing taxpayers' money and borrowings in grant-aiding that type of industry.</P>
    <P>In industry big is not beautiful but small is beautiful.  We should be encouraging Irish owned industries in such areas as agriculture, mariculture, horticulture and so on.  However, there is a change in emphasis in industrial policy and our emphasis should be on the home based industries.  I recognise what this Bill is proposing to do, but I do not think this Bill can work.  I hope I am proved wrong. I hope it turns out to be a great success in the next five or ten years.  If it does, whether I am in or outside politics, I will admit that I was wrong.  I hope it works but for the reasons I have outlined I do not believe it can.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the economic sphere I know that State interference must be done away with.  We must get the State off the people's backs and develop the right economic climate, but I do not believe this Bill will help to do that.  In fact, it will have the opposite effect.  Real political leadership should be <Col N="2181" /> brave and innovative.  In so far as this Bill is innovative, it is a good idea but, as I have already said, it will fail because it is trying to mix free enterprise and socialism. We must decide which road we are going to follow.  Until we decide that, we will have confused economic thinking.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House wants to solve the unemployment problem.  We have not been able to rectify the situation because we have not been able to decide which road to take.  If this Bill works I will be prepared to stand up in five or ten years time and say it was a very good idea and that the comments I made in November 1985 were wrong, but I do not believe I will be saying that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is very welcome and deserves our full support.  This country needs enterprise and we must do everything in our power to encourage and foster the spirit of enterprise from whatever source it may come.  In the situation in which we find ourselves, ideology of any shape or form must give way to the pragmatic pursuit of wealth generation and sustainable employment.</P>
      <P>There is a tendency to regard any form of State enterprise as being at best questionable. There are examples of State enterprises turned sour.  On the other hand, much of what is best in this country's economic history rests on a good mix of public and private enterprise.  We have had examples of unwise State investment.  We must look to the National Development Corporation for investment which will be productive and viable in the long term, investment which will provide a satisfactory return on capital. We must not, however, look for too much too soon.  Enterprise is all about risk and we must not inhibit or discourage risk taking in any way.  We must be prepared to accept stumbles and falls along the way.  Above all, if they are to succeed in their objectives, the National Development Corporation must be freed from the restraints which tend to restrict initiative in the State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are times for courageous action and in my view this Bill strikes the correct <Col N="2182" /> balance between the degree of public accountability which must of necessity accompany investment of State funds and the freedom of operation which is essential to the success of this venture.  I am confident, therefore, that the National Development Corporation will succeed in promoting economic activity, especially where it is most needed in the economic black spots which need help so badly, and this organisation will provide a spark which will ignite the spirit of enterprise so badly lacking at present.</P>
    <P>During my term as Lord Mayor of Cork I was struck by the amount of industrial skill which exists in the north city area of Cork, especially in the textile industry.  When this Bill is passed I will be asking the Cork Task Force to prepare proposals for submissions to the National Development Corporation outlining the available sites of fully serviced land and expert skilled workforce, especially in the areas of Blackpool, the Glen, Mayfield, Churchfield, Knocknaheenie and Hollyhill &mdash; former employees of Sunbeam Wolsey.  Surely there is some joint venture which can be established to utilise these assets.</P>
    <P>The British market in textiles is buoyant at present, especially in knitted goods.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill which is giving us an opportunity to extend the area of textiles. In Cork we have the cream of the textile workforce and I am asking the Minister to demand from the Cork Task Force proposals re the local textile industry in view of the recent report on the enormous upturn in the textile industry in Britain. In comparison to that country our textile industry and workforce are much more advanced and I fail to understand why more initiative and motivation are not being created in that area.  In view of recent reports, which are not being denied by anybody in authority, the responsibility lies between our local task force in Cork and our semi-State bodies. I am asking the Minister to investigate this matter further.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation will provide long term investment capital which is badly needed.  I ask the <Col N="2183" /> Minister to invest capital for marketing the textile industry in Cork since this would create employment for many people.  I ask the Minister to give this his immediate attention and I know I can rely on him to take the necessary action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The national Development Corporation has been on the stocks for quite a long time.  Many people had different ideas of what was intended by a national development corporation. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions did a lot of research into this idea. The Labour Party adopted it as one of the major items of policy and stitched it into the agreement with Fine Gael in Government.  The two parties, in my opinion, have different ideas of what a national development corporation means and that is the reason for the long delay in introducing this Bill.  What has come out eventually is not what was intended originally by the Labour Party and is undoubtedly not what was intended by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The Irish Congress in their document <i>Confronting the Jobs Crisis</i> said that Congress considered that a national development corporation must be given a major role in initiating and developing in conjunction with existing public enterprise where appropriate, or where necessary by the establishment of new enterprises, selected industrial projects in these areas. They said that the White Paper on industrial policy did not provide for the involvement of State companies in new manufacturing industries but that many of the proposals in the White Paper relating to the existing commercial State-sponsored bodies would seriously inhibit their potential for developing new projects. That is what they say on page 10 of that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point they were making is that the Government's White Paper on industrial policy made them think that the Government's ideas on a national development corporation would not be in accordance with their's because the White Paper would seriously inhibit the potential of State-sponsored bodies for developing <Col N="2184" /> new companies.  They said that the Government seemed to be refusing to give a role to public enterprise in developing manufacturing industry because they did not want the public sector to compete with the private sector.  That is very evident from Government policies for many years.  Governments saw the role of State companies as being to provide a service for private enterprise but never to compete with private enterprise.  Private enterprise is supposed to be dynamic and prepared for open and free competition. The point made by the supporters of private enterprise is that State enterprises are not enterprising or dynamic and that they cannot compete.  Why are there so many restrictions on State enterprises to prevent them from competing openly with private enterprise?  There is no reason why State enterprises should not be allowed a free hand without the Government constantly putting their fingers into the till, telling them they cannot do certain things because they would compete with somebody in existing private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy made the point that private enterprise is stifled.  Free enterprise is being grant-aided and assisted in every possible way by the taxpayer and it is not being stifled.  Private enterprise is not even paying its fair share of taxation. They are not even paying the share allocated to them.  We have a difficult area in relation to the collection of taxes and so on.  Private enterprise, far from being stifled, is given every possible facility in grants and subsidies.  At the same time State companies are being instructed to give private enterprise every possible assistance.  That is their job as the State sees it.  That is why State enterprises and commercial State companies are being prevented from making profits, are being prevented from innovations, from starting new companies and moving into new areas.  As Congress says, they are being prevented from getting into manufacturing industry.  Examples of this are widespread. That is why people are so sceptical of the NDC and its role.</P>
    <P>A good example of a State company which was stifled by the Government is <Col N="2185" /> the Erin Foods industry.  The company were told in the beginning that as they were moving into an area where private enterprise already existed in companies like Batchelors, Goodalls, Findus and others, that they were to export 90 per cent of their product and were only allowed to sell 10 per cent on the home market.  That was an enormous burden to put on an industry starting off in any country.  That was the first restriction put on Erin Foods.  Subsequently there were many other restrictions.  They were instructed by the Fianna Fáil Government at the time to form two State companies. Erin Foods and the Irish Sugar Company were to be under two separate boards.  They were not allowed avail of any grants.  This is why when Findus took over the Erin Foods plant in Middleton a question was raised as to how Findus were able to operate the company when Erin Foods could not and the general manager of the State company said that one was not comparing like with like, that Findus could get State grants which Erin Foods could not.  In other words, Findus could get State grants from the taxpayer but Erin Foods could not get any assistance.  That is the type of environment in which State companies in the commercial area are endeavouring to exist.  It is in that way that Governments are breaking them down and smashing them up as they have been over the last numbers of years with, for instance, the ESB&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The money for Erin Foods did not come from the taxpayer and if Deputy Kelly examines the situation he will see that it was a commercial enterprise which was availing of brand new technology, technology which the Heinz company did not have at the time. The Heinz company were down in the doldrums at the time, as Mr. Tony O'Reilly made very clear, and they were <Col N="2186" /> glad to avail of this brand new technology. We are very glad to avail of this brand new technology of accelerated freeze drying.  That was a new innovative commercial area availing of new technology in an indigenous food industry.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to hear Fianna Fáil coming up with this argument, which Deputy McCreevy used again, that this is the area where grant-aid should be given to our indigenous resource areas of the food industry, forestry, fisheries and so on.  This is the area where jobs should be created, where we should industrialise on our own resources.  That is the policy we have been advocating consistently outside and in this House.  This is the policy on which we went forward in the 1982 election in the <i>An End to the Crisis</i> document which is available still for people to see where the industrialisation should take place.  Some of these areas are listed in this NDC Bill which provides that the NDC will play a critical role in the Government's overall strategy for the development of the indigenous resource sector, particularly in relation to agriculture, fisheries and forestry resources.  It states that the Government, in conjunction with sectoral and agricultural interests, are committed to the preparation of a co-ordinated development programme for the indigenous resource sector.  That is the sector which we have said consistently is the area for development and for industrialisation.  I am glad to hear that Fianna Fáil have adopted this policy, I do not know whether the Government have seen the light but the IDA have seen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the IDA were critical of the Telesis report, they have adopted many of the recommendations of Telesis and have set up a separate food sector in the IDA for development of our food processing industry.  That is the area where massive job creation can be developed.  The ICTU document on confronting the job crisis from which I quoted earlier states that the trade unions are opposed to the proposal that the NDC must within predetermined time limits sell off their investment to the private sector.  Trade unions are also opposed <Col N="2187" /> to the proposals made by the National Planning Board that private firms should be invited to tender for the provision of certain public services and that the private sector employers should be subsidised to employ persons currently employed in the public service.  That is precisely the type of policy being adopted, as if there was something wrong with public sector employment.</P>
    <P>For instance, in Sweden public sector employment is the area for development of full employment.  They have a deliberate full employment policy.  What they call the chief macro-economic policy objective is full employment in Sweden and there the Government have expressly committed themselves to reducing unemployment to 2 per cent of the labour force.  Restoration of full employment is the primary target in that Government's economic policy.  Everyone who wishes shall be entitled to a meaningful job.  Unemployment is a personal tragedy and a waste of resources. This is Government policy and was declared in their 1985-86 budget statement. This was the statement of the Government and the strength of this commitment does not imply that unemployment is exceptionally high in Sweden.  In 1984 just before they made that statement unemployment was 3.1 per cent of the Labour force and they were committed to reducing it to 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>During the seventies and the early eighties unemployment was kept low in Sweden at the expense of inflation, but the document states that the private sector shed labour which the public sector was required to absorb in view of the commitment to full employment.  When you have a commitment to full employment you must recognise that only the public sector and assistance by the public sector will give that full employment.  The private sector will never give you full employment without the assistance of the public sector and they are committed to it to the extent that where labour is shed by the private sector the public sector will take up that loss in order to bring full <Col N="2188" /> employment to the extent of that 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is the type of commitment to jobs that we must have, whereas what we have here are a Government who have stated it is not the job of Government to create jobs.  It is not their job to have anything to do with creation of jobs.  The job of Government, according to this Coalition Government, is to create the environment in which private enterprise can create jobs.  That is completely opposite to the type of policy I have outlined that they have in Sweden, a major industrialised country with the highest technology and the highest standard of living &mdash; an area which recognises the need for public involvement in order to create full employment.</P>
    <P>If our Government say it is not their job to create employment, how can we expect them to do the things they say they will do in the NDC?  The Minister said that when the NDC identify a niche or gap in the market place which the private sector is not yet exploiting good, bad or indifferent they will become involved in it.  They must find this niche or gap in the market place first which the private sector is not yet exploiting, then they will be empowered to move in there and establish a business on their own initiative to meet that demand.  The Minister said it was intended that the NDC should operate as a commercial entity which will invest in enterprises, establish them on their own initiative &mdash; unlike the IDA &mdash; and then dispose of them in accordance with normal commercial procedures.  This is precisely the ICTU document which is objected to.  They are opposed to the proposal that the NDC must sell off their investments to the private sector.  According to the Minister that is still the objective of the NDC.</P>
    <P>I do not know precisely what the Labour Party think the Government will do, but what Fine Gael understand as the role of the NDC is very clear.  The role of the NDC is to assist private enterprises where they are not already engaged.  In some area the NDC will develop a business and when that business is developing profitably they will hand it over to the <Col N="2189" /> private enterprise people who are involved in it, or to some other private enterprise group who take an interest in it, and probably they will be repaid over a period.  They will recoup their money, but their original objective is to assist private enterprise in developing that sector of business, bringing it to a profitable stage and then giving it over to private enterprise to run while they move off to look for another niche or gap in the market place and develop that.  This sort of role does not seem to have any great future and that is the role as the Minister, Deputy Bruton, sees it.  Surely the role of the NDC should be to oversee the industrial development of the country generally and to develop industry.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister mean when he says they will play a critical role in the overall strategy for the development of the indigenous resources sector of the economy?  He said that our timber resources need to be exploited in a more commercial manner than heretofore and the NDC were being given a special role as investment vehicle in commercial projects in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy said that private enterprise had been stifled but the forestry area has been wide open to private enterprise for as many years as the State has been established and had done very little about it.  There is a saw mill here and there, some closing down and others opening up around the country but, apart from Woodfab, there has been very little development in the last 60 years in the forestry area although every possible assistance has been given by the Department and other Government agencies. Private enterprise has not been able to develop in that area.</P>
    <P>One of the points made by private enterprise in regard to their difficulties relates to the Civil Service control of the forests.  I do not think there is anybody, supporters of public or private enterprise, who would not agree that the direct Civil Service control of what is a commercial area of development has been disastrous and made it impossible for any development to take place.  This has been put to the Minister concerned repeatedly by <Col N="2190" /> myself and other Members but he has refused to make any changes in regard to the way the forestry tender system operates, the fact that some forests are inaccessible or the fact that the Department are not aware of the extent of forestry under their control.</P>

      <P>I am commenting on the Minister's statement that our timber resources need to be exploited in a more commercial manner than heretofore. All Members will agree with that.  I am anxious to know if the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has a different idea of how our timber resources should be exploited in a more commercial manner from that of the Minister for Forestry. The latter does not think any change is necessary in order to exploit our forests in a more commercial manner but Deputy Bruton said the NDC must be given a special role as an investment vehicle in commercial projects in this area.  I am trying to figure out if Minister Bruton discussed the matter with Minister O'Toole.  Does Minister Bruton realise what he is up against in Minister O'Toole?  From our experience in the last three years in comments and speeches by Minister O'Toole we can say that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism will not get anywhere in the development of forests in a more commercial manner.  I hope Minister Bruton will give us some idea of how he proposes to do this either in the area of private enterprise or public enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil have accepted the idea of Bord na Móna, who have shown such outstanding ability in the development of our peat resources, taking over the development of our forests because peat resources will not last forever.  Whatever decision the Minister arrives at he will be up against a Civil Service system in the Department of Forestry which is totally non-commercial and against the commercial development of <Col N="2191" /> our forests.  That is an indication of the general attitude of Government and I am wondering how the NDC will work in the way the Labour Party think it will. Bearing in mind Fine Gael policy it does not seem that the NDC will work in anything like the manner the Labour Party are suggesting.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, and the Government, have been developing a privatisation policy in a number of areas, not just in State companies as they are proposing to do in regard to the B &amp; I in hiving off the duty free shops to private enterprise, or in regard to NET having discussions with ICI with a view to giving them a half share because it seems that there is a privatisation policy by the Government in regard to areas like the health service. Even the measles vaccination seems to be privatised from the health boards to private medical practitioners.  In many other areas that seems to be the way things are going.  If that is so, I do not see how the Labour Party can expect that the NDC will develop public enterprises.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about full employment, about ensuring, as the Swedes say, that everyone who wishes shall be entitled to a meaningful job because unemployment is a personal tragedy and a waste of resources, and if the Government are working in human terms rather than engaging in bookkeeping exercises and in terms of profit, then we will have to see public enterprise and public companies as the way to give full employment. The slack must be taken up from private enterprise.  Where private enterprise closes down jobs the State must be prepared to take up those jobs.  The State must have development, expansion and innovation in mind.  We must support our best public servants who have been of tremendous benefit to the State and not throw them on the scrap heap, like General Costello.  We have to support them but the Government do not seem to have that type of policy in mind.  I cannot see how they are going to do the job in the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy felt that many grant-aided foreign industries should not <Col N="2192" /> be grant-aided because they do not have any indigenous base here and were of no benefit.  That is becoming more and more evident and I support what the Deputy said in regard to that.  The point he was making was that they are not adding to the economy and in the long run the profits they make are taken out of the country.  There is another reason why they do not need to be grant-aided now.</P>

      <P>I am referring to a comment by Deputy McCreevy which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle allowed.  The Deputy was making a point in regard to the industries that are grant-aided.  He asked if the industries developed by the National Development Corporation would also be able to avail of IDA grants. I think the Minister said yes, that grant-aiding of industries would come under the National Development Corporation idea.  If that corporation develop an industry, it should be entitled to receive the same type of grant-aid as other industries. It was on that basis that Deputy McCreevy was speaking about this.</P>
      <P>I did not think these industries needed so much grant-aiding now, because the current position is that industries are coming here for reasons other than our grants.  An industry called Verbatim is setting up here because the high volume assembly work is cheaper in labour terms here and in Mexico than in the United States.  In labour terms, we count the same as Mexico; we have cheap labour so we need not give these industries any grant-aid at all.  While the industries being set up here are providing jobs which we need, development should be geared to creating industries which, in turn, create new wealth in the economy &mdash; industries based on our resources, mineral, food processing, forestry, fisheries and so on.</P>

      <P>I support and have supported the idea of a national development corporation but I have a different idea about it, which I think was one the Labour Party had, that it would develop areas where private enterprise was not involved but also areas where private enterprise was involved and was doing a very bad job.  It is involved in forestry and so on.  The National Development Corporation will be developing public enterprise in the natural resources area which will be competitive and profitable. When profitable, they will be contributing to Government, not selling off to private enterprise which seems to be the policy of the Government at present.  I do not think that the National Development Corporation which is before us has any meaning whatsoever apart from being a cover for the Labour Party.  As pointed out by previous speakers, we already have a National Enterprise Agency.  As Deputy Bell has said, that agency might not have been too bad, but it lacked Government will to implement it.  He thinks the National Development Corporation will be better because it will have Government will behind it.  The whole thrust of my speech is in reply to that.  This corporation also will be hung up to dry because it will not have Government will to implement the ideas behind the original development.</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill. Every Member of this House should support the National Development Corporation and I am a little disappointed that the Opposition are not giving it their support. We are all deeply concerned about the very high level of unemployment. The choices open to us can be boiled down to two.  One is to sit and do nothing but complain and moan.  Alternatively, we can try to do something about the situation.  I do not wish to be contentious but the Opposition attitude to this Bill is one of sitting, complaining and doing nothing.  I am not including the last speaker in that Opposition.  I think Deputy Mac Giolla is in support of this Bill.  I am asking the Fianna Fáil Party to support the Bill because there is scope in <Col N="2194" /> it.  There is every likelihood that, if it gets the support of all parties in this House, of all the semi-State bodies, people in business and in enterprise outside this House, it can achieve much good for the country.</P>
      <P>We have at present in the region of 220,000 to 230,000 unemployed.  It is a frightening prospect to see many young men and women who will face a lifetime without a job unless something is done for them.  I believe that Governments can do something for these people.  It is up to all of us here to try to do something positive to provide the necessary jobs and that is my reason for supporting this Bill. There is every hope, possibility and prospect that the corporation will achieve many positive results and succeed in providing employment for our young people and those of every age who have been laid off work and face a prospect of never regaining employment.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his Ministers of State, Deputy Moynihan and Deputy Collins, on their input into this Bill.  These three have produced a Bill with the help of the Government and the Cabinet which will bring successful results.  The complaint is being made that we have sufficient agencies already.  If we can succeed in providing employment with this corporation, it will be of great use to this country. That is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in connection with Deputy Mac Giolla and shall touch only briefly on some points at which I would recommend the corporation to look.  I do not know if that is within the ambit of this debate.  This Bill enables the corporation themselves to do any particular job or to go into a joint venture with some other body.  Mr. Lorcan Blake of Allied Irish Banks mentioned recently private enterprise taking over our forests.  I read his remarks on this subject with interest.  In my view, a body such as the National Development Corporation have a role to play in the development of our forests, but I would prefer to see Bord na Móna taking over <Col N="2195" /> our forests and developing them, in conjunction with a certain amount of private development which exists at present.</P>
    <P>About four months before Deputy Haughey made his Ard-Fheis speech in which he stated that Fianna Fáil were considering having Bord na Móna take over forestry I went to the trouble of preparing a detailed speech, having done much research, in which I suggested that Bord na Móna should take over our forestry. The following morning I bought the three national papers &mdash;<i>The Cork Examiner</i> is not the big seller in Laois-Offaly &mdash; and there was something smaller than a small advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which they reported that Deputy Enright was in favour of Bord na Móna taking over forestry.  The other two papers did not deem my remarks worthy of comment.  Be that as it may, it is something that I believe should be considered. Forestry is one of the greatest areas for potential growth of employment available to any Government, the National Development Corporation or whoever may have the ability, energy and foresight to exploit it.  Across the whole country there are vast tracts of land awaiting forestry development with huge job potential.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to consider allowing Bord na Móna to take over and develop our forests or, if not, if they would examine closely how the NDC could move in and do so.  At present there is not sufficient timber for a number of our sawmills.  We are importing vast amounts of timber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your position, a Cheann Comhairle, and I shall not develop that point.  I would ask the Government to take a hard look at forestry and its potential and perhaps devote a Cabinet meeting to assessing its enormous potential and the jobs available. Bord na Móna are the people who should <Col N="2196" /> undertake the task, perhaps with a certain mix from private enterprise.  If not, the task could be undertaken by the NDC.  But something must be done because the way our forests are lying idle at present is a national scandal.</P>
      <P>Other areas in which there is tremendous potential are in food, fish and vegetable processing.  As a nation we deserve condemnation for the amount of food we import daily.  It amounts to a national scandal.  People throughout the length and breadth of the country purchase from the large supermarket chains, who are the main culprits, because they do not bring in food in van loads but in large containers, one following another.  The next time any Irish person goes to Britain he will see the notices displayed in shops there which read: &ldquo;Be British&rdquo;, &ldquo;Think British&rdquo; and &ldquo;Buy British&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Our natural resources comprise our land, forests and seas, areas in which there is enormous potential for the development of industry.  The NDC will have available to them a vast sum of money, £300 million.  I listened with tremendous interest to a radio interview this morning with a Father Mark Mimnagh from Cavan.  I might congratulate him on his initiative &mdash; he employs 17 people in a development corporation in County Cavan.  I would hope that the NDC would have the sense to see how vegetable processing can be undertaken in a small way on a profitable basis.  We have the soil, climate, expertise.  What we need is the initiative and drive to go out and get going.  We import vast amounts of vegetables.  With the assistance of the NDC we should be able to set up vegetable processing plants throughout the country.  A number of them are closing or are experiencing difficulties of one type or another. Whether the NDC undertake the task alone or in a joint venture with somebody else, they should have the courage of <Col N="2197" /> their covictions to take over such processing plants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned Erin Foods and all the problems that had ensued.  Again, there are problems with the Sugar Company.  In spite of all those problems there is scope and demand for the produce of these factories.  We are just as skilled as those people in Britain who manage to process vegetables.  At least if not more intelligent we have the expertise, common sense and everything else.  This National Development Corporation constitutes a great challenge to us as a nation to ensure that henceforth rather than being a heavy importer of vegetables, we become self-sufficient, perhaps exporting vegetables to countries where there is a demand for them.</P>
      <P>In the course of that radio interview this morning Father Mimnagh, to whom I referrred, was able to point out &mdash; and he had undertaken this research himself &mdash; that, on the American market cauliflowers cost $2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many areas here awaiting exploitation by such a corporation.  I might give as an example the amount of machinery we import.  I would hope that the NDC would have the initiative to ascertain how they can develop and <Col N="2198" /> manufacture machinery.  I know the opportunities exist.  For example, there is a firm outside my own town, Derrinlough Engineering Works in Birr, where machinery is expertly manufactured and prepared.  They work under the auspices of Bord na Móna who are considering closing this firm.  They should be allowed to sell to other firms also.  Those engineering works had been built up over the years and we cannot afford to lose expertise which has taken so many years to develop.  If Bord na Móna do not have the foresight to retain this important engineering works, the National Development Corporation should move in.  We have very complex rules and regulations in regard to joint ventures.  The biggest firm in the country is Guinness but if I wish to invest £200 in their shares &mdash;&mdash;</P>

The National Development Corporation will need assistance and investment funds from private individuals and companies.  I know that the regulations to which I referred are outside the ambit of the Bill, but the NDC will have to address themselves to that problem.

      <P>God loves a trier.  The corporation should not be too restrictive. Many accountants and civil servants will be brought in to cope with the book work involved.  In general, accountants and civil servants are not over adventurous and they do not have as much entrepreneurial flair as those involved in the business world.  I would hate to see good ideas bogged down in paper work and I hope they will be listened to and that there will be a positive response.  The corporation can work given the right support.</P>
      <P>Many people wish to invest in Ireland and there is potential in the Bill for doing so.  We are on the edge of Europe and there are positive benefits to be gained. We should be able to attract investment from outside the country.  I wish the corporation success and with the right guidance and positive support of everyone in the House they will succeed.  Every Member should back the corporation and the Opposition should be very careful about opposing the Bill.  The IDA have attracted many industries here and we would be in a very bad state without them.  They needed support when they were set up and the NDC need it now. Everybody in this House should give them their full backing.</P>

Listening to some of the speeches from Members opposite, it looks as if the National Development Corporation will be the fairy godmother to every kind of dumdum operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ideas about the National Development Corporation have been around for some time.  The matter has been discussed and various suggestions have been put forward as to how we should explore the possibility of innovation and development in the whole range of technological, scientific, engineering and other skills. We know there are agencies any one of <Col N="2201" /> which could be expanded by one simple clause which would enable them to undertake the developments we are talking about here.  There is a need for the kind of development envisaged under the NDC but we believe, and there is evidence to back this up, that all the purposes could be fulfilled simply by organising some of the existing agencies.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any difference of opinion on this matter on the part of some of the Members on the opposite side.  I shall quote a comment by Deputy Kelly about a year ago when speaking in this House on the national economic and social plan.  In volume 352, column 2237 of the Official Report dated 11 October 1984 the Deputy made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The reference to the National Development Corporation made me give a wry smile.  I have been hearing about this spook ever since it first surfaced in the form of an accommodation address in Kildare Street without even a telephone, a permanent secretariat or anything else...</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Apparently it is now to have a somewhat more solid substance, but I am still not clear what it is intended to do. I could not help laughing at finding in the plan that the National Enterprise Agency &ldquo;would seek to identify opportunities&rdquo; for the National Development Corporation to pursue.  Surely the people who want a National Development Corporation should see those opportunities before setting it up?  I can see it so well that I could nearly write the script.  There will be an office with wall-to-wall carpeting and a stainless plate on the door with a cute little logogram designed by some graphic designer with a tweed tie...</P>
    <P>These were the Deputy's views on the NDC.  He made the point I am making now, namely, that we have Bord na Móna, Bord Iascaigh Methara, Gaeltarra Éireann and a host of other agencies who are quite capable of doing what needs <Col N="2202" /> to be done provided a simple clause is inserted in their terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I am sceptical of the Government's intentions when I see the way the National Enterprise Agency have been treated by them since they took office. The agency have issued reports up to 1983-84.  They have pointed out the difficulties under which they have been operating.  They are conscious of the fact that, because of the sluggish condition of the economy here and throughout Europe, it is a difficult climate for a development agency to operate in.  Everyone knows that what is lacking is not structures, agencies or skilled personnel. What is needed is some direction from Government in many areas which would help to create a climate in which the necessary developments could take place.  We must not forget that there are 1,000,000 young people at school at the moment and many of them will need jobs in the near future.  I do not believe the NDC or any other agency can meet the challenge of unemployment unless and until the Government realise they must take the initiatives that are essential for economic growth.</P>
    <P>Many ideas have been tossed around and various study groups and committees have looked at them.  At the moment State spending is being cut, there are controls in respect of the volume of money in the market, profits are being squeezed, there if a fall in industrial development and the manufacturing base is contracting.  All of this is due to the policies of the Government.  In view of that any agency, whether it be the NDC, the IDA, SFADCo, Córas Tráchtála or Gaeltarra Eireann to name but a few, will be limited in the way they can tackle our problems.</P>
    <P>It is hypocritical of Government Deputies to say our opposition to this measure is due to failure on our part to recognise the urgent need to create employment. They know only too well that the policies of every Minister in this administration have been the main reason for the sluggish condition of the economy thus creating huge unemployment.  Because of this we will not have the right kind of climate <Col N="2203" /> to enable any agency, private company or individual to become interested in developing or expanding operations here.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister highlighted the need to draw up an agreement between the IDA and other State agencies to ensure there will not be overlapping or disputes between the various organisations with regard to responsibility. Is it not the obvious thing for the Minister to insert the relevant cause in the terms of reference of the existing agencies &mdash; a simple matter &mdash; to enable them to do what is necessary?  There is no need to have this further development, this new monster that will try to take over all the operations of the agencies and their financing.  In practically every section of the Bill there is a provision stating that matters are subject to the control or direction of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We can already see indications of what will happen when Government agencies begin to compete with each other.  After five years deliberation in the Department we now have circulated an Industrial Development Bill, 1985.  It was rushed in here today and this indicates the pressure that is already on the Department, with the various strands in the Department pushing their own points of view.  Did anybody before hear of two State agencies setting up agreements between themselves? The Minister is setting down guidelines for the NDC.  Will we next see him setting them down for marriage agreements, with the Minister officiating? I hope some Minister will have the power to dissolve the shotgun wedding.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the limit as far as bureaucracy is concerned.  By inserting a minor clause in the IDA Bill the Minister could have brought the NDC into being.  He did not do that because the NDC was the big plank in the Labour Party programme, although during the course of the debate this afternoon we have not heard a contribution from a Labour Deputy, and in the last half hour the Ceann Comhairle had some difficulty restraining Deputy Enright who was put <Col N="2204" /> in because of a shortage of speakers on the Government side.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not satisfy anyone and that is why there has been such a reluctance to speak by Government Deputies. The NEA was an excellent vehicle to promote the type of development we consider to be essential in present circumstances. In their report the NEA highlighted the fact that they had brought in a team of competent people in spite of lack of Government support.  In the short term of their existence they tried to fund sustainable jobs and the development, of instance, of a whole range of new products with engineering and scientific bases.</P>
    <P>We must try to exploit the huge volume of expertise we have in the universities, the NIHEs and the regional colleges.  In this Bill there is very little incentive for co-operation between the universities and the other higher education colleges to exploit scientific and technological knowledge.  In 1949 the British Government set up agencies to exploit the research work being done in the universities. The Minister will know of the establishment there of the National Research Development Corporation who are engaged in developing a whole range of contacts between universities and research institutes.  They have tried to develop inventions and so on.  They developed new products, advanced commodities. Last year they earned £60 million in overseas fees in respect of patents.  They carried our research work in computer and other sciences, in chemical engineering, in a variety of technological and scientific developments in the universities.</P>
    <P>Though that kind of development is recognised in the Bill, I should like to see some vehicle being developed to utilise the expertise on our colleges and universities. They should be brought together. We suffer here from a lack of linkage and if a new agency involved in this fails to bring together academic expertise we will be losing a great opportunity.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the NDC under the Bill will be very limited in regard to encouraging contacts and co-operative <Col N="2205" /> work in the colleges of higher education. We need to be in the van of scientific and technological advances being made. These advances are bringing about a new revolution and we need to be in at the beginning.  We have a million young boys and girls in our schools and colleges looking for employment openings.  In future there will not be as many opportunities in the public service because of the deliberate policy of the Government.  If there are to be opportunities, not only for the many thousands of young boys and girls who are unemployed but for the many thousands more who will be leaving the educational system in the next number of years, we must be involved in the whole range of technological development and let us be seen to be to the forefront where these developments are concerned.  This will involve directing our young people into the science subjects.  There is a whole range of activities which may seem to be unrelated to the development we are talking of in this Bill but which we will need to concentrate on if we are to provide opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous possibilities for us within the ambit of the areas the NDC will be exploring.  We are now only scratching the surface in that respect. However, I do not envisage the NDC being able to do anything that cannot be done by the National Enterprise Agency or by any other such agency.  That is why I would be more in favour of building on what has been established already and in giving to the NEA the teeth they need in terms of development potential and of being to the forefront in terms of the new and exciting changes that are taking place.  We are losing out on opportunities because of a lack of proper linkage between the Government agencies and the universities and colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to convince anyone on this side of the House that the Government are serious about supporting indigenous industry when we have regard to their action in relation to the chipboard factory at Scariff, for instance.  Numerous Deputies today spoke of the need to exploit our timber industry but, in an <Col N="2206" /> enterprise in which the Government were involved as partners with private investors including some local people who had invested their money to keep the plant open, the Government put in a receiver and had the company wound up.  A Spanish company are operating at the plant now.  How, then, could anyone treat seriously the setting up of a corporation to develop industry?</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will be convinced by the arguments of Government Deputies that the setting up of the corporation will result in the exploration of the full potential of our forestry, for example. We already have a Government Department who have power under the forestry Acts to explore that potential.  But how can anyone have confidence in the Government in that respect when some members of a committee set up by the Minister who were to report by June last went behind the backs of other members and supplied the Minister with selected passages from the final draft of the report, thereby sabotaging the committee's work?  The Minister was supplied with inside information as to what was taking place in the committee.  He was supplied privately with a two page document in advance of the completion of the committee's report.  Is it any wonder that the committee were totally undermined and circumvented in what they were doing?  Today the Minister tried to justify that sort of behaviour.  Was it surprising that one of the committee's key personnel, Peter Cassells of the ICTU, considered himself forced to resign from the committee though he was appointed by the Minister just one year ago?</P>
    <P>Government speakers tell us we should be constructive in our remarks about the NDC on the basis that the corporation will be involved in the exploitation of our resources and consequently in the creation of jobs in the various areas of activity but, only a short while ago, the Minister concerned scuttled a State Company who were involved in the timber business.  The same Minister has now undermined a committee set up by him to advise on what future structures might be needed in terms of exploring our <Col N="2207" /> timber resources.  Timber will become more valuable as it matures in the State forests and also because of a world shortfall in timber that will not be made up either by us or by any other timber producing country.</P>
    <P>We know what the Government are at. Their only aim is to be able to say at the next election that they set up the NDC and that that will result in the provision of jobs for the thousands of people who need them.  The jobs could be created by any one of the existing Government agencies.  There is no lack of finances to develop a project of any importance.  I have yet to experience the holding up of a genuine project for reasons of lack of finance whether on the part of private institutions or of State agencies.  There is a shortage of ideas and of new projects with the result that viable jobs are not being created.  Such agencies as the county development teams, Gaeltarra Éireann, the IDA and so on are capable of doing what needs to be done in the area of employment creation.</P>
    <P>Another project scuttled by the Government was the Hyster project in Limerick.  The Government failed to make available the money that was necessary for that plant.  That subject was debated fully here earlier in the year during Private Members' Business when it was shown clearly that the Government have no commitment to industry or to jobs.  Despite this they are prepared to spend money on this new development at a time when the Minister for Finance is telling us how Government expenditure must be cut.  We are talking here of a sum of perhaps £2 million for the administration of this new bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the desirability of exploiting our fisheries potential.  We have missed out on opportunities in that area.  Today the Minister gave figures in respect of the imports of fish &mdash; imports to a total value of £30 million in one year &mdash; but these imports should not be necessary.  We should be capable of fulfilling the market need by way of our own industry.  If we are to develop the fishing industry that development will be by way <Col N="2208" /> of negotiating larger quotas for our fishermen. There must be an increase in catches if we are to develop the industry. However, the Government by their actions have ensured that the reverse will be the case because in the negotiations for the enlargement of the Community there is provision for 17,500 Spanish boats to come here and take the fish which our fishermen should be catching.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kenny will be aware, fishermen along the west coast cannot fish for mackerel at this time because the season has closed.  Neither can they fish for herring in the Celtic Sea in the south-west because the season is closed and now, because of a badly organised and negotiated enlargement of the <Col N="2209" /> Community, there will be less fish as the Spanish fleet will be catching the fish which should be exploited by Irish industry. To say that a huge number of jobs will be created in the fishing industry when the National Development Corporation is established is a lot of rubbish, and Deputies know it.  More jobs in this industry can be created under present regulations and with aid which is already available from EC funds.  This aid is not being taken up because the Government are not sufficiently committed to developing the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>We do not need a new agency, all we need is the Government to encourage the fishing industry to develop secondary processing which can be done by Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This whole exercise is a bluff and the Minister knows it.  It is another bit of propaganda which will be used before the next election to try to get people to believe that this new development corporation is doing great things and that if this Government get back into power all our unemployment problems will be solved.</P>
      <P>The NEA set out very clearly what the Government have done to them.  They were beginning to operate successfully but before the ink was dry, this agency was undermined by the Government. Deputy Bell spoke about the frustration they felt, and admitted that the Government killed off the National Enterprise Agency.  He said it was not given any teeth, any money, or expertise and that it was a failure because the Government did not back it.  That is a test of the sincerity of this Government.  It is recognised that if the Government had backed the NEA, if the Government had been willing to help them, they would be well on the way to doing what needs to be done, and we would not be here discussing this Bill.  This is another delaying tactic by the national handlers pretending something magnificent is around the corner, if the people are foolish enough to believe it, but I do not think they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House because this Bill has been thrashed out for a long time and there will be another opportunity to thrash out the Industrial <Col N="2210" /> Development Bill.  This Bill was no sooner circulated than the IDA were busy getting their document before us. We know what the Government have in mind.  Fianna Fáil are deeply committed to the development of our resources, to the exploitation of the potential of our colleges of technology and universities, to the opening of our forests and so on. We can see the prospect of many sustainable jobs being created if the Government create the proper climate.  As long as we have a Government who are holding back every sector of the economy, who are committed to nothing but self-preservation, we will not see the kind of development we hope to see in the future.</P>
    <P>I tell the Government to forget about this bluff, to put this Bill away with the rest of their policy documents and to call a general election.  Let the people decide what they want.  I know they want to get this hopeless, hapless Government out of office at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposed National Development Corporation Bill. I believe this agency has a lot to offer in areas the NEA and the IDA have not been looking after.  As regards the food industry, forestry, meat processing and so on, over the years multinationals have been supplied with food from other countries, from Europe and South Africa.  We have seen people on strike for the past 12 months because of this situation.  A step in the right direction would be if the NDC were involved in a joint venture with people with large amounts of capital to invest and the Government should have a percentage share in these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to mention the attitude of the Opposition to this proposal.  When one looks back on the official records, one sees that in 1950 when the Industrial Development Authority Bill was going through this House, the then Opposition <Col N="2211" /> and their leader were opposed to it.  On 9 March 1950 the Fianna Fáil Leader, Mr. Lemass, said at column 1618 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I do not want the individuals concerned to feel that, in taking action to terminate it, we are animated by any hostility to themselves as individuals. Our hostility is to this Bill and to the principle of it.  It may be that the Minister will remain in office and that these people will continue to carry out his functions for him; but, if ever that situation ceases and the Party on this side of the House becomes the Government, the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be resumed by whoever is nominated to that post and these subsidiary bodies will cease.</P>
    <P>This is a proposal to help industry in a way in which it has not been helped over the past 35 years.  The Leader of the Opposition said 35 years ago that they would terminate the IDA who were set up by the Coalition Government.  It is interesting that when they returned to power that did not happen.  They saw the IDA as a means to help individuals who had supported them down through the years and to provide jobs and give grants to them.  We can see the results of that over the years.  Is it any wonder that so many of the efforts set up since then have failed?</P>
    <P>In this Bill £300 million will be made available to develop the food processing industry which has been dormant for years.  All Governments were responsible for that.  A real effort has not been made since we joined Europe in 1973 in relation to a policy for food processing so that there would be Irish food in the supermarkets, food of which people could be proud.  It is ironic that the Opposition are prepared to knock this for the sake of knocking as they did in relation to the IDA and as they knocked the National Housing Finance Agency Bill in 1981. Opposition speakers last week welcomed the increased amount of money for the National Housing Finance Agency.  We <Col N="2212" /> must continually listen to the Opposition knocking proposals that will develop thousands of jobs without coming up with one proposal to help to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The development of joint venture schemes in relation to forestry can ensure that large tracts of land useless for agricultural production can be planted, providing thousands of jobs.  In this area we could attract outside investment from banks and other institutions willing to invest on a long term basis to ensure that thousands of unproductive acres will be developed.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies mentioned that the National Enterprise Agency will go by the board.  They are doing an excellent job for small business people willing to invest money.  Having had the opportunity to talk to these people at a meeting of the Committee on Public Expenditure, I saw that they were doing an excellent job under their terms of reference.  It took a year to two to get them off the ground but, so far as small industries are concerned, there is an incentive and the agency are doing a good job.  The National Development Corporation will have the necessary finance and will be able to attract the business people who have the finance to invest in the industries I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said his <Col N="2217" /> piece and he should be off home now. My colleague, Deputy Wilson, also dwelt on this matter last night and we laid out in detail the massive financial losses that have been incurred in Dublin port over the years by these continuous blunders.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here tonight with the motion submitted by Fianna Fáil on the redevelopment of the port. Whatever form the proposed development of the port takes it must be seen to be beneficial and acceptable to all those people living adjacent to the port who would most likely be affected directly or indirectly by the port's activities.</P>
      <P>In this respect I would like to refer to what the Minister said last night regarding our party leader and myself for opposing what he termed certain industrial development proposals for political expediency.  The Minister failed to say that he was referring to the highly controversial proposal to build underground caverns for the storage of LPG in Dublin Bay.  This storage would be less than one mile from high density residential areas. Indeed, at the time there was absolute terror amongst the residents, particularly in Clontarf, Dollymount and Raheny, at the thought of the potential time bomb that it was being suggested should be located right on their doorstep.  It is grossly irresponsible of the Minister to make this statement which proves how bereft he is of ideas for proper port development. When he launched an attack on the Fianna Fáil representatives for Dublin North-Central for taking the stand they took last year he was grossly and totally irresponsible.  We make no apologies for opposition to that proposal and if it ever should be resurrected we will mount the same opposition to what was and would be a grossly irresponsible and stupid proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not to the credit of the promoters of Dublin port or Dublin Corporation that they pursued with great ferocity and enthusiasm this proposal strictly for financial reasons.  However, massive protests and objections by the communities living in the area eventually won the day because An Bord Pleanála rejected the <Col N="2218" /> application on the grounds that the caverns posed a massive risk of serious explosions to the people who live in that area and placed many lives at risk.  The decision was made in the aftermath of a very serious LPG storage tank explosion in Mexico which caused the deaths of over 3,000 people.  Since then similar tragedies have occurred in other countries where LPG was stored in residential areas.  Very recently I heard a whisper that Dublin port in conjunction with a promoter are endeavouring to resurrect this proposal in the name of development. If this proposal is the only one that Dublin port can come up with for the development of the port it is not surprising that the port finds itself in its present serious situation.  As we all know, it is on the verge of bankruptcy and closure.  The Minister also knows well that this development would have given very marginal employment to a very small number of semi-skilled or skilled personnel.  To talk in terms of this development creating employment in the area is totally dishonest.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister in the House on numerous occasions to give an assurance that he will not grant any further harbour works orders in the bay.  There is a huge demand, which commercially makes sense, for proper planning of amenities to be provided in the Dublin Bay area.  It is not reasonable that the Dublin Port and Docks Board continue to seek additional reclamation for industrial activity when they have acres of open spaces lying totally unused in the dock area.  Many acres of this open space are being used merely for the storage of empty 40 foot containers which have been lying there month after month.  This is a further abuse of the privilege of having valuable space and a further indictment of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I repeat my request to the Minister to reject that application for the harbour works order.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks of political expediency I would like to remind him of an official letter from Fine Gael headquarters prior to the last election, signed by Seán O'Leary, director of elections, <Col N="2219" /> to the people of Clontarf, promising that further development would not take place in the bay.  The Minister came in here last night and slated the leader of Fianna Fáil and me for making what he called similar promises for political expediency.  I have here the Fine Gael pamphlet handed out in Dublin North-Central before the last election.  One of its points is, &ldquo;We are totally opposed to the storage of LPG in Dublin Bay&rdquo;.  That is the industrial development the Minister talked about last night when he criticised Fianna Fáil.  I tell the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, that here is the letter. The Minister for Communications, Deputy Mitchell, is not in the House tonight and the Minister of State might inform him of the points I have just made. I will quote from the last paragraph of the letter: &ldquo;With respect to harbour works order, I wish to confirm that Fine Gael policy is firmly against granting any orders in this case.&rdquo;  That is quite clear. Is that political expediency on the part of Fine Gael?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil at least have been and remain totally consistent in this matter. The issue is so serious from the point of view of many thousands of people living nearby that the Minister should do the right thing and reject without further delay that application which is on his desk at present.</P>
    <P>I hope that answers the question posed by the Minister last night.  In return let me ask the Minister if his two colleagues in the constituency, Deputy George Birmingham and Deputy Richard Bruton, have withdrawn their support for rejection of the application.  I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, when he speaks shortly will reply to that simple question.  All I am seeking is a simple yes or no.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;offers an unique opportunity to change the other inner city area radically for the benefit of the communities living there.  The Government talked about a low density area and seemed to suggest that the site would be developed mainly commercially for hotels, a conference centre, a leisure centre, some shopping and some housing. Most people who know the port area well will be very hesitant to accept all these proposals as being potentially successful. When the Taoiseach made this announcement it was obvious that no homework had been done, and last night the Minister shed no light on that subject either. We have not yet received any details of what is planned for that area.  I hope the Minister of State will give some indication of what the Government may have in mind, but I urge that Dublin Corporation, the local authority responsible for the area, be invited to participate in the fullest possible way in the drawing up of plans for the development of that area. These plans should contain a very large segment of housing.  During the past few years all political parties have talked about the necessity of bringing life back to the inner city.  This development provides an ideal opportunity for the Government to do just that and to give an injection of new life to an area that has been denuded and allowed to become derelict mainly for commercial reasons and not in the interests of the port.</P>
      <P>Dublin port is a very important link in the transport cycle and the foundation of industrial development and thus job creation.  Seen as such, Dublin port should not be left in isolation.  A busy port means more trade.  More trade means more jobs and more jobs are, obviously, the ultimate which we must all be seen to pursue.  I hope whatever development plan the Government have in mind for the port will do that, because the area has suffered greatly over recent years from very high and serious unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being provided with an ideal opportunity to do something about that <Col N="2221" /> development but, unless the Government have the will, the courage and, above all, the initiative, I am afraid Dublin port will not succeed.  The Government must look at the whole set up of the Dublin Port and Docks Board because it has proved disastrous in recent years.  Unless there is a solution in that area I am afraid the Government may be wasting their time irrespective of the actions they propose to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Communications gave details of measures already taken to restore viability to Dublin port and informed this House of his intention to introduce early legislation to enable the restructuring of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I intend tonight to concentrate on decisions already taken by the Government to revitalise the dock area generally and the Custom House docks site in particular.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his statement to Dáil Éireann on 23 October 1985 has already given a clear indication of the measures which the Government propose to take to secure the redevelopment of the Custom House docks site and certain designated inner city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. The Custom House docks site is a 27-acre site and represents the largest single piece of dockland property which requires redevelopment.  It is also the closest area to the city centre which has been radically affected by the development and modernisation of port facilities and their transfer further eastwards.  The Government recognise the importance of the site in civic and national terms in its own right and also recognise the contribution, direct and indirect, which the redevelopment of the site could have for the area immediately surrounding the site and the north inner city area of Dublin generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided on 20 June 1984 to establish a special working party to consider how the Custom House site could best be developed to realise its value and at the same time achieve a satisfactory economic and social development. <Col N="2222" /> The working party, of which I was chairman, considered all possible options for encouraging the redevelopment of this site.  To those who said we did not give it much thought and that it was hastily conceived I must point out that the working party was established on 20 June 1984 and not on 20 October 1985. A lot of thought went into this matter.</P>
    <P>We engaged the services of a consultant to examine possibilities for the development of the site, having regard to:</P>
    <P>The need to obtain the maximum benefit for the Port and Docks Board from the development, and the desirability of achieving the optimum development from the point of view of inner city renewal and revitalisation, given the location and importance of the site.</P>
    <P>The consultant was required to consider all aspects of the matter to suggest possible development packages for the site and to advise on:</P>
    <P>The likelihood of selling the site on the basis of market conditions and the existing outline planning permission; the value of the site; the likelihood of attracting private capital and the means by which this might be achieved; whether a scheme of tax or other incentives might be likely to help in the development of the site and an analysis of the type of incentives and whether any special administrative, statutory or other arrangements should apply in relation to the overall development of the site or planning procedures.</P>
    <P>The consultant produced an up to date valuation of the site and an assessment of its potential in the light of the depressed property market and other factors and based on the outline planning permission which had been granted to the Dublin Port and Docks Board on 28 September 1982.</P>
    <P>The outline permission appeared to be based on maximising density for development purposes.  The office and shopping content was particularly large, given the location of the property and the size of the Dublin market for such development. At a rough estimate, the total investment value of a development on the lines of <Col N="2223" /> the outline permission would be in the range of £125 million to £150 million at current values.</P>
    <P>The consultant estimated that on the basis of the outline permission, and taking account of market circumstances, it would not be possible to sell the site other than at a figure representing a fraction of its potential realisable value.  In addition, he advised that in today's property market the site is indigestible and unbankable and would be attractive to potential customers only if it could be shown to provide an immediate return by way of undertakings that space would be occupied on completion.  A less intensive, more socially oriented development would offer the best chance of bringing the site forward for development in the foreseeable future and of realising its value.</P>
    <P>The working party generally accepted these conclusions.  We agreed, however, that because of the national and civic importance of the site and despite the present economic climate and difficulties in the property market, it could not be left undeveloped without considerable repercussions for the surrounding area. Accordingly, we drew up a set of principles for a possible development brief for the site, taking account of the factors indentified by the consultant as necessary if there was to be any possibility of the site being brought forward for development in the foreseeable future.  In addition we considered possible tax incentives which might encourage a mix of development on the lines contained in our development brief.</P>
    <P>We considered it essential to recommend tax incentives which would encourage a mix of developers and users on to the site and ensure its eventual development along the lines mentioned in the development brief.  In particular, we found it necessary to recommend tax incentives, at least on a par with those already available for industrial property, to builders and owner occupiers of commercial, retail and other non-industrial property on the site.  We also considered <Col N="2224" /> it important to give incentives to encourage the building of residential accommodation on the site and we considered that incentives would be needed to generate initial demand for retail and other commercial space on the site and to encourage a wide range of uses in accordance with the development brief.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the possible development of the site with financial institutions and developers.  There was general agreement among these institutions and developers that the site, by virtue of size and location, was one of immense national, civic and social importance but if left solely to market forces no development would take place on the site for the next ten years at least. The view also was that unless the site was given some particular status, with significant tax advantages for investors/developers, it would remain in its present state for many years to come.</P>
    <P>They also considered that an advantageous taxation package would be a significant factor in attracting developers to the site and hence overcoming the perceived reluctance of builders at present to become involved in projects unless there is a pre-building commitment to occupation of premises.  They also stated that the commonly held view was that the sheer size of the site would act as a deterrent to development.  It was thought that this would need to be counteracted not only by tax incentives, but by the appointment of some type of statutory body which would have the specific task of overseeing development of the site.</P>
    <P>The working party decided therefore to recommend in their report that tax incentives should form the basis of a flexible basket of incentives to achieve the desired type of development on the site.  The working party also considered the possibility that tax incentives would merely divert investment from other areas on to the site.  To the extent that this might be true, the working party feel that diversion is justified by the particular circumstances surrounding the site and the perceived disadvantage of the <Col N="2225" /> location.  However, on the basis of their discussions with investors, we were confident that a substantial proportion of development on the site could be in the form of new investment, either through the attraction of new money from abroad or through encouraging Irish investors to invest new money in the site.</P>
    <P>The working party also accepted the view that a statutory body to direct and control development of the site would be essential to ensure that development is brought forward and regulated in accordance with the development brief.  In addition a statutory body would devote their expertise and efforts to ensuring that suitable developments are brought forward in the shortest time possible.  The working party also recommended that the new statutory body should be required to prepare an overall planning scheme, for the site, based on the set of principles drawn up by us and having regard to the provisions of the development plan of Dublin Corporation.  We also recommended that the Corporation should be consulted in the preparation of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>We also considered the planning scheme should be flexible.  Joint ventures with State or semi-State participation should not be ruled out as long as the overall objectives are met within the predetermined time scale.  Flexibility, inventiveness and variety should be paramount.  Given an overall design brief no user should be seen as excluding others &mdash; offices, civic buildings, recreation facilities, housing and high-tech buildings should be able to exist side by side and create new employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>Virtually all new housing accommodation provided to date in the Dublin 1 postal district is local authority housing.  The working party considered that the development of the Custom House docks site offers an opportunity to set about rectifying the imbalance in the provision of residential accommodation by attracting private residential investment to the site.  The tax incentives recommended by the working party include specific incentives to encourage housing and the working party was confident that implementation of a positive policy of encouraging a residential social mix would facilitate the regeneration of the north inner city and other deprived areas along the docks and quays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin, of course, is no different from many other major cities in being faced with problems arising from the need to regenerate dockland areas. Representatives of the working party visited London to study the action taken to promote the regeneration of its docklands. The work of the Greater London Council in relation to St. Katherine's Docks &mdash; 37 acres &mdash; and of the London Docks Development Corporation was examined.  Though resources to deal with the problems are obviously available on a much larger scale in Britain, the scale of the problems is also much greater. Measures taken in both the dockland areas visited are broadly similar to those proposed by the working party in relation to the Custom House Docks site, including special taxation measures, exemptions from rates and modified planning controls in accordance with special development schemes.  While problems of the nature and scale being addressed in London do not exist in Dublin the rapid progress which has been made in a relatively short time in developing the hitherto derelict areas of London also indicate the benefits of a single purpose authority established to tackle a problem for which the normal operation of the market or normal public policy measures are either inadequate or unsuitable.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that the Government accepted the working party's recommendations and as Deputies will be aware announced the following main measures to bring about the redevelopment of the site:</P>
      <P>(a)  The establishment of a special statutory authority with planning functions to acquire the site and to direct and control its redevelopment;</P>
      <P>(b) The provision of a range of financial incentives to attract developers and occupiers to the site; the incentives to be provided are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) 100 per cent capital allowance for non-industrial buildings;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2229" /> (ii) &ldquo;Section 23-type&rdquo; allowance for owners of residential property on the site;</P>
    <P>(iii) Double rent allowance for traders to be offset against taxation; and</P>
    <P>(iv) Rates remission for ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also intended that a Bill providing for the establishment of the statutory authority will be presented as soon as possible to ensure that the redevelopment of the site can be promoted and got under way as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government have also recognised that the principles underlying the approach to the Custom House Docks site are also relevant in relation to a number of depressed inner city areas. Experience has shown that the normal operation of the property market has been painfully slow in bringing about the redevelopment of run-down inner city areas and all the evidence is that the situation would get worse unless a positive effort is made to redress the situation. Obviously, this is a situation which could not be allowed to continue undisturbed. The inner areas of the major urban centres represent a very valuable resource in terms of infrastructure and urban amenities, public buildings and social, business and commercial centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although local authority housing and other amenities of a very high standard are being provided in the inner urban areas, especially in Dublin, efforts to encourage private housing in development in such areas has had little or no effect.  Accordingly the Government decided that intervention was required and, as a first step, that a certain number of areas should be designated in the inner areas of the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick in which redevelopment would be promoted by means of special incentives. The specific areas to be designated have yet to be precisely defined but an announcement in this regard will be made in the very near future following consultations <Col N="2230" /> which are already taking place with the relevant local authorities.  It is envisaged that one area will be designated in each of the cities of Cork and Limerick and two areas in Dublin city. In Dublin we will be designating an area along the north and south quays and an area in the north inner city around Mountjoy Square.</P>
    <P>The following range of incentives will be made available in respect of these designated areas: section 23-type allowances for residential property, double rent allowance offset against tax, rates relief and &mdash; reverting to what I have been saying in an endeavour to regenerate and achieve a better social mix within our inner cities, particularly within the inner city of Dublin &mdash; a new 5 per cent allowance on the purchase price of private dwellings which will apply every year for ten years.  Therefore, on a £40,000 house a purchaser can set off £20,000 a year against tax on top of all the other new house grants, mortgage subsidies and reliefs.  That is a clear indication of the concern of this Government.  We are not merely paying lip service to this; we are serious about getting on with the development.</P>

      <P>However, I can understand his frustrations.  This work is progressing, <Col N="2232" /> the redevelopment of our city, not just on that site but on the quays, to deal with the dereliction of our quays, also very important, and the dereliction in areas of Limerick and Cork.  That is a very positive and forthright proposal.  I am happy to say it will go ahead because we are giving the necessary types of incentives.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to the regeneration of the quays and dock area, and I stress this, cannot be questioned because the proposals are there and are positive ones.  The Bill will come before the House shortly.  The measures announced for the Custom House docks site, for the designation of the areas along the quays, are further evidence of the Government's commitment to Dublin inner city and its docklands, a firm commitment laid before the House.  The Government are fully aware that the Custom House docks site is of key importance to the regeneration of the docks and of the north inner city and Dublin generally.  I am confident that the package of proposals announced by the Taoiseach will render the site and Dublin inner city area a very attractive place for private investors to invest their money.</P>
      <P>I am confident also that this will mean that a real start can be made, a positive start &mdash; the end of the political gimmickry that has obtained about this site for too long &mdash; towards the regeneration of the docklands, the north inner city and other deprived areas.  It will not be at the behest of one individual who was going around peddling his vote.  When developed, the north inner city and other deprived areas in the docklands will add tremendous prestige to our capital city.  We in this House have an obligation to ensure that it is revitalised and regenerated.  Along with that &mdash; I might throw this in although it may not be directly relevant but by way of passing reference &mdash; there will be the grants for home improvements, particulary for pre-1940 houses which is another example &mdash;&mdash;</P>

We do not intend that these will be delayed in any way, whether pre-1940 or post 1940; we intend that the structural grant system will move ahead as will the redevelopment of our inner cities and the major urban areas.</P>
      <P>What I have said here this evening demonstrates the clear commitment of this Government to doing something positive for a site that has laid dormant for too long and has acted like a dead hand on that part of our city.  I know the Opposition have an interest in this site as well, particularly Deputies from the area.  I hope that we can work hand in hand on this project because the city is not the prerogative of one side of the House only.  Our capital city is the prerogative of all Members and I am prepared to listen to any constructive suggestions as to how things should be done.  We claim the credit for this project because, although it took time to talk to the various bodies to ensure that we got an agreement, it is a package which is saleable and attractive.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State knows the official who was dealing with it.  He is an excellent official and he worked on the Custom House site also. The Minister is well aware of that.  Work on those two areas would have taken the pressure off Dublin Corporation.  An <i>ad hoc</i> commission would have been set up to get the work done expeditiously, to cut through the red tape and to encourage private enterprise into these areas.  Tax incentives could have been given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only way open to the Government is to start work on a Bill dealing with the development of the urban areas.  Regrettably, in many instances our local authorities have failed.  I know it is customary to compliment local authorities and to say what wonderful work Dublin Corporation and other urban authorities are doing.  I challenge the effectiveness of local authorities. They are stretched to the limit. Lamentably, there are many examples of where they have failed.  I have put on record on a previous occasion my absolute distaste of what happened at Wood Quay.  It was a poignant example yet again of the failure of the local authority to develop properly when so many other sites were available at the time.  There are other examples in Cork and Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about Mountjoy Square and the quays.  There is no point in dealing with this matter in a piecemeal fashion.  The only systematic way is to do the work through a development agency. When Deputy Wilson turned on the heat in an effort to have something done about a site it was jumped on by the Government. That is not the answer.  Work must be done in an organised ongoing way, <Col N="2238" /> where an area is designated and work is done and then work is started on the next site in the city.</P>
    <P>I expect that the Minister will at least agree with the motion put forward by Deputy Wilson.  He is a family man.  I do not know if he is aware of the crushing effect emigration is having on our city.  It is now impossible to get employment in the inner city.  In the area I represent there is 55 per cent youth unemployment on the south side of the river.</P>

      <P>I thought the chickens would come home to roost in this case but I did not think it would happen within 24 hours.  In the Minister's speech last night there was a statement of intent. There was a reference to the Minister for Finance, about preparations for the next budget and the Finance Bill.  I missed the speech of the Minister of State but I detect from the manner in which the exchanges are going on here that there will be no follow-through, as he indicated in one of his interruptions last night.</P>
      <P>I want to commend Deputy Wilson, our party spokesman, for tabling a motion on such an important and indeed vitally urgent issue as the development of the port of Dublin as well as the dockland area and the inner city area adjacent to it.  I would like to read again into the record of the House the text of that motion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to publish a detailed plan for the development of the Port of Dublin, to attract back lost business and to revitalise the undeveloped dockland area for industrial, commercial, housing and leisure activities.</P>
    <P>It should be said at the outset that it is sad that this motion should be necessary at all.  Dublin is the capital city of the country and as such its port and immediate hinterland should have had over the decades, the kind of development to take on the demands of industry and of export and import which arose with the widening and expansion of trade from Ireland to Europe and many other parts of the world.  To uphold authority with the ability, the capacity and the willingness to take on these challenges, together with appropriate and balanced developments on site, would have been a vital element in this evolution.</P>
    <P>Another aspect would have involved the imaginative and ongoing rejuvenation of the dockland area itself for wide-ranging uses including houses and leisure, industrial and commercial purposes to have ensured that inner city Dublin would have remained alive and a vibrant place balanced in terms of its needs and capable of providing the kind of efficient service and economic and social environments by way of proper social mix which would have established Dublin port on a par with many other busy and attractive ports and docklands around the world.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, what we have experienced in Dublin over recent decades has led to much dereliction, decay and abandonment of many of the services that in the past were available in this port area. There has been considerable unemployment, inefficiency and a serious loss of business to other ports around the country. Industrial unrest has cost huge losses to many firms and businesses who through loyalty to the port that had served them in the past continued to trade through it in very difficult times.  This most unsatisfactory scenario simply cannot be tolerated any longer.  To continue <Col N="2240" /> to do so would be irresponsible and would permit the final dismantling of the entire port service within a relatively short period.  Very serious and important decisions have to be taken.  The nettle has to be grasped firmly and finally, and the disastrous situation which now obtains has to be reversed urgently.</P>
    <P>This port is more than 100 years old. Over the decades it has had tremendous affinity for people of Dublin city, particularly northsiders. A brief look at the history of that period shows a sad transformation from the busy port with high employment occupying a very significant position in the commercial life of the country.  Because of its geographical position, and given an adequate amount of good will, co-operation and imaginative initiatives it should have gone on to evolve and develop greater business and traffic as well as the promotion of other ancillary services around the city dependent on the port and its business.  Many factors, however, some outside the scope of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, militated against that development.  The board, perhaps through their composition as well as other factors, were unable to take on the challenges that were presented, and found themselves in recent years losing large sums of money on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>The addition of Dublin Cargo Handling to the scene did not enhance the prospects.  Various charges and allegations were made from time to time about vested interests wielding too much power, but certainly in hindsight it is easy to see that what the board and dockland area in general lacked was a firm, efficient, statutory board properly accountable and capable of taking on the various areas of dispute and weakness as well as putting forward imaginative, realistic and feasible proposals for a balanced programme of development in the area.</P>
    <P>One of the saddest features in recent years in relation to problems in Dublin port have been industrial stoppages.  I do not think it is over-stating it to say that this problem contributed very largely <Col N="2241" /> towards the loss of trade, and I have heard on numerous occasions accounts from users of the port, both exporters and importers, of their most unsatisfactory experiences due to these stoppages.  A number of companies on the north-eastern side of the city had to close down because of serious financial losses.  Others had to trim down operations while some will still tell you that even today they are suffering the effects of a number of these disputes.  Many were discouraged away from the port, which they had used for years, and found that despite the travelling involved up country or down country it was far more preferable and feasible to avail of the services at other ports with less difficultes and problems.  It certainly seemed to make more sense to rely on ports where there was less unrest and more continuity of service, and therefore more reliability.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this is the rise in costs in Dublin port.  Many traders felt it was simply not feasible to continue to operate the port at these costs.  They sought cheaper alternatives and found that these alternatives were more satisfactory all round.  These developments are reflected in the traffic trends through the port <i>vis-à-vis</i> other ports over the last four to five years.  During that time Dublin port has been taking a very serious bashing in terms of the fall off in trade while Arklow, Rosslare, Drogheda, Cork and other places benefited very favourably and substantially during the same period.  There is a very important lesson here and indeed it presents a sad indictment of the inability of the authorities of Dublin port to grapple with the various problems.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the large area of dockland which is seriously under-utilised, areas of which have almost been laid waste in recent years, are other products of this problem.  As recently as last Sunday when inspecting that area, although having been aware of the problem, I found it incredible that large areas of dockland are no longer in use or are seriously under-utilised.</P>
    <P>Dublin and its hinterland need Dublin <Col N="2242" /> port, a developed, modern, efficient port with a mix between industrial, commercial and housing projects as well as social amenities, so as to give vibrancy and regeneration to an inner city fraught with high unemployment, rising crime and acute disillusionment among its inhabitants, and even more important, to provide a major bulwark for industrial and commercial development into and out of the city.</P>
    <P>Given this kind of background it is essential that this House takes serious steps to reverse the rising tide.  The initiative must come from here so that all the powers necessary to an authority with the will and commitment to take on the enormous task will be afforded adequately.  In 1979 an inter-departmental committee on Dublin inner city reported and made very strong recommendations in relation to the urgent need for provisions for this area.  The Fianna Fáil Government of 1982 published two Bills in relation to the area.  They were referred to by Deputy Wilson last night, namely, the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, and the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill, 1982.  I might refer briefly to the Urban Development Areas Bill, 1982, and the explanatory memorandum of the time.  The main purposes of the Bill were defined as:</P>
    <P>1.  To provide for the establishment of Urban Development Commissions, to secure the regeneration of designated urban areas</P>
    <P>2.  To designate the Custom House Dock site in Dublin and the area covered by the medevial wall city of Dublin as urban development areas.</P>
    <P>3.  To provide for the establishment of Custom House/Docks Development Commission and the Dublin Walled City Development Commission</P>
    <P>4.  To empower the Minister to designate other areas as urban development areas and to establish commissions in respect of such areas, if he is satisfied that there is <Col N="2243" /> a special need for the regeneration of the areas.  Considerable functions were been given within the context of this Bill to enable a serious, determined and comprehensive plan to be put in operation for the restoration and revitalisation of this part of our capital city.</P>
    <P>No. 4 actually referred to the provision that it should be &ldquo;The general duty of an urban development commission to secure the overall regeneration of it's functional area and specified the functions to be performed for that purpose.  It went on to give powers to the commission that may acquire whole and managed land for development either by itself or by others, and to prepare and implement or secure the implementation of schemes for the redevelopment or renewal of land&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It also stated that a balance should be maintained &ldquo;as between housing, industrial, commercial, social amenity and other development&rdquo;.  Section 8 of that Bill enabled the Minister by auditor to transfer land situated within the Custom House/Docks area from the Dublin Port and Docks Board to the Custom House/Docks Development Commission. There were many other powers and its overall direction was wide-ranging.</P>
    <P>It was followed by the Dublin Inner City Authority Bill of 1982 the object of which was, as per its explanatory memorandum at the time, to establish &ldquo;a Dublin Inner City Development Authority to coordinate and supplement the work of the variety of agencies affecting the Dublin Inner City area and to provide assistance by way of grants, loans or otherwise for inner city projects&rdquo;.  Section 4 of that Bill provided among other things for &ldquo;the coordination of investment in the area and of the programmes and other activities of statutory bodies.  The Bill provided for the encouragement of &ldquo;physical economics, social and cultural development in the area, the preservation and development of amenities and the improvement of the security of persons and property in the area&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> Those two Bills were a very serious, genuine and comprehensive start by the then Fianna Fáil Government to address and come to grips with the very serious problem of the inner city and docks area as well as the port.  However, regrettably at the time, they were greeted with cries from members of the major party now in Government as being a deal, as being spurious, as being nothing but an attempt to secure votes both here and outside the Dáil.</P>
    <P>No serious, honest or realistic analysis was done on the proposals at the time.  It was imputed that they reflected political expediency.  My implication, therefore, is that the main Opposition party at the time did not see the need for such a programme, referred to then in disparaging terms as the &ldquo;Gregory deal&rdquo; among others, and indeed when the Minister was responding to this aspect last night his attempts to explain his party's position on this situation were feeble, to say the least, further confirming the view that the Opposition of the day had no serious policy in relation to Dublin port.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that when, as Deputy Wilson explained, he put down the motion for Private Members' Business in relation to this area, the Taoiseach should hurriedly come before the Dáil to preempt a discussion or analysis of the plight or blight of Dublin's inner city.  The 1979 report, the Urban Development Areas Bill of 1982 and the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill of 1982 were left on the shelf, ignored, forgotten about.  There was simply no interest there nor was there any serious commitment.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not regret in the least the Government coming forward with proposals and utterances for huge multi-million pound packages for this area of Dublin city.  On the contrary, if the Government are serious in their attempts to come to grips with this problem they can be assured of our full support.  We are aware of the urgency of the situation, we are aware of under-utilisation of the port, of the serious fall off of its business, of the serious denuding of the residential area of the inner city, of <Col N="2245" /> the rapid bulge created in Dublin through the construction of towns on its perimeter. This has given a very lopsided, unbalanced development over recent years.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wilson that an institute or authority should be established for the development of the port which would have planning powers to cut through many of the delays that would inevitably arise in decision making and to enable the commencement of development to get under way without undue delay.  Another essential ingredient which Deputy Wilson referred to, which has been part of Fianna Fáil policy, related to support by way of incentives for investment in construction and particularly the capital allowance for non-industrial buildings.</P>
    <P>These, to me, are some of the vital ways in which this problem should be tackled.  Nobody is suggesting that the situation can be transformed over-night, but with realistic and attractive measures much can be achieved to reverse a most unfavourable trend within a reasonably short period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the tone of some of the speakers in this debate.  I was in the Public Gallery here after the general election in which Fianna Fáil were returned to power without a majority with the assistance of The Workers' Party and Deputy Gregory.  I was here when Deputy Gregory put on the record the full details of his deal with the incoming Fianna Fáil Government. The Deputy outlined his proposals very clearly on that occasion.  Someone in the House asked what about the rest of the country but that interjection was followed by laughter because the whole country was ignored with the exception of Dublin.  Fianna Fáil were concentrating on Dublin because they had to comply with the terms laid down by Deputy Gregory in return for his support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Dubliner I have been saddened by what has been happening in our city for some years past.  The measure before the House should be welcomed by all parties because the city has become very derelict.  I welcome the Government's <Col N="2246" /> proposals to develop the 27 acre dock site and also to undertake the refurbishing of designated areas of the inner city especially along the quays.  We can say proudly that we in Dublin have one of the best housing records of any European city but, apart from that achievement, there is much to be desired.  There are large tracts of land on either side of the canals which have been left unattended. Mainly they have been zoned for commercial and industrial use but unfortunately there has not been much demand for that kind of land.  Unless the necessary incentives are available to encourage the private developer to avail of these sites, they will remain as they are.</P>
    <P>However, the Government are redressing the situation and are giving these very generous incentives in respect of the development of the docks site and also of the development of the quays site.  My only regret is that they have not given the same kind of incentive in relation to the development of the quays as they have given in respect of the Custom House dock site because without the proper incentives these sites will remain undeveloped. The ERDO report was published recently and has attracted a good deal of criticism but I regard it as a very good study.  Politicians must recognise that, unless we take drastic steps to develop the inner city, the result will be as outlined in that report.  When the officials who drew up the report spoke to us recently in Dublin Corporation they said that what is outlined in the report will happen unless the ground rules are changed.  In this case the ground rules involve investment by the Government by way of tax incentives to developers to encourage them to develop the sites.</P>
    <P>We can only hope that this will happen in the near future.  Since I have come to this House I have heard the Opposition decry the lack of incentives for the building industry, but what better incentives could we provide for that industry than those being provided in this measure and by way of the house improvement grants announced recently?  These steps will provide immediate employment in the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2247" /> There will be an independent planning authority in respect of the docks site.  This will eliminate the dependency on Dublin Corporation and the delays that result from third party appeals and so on which can hold up development for years.</P>

      <P>First I should like to refer to a reference to me in the House last evening when the Minister said that my interventions in the various debates on the port site were most unhelpful and did not contribute to an early conclusion of the port dispute.  He prefaced his remarks by saying that, while he liked me, he had to refer to these continuous interventions on my part both in the House and in the media.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That intervention from the Minister came during a very constructive debate on a motion tabled by Deputy Wilson.  However, the Minister is right in so far as that throughout the year I continually questioned the handling by the Department of Communications of what was happening in regard to the port site and particularly the various discussions that were on-going with the Dublin Port and Docks Board in relation to Dublin Cargo Handling, Limited and other matters concerning the deep sea section of Dublin port.  What the Minister had to say last night in regard to me was almost a direct quotation from his contribution to the Estimate debate.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that Labour Court recommendation &mdash; No. 9804, Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the Marine Port and General Workers Union &mdash; was to be presented to the workers at a meeting during the month of June.  The recommendation was considered by the No. 2 branch who decided not to have a vote on it.  As a result, Dublin Cargo Handling, Limited issued lay-off notices and stated that the port would close.  It was to have closed from June 12 but the date was extended later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of private notice questions on several dates during June when we were <Col N="2248" /> approaching the summer recess both Deputy Wilson and I asked the Minister for Communications the steps he proposed to take as a matter of urgency to prevent the threatened indefinite closure of the deep sea section of Dublin port. Our interventions changed the Minister's decision and the port was not closed.  Our last question in that regard was on 27 June and both it and the reply are to be found in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The argument I advanced continually related to the Minister asking that the marine port workers should reduce the staff of 120.  We were grateful for the Minister's interjection last evening because it gave Deputy Wilson the opportunity to put right something the Minister had distorted.  What the Minister was doing in seeking the reduction in the workforce was asking fathers to vote sons out of jobs and sons to vote fathers out of jobs as anyone with a knowledge of dockland and its traditions anywhere in the country will appreciate.  I met the workers and talked to their shop stewards and I appealed to the Minister to consider the difficulty in which the workers found themselves and to try to find some means of renegotiation.  The Minister said I was unhelpful and according to him last night I am still unhelpful.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party I am sure you, Sir, will be pleased to note that two months later the Minister had to arrive at an agreement and that that agreement involved precisely what I had been seeking, that people who did not wish to lose their jobs would not have to lose them.  Instead of the 120 workers the Minister had been talking about the figure is 160, and they work a roster system which involves working three days out of four.  I am not claiming to have saved 40 jobs but I highlighted a real fear in Dublin port.  I did not mind the Minister accusing me when he did not understand the position last June, but when he comes back into this House several months later saying that I am being unhelpful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Aherne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is a total abuse of the system.  He should check his records and withdraw the allegations he made last night.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion.  For a long time it has been the policy of Fianna Fáil, and it is now policy of the Coalition Government, to examine the port area of Dublin, and other areas.  We consider the port of Dublin is a vitally important part of the commercial life of the city.  It has great potential economically and the hinterland provides very important commercial services and is a source of business potential, wealth and employment for the capital.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Inner City Interdepartmental Committee recommendations of 1979 spell out Fianna Fáil policy.  It is important to point out that this was long before the 1982 election.  That document set out what we considered should happen in Dublin, the special tax incentives which should be given to try to overcome the urban blight and to develop the inner city.  There are about 70 recommendations in this report.  It recommended that the inner city should be identified as a priority area by the various Government Departments in giving selective treatment in such matters as grants.  The report went on to spell out the potential for jobs.  The first page of the report stated that they favoured the maintenance of a residential community within the inner city, that the city's multi-functional role would be enhanced by the existence of a residential community within the city, that the inner city had a substantial economic base both commercial and industrial which was dependent on the residential community to a certain degree and they mentioned a great many other points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were out of office shortly afterwards but we came back in 1982 and a deal was made, as everybody knows, but that policy was laid down in 1978-79.  We were only ten months in power.  I was Whip at the time and I remember two Bills created massive difficulties in 1982 &mdash; the Finance Bill and the Urban Development Bill.  These Bills were linked to policies Fianna Fáil had already laid <Col N="2250" /> down and we put them to Deputy Gregory during the election, as did the present Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald.  We were ridiculed, criticised and attacked. We were told this was a disastrous thing to do.</P>
    <P>As reported in the Official Report at column 944, 2 June 1982, during the Second Stage debate on the Urban Development Bill, the present Minister for Labour, then Deputy Quinn, said:</P>
    <P>There is no such assurance in the Bill.  There are no such powers to allow of third party intervention &mdash; consultations certainly, that is a new phase in the eighties.  You can consider and consult but at the end of the day the Minister, not An Bord Pleanála, will decide.  These are retrospective, antidemocratic steps that push back gains which were made over the last ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to see the port developed and as spokesman for Labour I want to make a few points about the statement made by the Minister for State at his press conference, and I particularly want to tell the Minister something he can do quickly.  As regards B &amp; I restructuring, the Minister was talking about making progress but, when Deputy Wilson asked what he was going to do about the port or how he was going to develop it, he said he was going to abolish the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  I do not know if that will prove helpful but the Minister seems convinced that he will secure the port, develop it and give employment by abolishing the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The B &amp; I board, who are answerable to that Minister, are creating problems in the port.  Instead of trying to answer this motion and help us to overcome these difficulties the Minister is creating problems. It is appreciated that the B &amp; I proposals do not involve the transfer of passengers and cars to Dún Laoghaire, but a considerable number of commercial vehicles are at present carried on B &amp; I car ferries and it is believed that more <Col N="2251" /> vehicles will be diverted from the roll-on, roll-off freight vessels to car ferries.  The transfer of the B &amp; I's car ferry services to Dún Laoghaire will have a very serious effect on the port's finances &mdash; a loss of tonnage in goods, dues up to £1 million in costs at today's prices, a potential loss of £800,000 per annum with the future imposition of passenger charges, and perhaps also a reduction in the return on investments by the provision of additional facilities as a result of B &amp; I's demand for improvements to car ferry terminals in the last 12 months.  A sum of £120,000 was spent in the last 12 months by the board.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to evaluate the impact of the transfer of the car services and the investment of £7 million which the board have made for the provision of a new roll-on roll-off riverside berth.  This additional facility was demanded by the B &amp; I some time ago and it is probable that some jobs will be lost as a result of the B &amp; I pull out.  In connection with the Sealink roll-on roll-off into the B &amp; I Dublin Ferry Port, there is also concern.  The press release says that agreement has been reached with Sealink which will ensure that their new roll-on roll-off vessels will operate in the B &amp; I Dublin Ferry Port. Neither B &amp; I nor Sealink have even yet discussed the proposals with the board's officials.  It is believed that Sealink are planning their lift-on lift-off service into Dublin by a roll-on roll-off service.  All these problems can mean a loss of tonnage into Dublin.  Dublin would then be left without a cross channel lift-on lift-off service and it is more than probable that other ports would pick up the trade.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the suitability of Dún Laoghaire.  A certain limit was set in 1977.  Has the Minister for Communications considered all these matters?  Does he care about them?  Is he saying that the only solution is to change a few things here or there, privatising B &amp; I, as he did with Irish Shipping, and so on.  What protection is there for the workers?  Last night the Minister said he would abolish the board and that he had additional legislative proposals to bring <Col N="2252" /> before the House &mdash; he said it would not be a full Bill.  He said he would disband the Port and Docks Board and bring in a Dublin Ports Authority under a harbour Bill.  What protection is there for the staff?  What guarantees have they as regards pension rights?  When will we know about all these matters?  Will these problems be resolved by the stroke of a pen, as happened with Irish Shipping? Nobody could be blamed for the suspicions we harbour about the Minister, Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>As regards the customs dock site, we welcome this because it is a direct cog from the Urban Development Bill.  The Urban Development Bill, 1982, now becomes the special development Bill, 1985.  That is the only difference.  We welcome the incentives which we started in 1978 and the fact that there are ongoing discussions.  Putting in office and commercial developments of 650,000 sq. ft. and other developments is totally against the proposals set out in 1978 which I have already quoted and which would put life into this city.  The figures mentioned by the Minister follow the eastern regional development report which states that by the year 2011 Dublin city will be dead and that people will live in Meath, Kildare and everywhere else.  If the Minister is going to go ahead with our policy at least he could follow the one good bit to make Dublin a living city, by giving residential amenities which would give a balance and he should not ignore and exclude the few good bits.  The Urban Development Authority Bill was designed to revitalise the city and the Minister has now decided to implement that Bill, excluding the residential development. The Taoiseach said this morning on the Order of Business that it will be next year before there are proposals on this.  Will the Minister spend the next six weeks ensuring that the Fianna Fáil policy which he has picked up and decided to implement, which was brought in on the first day of the Dáil to save their skins, will at least be brought in correctly?  Will the Taoiseach also try to control the Minister for Communications and stop him doing further <Col N="2253" /> damage to Dublin port?  The Minister has wrecked it enough; he is a destructive individual as far as Dublin port is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Seamus Kirk has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of a question submitted by him yesterday for Private Notice.  He has eight minutes and the Minister has four.  I ask Deputies who want to leave the House to leave now and leave quietly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for giving me permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the take-over of Dundalk Milk Products by Tír Laighean, the financial package involved and the long term implications for the plant and for the 70 strong workforce in Dundalk.  Dundalk Milk Products have approximately 90 odd suppliers.  In recent times the company have been taken over by the Tír Laighean co-operative group. The financial package of the takeover involved the raising of £800,000 by the deduction of 5p per gallon from each supplier over the next four years.  The implications of this reduction for many of the suppliers to Dundalk Milk Products are very serious indeed.  We are talking about a deduction being made when the agricultural industry was never in a worse state in the matter of cash flow and when farmer borrowing is at a level that simply does not allow suppliers to plants like Dundalk Milk Products to make the sacrifices they are being asked to make in this package.</P>
      <P>A figure of £800,000 over four years means that £200,000 per year will be taken out of the milk cheques of suppliers, large, medium and small, in the general vicinity of Dundalk.  The 70 employees are very worried about their position.  Legitimately they are asking if DMP Limited will be turned into a mere depot and their services dispensed with, with the result that more wage packets will be taken out of circulation in the town.</P>
      <P>Dundalk has been devastated in recent times.  It is an economic wasteland.  No later than today we got word of a further closure with a receiver moving into S. &amp; S. It is in that context that I ask the house to consider the implications for DMP, their employees and farmers as a result of the takeover.  We must bear in mind their ability to meet financial commitments entered into with a view to expanding their dairy herds.  Those commitments will run for many years and many small or medium sized farmers are unable to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To complicate the matter further we have the spectre of other co-ops selling <Col N="2257" /> their subsidised milk in Dundlak.  Various attractions have been offered to retail outlets to sell milk in the town.  That is creating further problems for DMP.  The position in regard to milk sales in the town is chaotic.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the implications of the take-over and the unsatisfactory set up in regard to retail sale arrangements in the town.  I appeal to him to have regard to the implications for the 70 people employed by DMP.  It is appropriate that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism should be in the House to reply to the debate because we are referring to a town that has been devastated in recent years.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some hope to the people of Dundalk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Ministry for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) Ministry for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)">
      <NameTxt>Ministry for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposals on the part of the owners of Dundalk dairies to make any of their workers redundant which appears to be the concern expressed by Deputy Kirk.  The position in regard to any deduction from the milk price is essentially an internal matter between the co-operative, who are owned by farmers, and their suppliers.  I do not see that it is really a matter for the House and I do not quite understand what the Deputy wants me to do about it.  I know that concern has been expresed by him about what he described as the subsidisation of milk sales in the area by milk co-ops from outside the area.  Presumably, this refers to the intense competition that exists between co-ops for the business of the large supermarket outlets which still only represent a relatively small proportion of the total retail sales of milk. They are the most mobile sector as between the different suppliers and, therefore, have tended to attract a high degree of marginal pricing on the part of suppliers with a view to gaining the upper <Col N="2258" /> hand in the market.  This is normal commercial practice and, certainly, there are problems associated with it.</P>
      <P>If there is any suggestion that the trading is unfair or that individual supermarkets are taking oppressive advantage of their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the co-operatives supplying them, there is of course the possibility that those who feel they are adversely affected can make a complaint to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices who will take action under the code under which his office is established.  It is true that I approved the take-over of Premier Dairies, of which the Dundalk dairies is a part, by the Tír Laighean Co-operative. It was not a take-over that was in any way contrary to the criteria in the mergers Act under which I might have decided to refuse it.  Indeed, the take-over by the co-operative representing suppliers of the means whereby their supplies are distributed seems to me to be a logical economic development giving greater integration and responsiveness right through to the market from the initial supply source.</P>
      <P>It has been part of a problem in Irish agriculture that farm level supply is insufficiently integrated with and sensitive to the needs of the market place, at the supermarkets and the doorsteps of Ireland.  Any financial or commercial arrangement that facilitates closer liaison between the farm and the consumer is not something that one could or should object to.  I am not quite sure why the Deputy raised the matter here or what he expects me to say about it, but, perhaps, if he had put down a parliamentary question it might have been possible to elicit more clearly what he was on about than is possible in a debate of this kind where both of us may speak only once.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 November 1985.</P>

      <P>Salmon drift net licences are issued annually by the regional fisheries boards under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1980, as amended by the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1982.  I am aware that in some instances the fisheries boards experience difficulty in allocating licences in accordance with the requirements of the orders and accordingly I am having the relevant orders reviewed by my Department in consultation with the Central Fisheries Board with a view to developing a more simplified procedure for licence allocation.</P>

      <P>The maintenance of employment in the saw-milling sector is governed by a number of factors including the industry's ability to market its products successfully.  I am mainly concerned with the supply of sawlog to the industry and in that connection I am placing all available sawlog on the market but it must be borne in mind that the capacity of the saw-milling industry is much greater than the total national supply of sawlog available.

This committee drew up proposals in regard to licencing and quotas which operated for the <Col N="2108" /> fishery in 1985.  The main features of these arrangements were as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Fishing for herring in the area was only allowed under a licence on a daily basis.</P>

To that end they operate a comprehensive forest protection programme against fire hazards.  The various fire prevention and control measures at each forest centre are kept under continuous review and supplementary precautions are introduced when necessary.

      <P>By early 1985 the Passport Office, which is the part of my Department most relevant in this respect, had achieved the target of having only bilingual forms, so that Irish was equally available with English to those who wished to use it, side by side on the same forms.  All, or virtually all, of the form letters in use by the Pasport Office are also in bilingual form.</P>
      <P>Many of the forms used by consular section are now also, or will be before the end of 1985, bilingual.  I hope to have this proces continued until, as far as posible, all forms issued by my Department for use by the public for domestic purposes in any significant quantity will be bilingual.  I have instructed that the Irish (as well as the English) in such forms be simple and clear, and as far as possible should avoid over-official language.</P>
      <P>The outline targets of my Department for 1984 and 1985 under the Action Plan for Irish 1983-86 are to be found in the annex to the most recent annual progress report published by Bord na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Road grant assistance towards the cost of works on county roads is comprised mainly in the block grant which, in the case of county councils, supplements the provision made by the councils from their own resources for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, for improvement works on county roads, and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The disposition of the block grant including the extent, if any, to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads is a matter entirely for each council.  In accordance with established practice under successive Governments, State grants are not provided for maintenance works on county roads.  Expenditure under this heading falls to be financed from the local authorities' own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1981 Limerick County Council has benefited from funds provided for the improvement of county roads under the EC western package.  Prior to this year these funds were notified as part of the block grant.  The council has also received a number of specific grants for the <Col N="2120" /> improvement of county roads in the period since 1975.  Details of these grants are set out in the statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The wreck of <i>The Bardini Reefer</i> would appear to have been abandoned by its owners and their insurers who have made no attempt to salvage it. In the circumstances there are no statutory powers under which I, as Minister for Communications, can remove the wreck nor are there any funds at my disposal to meet the expenditure involved in such removal.  The Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, however, empowers a harbour or conservancy authority to remove a wreck from within its area of jurisdiction if the wreck is considered an obstruction or danger to navigation.  The Commissioners of Irish Lights are similarly empowered in respect of wreck in Irish waters where there is no harbour authority with appropriate jurisdiction.  There is a dispute at present as to whether the responsibility for the removal of the wreck of <i>The Bardini Reefer</i> rests with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, as the harbour authority for Castletownbere Harbour, or with the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  I have been asked to determine the question under section 533 of the 1984 Act.  I am considering the matter at present in conjunction with the Attorney General's office and the parties concerned.  In order to <Col N="2133" /> minimise any danger to shipping pending the removal of <i>The Bardini Reefer</i> the Commissioners of Irish Lights have marked the wreck with a buoy.</P>

      <P>The profit from the farm in this case was estimated at £3,000 per annum and the person concerned was deemed to enjoy two-fifths of that income, that is £1,200 per annum or £23.07 weekly.</P>
      <P>In addition, the person concerned had a small amount of capital which was calculated to have a weekly value of 18p. The total means assessed against him, therefore, amounted to £23.25 weekly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £8.50, being the appropriate rate in his <Col N="2144" /> case of £31.75 less means of £23.25. Weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

The firm was informed of <Col N="2146" /> the decision and the reason for disallowance in all cases.  An appeal was received in one case in 1981 and the appeals officer confirmed the original decision in respect of the claims concerned with the exception of those in stoppages which occurred on four dates in December 1977 involving a total of £367.16.

(3) Special efforts are being made to improve the services available to members of the public who wish to transact their business through the medium of Irish.  Following the recent completion of a survey of signs and notices in the Department's employment exchanges and public offices the task of providing Irish or bilingual signs has already commenced. Notices will be displayed in public offices drawing the attention of the public to officials with whom they can transact their business through Irish.  In addition Irish versions of the main forms are being made available and work is proceeding in the preparation of the Irish version of newly introduced forms.

      <P>Social welfare retirement pension is payable at age 65 and old age pension, contributory and non-contributory, is payable at age 66.  The question of a general reduction in pension age to 65 years will be considered in the context of the Government's intention to publish a framework for a national pension plan. The net cost of a reduction in pension age to 65 is estimated to be of the order of £30 million in a full year at 1985 rates. This estimate takes account of additional expenditure on old age pensions and on supplementary benefits-in-kind (free travel, etc), loss of income tax and PRSI contribution revenue and consequential savings in other social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>The current prevalence of bovine TB in County Limerick which has been falling in recent years is 1.9 per cent of herds compared to the national average of 3.69 per cent.  In line with the general trend there has been some increase in the disease prevalence in Limerick in recent months which can be attributed to the intensive nature of the testing in the current round.  Up to the end of October some 7,230 herds, i.e. 77 per cent of all herds in County Limerick, had been tested.  The expectation is that this year's intensive campaign will yield worthwhile results over the coming year in the form of a considerable reduction in disease levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of brucellosis, 0.98 per cent of County Limerick herds are infected <Col N="2149" /> compared with 0.30 per cent for the country as a whole.  While the Limerick figure is well above the national average, it represents a significant improvement on the position two year's ago when 2.04 per cent of herds were infected.  Further substantial progress is expected over the coming year in eradicating brucellosis from the national herd and, while set backs can never be ruled out entirely in the case of disease, a particular improvement is expected in the relatively high disease areas such as County Limerick. A breakdown of expenditure on a county basis is not available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Garda authorities that arising from a review of the policing requirements of Galway city, additional gardaí have been allocated there and special measures have been taken to improve the policing arrangements for the eastern side of the city. These measures include increased foot and mobile patrols in the eastern suburbs and an arrangement whereby a garda is deployed full time in the Mervue and Ballybane areas.</P>
      <P>There is no proposal at present to provide a separate station on the eastern side of Galway city, principally because of the absorption of resources in the manning of such a station that could be more usefully deployed on outdoor patrolling.  However, the possibility of establishing a &ldquo;clinic&rdquo;&mdash; in which there would be garda attendance to deal with local policing matters during certain hours &mdash;in the area, on an experimental basis, similar to those currently operating in the Dublin area, is under active consideration.</P>
