      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of a report prepared for the Eastern Health Board by Dr. Brendan Pigott, the board's chief dental officer, which showed that in the Dublin area the ratio of dentists in the public service to people entitled to public care was 1:2,900, whereas the desired ratio was 1:1,500; the measures he is taking to provide additional dentists in the Dublin area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the serious shortage of dentists in the public health service in the Eastern Health Board area, the Government will exclude dentists from the embargo on recruitment to the public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he intends to establish more dental positions with the Eastern Health Board, with particular reference to the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and <Col N="436" /> 3 together.  I am aware of Dr. Pigott's report.</P>
      <P>On the basis of figures available to me the Dublin area and the Eastern Health Board area generally have a very favourable ratio of public dental officers to eligible children when compared with other health board areas.  The desired ratio of one dentist to every 1,500 eligible children quoted in the report would represent an ideal situation in which there were no restraints on spending or recruitment.  No additional posts can be created in the health services area at present due to the general embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public sector.  I do not consider that the dentist/patient ratio in the Eastern Health Board area justifies an approach by me to my colleagues in Government to exclude dentists from the embargo on recruitment to the public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware of the Pigott report he will be aware that, as it states, the waiting time is four months in some parts of the Eastern Health Board area for routine dental care and that in excess of 7,000, possibly 8,000, people between the elderly and students are on a waiting list for routine dental care.  Does he not consider that this calls for a re-examination of the embargo on the appointment of dentists in the EHB area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin area alone there are 144,000 eligible school children in the EHB area.  Taking in the other counties there are 180,000 in all.  In Dublin there are 66 public dental officers. That is a ratio of 1:2,180 and it is the second best ratio in the country.  The Southern Health Board have 2,128. There is a waiting list, but, as I indicated to the Deputy previously, the waiting time in May 1983 was between two weeks and three months in the EHB area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pigott report indicates that in a greater emphasis on a preventive programme a ratio of 1:1,200 eligible persons would suffice.  Have the Department of Health or the Minister <Col N="437" /> embarked on any kind of increased preventive programme or is the Minister disposed to pursue such a programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One factor which adds to the relatively favourable position in Dublin is that while the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme under which adults are treated by private practitioners has been curtailed in some health board areas, it has not been so to any great extent in the EHB area.  As a result, where the scheme has been curtailed adults are depending on public dental officers for treatment, but the situation in the EHB is not too bad.  Undoubtedly I would like to see it improved, but one must remember that there are 66 public dental officers in Dublin and 75 in the EHB in all.  That compares with ten for the midlands.  In the north-western area there are only 11 public dental officers, that is one for every 3,000 people and in Dublin it is one for every 2,000 people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Eastern Health Board are fulfilling their statutory obligation to provide a proper and adequate dental service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing their utmost within the limitation of the number of public dental officers available to the board.  Ideally one would wish to see one dental officer for every 1,500 people but that would entail an enormous increase in general expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is now time for the embargo, which has been in operation for almost four years, to be reviewed and to have dental officers excluded from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always held the view that in this area the operation of the embargo is a rather crude and blunt instrument.  My colleagues in Government are aware of my views in the matter but that is the way the embargo was brought in originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if a preventive <Col N="438" /> programme was being pursued by the Department.  Is the Minister aware that the report indicated that, due to shortage of staff, it was not possible to carry out school examinations in all areas?  Does the Minister agree that this is an important part of any preventive programme and that it indicates the need for the appointment of more dentists, especially in the Eastern Health Board area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When resources become available, or if current resources become available they should go into such a programme for school children and young adolescents.  Undoubtedly that is the area of greatest need.  The working party report on dental care and services strongly recommended that and I am in favour of it.  However, until such time as we get more resources we will have to make do with the position as it is but I agree that prevention is worth a lot more than subsequent cure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when an orthodontist will be appointed to the Western Health Board; and if he will outline the reasons for the long delay in this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when funding for the post of orthodontist will be provided for the Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The post of orthodontist with the Western Health Board was recently advertised by the Local Appointments Commissioners. Interviews will be held soon and it is hoped the commissioners will be able to recommend a person for appointment.</P>
      <P>Interviews for the post were previously held by the commission in January 1984 and a person recommended for appointment in April 1984.  Subsequently, this person declined the offer of appointment. The cost of this post must be met by the Western Health Board from within their existing approved allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that <Col N="439" /> the post is not filled in spite of previous advertising will the Minister recommend to the health board that, while waiting for the post to be filled, emergency cases be farmed out to orthodontists in private practice with the burden of cost being carried by the Western Health Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The best thing to do is to have the post filled as soon as possible.  It was advertised on 24 January and I am very anxious that it be filled.  I regret that last year the successful candidate did not accept the post when it was offered to him.  However, to make interim arrangements at this stage would leave us with the problem of dismantling them subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Until the post is filled, will the Minister recommend to the health board that emergency cases be farmed out to private practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to have a look at that.  I find it difficult to believe that we will not be successful in getting an orthodontist to take up the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the difficulty of getting orthodontists and other qualified personnel to go to the west and north-west.  Does he agree that increased incentives must be provided to encourage people to go to these areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more relevant to the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that incentives will be necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a Local Appointments Commission appointment and the salary scales and other associated incentives are known.  I see no good reason why somebody should not find it an attractive position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been trying to fill it for two years.  What are people supposed to do?  Deputy <Col N="440" /> Coogan made a reasonable request which should be acceded to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has any proposals to make terms of appointment of dentists more attractive in areas finding it difficult to attract dentists such as some areas in the North-Eastern Health Board region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A special salary increase was approved for all dentists employed by health boards in late 1984. There are no further proposals on hand to make the terms of appointment of these dentists more attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we have been pursuing this matter for years?  There is a backlog of children awaiting treatment.  As regards the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme, out of the 42 dentists operating it, 39 are in Counties Louth and Meath and three are in County Monaghan. There are not any in County Cavan.  Does the Minister agree that there is a serious imbalance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The salary scales are clear-cut and were revised following an arbitration report last year.  An increase of 19 per cent is recommended for dental surgeons.  This is being phased in as follows: 4.75 per cent was approved last October and was backdated to 1 October 1983; 2.25 per cent on 1 December 1984 and in November-December 1987 there will be a further 12 per cent increase. That is in addition to the ordinary public service pay awards and is in an effort to make the posts more attractive.  I have no doubt that with the increasing number of persons available for appointment these posts will be taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that these pay scales are not adequate to attract dentists into these areas?  We can see the proof of that.  In parts of Cavan an adult will not receive treatment unless it is an emergency case. Does the Minister agree that it will be more costly for adults in future as a medical card is of no use to an adult in County <Col N="441" /> Cavan because there are no dentists to carry out the necessary treatment under the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The salary for a grade 1 clinical dental surgeon is £12,600 and will go up by another 6 per cent this year.  For a clinical dental surgeon grade 2 the salary scale ranges from £13,000 to £17,000.  For a senior clinical dental surgeon it is £16,500 to £18,800.  A principal dental surgeon has a salary range from £18,000 to £19,600 and a chief dental surgeon gets £21,200.  I do not maintain that the salaries are princely but, in the context of payment for work done and the other opportunities, the scale has been considerably improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>While the salary scale may be attractive in Rathgar or Greystones, it is very hard to attract these people to Killeshandra or Belturbet.  The <i>ad hoc</i> scheme creates a more serious problem.  We have not sufficient private dentists to operate the scheme and to give the necessary treatment to people with medical cards who are in need of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>A few minutes ago the Minister expressed concern about the ratio of dentists to patients in the Eastern Health Board area where it is one to 2,900.  Is he aware that in the Cavan-Monaghan community care area the ratio is one to 8,000 which is the worst ratio in the country?  Does he not consider that this is a crisis?  The North Eastern Health Board cannot carry out their statutory responsibility to these people.  Will the Minister take some action and, if not, will he ask the health board to make a public announcement to the effect that they are not in a position to discharge their statutory obligations, and not have people waiting for a service and perhaps losing teeth which could otherwise be saved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not as bad as Deputies might fear.  In Cavan-Monaghan the principal dentist surgeon's <Col N="442" /> post is filled.  The senior dental surgeon post is filled.  Seven clinical dental surgeons, grade 2, have been approved and three of those posts are filled.  The vacancies were re-advertised on 23 January 1985.  In Meath the principal dental surgeon's post is filled.  Seven posts were approved for clinical dental surgeons and five of them were filled.  There is one temporary post and one post is covered by sessions.  In Louth five posts for clinical dental surgeons were filled plus a temporary post for a senior dental surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister the figures for the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the North Eastern Health Board area 48,000 children are eligible and there are 16 public dental officers.  The ratio is one to 3,000.  That is not as good as the figure of one to 2,900 in the Eastern Health Board area.  The situation should be much better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is not much comfort to people to tell them that there are established posts?  In the Cavan-Monaghan community care area fewer than half of the posts are filled.  Surely this is a crisis for people who are waiting to avail of the dental service.  It is not much comfort for them to be told there are established posts which have not been filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The salaries are not princely but they are reasonable.  They are going up by 12 per cent by 1987.  They were the subject of a special arbitration award last year and 19 per cent was conceded, 6 per cent this year.  Over the next few years these posts should be filled <Col N="443" /> having regard to the numbers qualifying now and getting public service contracts with superannuation and other opportunities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that that was done years ago and the posts have not been filled as yet?  Therefore, it is time for him to have a new look at the problem from two angles.  One is to provide incentives to attract qualified personnel to the more remote areas in the west, north-west and north-east.  If he fails in that, will the Minister farm out the public work to the private dentists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <P>8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that many children in County Meath are waiting one year or more for urgently required dental treatment due to the lack of professional services in the North-Eastern Health Board; the action, if any, he intends taking to improve the situation; and the plans he has for the development of the national dental services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Joint Working Party on Dental Services, which consisted of representatives of the Department of Health, the health boards and the Irish Dental Association, is the blueprint for the development of the dental services. Among recommendations of the working party which have already been implemented are the use of dentists in private practice to treat eligible health board patients and the re-structuring of the grading of dentists in the health board service, including the provision of additional promotion outlets for dental surgeons.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the joint working party efforts are being made at present to recruit a number of full-time consultant orthodontists for the health boards and it is intended to proceed also with posts of oral surgeon when circumstances permit.  Recommendations to increase substantially the numbers of dentists employed in the health boards cannot be proceeded with at present due to the general embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public service.  Some other recommendations of the joint working party, involving the use of auxiliary dental workers in the health board service, cannot be proceeded with until the new Dentists Bill has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the recommendations of the Joint Working Party on Dental Services represent the plans for future development of the dental services generally, the services are nevertheless the subject of <Col N="445" /> an ongoing review by a group representing the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, the health boards and the Irish Dental Association.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dental service for school children in County Meath, there are some children served by the Trim dental clinic who, on the basis of the numbers awaiting treatment and the staff available to attend to them, will have to wait more than a year before they are reached.  However, many of those whose names are on the waiting list have not been clinically examined and it is thought that a high proportion of them may not require any dental treatment whatsoever. The health board intends to screen all those on the present waiting list and to draw up a new list of those genuinely requiring treatment.  When this was done in other areas of County Meath the waiting lists for dental treatment were drastically reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us about a number of recommendations which were made by the working party.  He will have to accept that since he took office none of these recommendations has been implemented.  The first one he gave us was the use of dentists in private practice to look after public patients.  This was in operation when the Minister took office.  In a number of health board areas it has been abolished as a result of the cutbacks.  None of the other recommendations has been implemented.  The Minister has already told us that he advertised for orthodontists but the posts have not been filled.  He has said that at some time in the future an old surgeon will be appointed.</P>

      <P>No.  I would point out to the Deputy that the number of dentists employed in the health services in 1979 and the following years, including 1982 when I took over, has not been reduced.  I have approved the employment by the health boards of five additional consultant orthodontists.  The posts are being filled where they become vacant; there has been no reduction.  We have not, however, increased overall the number of dentalologists.  I would remind the House that the number of children being born dropped in the period 1979 to 1985 from 76,000 to 63,000.  Therefore, in the years ahead those dentists dealing with schoolgoing children from the age of five upwards requiring treatment will have fewer cases to deal with.  This is a valid point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of the dental service available to primary school children varies from health board to health board and indeed in some cases between different areas of the same health board.  While the service may be adequate in some areas, it is less than adequate in others, due mainly to a shortage of dental staff in the health boards. The general embargo on the creation of additional posts in the public service prevents <Col N="448" /> the health boards from employing additional dentists at present.  The health boards do not have the dental manpower resources necessary to provide an annual check-up for all pupils of national schools.  To attempt to provide such annual check-ups would only deflect very scarce dental staff from the delivery of dental treatment and cause a general disimprovement in the level of service available.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health, in consultation with the Department of Community Medicine and Epidemiology at UCD, have established a consultative committee to carry out a study into the incidence rates for childhood leukaemia to determine whether there is an increase in cases on the eastern seaboard.  A number of specialists have been engaged for the purposes of the study.  In brief, the terms of reference are &mdash; to examine the national incidence of childhood leukaemia in the 0-14 years of age range approximately from 1970 up to now and to examine the mortality in the 0-25 years of age range from 1950, subject to data availability.  The incidence rates will be analysed for any clustering in space or time and for any excesses in certain geographical areas.  Finally, the group will critically examine the Black report, issued by Sir Douglas Black, in relation to the increased incidence of cancer in West Cumbria, which report is public knowledge.  They are examining the available evidence relating to Dr. Sheehan's and Dr. Hillery's hypothesis concerning the excess of Down's syndrome on the east coast of Ireland.  When I get that report, I shall immediately make it public.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that the British authorities have been very strongly urged by me to implement speedily the recommendations of the Black report.  The Department of Energy, together with the other Departments concerned, including the Department of Health, and the Nuclear Energy Board, will follow very closely the actions which the British authorities are taking towards implementing the recommendations of that report.  At this stage it is not possible to say what correlation exists between Sellafield and the north-east coast because we do not have an effective national cancer register with sufficient data to enable the incidence of leukaemia on the east coast to be established.

Dr. Herrity of the Department of Community Medicine and Epidemiology will be the co-ordinator of the study and Dr. Daly also of the same Department will act as the biostatistician. Finally, Dr. Fennelly, the oncologist, with a joint appointment involving a number of the major Dublin teaching hospitals, has also agreed to participate in the study.  The first meeting took place in November last.  It was attended by the leading consultants dealing with the problem throughout the country.  They had been invited to participate in the study and readily agreed to do so.  Therefore, the work is well advanced.  I am anxious to have the research data available to the Department as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is <Col N="452" /> aware, there are two State agencies in this area.  There is Park and then there is a subsidiary of the National Enterprise Agency also involved.  Both have contracts with different Departments of Health in a number of countries.  At national level there is a very emphatic need to co-ordinate this work.  My Department, through the Health Services Export Co-ordinating Committee, have been overseeing this work.  There is a need for a regulatory committee which would be a departmental-governmental committee to ensure that where any agency, be it in the public or private sector, is involved in this field, that this is done in a manner which preserves the integrity of the Irish health services and preserves the best features of our service going abroad, for example, that those companies operate viable contracts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this is quite a complex issue but there are the two State agencies involved and then there are a number of private agencies directly involved.  It is absolutely essential that, where contracts are taken up abroad, where contracts are entered into &mdash; particularly to deliver consultancy staff to installations abroad and where nursing staff are recruited here &mdash; that it be done in an orderly manner.  Otherwise our health services could find themselves placed in quite an impossible position.  It is also important that personnel taking up positions abroad should have basic protection given to them.  Of course it is of critical importance that those contracts abroad be viable, particularly where there is a State agency involved.  For all of those reasons it is of importance that there be a regulatory mechanism.  I am not necessarily suggesting that there should be another State-sponsored body but there should be a very firm regulatory position.  For example, where health boards write to me indicating that consultancy <Col N="453" /> staff wish to spend two or three years abroad, I, Comhairle na nOspidéal and all hospital authorities and health boards must replace such staff.  We must have effective regulation and control of it.  Otherwise the system becomes chaotic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Inevitably this is an area in which regulation must enter into operation.  As the Deputy well knows, my Department and health boards generally have been reluctant to deny any person an opportunity to further his or her career abroad.  But &mdash; and I throw out the question &mdash; what happens when those people come back?  Where do they fit in?  Where do they slot back into the system?  That can be done only by regulation.  I appreciate the concern expressed by the Deputy that some hospitals are very worried about this development.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Health of the day and of the Department to control that development in the best interests of the staff themselves and of the delivery of our health services.  Otherwise we will finish up with locums in every consultancy position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>I have not received a specific request from any firm for consultation or discussion on the question of controls for clinical trials of drugs but I did in fact receive detailed and specific observations from a particular firm in relation to the nature of the controls which might be imposed and I am considering those views.</P>
      <P>I have had detailed consultations with the National Drugs Advisory Board, who are the expert advisory body in such matters, about the Bill I propose to introduce to control clinical trials.  The NDAB are in close contact with the organisation of the activities of companies who conduct clinical trials, through the administration of a voluntary arrangement for the clearance of submissions for trials through the board.  The proposed Bill will put this voluntary system on a statutory basis and will apply to existing as well as new drugs.</P>
      <P>The number of firms engaged in clinical trials of drugs in Ireland in 1984 was 51. The safety standards applicable to the conduct of trials by these companies are set out in detail in guidelines issued by the NDAB and these refer also to the question of informed consent of participants in such trials and the approval of ethical committees.  Standards of good laboratory and clinical practice are also set out in the guidelines.</P>

Neither do the NDAB have any statutory authority in this area.  There are a number of very serious issues involved but these are being dealt with in the Bill.

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I have received a number of representations on this matter.  In addition, I have met some of the interested parties but I have not yet met any of the drug companies.  I consider it appropriate to have a Government decision first and then to consult with the companies when the legislation has been published. Regarding the incident referred to by Deputy Taylor, an incident which obviously concerns Deputy De Rossa also, I have had deep internal investigations undertaken but have found that I have no statutory control in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has been in contact with the National Drugs Advisory Board about the drug Ketoconazole which is sold in Ireland under the brand name Nizoral as this has been the cause of five deaths in Britain and 77 cases of liver damage have been reported after the oral preparation of the drug had been used there and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in contact with the National Drugs Advisory Board regarding the product mentioned by the Deputy.  The board are aware of the possible adverse effects from the use of Nizoral, particularly during prolonged treatment.  They have alerted all medical practitioners that systemic use of Nizoral be reserved for the treatment of serious or intractable infections which do not respond to topical measures.  The NDAB said also in their warning letter to medical practitioners that systemic treatment involving Nizoral is best carried out in hospital and under consultant supervision with regular assessment of liver function. The board are keeping the matter under constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any such report.  Earlier this month there <Col N="458" /> were Press reports confirming death and liver damage in the UK as a result of the use of the drug.  I have received an indication from the National Drugs Advisory Board that there were two cases in Ireland where liver function was reported to have been affected following the use of this drug.  In one of the cases the patient was suffering from an infection of the lung and he died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what tests were done on the drug before it was allowed to be used here by the National Drugs Advisory Board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular product authorisation was granted to a pharmaceutical company on 26 November 1981 on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The authorisation included precautions and warnings in regard to the use of the product and in particular the need for regular liver function tests during prolonged treatment.  I might add that in the case of the patient who died that death could not be attributed to the use of the drug. Following reports of the deterioration of liver function in patients arising out of this therapy, the authorisation was amended in March 1984 on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board to include further precautions and warnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>I will not have a series of questions.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that there is a great deal of speculation and the more innocent might be excused if they suspected that a great deal of it was inspired.  Rather than have us get our information from the United States, London or Northern Ireland, does the Taoiseach not think that in a crucial matter like this it would be desirable if Members of this House could get our information from the Government and preferably from the Taoiseach?  I know it is important to him to go over to London and make big pronouncements over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The legislation will be available to Members of the House later this afternoon and an advance copy will be <Col N="528" /> made available to the Deputy in the very near future.  We have endeavoured as far as we can to facilitate and inform the principal Opposition party of the position. Certainly the Deputy is entitled to seek all information possible.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 3 to 14, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Where it is proposed to make an order or regulation under this Act, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order or regulation shall not <Col N="536" /> be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 certain orders or regulations made by the Minister are required to be laid before the Oireachtas after they are made and if, within 21 sitting days, a resolution is passed annulling such order or regulation, such order or regulation shall be annulled.  Section 3(1) goes on to state:</P>
    <P>but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about that part of the section.  The Bill, principally, is an enabling measure.  Section after section gives the Minister power to make orders in regard to the boundaries of local authorities, orders in regard to the boundaries of electoral areas in local authorities, orders to enable him to vary the number of councillors to be elected within any electoral area and a whole range of powers which would have a very dramatic effect on the structure of the local government system as we know it. If the Minister can make these orders and have the contents of the orders made valid by way of section 3(1) despite the fact that the Dáil may subsequently annul the order there seems to be a slight anomaly. I hope the Minister will be able to give the House some reasonable explanation which might encourage me to withdraw my amendments.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise is that though subsection (1) states that the order shall be laid before the House it also excludes from that requirement orders made under sections 5, 7 (7), 8 and 24.  Section 3 (2) provides that orders made under section 8 or 24 shall be laid in draft form before the House.  They, according to the section, shall not be approved until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House. That is a much more satisfactory provision. In view of the extensive powers available to the Minister under the Bill to make orders which will have a dramatic effect on the whole structure of local government as we know it, it should be <Col N="537" /> incumbent on the Minister to publish his proposed orders in draft form and they should not come into force until a resolution is passed in the Dáil approving of them.  That would be a more satisfactory way to go about such major changes in the local government system.</P>
    <P>My amendment would require that all orders or regulations made under the Act be laid before the House in draft form and that a resolution would have to be passed approving of them.  They would not come into force in any way until the House had an opportunity of examining them and until the House had given its approval to them.  I am concerned about the last sentence in subsection (1).  If we are to allow the section to stand the Minister will have power to make orders and the matters required to be done in those orders shall be deemed to have been valid despite the fact that they may subsequently be annulled.  I should like to hear the Minister's explanation of the effect of his section and what he thinks the effect of my amendment will be.  The Minister should bear in mind that under the Bill his power to make orders is very extensive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be able to persuade the Deputy that his fears are groundless.  When he has listened to my explanation I hope he will agree to withdraw his amendments.  The effect of these amendments would be that all orders under the Bill would require to be formally approved by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would be without precedent and if this approach were adopted generally in regard to legislation the business of the House would come to a standstill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill adopts a reasonable approach and accords with well established precedent in that orders under sections 8 and 24 which confer wide powers on the Minister to amend legislation must be approved by both Houses; orders under section 5 and 7 (7) are a matter for the Minister and all other orders must be laid before both Houses for 21 days.  As I have said these are the normal provisions <Col N="538" /> relating to orders and in these circumstances I would ask Deputy Molloy to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>Generally, the approach followed in regard to orders is that those which give effect to something set out in an Act are required to be laid before both Houses for 21 days.  However, where powers are given in an order to, in effect, make new legislation and amend existing legislation then such orders are usually subject to the formal approval of both Houses.  This approach has been followed in the case of this Bill.  Orders under sections 8 and 24 must be approved by both Houses.  All of the other orders must be laid before both Houses for 21 days which is the usual provision applying to orders.  The only exceptions are orders under sections 5 and 7 (7).</P>
    <P>The order under section 5 fixes the appointed day for the upgrading of Galway to county borough status. Appointed day orders are not usually laid before both Houses.  The order under section 7 (7) allows the Minister to terminate the joint management arrangement in Galway where the city and county councils so decide.  A similar provision applies under the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, in relation to Dublin City and county and in that case the order does not have to be laid before both Houses.  I am satisfied, therefore, that orders under these two sections do not require to be laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>The order under section 8 enables the Minister to make any provisions necessary to give effect to the upgrading of Galway.  The order under section 24 enables the Minister to make any provisions necessary to enable the Bill to have full effect including the power to amend, repeal or adapt enactments.  As these orders allow the Minister to, in effect, make new legislation it was felt that they should be subject to formal approval by both Houses and section 3 (2) provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have explained to the Deputy that the matter is well covered and I ask him to withdraw his amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister <Col N="539" /> has given any explanation of subsection (1) which provides that any matter in orders laid before the House and, subsequently, annulled will be deemed to have been valid if the Minister had acted under the order before it was annulled.  The Minister did not explain what will happen in such cases.  For instance, if the Minister makes an order changing the boundary of some electoral areas &mdash; that is one of the powers he has under the Bill &mdash; and that change is subsequently annulled by the Dáil, what is the effect if an election had taken place prior to that, of any action taken under that order despite the fact that it had not been approved by the House?  Why is it necessary to include that reference to any matter which the Minister had carried out as proposed in the order?  Would it be deemed valid in spite of the fact that it could be annulled subsequently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to believe that the annulling power of the Houses of the Oireachtas would have no force in the event of the Minister for the Environment making a certain order.  This is not so, if an order is annulled by the Oireachtas it stands abolished.  The saving clause &ldquo;without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder&rdquo; validates the situation obtaining between the making of the order by the Minister and its annulment by the Oireachtas.  The provision in section 3 (1) about which the Deputy is concerned is a standard provision and is used in the majority of Bills.  There is no hidden danger in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state what type of action he thinks could be taken under an order in the period from the making of the order to the completion of the 21 days sitting period or the annulment? What powers would the Minister have to act under that order which would require validation under this subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in the normal course of events, will not be using the 21 days provision to take action for <Col N="540" /> an ulterior motive.  The Deputy seems to be of the opinion that in this subsection we are involving the House in giving power to the Minister to get around the normal methods and orders which I explained earlier.  This is not the case and I should like the Deputy to accept that there is no suggestion that anything would be done in the timescale within the 21 days while the order is laid before the House.  I do not know what the Deputy has in mind in this regard and perhaps he would enlighten me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that it is just standard provision which is contained in all the Bills which go through the House.  He is trying to find an excuse for raising this although I have given a very full explanation under the various headings raised.  As I said, this is a normal provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not satisfactory to be told that it is normal to have these words in a Bill.  If we require explanations for words contained in any section they should be given.  It is not satisfactory to be told that this provision is normal and included in other Bills.  This is not a normal Bill, it is proposing additional powers for the Minister which he did not have before.  I do not see any necessity to give the Minister power to make an order which, despite the fact that this House might subsequently annul it, nevertheless, the Minister, under this wording, is giving validity to any action he takes prior to the annulment.  If there is no need for it it should be removed <Col N="541" /> and, if it is needed, we should be told why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are powers under existing legislation for the Minister to include electoral areas and to fix the number of members per area by order. The provision applying to these orders is the same as those in section 3(1).  I have given a complete explanation in regard to sections 5, 7, 8 and 24 and I do not know why the Deputy is persisting in his inquiry.  He is making a mountain out of a molehill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is fully realised, under the Bill the Minister will have full power to change the number of councillors elected in any area, to change the boundaries of the electoral area and he will even have power to change the boundaries of a local authority by order, not by legislation.  If I am interpreting this correctly, they are very extensive new powers.  I do not see how we can be expected to accept that the Minister can have those extensive new powers under a section of the Bill enabling him to do these things by way of order which subsequently this House may not agree to ratify.  Despite that fact, it seems that as the Minister made the order, he may deem that any action taken by him while that order was in force before its annulment would have been a valid action on his part supported by this section of the Bill.  If the period of the order was to transcend the election date, it could cause electoral consternation.  If a boundary was changed and an election held under that boundary which was subsequently changed by the House, the election would be deemed valid in spite of the fact that the House did not support the boundary change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to intervene and I had a completely open mind on the Bill until I heard Deputy Molloy making his case.  However, he overstated it.  As the Minister said, this is a perfectly familiar formula and I have seen it many dozens of times here.  Deputy Molloy, <Col N="542" /> who has been here for much longer, must have seen it perhaps hundreds of times. I have no doubt that he sponsored legislation when he was a Minister which contained this formula.  I know that if you approach it from scratch it looks sinister but it is a very common form and is intended to protect officials against actions which might lie against them or proceedings which might be taken in relation to acts which, if the power they are acting under is subsequently annulled, turns out to have been done without legal authority.  That is the purpose behind this very common form and it is not as sinister as Deputy Molloy suggested.  The alternative is the so-called positive resolution and by far the commonest form which power to make regulations is contained in is the form which incorporates the negative resolution which the Bill now contains.  Deputy Molloy is seeking to replace it with the positive resolution which is a much rarer form but the disadvantage with that is that it inhibits a Minister from making any regulations during periods when the Dáil is in recess or when its load of work is so heavy that he may not be able to get his proposal before the House.  The Deputy is putting a sinister construction on something which he must have sponsored many times in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly is quite right.  I did not like to jog Deputy Molloy's memory but the Local Authorities Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971, was put through the Oireachtas when he was Minister for Local Government. That Act allows corporate bodies serving local authorities and health boards to be established by an order which does not even have to be laid before the Oireachtas in the way envisaged under section 3 (1).  The changes we will be making to the boundaries in Galway will form part of an amendment which we will deal with later, but all other changes in the boundaries will be those suggested by the Boundaries Commission.  No other changes will be made by me with or after the passage of this legislation.</P>

It is very sloppy to make legislation on the basis of a promise. What is written in this Bill is what will be on the Statute Book.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not wish anything to happen to the Minister's health.  The House was satisfied to accept the 1971 Bill but this Bill introduced vast new powers into the electoral arena where political advantage can easily be taken by one side over the other because the Minister of the day has the power, by order, to alter the electoral areas under which local authority elections will be fought.  They are very extensive powers for any Minister to have, as the Minister knows.  If at some time in the immediate future some irresponsible person were to be made Minister &mdash; I am not implying the present Minister would, although he might be tempted to, like many others &mdash; it would be open to him to alter the electoral boundaries in whatever way he wishes.  He has absolute power under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I am asking in my amendment is <Col N="544" /> that the orders be made in draft form, published so that the public and the Members of this House see them, then debated in this House and passed by way of resolution. Not until then should they come into force.  What disturbs me is that any action taken in implementing the provisions of that order would be valid up to the time of its annulment.  I find that extraordinary.  I do not believe any order of this political significance should be made without first being published in that form and brought before the Dáil for approval.  Then, with the majority approving it, we would all have to accept it.  If this section goes through as it stands the Minister may take this step for political or other advantage and it would be deemed valid despite the fact that subsequently the majority of the House would not agree.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House too long, but I thought the Minister would have a much more reasonable and logical explanation for what he is doing.  Deputy Kelly is right when he says that this is a very sinister provision.  It gives the Minister very extensive powers to do something without the authority of the House. We are all particularly anxious and sensitive about matters in this area which affect political fortunes of individuals and political parties.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the power given to the Minister under this Bill will elapse after the 1985 local elections. Certain provisions in the Bill relate to changes which are to be made for the purpose of the 1985 local elections.  There are references in the Bill to certain orders in regard to changing the polling districts and registers in preparation for the 1985 election, but I am concerned principally with the wide-ranging powers given in the Bill to the Minister to enable him at any time in the future to alter boundaries of local authorities or electoral areas and to determine the number of members to be elected in any electoral area.  Is the <Col N="547" /> Minister saying that those three powers will lapse after the 1985 local elections?</P>

I still feel that it would not be proper for this House to confine the Minister in the making of these orders but to require him to publish them first in draft form for public examination and public debate in the Oireachtas and have them adopted here prior to their being approved.  That is in effect what is proposed in amendment No. 2, and amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are consequential. I see no reason from the Minister's explanation so far to alter my view that the powers are too extensive and that the correct way to proceed in this area in the electoral field is to require the Minister to put everything up front so that it can be examined critically by the public and the Oireachtas itself can then decide whether these matters are to be approved.  For that reason I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment and I am asking the Chair to put the amendment.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), line 8, to delete &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Lord Mayor&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are put down by me to clarify the position with regard to the position of lord mayor in county boroughs and the office of mayor.  At present in the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork and chairman of the city council carries the title of lord mayor.  In all other local authorities including the county boroughs of Waterford, Limerick and now Galway and all the borough councils the official title is that of mayor.  I put down this amendment to clarify the historical source for this title, where it comes from and what is the reason for it.  If it is to be retained as the title of the chairmen of local authorities then surely it should be accepted that some rules apply to where it will come into operation.  The section refers to Galway merely because it is dealing with the change in the status of Galway from borough council to county borough, but I am conscious that the county boroughs of Limerick and Waterford do not have the title of lord mayor for the chairman of the councils there.  I am not sure whether the House is particularly enamoured of the title anyway, but a tradition is attached to it and the office holders command a certain respect.  It is a tradition which goes back a long way and which is highly respected and none of us would wish really to change the title now, but if we are to retain that in our local authorities and some county boroughs then why not in all county boroughs? What is the historical background for this title in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Molloy has put the matter very temperately. I was inclined to think that he might make an impassioned plea that Galway be upgraded into a lordmayorship as well as a county borough, but he was quite rational in asking that the thing be clarified. It is strange that in this country we, having made so many efforts to throw off foreign domination, cling so tenaciously <Col N="549" /> to the traditions of foreign panoply which the storms and hurricanes of history have left intact still.  Deputy Molloy did not say this and I am not going to put the words into his mouth, but I know there are people in the city of Galway who will feel slighted if they do not have a lord mayor as distinct from a mayor.  I must say that I consider that there is no justification for keeping a title of this kind at all in a republic like this and least of all perhaps in a city which, rightly or wrongly, claims to be the capital of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a reflection on us that we cling to things like the title of lord mayor and to dignitaries like &ldquo;alderman&rdquo; which, as far as I know, is Anglo-Saxon. It is not even Norman; it is a pre-Norman title going back to the Anglo-Saxons. This Celtic people, as we in other moments think of ourselves, would feel naked to the world if we were stripped of the panoply of lord mayors and alderman not to speak of the other panoplies which local government keeps intact for itself, while apparently indifferent to the fact that seven-tenths of its functions have been stripped from it over the last 80 years because they proved impossible to discharge efficiently in the structure which existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to look at a matter like this, trivial and marginal though it is, when we are looking at the whole question of reform of local government in the more substantive sense.  I know the Minister has not pretended that this Bill is doing that but we should be looking more at the substance of what we should be trying to get from a locally elected organisation and not worry about names and titles.  I do not think many taxpayers care two trawneens what an elected representative is called who happens to top the poll in the ward in which the taxpayer may have voted.  I am sure he feels a kind of pitying contempt for a man who gets excited if <Col N="550" /> he is not accorded the title of &ldquo;alderman&rdquo; or &ldquo;lord mayor&rdquo;.  We ought to get a grip on ourselves in the reform of local government and start right here.</P>
    <P>I admit it is a trivial matter but by our approach in attaching so much evident importance to titles and very little to what the system is doing and whether it might not be done better in some other way, we are letting ourselves down and behaving in a non-republican way.  I do not say that in a contentious way.  Deputy Molloy did not invite contention or contradiction.</P>

      <P>As I said on Second Stage, legislation is being prepared and reforms in the organisation and procedures of local authorities will take place. Among the matters being considered is the question of titles: lord mayors, mayors, chairmen, and the possibility of standardisation in regard to these.  As the issue raised in the amendment will be considered, I hope the amendment will not be pursued.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned that some areas have lord mayors and some do not. The present title of &ldquo;lord mayor&rdquo; applies in the case of Dublin Corporation by virtue of section 12 of the Municipal Corporation (Ireland) Act, 1840.  In the case of Cork the title was made under patent of 1900.  These were made by some other authority which had little to do with what we have been doing for the past 60 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the extra little bits of information Deputy Kelly can give us in this area.  The 1840 Act provided for the title of &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; to apply to the boroughs of Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford.  Wexford obtained a charter and the title &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; in 1846. Galway was incorporated and acquired the title of mayor under the 1937 Act. Galway is the only one which received a title since the State was founded.  Dún Laoghaire revoked the possibility of having the title &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; and chose &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; under section 46 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1937.</P>
      <P>I hope the explanation I have given about how the titles came about will result in the amendments being withdrawn.  It is appropriate that Galway is in the same league as places like Limerick, Waterford and to a greater extent Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had no expression from the Minister as to whether he supports the continuation of the title &ldquo;lord mayor&rdquo; in county boroughs where that title applies at present.  I take it from what the Minister said that these matters will be considered at a later stage when the other Bills appear before the House. On that basis I will withdrawn the amendments referring to &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; and &ldquo;lord mayor.&rdquo;  However, there is need for uniformity.  I am inclined to go along with the attitude of Deputy Kelly regarding the retention of the title &ldquo;lord&rdquo;.  The international title of &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; will be acceptable everywhere.  One need not be too concerned about one's republicanism being diluted in agreeing to the title of mayor.  The title is in operation in France, the home of republicanism, America another great republican country and many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised the issue to draw the attention of the Minister to the need for uniformity. Perhaps those titles could be formally adopted into our legislation.  If not they should be made extinct.  We should not <Col N="552" /> continue to have titles which were introduced under legislation which predates the establishment of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain subsection (4) and what exactly the procedures will be in regard to the extension of Galway borough and the special temporary arrangements being made for the pending local election whereby that part of the country which is being added to the city will form part of the electoral area for election to Galway borough council but will not be part of the borough council until a subsequent order is passed? People in the city who were previously entitled to vote in a council election are being excluded despite the fact that they will continue to live in a borough council and not a county borough.  The Minister is debarring the people in Galway city from voting in elections to Galway County Council, as was their right heretofore, because it is proposed to upgrade the city at some future date to a county borough.  However, it will not be upgraded prior to the election.  I should like the Minister to confirm that people residing in the area that is being added to the city will be excluded from voting in the county council elections despite the fact that they will still be residing in the county and not in the borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the subsection, as the Deputy said, the Galway city electorate will not vote in the coming county council election.  This is because we are upgrading the borough to a county borough. No county borough votes in a county council election.  I hope that status will be conferred on Galway as quickly as possible.  It would be inappropriate for the people concerned, since the borough is to become a separate county borough, to vote, when they would not have the <Col N="553" /> status of county borough, in the county council election.  We are extending the number of seats in the new county borough of Galway.  We expect that, in a very short time, Galway will be a corporation, a county borough, and therefore will have the status and standing county boroughs elsewhere have.  They voted in county council elections in the past, but this will not be available to them now. This is the situation in every other county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the changing of the status of Galway may entail a delay of eight or nine months.  Can the Minister outline the matters which have to be resolved before Galway is upgraded and before a pronouncement can be made that the city is to become a county borough. Will another Bill have to be brought in here to change the status of Galway and what further legislation will be required before the change can take place?</P>
      <P>One of the matters of great concern to the county council is the question of compensation for the very valuable areas which are being ceded to the city. The major part of the Galway industrial estate is located in the townlands which are being added to Galway city.  They have very high valuations and are potentially very high revenue earners for Galway County Council.  That revenue will now be lost to the county despite the fact that the services which enabled those factories to be established were provided and paid for by the county authority.  It seems they are now to be handed over to the city without adequate arrangements for compensation to be paid.  That is one important matter which will have to be resolved before any final transfer can take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the elections are held on 20 June we will have a new city council elected for Galway who will continue to exist in a limbo until they are formally approved by further legislation after a number of matters have been resolved.  I should like the Minister to indicate to us what other main matters remain to be resolved between both local authorities.  In the <Col N="554" /> event of a dispute, what procedure will be adopted?  Further on in the Bill the Minister seems to say that he will resolve any difficulties.  Heretofore, I understood there was provision for independent arbitrators to make decisions which were binding on both parties.  Is the Minister assuming that role in the event of nonagreement locally?  Before upgrading Galway to county borough status can take place, it seems that many matters have to be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the upgrading of Galway to the status of a county borough in this section.  I do not think the questions raised by the Deputy are pertinent at this stage.  He mentioned compensation.  It will be open to both local authorities to have an independent arbitrator to consider the level of compensation. If this is agreed locally, it will be accepted by me and that will be the end of it.  If it is not agreed, as in the past I will be the adjudicator.</P>
      <P>There are areas of operation which are common to both such as the fire service and lighting.  These topics will have to be discussed over the next few months.  I hope this will not take too long and that we will get agreement.  I understand there is a level of agreement in Galway at the moment.  There should not be any great delay.  I hope there will not be a contentious debate between the two authorities. I am led to believe there probably will not.  In this section we are dealing with the status of Galway city and I do not think this point is really pertinent.  We can deal with other aspects later on.</P>

      <P>In page 7, lines 37 to 48, and in page 8, lines 1 to 12, to delete subsections (5), (6) and (7).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These subsections refer to the office of the county manager and the office of the Galway city manager and suggest that they should be held by one and the same person.  I want to have a discussion on this because, with the enlargement of Galway city and the proposal to upgrade it to the status of a county borough, the city should have its own manager.  I want to hear the Minister's arguments in support of these subsections which provide that the holder of the office of county manager on 1 March 1985 shall continue <Col N="556" /> as the county manager of the county council and the city manager of the new county Galway borough until such time as resolutions are passed agreeing to the appointment of separate managers by Galway County Council and Galway Corporation.</P>
    <P>Is it proper that the same individual should continue in the role of manager of two adjoining local authorities?  The provision in the Bill giving the county council equal authority in the matter of terminating the operation of this procedure is doubtful.  Surely that should be a matter solely for Galway Corporation. If the corporation subsequently decided that they wanted to have separate management from the county, legislation by the corporation should be adequate.  As I read the section, the provision is made where the legislation is passed by both authorities.  In other words, the county council, who would not be directly but indirectly affected inasmuch as their manager was having to devote some of his time and energies to management of another authority I presume would have an interest in that it might suit them to have him devote all his time and energy to their authority.</P>
    <P>The authority most concerned is the city council who are going to continue, despite upgrading, with the same management structure as heretofore when Galway was a borough council.  Under that system there was a town clerk and an assistant county manager acting as city manager.  That is purely a nominal office. It does not carry any functions other than the powers delegated by the county manager to it.  The person with ultimate responsibility for the management of Galway city is the man who also has the post of county manager.  That layer of management is not helpful to the growth of Galway city.  It is an encumbrance on the day to day management of Galway city local authority since decisions cannot be made by the person most concerned, the town clerk.  He must refer any major decision to his assistant manager or city manager, who will refer the decision to the county manager.  That layer of bureaucracy is acting as a disincentive <Col N="557" /> to initiative and an obstacle to dynamic management in the growth and development of Galway city.  For that reason, I have put down this amendment, principally to hear the Minister's arguments in support of what he is proposing.  Having listened to the Minister and considered the matter, we will decide whether to put the amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister, for purely administrative arrangements, wants to continue for the time being with the same manager, it should come within the compass of the city council, on the passing of a motion there, to separate management of city and county.  They would have a much greater vested interest in that decision and should not be blocked from making it purely because of non-agreement of the county council, who would not be involved in the management of the city. Later in the Bill the Minister has given power to the Minister to terminate the arrangement by order.  It may not be the wish of the Minister of the day to do that. It is the desire of the local authority that it should be done.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has already mentioned, in discussing an earlier amendment, that he is aware that there will be complex matters involving the transfer of property, staff, liabilities, assets and so forth to be sorted out arising from the separation of the county and county borough.  No doubt, various practical difficulties will arise.  It is essential that in the initial phase there be joint management in order to secure that the separation of city and county and the subsequent development of each authority is handled in a co-ordinated fashion and that any problems arising can be readily sorted out.  In due course the two authorities may themselves decide that separate management is a more appropriate arrangement and section 7 (7) allows for this, once the present manager ceases to hold office.  This strikes a reasonable balance between the need for joint management in the initial phases in the interests of proper co-ordination and efficiency and the desirability of allowing <Col N="558" /> the two authorities to choose the particular type of system which they feel is most appropriate.  For these reasons I would prefer the Deputy not to pursue this amendment.  I have outlined my reasons for saying that the present situation should continue until the end of the present term of office of the county manager there.</P>

      <P>For clarification, if the county council, under section 7 (7) and the corporation both propose resolutions that the management of the county and city should not be held by the same person, may I take it from what the Minister is saying that there will then be an appointment of a separate city manager and the county manager will become manager for the county council only and that that would be agreed to by the Minister? Am I to take it that there would be no other obstacles to implementation of that resolution?  Is it solely up to the local authorities to decide what form of management they want?  Can they decide that they want two managers, one for the county and a separate individual acting as city manager?  Can the local authorities make that decision, or is there any way in which the Minister can interfere in the matter and stop this being done?</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister is being advised that this is a personnel matter, but it is more than that.

I did not introduce the personnel aspect.  The Minister introduced it in the wording of this subsection, where he makes reference to the individual who holds that office at present.  I cannot avoid making reference to the office and the holder thereof when the Minister has mentioned that office and the holder thereof in that subsection.

      <P>Therefore, the Minister is not merely asking us to agree to the section, as written, to facilitate what he describes as the necessity to have the one manager during this interim period, when all of these complex arrangements must be made to facilitate the transfer of part of the county to the city, the enlargement of the city, and arrangements for compensation in regard to property transfers and other matters.  It is not solely for that purpose that the Minister is asking us to agree that the person who held the office on 1 March should continue in that office because it appears from what the Minister has just said he could continue in that office for seven years.  Therefore, this newly expanded city of Galway is being denied the opportunity of having separate management for a period of seven years if the present incumbent continues to serve for the remainder of his period. That is not satisfactory.  The Minister said earlier that if the two local authorities came together and passed a resolution <Col N="561" /> that there should be separate management, he would arrange for separate managers to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears now that the Minister is debarred for seven years from doing so in the case of Galway.  It is unreasonable that the opportunity should be denied this new city to have separate management.  It is necessary for the city, for its growth and development, in order to introduce some dynamism into the administration of local government in Galway city that there be separate management. Let us face it, there is a general need for change in legislation to allow local authorities fulfil their real role in the community.  I consider that to be one of leading development, that local authorities in urban areas should act as development corporations for their areas and should be leading in that role.  To promote that type of local authority, to introduce that type of dynamism into local government, separate management constitutes one of the prerequisites.  If one individual has to carry responsibility for the administration of Galway, which is the second or third largest county in the country, and this newly expanded city with all its inherent arrangements, then we shall have been denied something which would benefit the growth of the city in years ahead.  Is there not some way in which the Minister could change that arrangement, or confine the guarantee to the present incumbent to a period of 12 months?  Surely that would be an adequate period to allow for the transitional arrangements to be effected?</P>

      <P>Had we not decided on this side of the House to grant Galway this enhanced status that individual would continue managing the city and county of Galway.  I do not understand why the Deputy is so firm in advocating that he should not hold office until the end of his normal term in the territory to which he was appointed, which is the city and county of Galway.  Seven years is a brief enough period in the life of any city, town or county.  I am not aware of any reason why he should not continue in the enhanced office of city and county manager until the end of his period of employment.</P>

Will we have one manager, the existing incumbent of the office of city and county manager of Dublin?  Will he continue as the county or city manager under the new Dublin corporation and each of the three new Dublin county councils?  What will be the position in that case?  What is the difference between what will apply in the case of Dublin from what the Minister proposes for Galway?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been decided and discussions will take place on that matter.  I would be very keen to ensure a continuation of joint management throughout the whole of the Dublin area, whether that be in the metropolitian council to be established, or in some other way.  But that has not been decided. Therefore it is premature to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Minister will not agree to our suggestion in the amendment which removes part of the section.  Neither does it seem he is agreeing to the other suggestions I made in the course of this short discussion, just to limit the guarantee he is giving the existing incumbent to a period shorter than the seven years he has remaining to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> The Minister says he wants to ensure a smooth transition.  Is he suggesting that it will take seven years to implement the transition because earlier he said he hoped it would have taken place, I think, by Christmas next?  If that is so, why is the Minister so insistent that the manager should remain on for a period of seven years, that we should be denied the opportunity of having separate management if that is what the local authorities decide?</P>
    <P>After the establishment of the Galway county borough with the new council of 15 members, after these transitional arrangements have been worked out, when the matter is finalised and the Minister's order made for their establishment, I can foresee them becoming very disgruntled at having to continue under the management of the county manager who has other responsibilities over a very wide area.  The city of Galway is faced with many challenges, particularly in the line of development, housing and industry, in the area of job creation, of maintaining its premier position as a tourist resort. This means that there is a very large task to be carried out and supervised by a competent, full time manager and not a part time person sharing his time with another major local authority.  That is not satisfactory.  I can see the need to have him there for the transitional period but I do not see the need to guarantee him this position for seven years.  It is very strange that that should be written into legislation or that anybody be given that kind of guarantee.  Why should the manager's position supersede the optimum position for the town and city as a whole?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 25, to delete &ldquo;fifty-two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eighty-five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My purpose in proposing this amendment is to establish equality of representation as between the Dublin County Council area and the Dublin City Council area in terms of the proposed new boundaries. The Minister is proposing 52 seats for the new Dublin city area.  The votes then of the people in the city area will be worth about half what the votes of the people in the county area will be worth.  That is an undemocratic procedure but, in addition, there is the Minister's suggestion &mdash; and that is all it is in relation to the municipal authority &mdash; that the membership of the proposed municipal authority will be drawn from the three new county council areas and the Dublin City Council areas, presumably on the basis of the number of seats in those areas. This compounds the inequality and the undemocratic procedure.</P>
      <P>This whole question of the numbers of seats has been raised before, and the Minister has indicated that he considers a council comprising 85 or 90 as being too unwieldy.  I suggest that when he has finished his reorganisation the Dublin County Council area, which will have 78 seats and which will operate as a single county council area, will be no less or no more unwieldy than the proposal I am making now.  The greater number of seats in the Dublin area, as being proposed by me, would provide for a greater degree of contact between local representatives and their electorate.  Local democracy depends very much on the sort of contact that representing a smaller number of people would provide, both to the representatives concerned and to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To highlight the kind of inequality I <Col N="565" /> am talking about, I would refer the Minister to the Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle area which under the new proposal will have four seats and which has a population of slightly in excess of 21,000.  Until this Bill is passed that area remains part of the city, but next door to it there is the Clontarf electoral district which has a population of 49,900 but only five seats. The people in the Clontarf area are at least as entitled to the same representation as the people in the Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle area.  I am simply using these examples to illustrate the inequality that will result if the Minister's proposal of 52 seats in the city area and 78 seats in the county council area is accepted.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate how the additional seven seats he is proposing for the city were decided on.  The present number in this respect is 45.  What kind of rationale was used in this decision? Why not five seats, ten seats or 17 seats?  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  In considering equality of representation as between local authorities, it is necessary, from a practical point of view, to give some weight to factors other than strict equality. If a council are to function properly a certain minimum membership is necessary, but if the membership is above a certain level the council may become unwieldy with a consequential fall-off in efficiency.  Similarly, the same level of representation may not be essential in, say, a compact fully built-up county borough as in a county that is physically large but thinly populated.  It may be that different scales might be appropriate in different kinds of authorities.  It might be said, for instance, that Dublin city is under-represented by comparison with the rest of the country.  I would emphasise that representation of the county borough is being increased substantially &mdash; from 45 to 52 seats as from the next election &mdash;and it should be noted, too, that the effect of the boundary changes is to increase the population in the city <Col N="566" /> area by only 18,000.  The overall population of the county borough has shown a small but steady decline in recent years. Unlike the county council area, Dublin county borough is no longer a growth area.  I regard it as being treated reasonably from the representational point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to the number of seats in terms of ratio to population in what will be two different local authority areas.  Equally, he could point out the difference in representation between Leitrim and, say, Kildare and Wexford and ask why there are so few members in Kildare or Wexford compared with Leitrim.  The purpose of the proposals is to equalise the ratio as between members within their own local authority area. With the setting-up of three county councils a basic number of members is required so that the work can be done efficiently.  It is not reasonable to talk in terms of the new council membership being 78.  I prefer to indicate that the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area will have 28 members, that the Dublin-Belgard area will have 26 members and that the Dublin-Fingal area will have 24 members. These represent even a higher ratio than is the case in county councils in other parts of the country.  However, the lowest number one can reasonably apply to county councils is one to 180,000.  It is not a valid comparison to take what will be part of a county council constituency and compare it with a corporation constituency. The addition of seven members was a gesture to the corporation to increase their membership and to allow for more seats with the passage of time since the last election and in that way to bring more representation to population that is declining.  If we are to believe the reports that will be coming before us, the populations in these expanding areas, particularly in the case of Dublin-Fingal and the electoral county of Dublin-Belgard, will increase significantly in the coming years.  I cannot accept the amendment that has been put forward.  An attempt has been made to increase representation for the corporation area.  However, it is a compact homogenous area <Col N="567" /> and the representation at 52 is a reasonable balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment does not propose a decrease in the membership of the county council area but rather for an increase in the Dublin City Council area.  The Minister suggested that my example of comparing the Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle area with Clontarf was similar to comparing Leitrim with Kildare.  That is not so.  The geographical spread of the Clontarf area is smaller than the Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle area and the Minister's argument does not stand.</P>
      <P>I recognise there is need for a higher proportion of representation in the Leitrim area because of the sparse population and the distances involved but that does not apply in the areas I mentioned nor does it apply in the county council area as a whole.  To some extent there is a degree of spread in the county council area, say, as between the Balbriggan area and the Malahide area, but it does not compare with travelling from one end of Leitrim to another or from one end of Kildare to another.  His argument does not hold on that basis.  The Blanchardstown and Tallaght areas are heavily populated. In the Tallaght area there is in the region of 90,000 people and it is expected that the population in the Blanchardstown area will be the same if not more. Again, the argument of population spread or sparseness of population does not hold when arguing for a higher level of representation in those areas than in the city council area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other key point to which the Minister did not refer is that the municipal authority for the county and city will be drawn from councillors elected in the city and in the county area.  With a population of 100,000 fewer in the county area they will have 78 seats while Dublin city will have 52 seats.  There will be an undemocratic imbalance as between the two areas when the municipal council is established unless the Minister accedes to our request and the municipal council is elected by direct vote of the electorate.  As the <Col N="568" /> Minister is proceeding at the moment he is proposing to draw from representatives of the county council and the city council.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would prefer to consider Dublin County Council as three county councils which are what will exist following the final reorganisation.  He is also proposing to split Dublin city into six district councils.  I ask the Minister to respond in relation to the municipal council and the undemocratic imbalance that will arise because of the imbalance in representation.  Will he not agree there is no valid comparison between the Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle area and the Leitrim county area?  Will he also indicate how he arrived at the figure of seven extra seats?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy speaks about a municipal council I assume he is referring to the metropolitan council as mentioned in the Bill.  It is very difficult to see how a further increase of 33 members in the corporation, as proposed by the Deputy, can be justified on democratic grounds, that suddenly there would be more democracy because there are more members.  If that were so perhaps we should have another 200 Members in this House but that would look laughable when one compares the situation in Germany where there are 450 members for a population of 60 million.  I do not think 33 more members on Dublin Corporation can be justified in the present economic circumstances.  On the basis of efficiency, I do not see how that additional number would make Dublin Corporation more efficient.  If we were to accept this amendment it would mean an enormously increased workload for the present staff who would require extra personnel.  Judging by the amount of correspondence I get from Deputies, I can imagine what the housing section in Dublin Corporation would get in correspondence from 85 members, many of whom would make representations on behalf of the same person.  This proposal would be inefficient, uneconomic and totally unwieldy.  The Government have made a gesture to have increased representation <Col N="569" /> and they have provided for an extra seven seats for Dublin.  That decision was made on the basis that, with the passage of time since the last local elections, Dublin County Council could accept an additional membership of seven.  The numbers on the three new county councils being elected are no more than needed to enable the new councils to function properly.  Committees have to be set up, members have to be represented on various bodies and so on and a basic number is needed to properly service these committees.  On both sides the proportions are reasonably well met. Time will tell if we are wrong.  The membership of the metropolitan council and the basis on which it is nominated by the mainline authorities has not been settled at this stage.  The Deputy in suggesting that it would be a 50:50 split is away ahead of us.  It would be the aim that the nomination procedure should reflect a reasonable balance of population and interest as between the different councils making the nomination.  That would be the basis in relation to the nomination of the metropolitan council rather than to take the simplistic solution that the county councils will nominate 50 per cent and the corporation 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Minister has raised an interesting point.  I referred to the metropolitan council and not to the municipal council.  The Minister suggests that it will not be a 50:50 allocation from the three county councils and the Dublin City Council.  I am not arguing for that case either.  Dublin City Council and the three county councils would be right to expect to have representation on a new metropolitan council in line with the elected representation they have on their own councils.  That is why I say that 52 seats for a population of 540,000 presents an imbalance as against 78 seats for 450,000 people in the county council areas.  So far the Minister has not come up with an argument for or against maintaining that imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increase in costs which would result in increasing the number of seats from 45 to 85 in the <Col N="570" /> city area.  If that argument is valid at all, it is as valid in the county area, which is having an increase from 36 seats to 78 seats.  There would be more than double the expenses in the administering of the county area as three separate administrations are being set up.  In the city area we are talking about a single administration. I propose that local representation be increased.  I know this will create additional costs but if we are to use that argument we would not go ahead with the county council divisions or the increase in the number of seats in the county council area and we would not establish, for instance, the new Galway Borough Council. Where do we draw the line on costs? Is the line to be drawn only in relation to Dublin City Council?  I do not accept that as a valid argument.</P>
    <P>In relation to democracy, more seats meaning more democracy, it could be validly argued that more seats could mean more democracy in the sense that people would have a closer relationship with their representatives and they would have easier access to them and there would be an easier flow of information. We are not talking about democracy in a general sense but about local democracy. Local democracy is very necessary in highly populated areas because these are the areas where people feel most alienated and most separated from the community. In these areas we need more involvement of the people at local level and greater local representation on councils.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued that the Minister has not yet given us the basis on which he has come up with the seven extra seats for Dublin.  Does it relate to the expected decline in the population, or is it based on so many seats per head of population over 65, or what?  What was the logical, rational basis for providing seven extra seats?  If we knew that we could decide whether we could apply that to increasing or decreasing the number of seats across the board.</P>

      <P>The setting up of three new county councils and dividing the old Dublin County Council is a fundamental part of the Government's decision on local government reorganisation in the city and county of Dublin.  Taking into account the likely expansion that will take place in these areas, we have decided on the level of seating.  It was appreciated that there was to be a considerable increase in the number of seats in the county council area and, although one would not identify a county council seat as being the equivalent of a corporation seat and one could not consider a corporation member as being equivalent to a member of a county council in one of the smaller county councils &mdash; the comparison cannot just be made on that basis at all &mdash; it was decided that this increase in the county council should be reflected by some increase in the corporation area. The figure decided by Government was seven.  This was considered a reasonable increase on the basis that the population of the corporation area was in decline while in the other areas a considerable increase, which was likely to continue, took place.  That was the figure arrived at to represent some balance between the additional seats going to the totality of the three councils and yet, at the same time, to afford a reduction in the ratio of members to population in the corporation area.  This is a fundamental part of the Government's approach to the reorganisation of local government in the city.  I have given as complete an explanation as possible on this and I do not accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

      <P>Yes.  To go ahead and hold the elections on the basis that this will be done some time in the next election would be putting off the whole concept of the reorganisation of local government.  It should be done now.  New councillors will be aware of the new county council areas.  They will be familiar with the area they will be representing after the arrangements between the old council and the new body are operating. A number very much less than 78 would not be applying true democracy to county council status for three county councils. It is a fundamental part of the reorganisation that the three councils be set up but in advance of them becoming operational and for a lead in period there will be a county council of 78 members.  It is envisaged that that will disappear in a year or two, as soon as progress is made on the arrangements that will bring about independence in the three areas.  That is the reason why we have 28, 26 and 24 members for the three proposed county councils.</P>

      <P>This section proposes the establishment of the new city council. When the Minister of State was speaking here last week he said that, after the establishment of a new city council, it was proposed to establish district councils in each of the electoral areas to Dublin City Council.  In effect, that means a district electoral council in the Artane-Coolock-Raheny area, in the Glasnevin-Drumcondra-Clontarf area, in the Finglas-Cabra-Ashtown area, the inner city area, north and south, in the Crumlin-Drimnagh-Inchicore-Ballyfermot area and also in the Pembroke-Rathmines area.

It seems from what the Minister says that the members elected <Col N="577" /> to Dublin City Council in each of the six electoral areas will automatically also become members of these new district councils and that the district councils shall also comprise other persons who will represent the community but they will not be directly elected either through community councils or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain what the position will be in regard to persons who are elected to these new authorities?  In his introductory speech the Minister said that the people elected in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area will serve temporarily on Dublin County Council, which will consist of 78 members and which will continue in existence until agreement is reached on the divisions of staff, properties, responsibilities and so on between the new authorities, which the Minister confirms may take as long as two years.  If he estimates it will take as long as two years, it is obvious that it will take a lot longer.  It is also proposed that the Borough of Dún Laoghaire will continue in existence after the elections and that some of the people elected to the county of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will serve on Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and on Dublin County Council, which will have 78 members.  What exactly is the Minister proposing as regards the role of the elected members, particularly of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, after 20 June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Molloy and others may be a little confused about the interim period.  As regards Dublin city, the situation is straightforward. The city boundary is being adjusted under this Bill.  The electorate in June will be the electorate within the adjusted boundaries.  The electoral area will be the areas recommended by the boundary commission, electing a total of 52 members. The new city council will continue as before to be fully responsible for functions and services over the whole of the area of the city within the adjusted boundary.  There is no question of any interim or transitional situation in the city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the county three new county councils will be elected: Dublin-Fingal with 24 members, Dublin-Belgard with 26 members, and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown with <Col N="579" /> 28 members.  The boundaries of these county councils are being laid down in this Bill and take account of the changes in the city and county boundaries.  The electoral areas in the three new counties will be as recommended by the Dublin commission.</P>
    <P>The members elected will assume normal county council responsibilities in the three new counties as soon as the necessary arrangements for this have been made, and this will require further legislation and will take some time.  A considerable amount of detailed planning and consultation will also be essential.  In the meantime the members elected for the three new county councils will constitute the membership of the existing Dublin County Council.  The existing Dublin County Council with this membership will continue to function and to be responsible for services over the whole of the county area, excluding Dún Laoghaire Borough, during this transitional phase.  This transitional county council, therefore, will have a membership of 78.  Some may consider this too big and unwieldly to be an efficient council and, as I said to Deputy De Rossa, I am inclined to agree that the type and number are indeed too large. The arrangement is not ideal in the interim but it is the only means to satisfy two basic objectives.</P>
    <P>The first objective is that there will be elections in June, and by now I think we all agree to a new system of county councils in Dublin.  If this decision and commitment were not made now, there would be no fundamental organisational reform for another term of four or five years, and that kind of delay is simply not acceptable to the Government.  The numbers being elected are no more than will be needed to constitute the membership of the new county councils when they become operational.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to ensure that there will be no disruption in local authority services as the reform takes shape. For this reason Dublin county, with the increased membership, will continue to operate and provide services until the <Col N="580" /> new county councils are ready to take over.  Similarly, it is intended that Dún Laoghaire Corporation will continue to function and to provide services during the transitional period in the area of the borough, with membership made up from the electoral areas which approximate to the borough.  Section 16 of the Bill enables the Minister to determine these electoral areas.  The Dublin boundary commission have recommended three electoral areas with a total membership of 14 covering the area to the east of the Bray road, and these would appear to be the appropriate electoral areas for designation under the section in due course.</P>
    <P>Let me summarise the county situation. In the transitional period the 78 members elected to the three new county councils will make up the membership of Dublin County Council as we know it, and that council will continue to function and provide services over the whole of the county area, apart from Dún Laoghaire Borough, taking account of the changes in the city-county boundary being made under the Bill.  In addition, the members elected for the electoral areas which broadly correspond to the Borough of Dún Laoghaire as we know it will constitute the members of the borough council and that council will continue to function and provide services in the borough during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>I will be looking for the full co-operation of all the elected members in ensuring that reasonable and sensible arrangements will operate in regard to the holding of meetings and all other aspects of the transition programme.  I hope I have cleared up what the situation after the next election will be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The number of members to be elected from each electoral area, shall not be less than four.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put forward this amendment because I know from the report of the commission for the Dublin area that out of 20 electoral areas established by the commission seven are established as three-seat areas. It is probably generally accepted that as the proportionality of representation in an electoral area is reduced the smaller the number of seats.  Particularly in relation to local elections, where we are looking to local representatives to represent local people, it is important that any reasonably substantial number of the electorate who want a particular party, independent candidate or individual to represent them at local level should have a reasonable chance of having that person elected to represent them.  In three-seat areas that possibility is drastically reduced, given that in order to achieve election in a three-seat area something like 25 per cent of the valid poll must be won by a candidate.  The chances, therefore of a person's first choice being elected is fairly slim.  That is the main reason for putting forward this amendment. It seems to us that there is a reduction in the proportionality of our PR system.  After all, the electorate have twice rejected an effort to do away with the PR system and it is only right that this House should ensure that any system of electoral areas ensures that the people elected are representative of the electorate in their area.  It is unfortunate, regardless of what views we may hold about particular groups or political <Col N="583" /> parties, that through manipulating or adjusting the electoral system we keep people, such as the Provisionals, outside elected councils.  We should do everything possible to bring them in and encourage them to participate in the democratic process.  As a result of having three seat areas, particularly in the greater Dublin area, large sections of the population may feel disenfranchised as a result of the representatives they want not being elected.</P>
    <P>This amendment moves away from the principle of PR and that is unfortunate. In 1977 there was a major move towards three seat areas.  Fianna Fáil won an overwhelming majority far in excess of the proportion of votes they won.  I do not propose to go into the merits or demerits of that Government.  However, it is significant that subsequent to that an electoral commission moved back strongly towards four and five seat areas.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to re-examine the commission's proposals as they relate to the greater Dublin area and to eliminate the three seat areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to reject this amendment.  The House is aware that the reports of the two electoral area boundary commissions were presented to both Houses and that the recommendations of the commissions were accepted by the Government.  The Government announced their intention to implement the recommendations.  If the amendment was accepted it would mean rejecting the recommendations of the Dublin boundary commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Commission stipulated that in the case of Dublin County Borough and the three electoral councils, the new electoral areas should not have more than five seats in each. The House will accept that three seats are generally accepted as being the minimum for PR purposes.  Three seats constituencies have always figured in the constituency and electoral area arrangements. The commission did not propose something new nor did they set out to prevent parties or individuals from entering local <Col N="584" /> authority elections or from being elected.</P>
    <P>In the case of the two Dáil constituency commissions established in 1979 and 1983 the terms of reference in both cases provided for three seat constituencies.  This was also the position in the case of the European Assembly elections where there were five, four and three seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The commission were given terms of reference.  One may talk about elections where there were many three seat constituencies. In homogeneous areas a three seat constituency would be ideal.  The commission may well have taken that into account.</P>
    <P>We should reject this amendment.  I take the Deputy's point but this is not something new.  Three, four and five seats have always been there and by and large the system has worked well.  There is nothing wrong with it.  The commission did a very good job.  I do not think we should change their recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that it was a new development.  In fact I indicated that it had been tried in 1977, interestingly enough under a Coalition Government.  Subsequent electoral boundary commissions moved away from the three seat idea and opted for four and five seat areas.  Out of 20 electoral areas seven are three seat areas.  Slightly more than one-third of the electoral areas will have three seats.  There are discrepancies also as regards the population-seats ratio.</P>
      <P>The electoral system must surely ensure that the views of people in an area are fully represented and that they do not feel alienated from the process of democracy.  The preponderance of the three seat areas are in the county area, particularly in Blanchardstown and Tallaght. These are all heavily populated working class areas.  Six of the seven are in the county areas.  I am concerned that, as a result of having only three seat areas there, a large proportion of the population will feel excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the commission reported and the Government accepted that.  Therefore it cannot be changed.  I have my own views about the way in <Col N="585" /> which the terms of reference were drafted.  I have every faith in the integrity of the commission as established.  The terms of reference given to the commission, particularly as regards the Dublin area, were extremely restricted.  Guidelines were set down which virtually precluded the commission from going outside particular boundaries.  For example, the terms of reference referred to splitting Dublin city into six districts and indicated the geographical areas which should comprise those districts.  The terms of reference for the county indicated that the Government wanted three county council areas and also indicated the geographical areas which should comprise those.  They also indicated the population &mdash; elected members ratio for each of those areas and said there should be no more than five seats for any electoral area.  They stated there should be two electoral areas in each district.  There were tight terms of reference given to the commission and the variations which the commission could be expected to come up with, within those terms of reference, were limited.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the Government had no hand, act or part in the outcome of the commission's deliberations.  They set the terms of reference.  The commission operated within those terms of reference and came up with the answer.  In the Dáil we are entitled to suggest that three seat areas are not the best, particularly for the local elections where we want to have as many political viewpoints as possible represented at local level.  For that reason I urge the Minister to look again at the question of three seat areas and to eliminate them where that is practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy De Rossa is making a real case.  He said the commission's hands were tied, particularly in Dublin city where we have six district council areas.  In the Dublin city area where there are 52 seats there is only one three seat electoral area.  There are five five seat electoral areas and six four seat electoral areas.  That is a reasonable balance.  The three seater is in a homogeneous <Col N="586" /> area around the Cabra area which has its own identity.  The commission were not hidebound or constricted by their terms of reference.</P>
      <P>In the county where there are two district electoral areas they had more discretion to operate outside the three seaters if they wanted to.  There are new growth towns and the commission may have taken that into consideration.  I do not know.  They were not inhibited in their work by the terms of reference set down by the Government.  Their terms of reference were fairly wide.  They had a wide remit.  Deputy De Rossa talked about the three seaters in 1977 when the Government fell.  In 1969 there were a number of three seat constituencies. Three, four and five seat constituencies have always been part of our electoral system.  By and large this has worked well and I do not see any reason why it will not continue to operate in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister why there was a significant difference in the terms of reference given to the commission which dealt with the Dublin area as against the terms of reference of the commission which dealt with the areas outside Dublin.  In the case of the Dublin area the terms of reference stated that in establishing electoral areas new electoral areas were to have no more than five seats each.  They were debarred from having an electoral area with more than five seats.  They were free to range from five to one because there was no limit on the downward swing.  The result of the commission's deliberations within those terms of reference was a recommendation to have some three, some four and some five seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the terms of reference for the county areas we see that where there were in existence electoral areas which had more than eight councillors they were to recommend the subdivision of those areas into electoral areas of not fewer than four seats.  It is difficult to understand why a different set of instructions was given to them.  The Dublin area <Col N="587" /> with the highest population can have electoral areas with three elected members. In the rural areas the commission were not allowed to recommend three seat electoral areas when they were subdividing an electoral area which had in excess of eight councillors.  One would have thought the proper thing to do would be to take cognisance of the geographic and demographic difficulties experienced by elected councillors in the rural areas.  The electorate is scattered over a much wider area and it would make more sense to allow three seat electoral areas.</P>
    <P>In the urban areas where the community are closer together there would not be the same distance to be travelled and it would have made more sense to have bigger electoral areas.  The thinking was contrary to that.  I wonder why there was a difference in the terms of reference.  If it was thought to be correct to instruct members of the commission dealing with Dublin to create electoral areas of not more than five seats, why was the same instruction not given to those dealing with the county areas to create electoral areas of not more than five seats?  This would have allowed them to establish three seat areas especially in very thinly populated areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin area it has always been the established practice that the maximum number of seats was five.  We did not put on a bottom rung and that indicates that we did not put any stranglehold on the commission.  We put on an upper limit for Dublin because that has always been the tradition so far as I can remember.  Looking at the area outside Dublin we saw areas where there were more than seven seats.  Traditionally there were a larger number of seats outside the Dublin area.  That was the accepted practice.  We felt seven was a reasonable figure and that anything with more than seven should be subdivided. Otherwise it would be too unwieldy.  It did not seem reasonable to ask councillors to represent a very widespread area. By subdividing it we brought order into it.  That was the thinking in setting down <Col N="588" /> the terms of reference.  There was no Machiaevellian plot.  In an area where there are more than seven seats we must ask should there not be some subdivision in the interests of reasonable order.  On balance the Government made the right decision.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be any reasonable, rational explanation given to this.  I know that in some of the exercises which some local authorities carried out it would have suited to have created a three seat constituency where there was a natural divide &mdash; such as a lake, or mountain, or community divide, natural local conditions in town centres and so forth.  In some of the exercises which I did, obviously a three seat would have been the correct number to meet the particular circumstances.  However, because of that bar it was not possible to do it.  We are asking in the House, of the people who drew up the terms of reference, why they wrote it in that way.  Why did they give permission to the Dublin commission to establish three seat electoral areas but debar the county commission from doing this, bearing in mind that the only areas where they would come up against this problem was where there was a large number of councillors, exceeding seven?  Rightly, they were required to make some sort of subdivision, but it is strange that it was confined to not fewer than four.</P>

With regard to areas outside Dublin there was no bar on three seaters except where a subdivision was taking place.

      <P>The Minister has entered an area which defies logic.  On the one hand, nobody in this House has impugned or questioned in any way the integrity of either of the two commissions that have been established and no one is attempting to do so.  In putting a restriction of four on areas outside Dublin, and putting a maximum figure of five on the Dublin area, it is fairly clear that the Government were making a political decision.  It was not the commission who made the political decision.  There is hardly anybody in this House who does <Col N="591" /> not know that the Minister of State, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Energy and others perhaps had pored for many months over the maps and figures for all the areas, to see how best the terms of reference could be put together for their independent commission. It is treating us as little children to expect us to accept that there were no political implications in the terms of reference which were given to the commission concerned.  The reality is that a third of the electoral areas in greater Dublin have three seat electoral constituencies. That will disenfranchise a great number of people in the greater Dublin area.  No amount of arguing and double backtracking in this House will get over that fact. I am appealing to the Minister to apply the same rules in the Dublin area as he applied outside Dublin and have not fewer than four seats in any of the electoral areas.</P>

      <P>First, I want to make it quite clear that nobody is being disenfranchised by anything which has been done.  I repudiate that suggestion from Deputy De Rossa.  With regard to the question of the number of seats in Dublin, I repeat there are five seaters, four seaters and three seaters, which always has been the practice.  With regard to areas outside Dublin, the maximum is seven, not four.  There is no minimum, but there was nothing to prevent the commission from making a three seater constituency, except where a subdivision was taking place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are the terms of reference for the commission for outside Dublin that with an eight seat constituency it should be subdivided four and four?  I do not accept the Minister's simplistic answer.  In some areas there are obvious geographic divides.  Take the town of Athlone, which is built mainly on one side of the river.  An obvious divide would have been the River Shannon. Why were the commission hamstrung into dividing four and four, rather than five and three?  I have not got an answer to my question.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that nobody had been disenfranchised.  I can give an example of an electoral area in County Mayo where the home town of a city councillor was put into another area. Effectively that man is now sitting on the fence.  He just does not know what to do. This is something to which the commission could have turned their minds.  Some of the electoral areas stretch as far as from Dublin to Mullingar &mdash; 48 or 50 miles.  I cannot honestly say why if a genuine effort was made, something like that would not have been taken into account.  As Deputy Nolan said, the Minister's answer in relation to the division of the eight-seater &mdash; if there were to be an eight-seater &mdash; is much too simplistic. If one looks at the maps one will see that what has happened in very many areas is that no account has been taken of natural boundaries &mdash; in some areas mountains are crossed to get four-seaters when a three-seater and a five-seater would have been much easier, effective and more representative.</P>
      <P>The commission were put in a straitjacket.  Everybody in this House knows they were placed in a straitjacket, that they did the job in accordance with their terms of reference, and they were laid down so strictly that they could do very little else.

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 19, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>19.  &mdash;(1)  (a)  On the commencement of this subsection, the area described in the Fourth Schedule to this Act shall, for the purposes of the local elections next occurring after such commencement, be detached <Col N="594" /> from the County Health District of Galway and from the jurisdiction and powers of the council of the county of Galway (in so far as they relate to such purposes) and be added to the Borough of Galway, and on and from such commencement the said area shall be included in, and form part of, the said borough for the said purposes and the boundary of that borough shall be altered accordingly.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Minister may by order make such incidental, consequential and supplementary provisions as appear to him to be expedient to enable paragraph (a) of this subsection to have effect for the purposes of the elections referred to in that paragraph.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister shall by order provide that the boundary alteration effected by subsection (1) of this section shall (in addition to having effect for the purposes specified in the said subsection (1)) have effect for such other purposes as shall be specified in the order.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where an order under subsection (2) of this section has not been made prior to the local elections next occurring after the commencement of subsection (1) of this section, then, pending the making and coming into operation of the said order, each of the persons elected at the aforesaid local elections to the council of the Borough of Galway shall be the members of and, as regards the period beginning on the day of their coming into office and ending on the commencement of the said order, shall act as the council for the said borough as it existed immediately prior to the making of the boundary changes effected by the said subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(4)  For the purposes of giving effect to the order required to be made by subsection (2) of this section, the Minister may either by that order or by another order&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> (a) make a provision similar to or to the same effect (with any modifications which the Minister may consider appropriate in the particular circumstances) as any provision contained in the Second Schedule to this Act, and</P>
    <P>(b) do anything which may be done by order under section 24 of this Act, and</P>
    <P>(c) make such other provision (if any), as the Minister shall think proper, in relation to any matter whatsoever.</P>
    <P>(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prejudicing the generality of section 24 of this Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from the recommendations of the City and County Borough Electoral Areas Boundary Commission.  While under its terms of reference the commission was required to consider boundary alterations in the case of Cork, Limerick and Galway a boundary alteration was recommended only in the case of Galway.  This new section will therefore apply only to Galway.  It will provide for the transfer to the borough of the area recommended by the commission and agreed locally. The area to be added to the borough is described in the Fourth Schedule being inserted by amendment No. 27.</P>
    <P>The new section 19 provides that the boundary alteration will have effect for electoral purposes and requires the Minister to make an order giving effect to the boundary alteration for other purposes. I would hope to make this order before the June elections and consultations in this regard are under way with the local authorities.  This order will contain standard provisions normally included in boundary extension orders along the lines of those contained in the Second Schedule to the Bill which apply to the Dublin City/County boundary alterations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (a) provides for the alteration of the boundary of the borough <Col N="596" /> for the purposes of the June local elections. The areas to be added are described in the Fourth Schedule which is being inserted by amendment No. 27.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (b) enables the Minister to make by order any supplementary provisions necessary to enable subsection (1) (a) to have effect.  For example, this order will deal with the register of electors and will enable appropriate arrangements to be made in regard to the polling places and districts within the added area.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) requires the Minister to make an order giving effect to the boundary alteration for other purposes.  This order will provide that the boundary alteration will apply for all purposes.  Subsection (4) relates to the provisions to be included in this order.  It is intended that this order will be made prior to June.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is a safety clause which provides that in event of an order not being made under subsection (2) giving effect to the boundary alteration for all purposes prior to the June elections, then the members elected at those elections would not be responsible for the added area until the order was made; this area would remain the responsibility of the county council.  This would be an undesirable situation.  This subsection is therefore intended as a safety net to deal with this situation should it for some extraordinary reason arise.  I fully intend that the necessary order is made prior to the June elections.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that the provisions to be included in the order under subsection (2) giving effect to the boundary alteration for all purposes may include: (a) provisions similar to any provision contained in the Second Schedule which are the provisions applying in the case of the Dublin City/County boundary alteration and are the standard provisions usually applying to boundary alterations such as phasing in of rates liability, application of development plans, by-laws, notices served, etc.  It is intended that provision for the phasing in of rates and for the payment of compensation will be included in the order as in the case of Dublin; (b) provisions which may be made under section 24 which enables the <Col N="597" /> Minister to make any provisions necessary to enable this Act to have full effect; (c) any other provision relating to any other matter arising in relation to the boundary alteration.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) is a saver designed to ensure that the provisions of section 24 are unaffected by this section.  Section 24 enables the Minister to make by order any additional provisions necessary to enable this Act to have full effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has special historical significance for my native city of Galway.  I welcome the proposed extension of the boundary of Galway city.  Galway has a long history of involvement in the local government system and only last year celebrated the 500th anniversary of the establishment of Galway Corporation and the local authority in the city area.  The establishment of the mayorship has a long history spreading back over those 500 years.  The decision to extend the boundary is the result of meetings held between Galway Corporation and Galway County Council.  It is appropriate that I express appreciation to the members of both of these local authorities, but in particular to the members of Galway County Council who have so generously agreed to cede part of the county area to enable this expansion to take place.</P>
      <P>However, there is one sad fact I wish to bring to the Minister's attention, that when the council took that decision it was taken on the condition that there would be adequate compensation paid and suitable arrangements made for that, and we assumed that such would happen.  It was also taken on the assumption that the agreed recommendation of both local authorities in the Galway area in regard to the new electoral areas to be created would be accepted.  Unfortunately, the commission did not accept the recommendation to establish a seven-seat electoral area in the Connemara area, west of the Corrib and west of this extended city boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall result of this is very unfair <Col N="598" /> to the councillors who entered into discussions and arrived at decisions based on certain other matters.  The Minister is accepting the decision regarding the extension of the city boundary but he is not accepting the recommendations from Galway County Council in regard to the new county electoral areas to be extended following the change brought about by the expansion of the city into the old Galway electoral area.  That decision was unanimous at Galway County Council level but it would not have been unanimous if it had been known that the Minister would not be accepting other recommendations of the councillors, recommendations that were part of the overall package.  Some councillors have been left in a very awkward position as a result of the recommendations of the commission.  It is very unfair that people who acted in good faith should be let down subsequently by a decision of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann solemnly declares it will reject any arrangements which will permit access by Spanish or Portuguese fishing boats to what is referred to as The Irish Box in the present EEC negotiations on the enlargement of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more than a year now we in Fianna Fáil have been pointing to the disastrous consequences that would result for the Irish fishing industry by reason of the enlargement of the Community consequent on the accession of Spain and Portugal unless adequate steps were taken in the negotiations to protect the Irish industry and to safeguard our vital interests. On every occasion on which we raised the issue, whether by way of debate here on motions relating to fishing <Col N="599" /> affairs, or motions dealing with developments in the Community, or by way of parliamentary question, we were given assurances that no agreement would be entered into that would be detrimental to the development of the industry or to its future prospects.  It is emerging now from the recent discussions that our worst fears have been realised and that, unwittingly or otherwise, the Government have accepted a position that will spell the death knell for our fishing industry. They appear to have agreed that enlargement of the Community, with all the unfavourable aspects that would follow from our point of view, is more important than holding out in the negotiations for an agreement that would ensure adequate protection for our fisheries and enable further expansion and development of the industry.</P>
    <P>We contend that Irish fisheries have been sold out, that jobs in the industry have been put at risk, that confidence has been undermined and that the prospect of further development and expansion of the industry has been damaged.  The whole affair has been handled badly.  It has been poorly negotiated.  The outcome will be disastrous for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>In June 1984 I expressed our deep concern at the manner in which the negotiations had been conducted and I pointed to the implications for the industry in the event of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  It was obvious that for technical, administrative and indeed, political reasons it would be impossible to meet the deadline that had been set for the conclusion of the negotiations.  That was the view also of experienced people in the industry, people who had been following the course of the discussions.  It was the widespread belief also of the fishing industry in the Community generally.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of preparedness, of discussion and of examination of the complex issues involved there was a general understanding throughout the Community that the deadline could not be met, that in the final analysis a decision would be reached without full and adequate consideration or without taking <Col N="600" /> into account the implications for the long term development of the industry and that a decision would be reached in the final days in which it was decided to conclude negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy which represented a fragile balance between the member states involved a period of six years discussions and negotiations.  The enlargement of the Community to include Spain with its fleet of 17,500 fishing trawlers would obviously endanger the very fine balance of that policy. It is obvious also that with regard to access to fishing waters, enlargement would have a dramatic impact not only for Ireland but for all the fishing interests in the Community.  In short, the entire marine resources management policy of the Community would be endangered. This view has been expressed also by responsible people in the industry throughout Europe.  A further implication is the extraction of marine resources by vessels operating under third country flags which would have free access to the markets.  Conservation measures, protection policies and development prospects would all be affected. The lack of consideration given to the issues involved would mean that permanent re-negotiation would be needed and this inevitably would destroy the confidence of fishermen in the Community. The whole operation of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy that was arrived at after protracted negotiations, would be put in jeopardy at a very early stage and before it had the opportunity to work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The most immediate impact of enlargement for the Irish fishing industry would be the presence in our fishing waters of the huge Spanish fleet.  Even in the best regulated fishing regime, the cost is massive in terms of protecting our fishing rights but it is even more forbidding when it is clear that large sections of the northern Spanish fleet now operate illegally. For evidence of this one need only have regard to the figures for convictions of Spaniards in respect of illegal fishing in Community areas.  In our exclusive area in the past few years, many Spanish vessels <Col N="601" /> have been apprehended.  In 1982 there were convictions in respect of 30 Spanish vessels and in 1983 the figure was 43.  Of the 29 foreign boats apprehended in 1984, 24 were Spanish registered and five were ex-Spanish vessels that were registered in the UK.  The fines in respect of our area for 1981 in this regard totalled £1,033,672.  The fines in respect of 1984 will total more than £500,000 and there are probably other very substantial fines yet to be imposed for that year.</P>
    <P>The protection of our exclusive fishing area is a big problem.  We have a coastline of 1,737 miles.  The 200 mile exclusive fishing limit gives us a sea area of approximately 132,000 square miles to patrol and protect.  For the year 1980 there were 25 convictions for illegal fishing in those waters.  The number of vessels apprehended represents only a small proportion of the numbers operating illegally in our waters.  It is important that strict vigilance in respect of our fishing area is maintained.  This has been done in the past.  Nevertheless it is clear that protection will become more important in the future because many foreign vessels will encroach on our exclusive areas as their own fishing grounds become denuded of stock.  It is evident that this will pose enormous problems for our hard-pressed protection services.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there has been increased illegal activity recently by Spanish boats in anticipation of Spain becoming a member of the EC and once agreement is reached there will be increasing pressure to secure quotas and access to our exclusive areas.  Fianna Fáil have complained consistently of the lack of information emanating from the discussions and the failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries to disclose what has taken place behind closed doors in Brussels.</P>
    <P>We criticised strongly the system that has developed where negotiations in such a complex and complicated area are being handled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department.  I have every confidence in his ability to negotiate but we think the primary responsibility for negotiating in this delicate and complex <Col N="602" /> area which is so involved and interwined with fishery development in the Community should be the responsibility of the Minister for Fisheries.  It is not good enough that he sits in as an observer at these important discussions: he should be involved directly in the negotiations.  We may well suffer as a consequence.  It is our opinion that the Minister should be involved directly in the negotiations and now in the days prior to the next round of discussions we urge that the system that has been adopted in recent times be changed and direct responsibility given to the Minister for Fisheries to finalise that agreement.</P>
    <P>It is true that an understanding emerged in the early discussions that the Irish Government would hold out for a definite transitional period and it was understood by all involved that the present fishing regime would be frozen at present levels.  We understood that negotiations would proceed for the integration of Spain with the Community's fishing industry during the transitional period but that there would be no escalation of Spanish activity in our areas in that period.  We understood that the principle we had adopted in the framework agreement we signed previously would be adhered to: in other words, that there would be a systematic phasing out of Spanish activity within Irish coastal areas and that that principle would not be changed.  This had ensured that during the five years of the operation of the framework agreement Spanish fishing within Irish coastal areas had been reduced by 50 per cent.  It was considered important that during the transitional period Spain would rationalise its fleet, reduce its capacity and generally streamline its efforts by getting rid of its overcapacity and its obsolete boats and thus fit into the Community fishing fleet when the transitional period would have expired. By then it was hoped the Spanish Government and the Spanish fleet would accept their responsibilities fully, not only in relation to their behaviour in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy but also in the way they operated their fleet so that we would not have the illegal <Col N="603" /> flouting of the law that is taking place on an ever-increasing scale by the Spanish fleet at the moment.</P>
    <P>The length of the transitional period has been the subject of some discussion here.  On the last occasion when we debated the issue the Minister for Fisheries pointed out that it was the first time he had heard of a 20-year transitional period.  I would remind the Minister that in December in the debate here on developments in the European Communities I spoke of the need for a 20-year transitional period from the date of Spain's accession to the Common Market during which time the issues I raised would be discussed, negotiated and decided upon. I said there should be no question of any escalation of fishing activity in that 20-year period.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted in the industry that until the summit in Dublin there was no question whatever of anything less than a 20-year transitional period from the date of entry of Spain and Portugal, which will be 1 January 1986.  It was with some alarm we learned in the Dáil from the Minister that not alone had the demand for the 20-year transitional period been abandoned but that what was being discussed was a situation where a transitional period would not apply at all. A Community offer was on the table that would give Spain access on the basis of 1984 quantities to the species it currently enjoys and this would be extended to allow Spain catches in other species that were to be determined such as horse mackerel and blue whiting within a transitional licensing system.  Horse mackerel and blue whiting are two species where we could expect to see some exploitation by Irish fishermen in the development of our fishing industry in the next few years. Because of the stock situation the traditional species we have been fishing in the past years are under strict control.  It is essential to expand our fishing industry and to develop it and we must have adequate availability of horse mackerel and blue whiting if we are to have such expansion in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> The transitional arrangements that have been talked about by the Commission would last possibly for ten years but with the possibility that it could be reduced to eight years if satisfactory post-transitional arrangements could be adopted by the Commission and by the Council. If such arrangements could not be implemented the ten-year transitional period would be extended for a further five years.  There was some surprise expressed that the summit had agreed not a 20-year transitional period but a ten-year period with the possibility of a further five years extension.  Apparently in the later Commission proposals it seemed to well informed people who were watching developments that not only was the ten-year transitional period with a further extension of five years being abandoned but that the Spanish fishing fleet would be entitled to get inside the Irish box in seven years.  This was totally unacceptable and we made this point clear in discussions here.  There was also a proposal to give access to fishing for hake, monkfish, pollack and many other varieties in regard to which we consider there is a prospect for future development.</P>
    <P>There was a bid to expel boats from the North Sea area but there did not appear to be any provision whereby large parts of the Spanish fleet which fish in non-Community waters would be prevented from entering Community zones which would pose a further problem for us.  What we are seeing is a total sell-out of the Irish position which will put the Irish fishing industry into the dark ages and which will put a brake on further development of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of access and quotas some very important issues appear to have been glossed over in the rush to find agreement.  There is a growing fear that fish and fish products produced by member states will be displaced by similar products coming onto the market from Spain.  It is then anticipated that because of the huge demand and the huge Spanish market for fish there would be an opportunity here for fish markets for the Irish fishing industry.  It is well known that Spain has many third country agreements. <Col N="605" /> They have over 106 joint ventures and we have little or no information from the Minister as to what effects these arrangements will have on fish markets, fish prices and on the jobs in the processing industry here.</P>
    <P>We are dissatisfied with the situation in the area of structural development. The Commission were apparently hampered by the lack of information in relation to the size and the state of the Spanish fleet.  It is understood that Spain will require substantial sums for modernisation and for the disposal of obsolete vessels.  The lack of information from the negotiations leaves us in a position where we are not satisfied that adequate funding will be available from the structural policy of the Common Fisheries Policy to fund the modernisation of the Irish fleet so that the restructuring we need as urgently as any fleet in the Community will be done through funding by the Community, bearing in mind that at present Community funds are under severe pressure and there are no indications that there will be a substantial increase in the funds set aside for structural improvement.</P>
    <P>In relation to the council meeting last week, which brought about this motion, it was obvious from reports from Brussels last Wednesday that in the negotiations concessions have been made by our negotiating team which clearly admitted that the exclusive position in the 50 mile box was to be breached after a ten year period.  In other words, Spain would get access to the Irish box after the ten year transition period.  There was some doubt as to whether or not that was agreed. This would mean that increasing pressure would be brought on us to get access to the 12 to six mile limit.  The failure to get any worthwhile assurance from the Minister for Defence who replied to a Private Notice Question last week on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the confusion which resulted at the Foreign Affairs Council Meeting on Thursday night, demands this evening a clear and unambiguous statement from the Minister and the Minister of State if possible, as to what has taken place in Brussels in these final negotiations.  It <Col N="606" /> was obvious from press reports of what transpired that the Minister felt he had agreement but was not sure whether or not he had an agreement.  It is equally obvious that the French Minister objected on behalf of his industry because he was not satisfied with the control on the number of boats getting into the French coastal areas.  It was also obvious that the Danish Government were prepared to use their powers of veto to keep Spanish boats under control in the North Sea area.  This was made quite clear by the Danish foreign office in a statement issued in Copenhagen, clearly indicating that the Danish Government in the fisheries negotiations were not satisfied with the increased Spanish activity which they were anticipating in their fishing areas and that they were prepared to use their powers of veto to hold up any agreement on the common policy which would be adopted by the Community and Spain.  Our negotiating team, both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries, were out-manoeuvred by the Danish and French Ministers. The Irish position is now critical. Apparently we have agreed to an infringement of the Irish box after a short transitional period which can be negotiated further before these negotiations are concluded so that we will be left in a very vulnerable position as regards the Spanish fleet.  The French Government have no intention of letting the Spanish fleet into their area; the Danes have threatened to use their powers of veto, but we have accepted a situation which will inevitably mean that much greater pressure will be directed towards us if the Spanish authorities and the Spanish negotiating team wish to encroach further into our areas.  We want an assurance from the Minister here tonight, from not only the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Fisheries but from the Taoiseach, that in the event of failure to rectify the situation in the negotiations that will take place this week there will be a very hard line adopted by the Taoiseach at the summit to ensure that there is no weakening of our position and that there is no question <Col N="607" /> of abandoning our position of maintaining our exclusive 50 mile box.</P>
    <P>In proposing the motion we are not prepared to sacrifice a national interest in the fishing area for enlargement of the Community to satisfy other member states who appear to be more interested in enlargement for reasons other than social or economic development.  We are seeking vote support in the Dáil for this motion and asking those who value the development and preservation of our natural resources to back this motion.  We believe it to be in the national interest to take a stand on this issue now.  The House cannot accept that the 13,000 people employed in the fishing industry can be deprived of their livelihoods or be driven from the industry.  The future prospects for the preservation and development of a major national industry cannot be threatened. There is no alternative for the Taoiseach except to scrap this deal which has been negotiated and to ensure that in the summit there will be no sell out of the Irish position in these negotiations.</P>

      <P>Early on we recognised the importance of enlargement of the Community and the need to have a carefully documented case and a strong stance taken in the enlargement negotiations. We, in the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC who meet on a regular basis undertook in a motion debated last year to have a very thorough examination of the whole industry carried out and to express a view on the implications of enlargement of the Community for our fishing industry.  We in the committee sought a special debate in the Dáil on the issue.  Permission was not given and we have used any opportunity available to us both in Parliamentary Questions, Private Notice Questions and in various debates on the Estimates and on motions in this House to put on <Col N="608" /> record our serious worries about the fishing industry in this new situation which is developing.</P>
      <P>We are totally dissatisfied with the way the negotiations have been handled to date.  We have tabled the motion in the hope that, even at this late stage, we can make the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries aware of the seriousness of the matter.  I hope they will realise that and rectify the matter before any permanent damage is done to our fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to get an opportunity to support Deputy Daly in his plea to the House on behalf of the fishing industry.  The necessity to protect an industry that has only started to develop in recent years cannot be overemphasised. We must ensure that it is fully protected and allowed reach its full potential.  The danger that the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community will mean that our industry will be overrun is very real.  The indications are that in our negotiations the Government have not been as successful as they should in their efforts to protect the industry.  It is essential that there should be a 20-year transition period.  The now famous Irish box must be guaranteed and our fishing industry must be given complete protection. There is a great danger that with the advent of Spain and Portugal there will be a complete upheaval in the fishing industry not alone around our coasts but throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge investment by committed people in the industry down the years.  This is a time of worry and apprehension for those involved in that investment.  It is vital that those involved in the negotiations on our behalf adopt a stance that will protect the interests of those people.  The huge investment in fishing, one of our great natural resources, must be protected.  It must be remembered that the Spanish fleet is larger than the total European fleet.  On that basis alone one can see the impact the arrival of boats from the country in our fishing grounds will have.  There is no doubt that it will be catastrophic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="609" /> Our fishing industry has a long way to go before it reaches its full potential. It is imperative that in the negotiations measures are adopted to protect our industry.  In 1975, 2,270 fishermen were employed full time here and that figure rose by 1982 to 3,675.  In part time employment in 1975 there were 4,360 and that figure rose by 1982 to 5,300.  Those figures illustrate the importance of the fishing industry to our economy.  In processing in 1975 about 1,300 people were employed and that had increased by 1982 to 2,000.  The huge investment in our fleet will go for nought if Spain and Portugal are granted permission to fish in our fishing grounds and it is questionable if our industry is in a position to withstand competition from those countries.  State expenditure in 1983 by BIM, the Department of Fisheries and Roinn na Gaeltachta amounted to £25 million &mdash; BIM made a fleet investment in the region of £9 million.  That investment will be money down the drain if Spain and Portugal are allowed plunder our fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>The development of the industry here has been concentrated in small areas.  The large vessels which have a considerable catching capacity operate from the Donegal coast.  Up to now mackerel has been the principal species caught and marketed but if that species is endangered there is a danger that the industry will fall flat on its face.  There has been a considerable growth in the tonnage landed.  In 1970 77,500 tonnes were landed and in 1982 206,000 tonnes were landed.  The growth in the tonnage landed was in the main in mackerel.  It has risen from 1,000 tonnes to 110,000 tonnes over a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>With regard to harbour and port development in recent years, I should like to say that Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveal and Killybegs have been the main centres of activity; but, unfortunately, Clogher Head in my constituency and Schull in County Cork have suffered as a result of an over concentration in those areas.  The harbour in Clogher Head is falling into the sea and it is doubtful if there is a commitment by <Col N="610" /> the Department to the development of the fishing industry in that area.  Fishermen in Clogher Head have been agitating for some time to have necessary repairs carried out.  They have called for investment by the Department of Fisheries in Clogher Head but to date their request has fallen on deaf ears.  The Government should take an urgent look at this and ensure that the rights of fishermen in those areas are protected.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry ranks as one of our greatest natural resources and because of that I cannot over emphasise the need for the Government to adopt a firm stance in the negotiations with Spain and Portugal. I am worried that Minister Barry and Minister of State O'Keeffe have failed in the negotiations.  Obviously, they do not have any interest in the fishing industry. If one takes note of the fact that about 13,000 people are employed in the industry one will realise how important it is to protect our fishing rights.  I appeal to those concerned in the negotiations to stand firm and ensure that our fishing industry is protected and allowed to develop in the years to come.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declares its support for the efforts of the Government to ensure an outcome favourable to the further development of the Irish fishing industry in the fisheries chapter of the accession negotiations between the European Community and the applicant countries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons why Deputy Daly's motion is not acceptable to the Government are straightforward.  The motion tabled by Deputy Daly is based on the incorrect and unsustainable premise that it would be possible to permanently exclude Spanish and Portuguese fishing from the waters covered by the Irish box.  Deputy Daly changed his tune tonight &mdash; Deputy <Col N="611" /> Kirk repeated that change &mdash; and I presume they will be voting for my amendment tomorrow night.  Deputies opposite now say they want a 20 year exclusion, although their motion, which is contrary to EC practice, calls for a permanent exclusion.  The deputy leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Lenihan, last year was calling for a 15 year exclusion. As is usual with the Opposition, confusion reigns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly and his party are very well aware that it has always been accepted in the Community that the Community's rules would eventually require non-discriminatory treatment on the issue of access to the waters of the enlarged Community for all members of the enlarged Community and that, subject to any temporary derogations which might be negotiated, a time would come when there would be no basis on which to exclude Spain, or indeed any other member state of the enlarged Community, from the waters in the Irish box. Those who are familiar with the history of the negotiations on the Irish box will know that the concept of the prohibition of fishing by Spain, and by other third countries, in a box, no point of which could be less than 50 miles from the Irish coast, arose initially in the context of the Community's fisheries relations with third countries following the Hague Agreement of 1976.  Ireland insisted upon, and secured, the exclusion of Spanish fishing from the Irish box in return for our acceptance of the bilateral Framework Agreement of 1980 between the Community and Spain.  What was involved was the exclusion of a third country, Spain, from a particular area of Community waters.  This was the price to be paid by that third country for the fishing rights which it enjoys in other parts of the Community's waters.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the words &ldquo;third country&rdquo; in relation to the creation of the Irish box, since Spain and Portugal will no longer be third countries when they accede to membership of the Community. Subject to any transitional arrangements or temporary derogations <Col N="612" /> which may be negotiated, these countries will have the same rights, and the same obligations, as other member states of the Community.  These are plain facts which Fianna Fáil Deputies should face up to &mdash; unless, that is, they wish to suggest that the two countries concerned should not be permitted to become members of the Community, which I presume is not their intention, although it was implicit in Deputy Daly's remarks.  To suggest that members of the Community could be permanently excluded from the Community waters covered by the Irish box is merely to seek to mislead public opinion in regard to the rights of member states of the Community.  I have to say that I find the content of the motion tabled by Deputy Daly very strange indeed, especially since the Deputy Leader of his party, in vol. 356, col. 1789, of the Official Report, in the debate on fisheries on 6 March, said that &ldquo;there must not be any compromise in regard to the box... during a transitional period&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should not have to say so to this House, but the Opposition motion compels me to emphasise once more in the strongest manner that the Government have spared no effort throughout the accession negotiations on fisheries with Spain and Portugal to secure an outcome favourable to the further development of the Irish fishing and fish processing industry.  The Government remain determined to secure such an outcome.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is a need to put matters in some perspective and to say something about the history of very difficult negotiations which are now, I hope, very near to an end.  The difficulties so far as Irish interests are concerned have been with Spain.  Portugal's interest in developing fishing activities in the waters of the existing Community are very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy became a fully fledged Community policy on 1 January 1983.  The question of excluding Spain from participation in that policy does not arise.  What is at issue in the Community's negotiations with Spain is the question of how Spain is to be integrated <Col N="613" /> into that policy, from the date of Spain's accession and during the lifetime of the policy in its present form, that is, up to the year 2002, without causing any serious upheaval in the balance which was finally achieved in this laboriously negotiated policy.  The means for avoiding upheaval in the balance of the Common Fisheries Policy, following Spain's accession, are now being negotiated. These means involve temporary geographical restrictions on fishing by Spanish vessels in certain areas of the Community's waters, including the Irish box.  They involve limits on the size of catch quotas for particular species to be allocated to Spain from its entry to the Community up to the end of the present arrangements, in the year 2002, under the existing Common Fisheries Policy. They also involve strict limits on the number of Spanish vessels which will be permitted to fish in Community waters between accession and the year 2002 as well as the application of a very strict monitoring system to such Spanish fishing as will be permitted in Community waters.</P>
    <P>Throughout the negotiations on fisheries Spain has pressed for substantial integration, from the very date of accession, into the Common Fisheries Policy. That country has sought an outcome whereby, from accession, she would be subject only to the same regulations as at present govern member states' fishing activities and whereby geographical restrictions on Spain's fishing effort, including the Irish box, would begin to be dismantled from the date of accession. Spain has vigorously made the point that it has been customary in accession negotiations to seek solutions involving a transition towards the full application of the Community regime rather than exclusion arrangements; and that solutions involving transition arrangements rather than exclusion arrangements have in fact been found, or are on the way to being agreed, in other areas of the current enlargement negotiations.  This point was made very forcibly by the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Moran, when he met the Minister of State at my Department at an early <Col N="614" /> stage in the marathon negotiations on enlargement which took place at the Council of Ministers in Brussels through five days of last week.</P>
    <P>Spain has all along pursued the objective of gaining some access for its fishing vessels to the Irish box from the date of accession, with graduated access thereafter. In short, Spain has vigorously opposed the principle of the Irish box being closed to Spain, when she joined the Community, while it remains open to fishing vessels from other member states of the enlarged Community.  The Irish Government, on the other hand, have been absolutely determined to obtain a lengthy exclusion of Spanish vessels from the Irish box, as a necessary means of control.  Moreover, we have joined with other member states in pressing for strict limits on the number of Spanish vessels which will be permitted to fish Community waters in order to avoid any serious upheaval in the balance of the present Common Fisheries Policy and with a view to maintaining the relative stability of fishing in the Irish box at the eventual stage when Spanish fishing vessels have access to the Irish box.  In this connection we are talking about 1 per cent of the existing Spanish fleet into the total Community waters and less than a half of 1 per cent into the Irish box after the transitional period.</P>
    <P>We are politically committed to Spain, as a democratic country, joining the Community and, like other member states which have interests to protect in not alone fisheries but other important areas of the negotiations, we have had to show a measure of flexibility.  However, the Government's actions at every stage in the negotiations have made it manifestly clear to our Community partners and to Spain that we are absolutely determined to secure an outcome favourable to the further development of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The question of what is to happen to the Irish box when Spain and Portugal become members of the Community has certainly been one of the most difficult elements in the negotiations on fisheries. The Community, in an offer made to <Col N="615" /> Spain in May 1984, proposed the application during a ten year period of a transitional licensing mechanism, with the exclusion of Spanish fishing vessels from the Irish box during this ten year period. This offer was decisively rejected by Spain, which continued to insist on access for its fishing vessels to the Irish box from the date of accession.</P>
    <P>In December of 1984 the Community revised its offer to Spain.  The Minister for Fisheries explained the elements of that offer to the Dáil in the course of a debate on fisheries on 5 March.  The December offer provided that the transitional arrangements for the enlarged Community should last for ten years. with the possibility that this could be reduced to eight years if satisfactory post-transitional arrangements could be adopted before the end of 1993.  If such arrangements could not be agreed by 1995, the ten years transitional period would be extended for a further five years.  The Community's December position provided for the exclusion of Spanish vessels for fishing purposes from the Irish box during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries further informed the Dáil on 5 March that Spain's reaction to the December offer was totally negative.  Spain expressed strong opposition to the possibility &mdash; even though it was only a possibility &mdash; of a 15 year transition period.  Moreover, Spain continued to press for access to the Irish box from the date of accession.</P>
    <P>Spain's reaction to the Community's December offer led some member states which do not have significant fishing interests in the North Atlantic to query the length of the transitional period being offered to Spain and to reconsider other aspects of the offer.  At the same time some of the five countries which have significant fishing interests in the North Atlantic appeared less determined than others to secure a transition period of at least ten years duration with the coterninous exclusion of Spanish vessels for fishing purposes from the Irish box.</P>
    <P>On 11 February the Commission put forward for consideration by the Council <Col N="616" /> a new package of compromise proposals covering the outstanding chapters of fisheries, agriculture and social affairs.  In their proposals on fisheries the Commission sought to narrow the wide gap existing between the Community and Spain and thereby advance the negotiations. The Commission proposed the retention of the Irish box for a period of seven years only.  While the Government welcomed some of the ideas in the Commission's proposed compromise on fisheries, we insisted that the exclusion of Spanish fishing from the Irish box for seven years only was not acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>At last week's marathon meeting of the Council of Ministers, myself, the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister of State in my Department participated. Throughout the meeting intensive negotiations took place both between the member states of the Community, and between the Community and Spain.  Following discussions in the Council, and discussions with the applicants, the Presidency put forward early in the meeting its own compromise proposals covering all the unresolved issues in the fisheries, agriculture and social affairs chapters of the negotiations.  It is public knowledge, I believe, that the Presidency's compromise proposal on the outstanding questions in the fisheries chapter with Spain involved the lifting of geographical restrictions after seven years, that is, the full opening of the Irish box to Spanish fishing vessels at the end of this period. This aspect of the proposals was rejected by the Irish delegation.  In further negotiations and discussions, Spain conceded the principle of five year's exclusion of Spanish fishing vessels from the Irish box. The Presidency's proposals then went through two subsequent revisions.  On 21 March the Presidency produced a revised package of compromise proposals covering the fisheries and agriculture chapters of the negotiation in the case of Spain, and the social affairs chapter of the negotiations in the cases of Spain and Portugal. The discussions, which were finally adjourned late on the evening of 21 March and which are to resume next Thursday, were in large part based on <Col N="617" /> this compromise package put forward by the Presidency.  The discussions were adjourned because the Council found itself unable to reach agreement on all of the elements in the Presidency's proposed compromise package.  The elements on which the Council was unable to reach agreement were not confined to the fisheries chapter.</P>
    <P>The media have accurately reported that the Community Presidency's proposed compromise package of 21 March includes provision for a derogation under which Spanish fishing vessels would be excluded from the Irish box for a ten year period, with access to the box to be opened to a defined and limited number of Spanish vessels after that period.  The proposed compromise would involve strict limits on the number of Spanish fishing vessels which would be permitted to fish in Community waters between the date of accession and the year 2002, the last year of the Common Fisheries Policy. This number would constitute only a tiny proportion of Spain's total fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>There would be a sub-limit, within this overall limit, for the number of Spanish fishing vessels which would be permitted to fish in the Irish box when access to the box was eventually opened to Spanish fishing.  Moreover, Spanish fishing activity in Community waters, including Spanish fishing activity in the Irish box after it had been opened up, would be subject to very strict controls, including quota limitations, as well as a strict monitoring system to ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement arrived at.  This monitoring system would require prior notification of the actual vessels from the permitted list which intended to fish in particular parts of Community waters at any given time, as well as reporting of catches on board.  Spain would be permitted to increase its catches of hake, megrim, monkfish, nephrops and pollack, and would be given allocations of blue whiting and horse mackerel.  However, these increases would be achieved by increasing the total allowable catches for the species concerned.  This would mean that as a result of the increases in <Col N="618" /> the catch levels Irish fishermen would receive larger quotas for certain species.</P>

      <P>It will be apparent from what I have said that the present situation has been arrived at in the face of considerable difficulties.  Notwithstanding Spain's demands for early access to the Irish box, notwithstanding the fact that the support of some member States of the Community for this country's negotiating objectives has been less than wholehearted, the Government have made very considerable progress towards achieving an outcome to the negotiations which will be positive and advantageous from this country's point of view.  However, I must emphasise that the negotiations with the applicant countries are now at a very delicate juncture.  The Presidency of the Community has emphasised that its compromise package of 21 March on the fisheries, agriculture and social affairs chapters is to be regarded as a unified whole.  Not all the elements of that package have proved acceptable to all member states of the Community.  In our case we have not said yes to the Presidency's proposals on the fisheries chapter.</P>
      <P>Negotiations will resume at the Council of Minister on Thursday next.  I hope it will be possible then to arrive at agreement with both of the applicant countries on the remaining major outstanding issues.  I do not believe that it would be in the national interest for me to disclose here the details of the negotiating positions which we shall pursue at the discussions next Thursday, and I do not intend to do so.  I can, however, give the House the firm assurance that the Government remain determined to secure an outcome which will permit the continued and progressive development of the Irish fishing industry in future years.</P>

      <P>This motion is a further example of blatant political opportunism on the part of the Opposition.  It ignores reality and is entirely unsupported by the facts.  The motion ignores the reality that Spain and Portugal have applied to join the Community as full members, and their application has the support of the Government and, up to now, had the support of the Opposition also.</P>
      <P>Since membership of the Community will involve, as for every other member state, access to Community waters, acceptance of the opposition motion is tantamount to a rejection of the applications for membership.  If this is the Fianna Fáil position, I think in fairness to the House, that they should say so clearly here and now.  They cannot have their cake, or their fish, and eat it.  Do I need to go into any arguments at this stage as to why it is in Ireland's interest to support enlargement?  One can adduce the idealistic argument that the newly emerged democracies should be entitled to join, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Rome.  If one is unconvinced by that argument, then perhaps the fact that the present Community is bankrupt and that we cannot get an agreement on an increase in own resources save in the context of enlargement may have a more compelling effect.  This latter aspect is of more than passing interest to a country such as ours which is a net beneficiary from the European Community to the tune of about £600 million a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need follow that tack unduly because the Opposition's argument does not clearly specify that they are against enlargement.  I lay down a challenge to them, if they are against enlargement, let them say so here and now and we will argue out the situation <Col N="620" /> in its broader terms.  Any objective reading of their motion, which seeks a declaration of rejection of any arrangements that will permit access by Spanish or Portuguese fishing vessels to the Irish box, can only be tantamount to a rejection of enlargement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is entirely unsupported by the facts.  If we believe in enlargement, what faces us is the question of how to integrate the applicant states into the CFP.  I am dealing specifically with Spain, because the fishing capacity and potential of Portugal pose a threat to nobody.  If we are talking about integration of Spain into the CFP, permanent exclusion from the Irish box is not on, in the same way as permanent exclusion from the North Sea is not on. Reference has been made to the Danes in the North Sea and we will deal with that also, but first I refer to the Irish box. We were able to maintain the box against Spain as a non-member, but it is totally against Community principles to expect a permanent exclusion against a state which is a member of the Community.</P>
      <P>Since the North Sea was raised, let me deal with it.  There is a very important difference between the Irish box and the North Sea which is worthy of stating. There is the difference that Spain has never fished in the North Sea, does not fish in the North Sea and has made it clear that it does not wish to fish in the North Sea.  Despite this, the latest Community compromise contains a provision for the possible access to the North Sea by Spain from 31 December 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having disposed of that argument, let us look at our approach in this negotiation. Central to our approach has been our firm insistence on a number of things; firstly, a long period for the total exclusion of Spanish fishing vessels from the Irish box.  We are seeking, have been seeking and will continue to seek that until the conclusion of the negotiations as a derogation, and I believe we will be successful.  Secondly, we are insisting on the fixing of a restrictive list of Spanish <Col N="621" /> vessels which might fish Community waters at any given time.  Thirdly, we are seeking strict monitoring and control of Spanish fishing activities.  Here I put in this House, as I did in Brussels for five days last week, a great deal of emphasis. I agree with the figures produced by Deputy Daly.  They indicate indiscipline on the part of Spanish fishermen in the context of the present third countries. That is the one point on which Deputy Daly and I can reach agreement.  I hammered home this point day after day last week in Brussels and insisted that there had to be proper controls.  Last, as a central objective in our strategy, we sought that there would be no disruption of the percentage key of quota allocations for member states of the Ten as a result of any allocations of quotas to Spain.</P>
    <P>I am constrained to some degree in my presentation here tonight in that the final negotiations have not been completed and I do not want to say anything that would be prejudicial to these negotiations which will resume on Thursday this week. However, we are close to realising our objectives on the points we have regarded as essential to a satisfactory outcome of the negotiations.  I think I have made it clear that the formal negotiating position had not moved in any way but, as was made very clear by the Presidency late last Thursday night, the Spaniards, as part of an overall package, had conceded the ten year total exclusion.  At the beginning of the week their approach was immediate access, later in the week they moved to access after five years but throughout the week there was no question of any budge on our part.  We demanded and continued to demand a long period for the total exclusion of the Spanish fishing fleet from the Irish box.</P>
    <P>The other aspects, while not fully finalised, will end up in a very favourable package from our point of view.  The discussions in relation to controls have reached a very advanced stage, and I believe that by incorporating procedures which would involve telex messages immediately on going into zone 6 and zone 7, telex messages on the way out, <Col N="622" /> the Shetland box procedure, reporting of catches etc., we will be able to establish a regime which must be respected.</P>
    <P>I have heard many references to the danger of the Spanish fleet fishing right up to our shores.  That is bunkum.  Irrespective of what happens, with the total exclusion that we will achieve and even thereafter no Spanish fishing vessel will fish within the 12 mile zone.  Reference was made also to the number of boats.  I read a reference in an earlier debate to the Spanish fishing fleet of 17,500 vessels. Of course, the Opposition, who profess to be worried about raising fears and apprehensions on the part of the Irish fishing industry, proceed gaily to paint the picture of a huge invasion of Spanish vessels into our waters.  Again that is bunkum.  We will secure a deal that will result in a very limited number of vessels after the total exclusion period having access to our waters in zone 6 stretching right out to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was reference to the French and how tough they were and the exclusions that they got.  They have not and will not have any exclusion at all.  They have problems inside their 12 mile limit because of traditional rights there, but that is a matter for them to resolve.  They will have no exclusion.</P>

We will secure a deal which will be in the best interest of the country generally and of the fishing industry in particular.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, talking about confusion on this side of the House. It is obvious to all that the confusion is on the other side.  That is evident from the number of contradictory statements issued over the last few weeks.  Three weeks ago we heard the utterances of Deputies O'Toole and D'Arcy.  Last week we heard the Minister for Defence make statements on the fishery problem although the Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries was present. Tonight the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his junior Minister took up the running. That is typical of the Government. They try to cloud the issue and to confuse the people.  However, the fishermen are <Col N="624" /> not confused.  They know the Government have sold them out in their negotiations. They will never be forgiven.</P>
    <P>Less than three weeks ago many speakers from this side of the House dealt with the serious repercussions which will be caused by the entry of Spain and Portugal to the EC.  We encouraged the Minister to take a tough and rigid stand during the negotiations and made many suggestions which we thought would be helpful to him.  However, the Minister decided to totally ignore our advice.  The proposals being put forward by the Minister will have serious consequences for the fishing industry.  The Minister has a duty to protect one of our greatest national resources and to protect the livelihood of those engaged in the industry.</P>
    <P>Fishermen view the situation with alarm and anxiety.  They see this Government as inept, weak and incapable of protecting their interests.  A few months ago we held the Presidency of the EC and the entry of Spain and Portugal was a live issue.  The IFO and other fishery organisations made numerous representations to the Minister and the Government about the dire consequences the entry of Spain and Portugal would have on our fishing industry.  The Government chose to ignore the alarm bells which were ringing at the time and adopted the theme song of being good Europeans, doing what was best for Europe at the expense of this country and people. Instead of using the role of presidency to seal the fishing deal to our advantage the Taoiseach and his Ministers were more interested in solving the wine lake problem for the Italians.  Was a deal done behind closed doors between the Italians and the Government the results of which are now being felt to the detriment of our fishing industry?</P>
    <P>Recent discussions and negotiations have not done anything to dispel the fears of fishermen.  It now seems that the Government have allowed their EC partners to corner them into a position where they must accept the entry of Spain and Portugal as being far more important than the protection of our fishing industry.  Why the rush to admit Spain <Col N="625" /> and Portugal to the EC when it is obvious that a small nation like ours will have to pay the consequences of serious decline and job losses in the industry, an industry which faces financial difficulty with fleet owners owing £8 million to BIM and with threats of possession hanging over their heads?</P>
    <P>What have the Government done to protect their interests?  Nothing.  Despite clear support from this side the Minister has clouded the issue by his constant refusal to give clear information on what took place.  What are Ministers trying to cover up?  Is it the fact that the leaked report from Brussels might very well be true, that major concessions have been made, that the Irish box is up for grabs and available to the Spaniards as a compromise? It is time the Minister came clean and told the truth to the House and the fishermen.  If there has been a sell out the fishing industry might as well close up with a loss of 13,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>As much as I am tempted to deal with the problem of the fishing industry in my own county, Wexford, I realise that the debate is related to the national interest. However, a Spanish invasion of our waters will have serious consequences for the fishermen in my constituency with the loss of several jobs.  Does the Minister realise the great size of the Spanish fleet and the threat it will pose to our fishing industry?  It is a fleet of 17,500 vessels compared to our fleet of 1,600 vessels. The total Spanish fleet represents over three quarters of the total EC fleet.  Total fish landings by Spain are over five times greater than that of Ireland and the Spanish import more than the total Irish catch per year.  The Irish fishing industry and fishermen have little chance of survival against such a huge fleet.</P>
    <P>The Spanish are pulling every trick possible to join the Community because they see the rich fishery waters as being totally to their advantage.  The Minister offered as a carrot the potential export market to Spain which would be available to our fishermen.  This will not be the case.  The Spanish are capable of servicing their own markets and they have numerous agreements <Col N="626" /> with other countries for supplies. These would not make it economically viable for Irish entry to their markets.</P>
    <P>Another area of concern must be the fact that the Spanish fleet is not structually sound.  Huge injections of capital will be needed to modernise their outdated fleet and this will have to come from Community funds which will weigh heavily on our economic development under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Up to now Community resources have helped our fishing fleet and industry to develop but due to extra strains on the Community further modernisation and development will be seriously curtailed.  Our fishermen have suffered seriously due to the blatant illegal fishing by the Spaniards off our coasts.  Our fishery protection service has been unable to curtail them.  If they are allowed any legal foothold or given an inch in the present negotiations one can only speculate on the abuse which would be widespread in our fishery waters.</P>
    <P>The preservation of the Irish box is vital and we must protect our stocks from being exploited so that our industry can expand in the non-traditional areas.  If the industry is to expand it must do so by researching and developing areas where there is vast potential.  The fishing industry is a very valuable resource and is important to our economy.  It has vast potential for job creation.  The Government cannot allow that potential to be undermined.</P>
    <P>The Government must adopt a tough stance at the negotiating table.  Up to now they have been pussyfooting and have been out-manoeuvered once again.  A transition period of 20 years is a must. There can be no deviation from that stand, no selling out and no excuses.  They should use the veto if they have to, but at all times the interests of Ireland and our fishing industry must come first.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about a monitoring system of such Spanish fishing as will be permitted in Community waters.  How is it proposed to control this vast area when, at present the Minister for Fisheries cannot control poaching in our rivers?  How does he intend to control the Spanish fleet which may enter our <Col N="627" /> waters illegally?  The Minister has sold out the fishermen and the industry.  How can the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, one of the principal negotiators, run on for ten minutes tonight poking fun at this side of the House?  If that is how he treated the negotiations how can we treat what the Government are doing as serious?  He acted disgracefully tonight by joking and making fun of this side in a serious debate which has serious consequences for our fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues regarding their apprehension about Spanish access to Irish waters.  The greatest problem for our fishing industry is that it is ill-prepared and is a lame duck industry.  If we do not get a realistic 20 year derogation we will be put out of business.  Approximately 12,000 people are employed in the industry, which is pitiful when one thinks that we are an island community with excellent waters around our coasts.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept any assurance that we will have strict monitoring and control of 1 per cent of the Spanish fishing fleet. At present Spanish boats are doing what they like in a most aggressive manner. Far higher fines should be imposed on Spanish fishermen who flout our laws.  An island off Cork is being made ready for joyriders.  Spanish captains who run around the Irish coast, do what they please and threaten the Irish navy are taken into court and released on a bond of £120,000 but the maximum fine is £3,000 or £5,000.  Within the past couple of weeks a Spanish vessel was brought into Cobh and fined and within three days was caught again.  If we cannot support our navy to monitor and protect our fishing grounds now, what chance will we have when Spain is allowed full access to Irish waters, even after a period of derogation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be sensible about this.  If we do not take a tough stand on this issue we are writing off the Irish fishing <Col N="628" /> industry for good.  Virtually no development is taking place in the industry.  We have very little research.  We have one research vessel which is laid up for the entire year, apart from five or six weeks. We have a research field station in Sherkin Island off Cork.  It is starved of funds. We are not supporting our fishing industry to enable them to be professional, to be fully developed and to have decent vessels to cope with one of the strongest fishing nations in the world. The Spanish fleet consists of 17,500 vessels. One per cent of that is 175 vessels. Such an influx into Irish waters together with unofficial fishing will destroy our industry.  If we are to give the industry a breathing space and a chance to get off the ground, we must get a decent derogation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party are demanding that our negotiators take a tough stand on this issue.  Our fishermen have a tough job to do in trying to eke out a living. They are looking to our negotiators for a fair deal.  They do not want our negotiators to come back and say they got a damn good bargain if they have left an under-developed industry at the mercy of one of the strongest fishing industries in the world.  We need to be realistic in regard to the amount of funds made available to the industry.  Our research has to be realistic.</P>
    <P>The position in the processing sector of the industry is lamentable.  It is an indictment of the people who had responsibility for the development of the industry over a long number of years. There is no use in BIM putting up palatial offices in Dun Laoghaire.  That is no way to service our fishing industry.  This industry is based almost exclusively around the south-west and the western coast.  How many people in the processing sector, how many food processing personnel reside in the west and the south-west?  How many personnel with fish processing qualifications are employed by BIM?  For people on the west or the south-west coast who want to develop a fish processing activity it is a daunting task to try to make contact with the multiplicity of agencies with some <Col N="629" /> responsibility for the fishing industry. Many people have thrown in the towel. We need to develop the secondary processing sector.  In many cases fish is being landed and frozen and taken to markets in different parts of the world with expensive transport costs.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the Industrial Development Authority with their expertise in the food industry generally could not coordinate their activities together with BIM.  They have offices in some of the sub-regions who could support the fishing industry.  We have the same difficulty in the marketing sector.  There is virtually no professional marketing for our industry.  It is the old story: &ldquo;Produce it and we will try to get rid of it somewhere.&rdquo; That is not a proper attitude for an industry facing the most intense competition not only in the production area but also in processing and marketing as well.</P>
    <P>I call for an urgent injection of finance into the production, processing and marketing areas.  We did this for other industries and why not for the fishing industry?  At the moment fishermen are being hounded for repayments which they are unable to make.  They are doing the best they can in difficult circumstances. For the general industries we have the permanent agency Fóir Teoranta. They have helped several firms and small industries over a lean period.  We had the same thing in agriculture.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance will continue the Rescue Scheme for farmers in financial difficulties.  I am advocating a similar scheme for fishermen in financial difficulties. We will be unable to meet competition in 15 or 20 years from Spain or any other country if our industry here cannot cope with that competition.  We should support and develop our fishing industry rather than have a chip on our shoulder about competition.  We should be able to sell out there on the market and compete with whatever countries we have to compete with.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15.</P>
    <P>In page, 12, before section 19, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>19.  &mdash;(1) (a) On the commencement of this subsection, the area described in the Fourth Schedule to this Act shall, for the purposes of the local elections next occuring after such commencement, be detached from the County Health District of Galway and from the jurisdiction and powers of the council of the county of Galway (in so far as they relate to such purposes) and be added to the Borough of Galway, and on and from such commencement the said area shall be included in, and form part of, the said borough for the said purposes and the boundary of that borough shall be altered accordingly.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 15 and 27 to be discussed together.  Deputy Molloy reported progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress I was making the point that this section presents a historical change in the boundaries of my native city of Galway.  I welcomed that proposed extension.  I had said that the change proposed by the commission and now accepted by the Government was a result of meetings held locally between the two local authorities in County Galway &mdash; Galway Borough <Col N="632" /> Council and Galway County Council. After a number of meetings agreement was reached on the extension of the city. In arriving at that decision, many councillors were influenced on the basis of adequate compensation being made and on other proposals being entertained which were contained in the agreement referring to the creation of a new electoral area in Connemara.  Now we find that only the part recommending extension of the city has been accepted and the agreed recommendation for changes in the electoral areas has not been accepted.  Some of the councillors who gave their ready agreement feel sorely aggrieved because they are suffering following the changes. The changes in the electoral area were agreed between the two major local authorities involved, but also between the various political groupings represented on both authorities.  They were not accepted by the commission because they felt that their terms of reference debarred them from implementing this recommendation.</P>
      <P>There have also been very serious reservations expressed in this whole area. The Gaeltacht is located in the two electoral areas which are most affected by the extension of Galway city and the changes affecting the Connemara electoral area. It was hoped to amalgamate the large Connemara Gaeltacht into one electoral area, which would have been a very sensible rationalisation of the local Government structures in County Galway and would have been implementing something which has been recommended by several committees and commissions which have been established under the auspices of the State and privately over the years &mdash; that the division of Galway Gaeltacht into different electoral areas for local authority purposes should be ended by amalgamation into one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the unusual situation that the Aran Islands are attached to the Galway electoral area which extends as far as Headford, whereas Rossaveal, Carraroe and the Gaeltachtaí of south Connemara and the islands and back to Carna are to be detached from the electoral area to which the Aran Islands are attached.  I am <Col N="633" /> disappointed that the recommendations made in this regard by Galway County Council and by Bord na Gaeilge in this matter were not accepted.  That board had gone so far since the commission's report was published as to issue a statement asking that further consideration be given to the proposed revisions of local authorities electoral boundaries in Gaeltacht districts.  From what the Minister is saying here, he does not propose to make any changes in what the commission have recommended.  With the time scale involved, it is obvious he is not going to entertain any major changes.</P>
    <P>Again, an opportunity presented itself to do something positive for the Gaeltacht and local government in some of the Gaeltacht areas and that opportunity has been missed.  The reason is that all these changes have been rushed in at the last minute.  Adequate time was not given to considering what would be the best structures to meet the real needs of all the different areas.  The commission, in their report, stated on numerous occasions what I have already highlighted, that they were constrained by the time factor and could not make the best possible recommendations because they did not have time to consider all the various matters which they felt needed to be considered. Their work is a result of a rushed job and is not at all fully satisfactory, but we accept it because now with further time constraints on us and the imminence of the elections it is not feasible for furthere consideration to be given to these matters.  Reluctantly, we have to agree.</P>
    <P>We are very critical of the Government for wasting so much time when all last year could have been used to allow plenty of time for discussions and negotiations to take place with various interested groups and between the commission and the local authorities and others who were making representations to them.  They did not get that opportunity.  The commission were only established in late January and had to report before the end of February.  It was ridiculous for the Government to have gone about their business in this way.  Not alone have they been criticised by this side of the House <Col N="634" /> but last week there was very severe criticism from the Minister's colleagues on the Government side of the House, who expressed regret at the paucity of the proposals in regard to major reform and on the lack of time given even to do the little that is proposed here.  Even that has not been done correctly because adequate time was not given to it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this section is historical from the point of view of Galway city in that it is a major extension of the boundaries, which is to be welcomed.  I have to highlight the fact that the new Galway city area will consist of a very large part of the Gaeltacht.  The Minister and the Minister for the Gaeltacht will have to sort the matter out as to what exactly will be done to rationalise the position.  The city has expanded out into what was once rural hinterland which was Fíor-Ghaeltacht, but some of which is no longer Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  It is not in the interests of the development of the language to pretend continually that some of these areas are Fíor-Ghaeltacht when they are not.  Most people genuinely interested in and concerned about the language would be anxious to see the situation rationalised.  This will not be dealt with now because there is not time to go into these matters.  All we can do is make passing references to them.  I am making these points so that the Minister will know that there were many other matters which needed to be fully considered and were not.  It is hoped, if he comes forward with other Bills in the future, that he will give due consideration to these matters and recognise that they are important and provision should have been made for them.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference given to this commission were totally inadequate for the task required.  If the proposals were considered to be of major importance, surely they deserved sufficient time for the commission to consider the various effects which the major changes will have.  They should have had time to listen to all the points of view.  A very large number of groups who sought to have their case heard by the commission were refused, on the grounds that the commis- <Col N="635" /> sion could not accept oral evidence &mdash; again because they did not have time.  I understand that the only people they met to discuss these matters were the Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin local authorities but that none of the county councils was given an opportunity to discuss with the Minister any of the proposals the commission were considering.</P>
    <P>I am being critical in what I am saying, but at the same time I congratulate the councillors in Galway on their foresight in agreeing to this extension.  That may not appear to be of major consequence, but when one looks at the situation in Limerick, where the two local authorities seem unable to reach the kind of agreement achieved in Galway, then one can see things in perspective, the significance of this move and that it would not have been recommended had there not been that agreement.  I congratulate all of the councillors of every party on both authorities in Galway on their contribution to this significant development for the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was happy to hear the concluding remarks of Deputy Molloy and join him in his congratulatory sentiments about both councils in Galway.  The opportunity afforded Galway city to become a county borough is one that was gladly accepted, particularly on the historic occasion of its 500th anniversary, by all parties in that area. The response was very positive.  In that respect a good day's work was done in having the capital of the west elevated to the status of county borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy was not so congratulatory about the efforts of the commission in their work in that area.  As I said on many occasions before, the Government had decided to adopt the recommendations of the commission.  I believe this to have been the only realistic approach. If changes, such as those suggested by Deputy Molloy, were to be entertained they could have rendered the whole task very difficult and the whole purpose and advantage of the commission approach would have been lost in a welter of claims <Col N="636" /> and counter claims and charges of discrimination, although, even with the commission these charges have been levelled. But there would have been many more Members of this House levelling charges of discrimination had I interfered in any way with the deliberations of the commissioners. I hope Deputy Molloy will see the good sense of this, that that was the only reasonable course open to anybody establishing such boundary commissions and that then the natural course would be to accept their deliberations in their entirety.</P>
    <P>Of course, electoral areas can be adjusted at any time in the future if clear anomalies are established on the ground in the course of the forthcoming local elections and there is an agreed view about this at local level.  Certainly I shall be prepared to listen to whatever representation may be made and account will be taken of them in any subsequent local election.</P>
    <P>However, there are difficulties about the establishment of electoral areas based on exclusively Gaeltacht areas.  Arising from the physical nature of the Gaeltacht, to begin with the Gaeltacht is spread over seven counties.  In six of those counties it is divided into two or more non-contiguous areas.  In several counties non-Gaeltacht areas are isolated by the Gaeltacht from English-speaking areas. Gross inequalities of representation would arise if all Gaeltacht areas were represented by separate electoral areas. That would run counter to the principle underlying the establishment of the two independent electoral commissions, namely, equality of representation within counties and county boroughs.  In fact it would be difficult to justify the creation of separate Gaeltacht electoral areas in any county other than, perhaps, Donegal and to some extent Galway and Mayo. Even in those counties it would seem necessary to exercise a substantial bias in favour of Gaeltacht districts and accept electoral areas which are awkward in shape and include non-contiguous areas.</P>
    <P>All of this, of course, does not mean that the Gaeltacht will be ignored in the context of local government reform.  The <Col N="637" /> Government accept fully the desirability of having local structures which recognise the special nature of Gaeltacht areas and are responsive to the needs of such areas. Accordingly, further legislation will permit the establishment of Gaeltacht committees in the relevant counties to which functions can be devolved.  This will represent a realistic response to the special needs of the Gaeltacht.  I hope Deputy Molloy will accept from me that this represents a gesture towards what he has been suggesting for the Gaeltacht areas and for their representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points to which I want to respond.  I do not know whether the Minister really grasped what was the meaning of the recommendation from Galway County Council in regard to the Connemara Gaeltacht.  I would rather the Minister had replied to the point I made instead of referring in a general way to all of the Gaeltacht areas saying that they are scattered throughout rural regions of the west and that it would be difficult to form them into individual electoral areas within each county.  I understand all of that.  I am merely putting it to the Minister that a practical proposal to unite most of the Connemara Gaeltacht was made to the Minister by a local authority with full agreement between all the members of the political parties in that authority and the two local authorities in that area and that that recommendation was rejected.  That is all I am saying.  I am not asking about the other Gaeltacht areas in, say, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry or Waterford on this occasion.  I am referring merely to the Galway Gaeltacht because that whole area has been affected in a major way by the decision to expand the city.  That has meant that part of the Galway Gaeltacht in the County Galway electoral area has now been brought into the city and the remaining part of that Galway electoral area, which is also Gaeltacht and has now been reduced in size, remains separate from the Connemara electoral area which consists mostly of a Gaeltacht area. Therefore, it would have made sense to marry the two together; the population <Col N="638" /> existed for a seven-seater electoral area which would have given the disadvantaged part of County Galway, which is largely Gaeltacht, greater voice and unity within the council.  But that opportunity has been denied them by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal for the establishment of Gaeltacht area committees within each county council that has Gaeltacht areas within it and his proposal that functions be delegated to those committees.  However, I am very sceptical of the possible fulfilment of this proposal. I witnessed the establishment of Údarás na Gaeltachta and the provision in the legislation establishing that body for functions to be delegated from the local authority and other Government Departments to Údarás.  None of those functions has been exercised, no extra functions have been allocated to Údarás since the date of its establishment.  Therefore I am very sceptical of any functions being delegated to special Gaeltacht area committees.  Unless the Minister provides for a delegation of these functions by legislation I am sceptical it will ever come about.  I say that from practical experience. There is no need to go into the reasons I hold those views.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is genuine in seeking to fulfil the promise he has given me here this evening that these Gaeltacht area committees will be established and given specific functions, then he should introduce legislation providing for the delegation of those functions to those area committees.  Otherwise that proposal will never see the light of day.  We have had too many of these kinds of promises in debate and Government reports, none of them fulfilled and all of them gathering dust on the shelves in Government Departments.  It is time that positive action was taken in this area.  I commend the Minister for referring to the matter. At least this is a response to my urgings.  I suggest that he can fulfil that commitment by taking positive action in providing for this change in legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 20, to insert the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>20.&mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of section 19 of this Act and in any event not later than the date of the making of an order under section 84 (as amended by section 4 of the Local Elections Act, 1966) of the Electoral Act, 1963, fixing the polling day at the local elections to be held in 1985, make an order under subsection (2) (as amended by section 87 (4) of the Electoral Act, 1963) of section 35 of the Local Government Act, 1941, in respect of the Borough of Galway and an order under section 33 of the said Act, in respect of the county of Galway.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 15.  It requires the Minister to make such electoral area boundary adjustments as are necessary arising from the extension of the boundary of Galway. These changes will be made on the basis recommended by the county and county borough electoral areas boundary commission. They must be made as soon as possible after the extension of the borough boundary affected by section 19 and not later than the date of the making of the order fixing the polling day for local elections.  As drafted originally, the section would have applied to Limerick and Galway also but section 19 which provides for boundary alterations will apply now only to Galway.  The consequential provisions of this section must be reduced in scope so as to apply to Galway only. Section 35 of the Local Government Act, 1941 empowers the Minister to divide Galway Borough into electoral areas. Section 33 of that Act empowers him to divide the counties into electoral areas <Col N="640" /> and to fix the number of members per electoral area.  The extract relating to the electoral areas affected by this alteration is from page 85 of the commission's report.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 10 to 15, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(1) The Minister may by order, made at any time before the local elections held next after the passing of this Act, alter the number of members of the council of any county specified in the order.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments arise also from the recommendations of the commission. They restrict the scope of section 21 so as to apply only to county councils.  Only in the case of eight county councils did the commission recommend alterations in the number of members.  The section as drafted would apply to county borough councils other than Dublin and Galway Borough Councils.  The reference to these authorities is being deleted. Amendment No. 18 is consequential on the amendment to subsection (1).  At present the number of members of most <Col N="641" /> county councils is fixed by order made under the Local Government Act, 1941. In some cases membership was increased subsequently under the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898 on the application of the council concerned and following a local inquiry.  In any case where the Minister increases membership of a county council under this section, the previous order fixing membership will be revoked.</P>

Any order made by the Minister using this power will have to be laid, by virtue of section 3 (2) of the Bill in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will not be made a resolution approving of the draft until it has been passed by both Houses.  The Minister will be empowered to make an order under this section where he considers it appropriate to do so, having regard to the provisions of the Bill, or where such order is necessary or expedient so that other enactments, orders and so on can have effect in conformity with the terms of the Bill, or that it is necessary or expedient so as to remove any inconsistency between the Bill and other enactments and instruments, or that any other enactment or instruments are replaced or rendered unnecessary by any provision of the Bill.  The Minister will have power to amend, adapt, modify, repeal or revoke any enactment or instrument and to provide for its application or non-application to a local authority or local authorities.  It is because the section will confer a broad power on the Minister <Col N="643" /> that orders made under it will be subject to positive confirmation by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give an explanation to the House regarding the method of appointment of membership of committees of the various local authorities as proposed in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that the procedure which applies to the making of appointments by local authorities to health boards shall in future apply to the making of appointments to certain committees and other bodies by local authorities.  The bodies to which the new procedure will apply are set out in subsection (2) of the section.  The Minister will have power to apply the new procedure to other bodies by order.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this new procedure is to ensure that a local authority's representation on committees and other bodies is a fair reflection of the composition of the local authority.  The procedure has proved satisfactory in the making of appointments to health boards.  In responding to the Minister's Second Reading speech, Deputy Molloy welcomed the proposals to extend its application.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) provides that, subject to subsection (4) a local authority in appointing, whether by nomination or election, members of the local authority or persons who are not members of the local authority to be members of any body mentioned in subsection (2) of the section or a committee of agriculture shall make such appointments, first, in the case of appointments to membership of a committee of agriculture, in accordance with the rules set out in Part I of the Fourth Schedule, and secondly, in the case of appointments to membership of any other body mentioned in subsection (2), in accordance with the rules set out in Part II of the Fourth Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules in Part II of the Fourth Schedule are modelled on those which apply to appointments to health boards. <Col N="646" /> The rules in Part I are a modification of those rules to take account of particular legal requirements governing appointments to committees of agriculture. There are requirements that certain agricultural bodies be accorded representation on a committee of agriculture, for example, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the ICA and that there be at least one representative of each county electoral area on such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This notion of laying down a system for appointments to health boards was introduced by the late President Childers when he was Minister for Health when he set up the health boards. Whatever criticisms there may have been of the health boards since then, so far as the appointment of the councillors to the boards was concerned there has been general acceptance of the principle introduced by Mr. Childers at that time.  It helped to establish harmony and good relations and to avoid much acrimonious wrangling at council meetings in filling some appointments of councillors to health boards.  I welcome the extension of that principle to other committees which newly elected councils have to fill.  I hope that this principle which was introduced by the late Mr. Childers will bring the same degree of harmony, will establish better relationships and will avoid the dissent and heated debate that occurs at such times in council meetings when decisions have to be made regarding the filling of various appointments.  The principle is good.  It is proper and correct that there be representation according to the strength of the various groups on a council. I hope the system will operate efficiently and I welcome the proposed extension of the system to the other committees under the auspices of local authorities.</P>

      <P>The section provides for an extension of the boundary of the administrative county of Cork to include part of Bantry Bay.  The Minister will be empowered by order to specify whether this boundary extension is to be for all or for certain purposes.  The section will empower the Minister, by order, to include land in a county or county borough specified in the order and the boundary of the county or county borough to which land is added will be altered accordingly.  Before making any such order the Minister will be required to consult with the Commissioners of Public Works, any other Minister who may be concerned and the council of any county or county borough who may be affected.  The Minister will have power to make such incidental, consequential and supplementary provisions as appear to him to be expedient in relation to both Cork county or any other county or county borough in respect of whose maritime boundary he makes the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to clarify the exact maritime boundary of a county. I understand that there have been difficulties in some cases where malicious damage has been caused to vessels tied alongside in harbours.  In such cases the local authority concerned have disclaimed any responsibility arguing that even though the vessel was tied up alongside the harbour within their county the vessel was in waters which were outside the county boundary.  Arguments have been made that the county boundary did not extend beyond the side of the quay in the case of a deepwater harbour.  It is important to define clearly on the maps, the boundaries of a county in regard to coastal areas and where there is a harbour where boats come alongside the line should be drawn well outside the harbour so that there will be no doubt as to whether the boats were in the jurisdiction of the county authority.  Arguments have been made in court that boats were outside the jurisdiction of the county authority against which malicious damages claims had been made.  I take it that section 28 will enable the Minister if requested by a local authority in future <Col N="649" /> to delineate this county boundary out beyond the low water mark.</P>

      <P>As matters stand, the marine boundary of County Cork extends only as far as the high water mark.

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 21, Part II, to delete lines 1 to 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would have the effect of leaving the section of Dublin city, Howth, Sutton, and Baldoyle within the city of Dublin which is the reasonable, rational place for that area, rather than the abortion of a proposal we have before us to move Howth, Sutton, and Baldoyle out into County Dublin, into Fingal.  We have heard much in this debate and in the various statements made by various Government Ministers about local government reform, that this Bill is part of a package of major local government reform and that the tackling of the reform is being done in a very honourable way by the appointment of boundary commissions and that the boundary commissions will see that everything is correct.  There has been much play in amendments referring to the reports of the commissions. But the reality is that the hands of the commissions were already tied by a gerrymander <Col N="651" /> by the Government in their decision that Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle, a natural part of the city of Dublin, should be taken out and transferred into County Dublin with no respect for the views of the people of the areas and showing total disregard for the fact that they, as ratepayers, are on a much lower rate than the county ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Government are showing total disregard for the fact that Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle will not have anything in common with the major part of the new Fingal Council.  The area covered by the latter will stretch from the northern part of the Liffey at Lucan, through Blanchardstown and Mulhuddart across to Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle.  The change is being made for no other reason than party political gain by the major party in Coalition, Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the decision was not taken in the Custom House but in Kildare Street, in the Department of the Public Service, by the Minister for the Public Service, to help his pal, Deputy Cosgrave, and the Fine Gael Party generally. The intention was to help Fine Gael to get a majority on the new Fingal Council. It is an absurd proposal to take a major part of the city of Dublin and put it into Fingal and give that an air of respectability by referring to the boundary commission.  That action is beneath contempt and shows total disregard for the services and traditions of the ratepayers of Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle.  As a Deputy for North County Dublin I welcome the arrival of the people from that area into the Fingal district but there is no logic to the Minister's proposal.  The Minister has told us that the boundary commission behaved in an independent way and I accept that, but the hands of the commission were tied by the gerrymander performed by the Fine Gael Ministers.  I have no doubt that the former chairman of the county council, now Minister for the Public Service, played a major role in the decision with regard to Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle. Part II of the Schedule states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> 2. (1) The part of the City enclosed by the existing boundary and an imaginary line drawn as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Starting at the point where the existing boundary meets the western boundary of the Dublin-Belfast railway line at &lsquo;Howth Junction&rsquo; Railway Station, thence in a southerly direction along the said western boundary to the point at which it joins Kilbarrack Road, and finally continuing in an easterly direction along Kilbarrack Road and along its imaginary projection.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;imaginary projection&rdquo; aptly describes what has been done with regard to Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle.  Surely it is imaginary to project that the people of Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle have anything in common as far as services, traditions, needs and rates are concerned with the people of Blanchardstown or Castleknock. The Minister's change makes a nonsense of the proposals before us for the various reorganisations in Dublin.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's attempt to explain the reason why Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle have been lumped against the wishes of the people and their financial interests as far as rates are concerned into North County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole pattern of changes in the city-county boundary is intended to achieve this end.  The boundary was last reviewed in 1953.  The changes in the Howth area form part of the current revision.  Howth is an area of high amenity to the north of the city as Killiney is to the south.  No one is suggesting that Killiney should form part of the city area.  Given that Howth is a high amenity area, as are other parts of coastal north county Dublin, the Government felt that there were sound geographical arguments for its inclusion in north county Dublin.  I am sure the Deputy, a representative from that area agrees.  Furthermore it will help to strengthen the population base of that county.  In these circumstances I am not prepared to accept this amendment. However, I am aware that certain difficulties in regard to rates liabilities may arise for residents in the area and I will be dealing with these in the context of Deputy Molloy's next amendment on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very lame attempt by the Minister to justify the gerrymander carried out by Fine Gael members of the Government because, to be fair to the Minister, his party do not have a hope in hell of getting a seat in that area.  The gerrymander was carried out by Fine Gael Ministers in such a way that Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle would go into the county.  The Minister said that the change was designed to remove anomalies and that it was more logical and rational that the area of Howth, <Col N="654" /> Sutton and Baldoyle be in north County Dublin.  There is no logic in that.  The move is not in the least rational.  It does not amount to a tidying up of a boundary. If one looks at the map one will see that the boundary going in a straight line across the city fringe takes in Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle.  There is no logic in the Minister's move.  As far as the 1953 review is concerned I must point out that the trend since then has been to extend the city boundary further and further out into the county rather than to take lumps of the city and put them into the county. The Bill proposes to take major sections of the county into the city and they are adjacent to Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle. I am referring to the Donaghmede, Grangemore and Donaghies areas.  They are in the county area and the county council built local authority houses there but it is being moved into the city.  It was logical to move Darndale into the city.  The logic of the Minister's proposals has been to tidy up along the city fringe with the exception of Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle. His proposal in regard to that goes directly against his other moves in regard to the city fringe.  The areas of the city fringe that have expanded into the county are being tidied up and brought into the city.  The move in regard to Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle is illogical and irrational.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's heart was in that proposal.  Clutching at straws the Minister referred to Killiney and told us that there should not be a proposal to bring Killiney into the city.  Killiney was never included in the city boundary and nobody is seeking a change there.  There is no comparison between the position of Killiney and that of Howth.  Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle are in the city and the people of the area relate to the city. They do not relate to the people of Balbriggan, Mulhuddart, Clonsilla or the northern end of Lucan.  Their relationship is towards the city of Dublin where they are at present.  The Minister said that there are sound geographical reasons for doing this and that Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle have something in common with the county, but that is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Howth forms one of the arms of Dublin Bay looking towards the city and, for political reasons and gerrymandering, it is being put into north County Dublin. However, I have no doubt that that proposal will rebound on the Government, especially on the Fine Gael Party, when the people of Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle realise the injustice that has been done to them, especially as they will have to pay a rates bill far in excess of what they pay at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have a lead in a period of three, four or five years but there will still be a considerable increase in the rates in the long term and even in the short term for the people in those areas.  There is no logic in the Minister's decision.  To an extent, I sympathise with him because his heart is not in it.  He is creating anomalies which are not logical. The rational proposals on the city fringe go against what the Minister is doing to Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle and to the people of that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the boundary changes of 1953 but the fact is that the city has been expanding instead of parts of it being taken into the county.  I realise that the Minister's hands are probably tied because of the gerrymandering by Fine Gael but I ask him to reconsider the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinary decision by the Government.  They have predetermined the boundaries for the new local authorities in Dublin and excluded the delineation of these boundaries from the independent commission. It is important that that is made very clear and understood outside this House because there has been an attempt to convey the impression that all the work in regard to the boundaries is the result of consideration given to these matters by an independent commission, but that is not the case.  The most important decisions made regarding this matter were made by Government members and it is impossible for the Minister to explain the reason for placing the Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle area in the new county area of Dublin-Fingal.  It is clearly in the city <Col N="656" /> area and has been there during the rapid period of urban growth over the past 20 years.  It is located on the shores of Dublin Bay and many important services are interlinked.  Even a cursory look at a map of Dublin shows that the natural alignment for the community residing in this area is with the city and not in north County Dublin.  The area connecting the electoral area of Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle to the new county area is a very narrow opening in the Sutton-Baldoyle area; it is barely connected, there is just a narrow strip of land connecting it to the huge council area in north County Dublin.  It is clear, therefore, that there is no logical explanation for this area being transferred to the county and there must be some other reason for this.  We accuse the Government of gerrymandering these boundaries for party political purposes. A prominent Government Minister is known to have a particular electoral interest in this area and we must come to the conclusion that he exercised undue influence in this matter.  He sought to have a natural part of Dublin city excluded from the city area and transferred to the county, which is his base, and to bolster his political fortunes by transferring an area where there is substantial support for his party to his area rather than leave it in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the explanation given by the Minister.  One would imagine that he would have sought to give some explanation for this decision or tried in some way to justify the Government's actions.  However, the has made no effort to come to their defence. The sad reality is that the people who reside in that area and who operate commercial enterprises there will have to pay a very heavy price to satisfy the political ambitions of Fine Gael, especially those of Deputy Boland.  I am surprised that a Labour Minister is prepared to accede to the request of a Fine Gael Minister in regard to this matter as there does not seem to be any advantage to the Labour Party in transferring this area.  The fortunes of Conor-Cruise O'Brien have waned and the Labour Party influence is no longer there.  It is of more electoral <Col N="657" /> benefit to Fine Gael to transfer this to the county to try to counter the strength of Fianna Fáil in that area and that is what is happening.</P>
    <P>There is a very heavy price to be paid by the property owners in this area because of the difference in the rate struck in Dublin city and Dublin county. Those who up to now were located in the city area were paying a rate based on £18 in the pound.  When this Bill is passed they will be paying approximately £24 in the pound, a difference of £6 in the pound.  Commerical property owners will certainly pay the cash price to satisfy the electoral ambitions of local Fine Gael politicians.  I do not know if property owners will be happy to make these cash payments which can be quite substantial. If one considers property valued on a rating of £100, there is a difference of £600 to be paid in rates.  I know that the Minister proposes to phase it in over a period of five years, but each year property owners will have to pay higher rates.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for this side of the House to accept such blatant gerrymandering by the Government and we must lodge a protest.  We recognise that the Labour Party are happy to support this gerrymandering &mdash; by supporting Fine Gael they can ram this through, which will establish this awkward looking county council in Dublin-Fingal.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this stage, to reconsider and to recognise that what he is proposing is irrational, that it has no logical base and will involve difficulty in administration.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there are many infrastructural services running from the Howth area, and many major sewerage disposal units in the city have loations in and beyond Howth.  These major systems are transferring from one area to another.  There will be many other administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the overall picture one can recognise why the Government were not prepared to allow any independent commission to lay down the boundaries for the four new Dublin authorities. This was a matter of extreme political importance and therefore these independent <Col N="658" /> people were not to be given this important task.  No chances were to be taken on this issue and the commission did not have any part to play in deciding the new Dublin city boundaries.  That was for the heads of the Government parties to decide because in future elections parties' fortunes would be affected by whatever decisions were made.  The commission were given the lesser task of determining a line for electoral areas only but they were not allowed to touch this important task.  It is important that we hammer home this fact.  There is no way we will accept the Minister's arguments and we insist that our amendment be put to the House.  We will call a vote and divide the House on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little to be said on this.  Today the Deputies said that, generally speaking, the proposals contained in this Bill are acceptable and there was nothing they could get their teeth into.  The changes contribute to the overall balances between the three new county councils in terms of population and viability.  There was talk about Ministers having a big say in this and talk about four county councillors &mdash; there are 1,500 or 1,800 county councillors in the whole country &mdash; and they tried to find one area where they could tag the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; and thereby attempt to discredit this.  I do not believe this has worked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it.  As I said, it brings a balance to the three county council areas in terms of population and viability.  That is the basis of the argument.  The talk of gerrymandering is just political point scoring and has no basis in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about democracy. <Col N="659" /> People will go out to vote and determine who their representatives will be.  We all have to accept the result of elections and this will be the case in Howth as in any other part of the country.  The Deputies opposite have not made any reasonable case against what has been done here to bring viability to the three county council areas.  A number of foolish assertions were made but the Deputies opposite have not, and will not, convince me that their case holds water.  They should give up on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks about viability.  The Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle areas have been moved for better distribution of the population into the county.  Why move a part of the city into the county when, on the other side of the railway line at Kilbarrack, part of the county is being moved into the city, an area where county council houses have been built and where the landlord is the county council?  Further along the Malahide Road there is Coolock, which has been in the county and has a major IDA industrial estate on the eastern side of the new by-pass on the airport road.  That area is being taken into the city.  The Minister is talking about viability in the new Fingal area, yet he is moving an area at the back of the Northside Shopping Centre from the county into the city, the reverse to what is being done in Howth. There would be some effort to improve the rate base of the county area if the IDA industrial estate were left in County Dublin, but the Minister is doing a complete somersault by moving those areas into the city and moving Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle into the county.  Talking about viability, how about those people in Howth-Sutton-Baldoyle who are paying the exorbitant Dublin city rate of £18 in the pound?  The Minister intends to transfer them, against their will, with no logic or geographical connection, into the county where there is a rate of £24 in the pound.  These business people's finances are already being stretched by Government decisions in other areas but they are being pushed into the county under a <Col N="660" /> gerrymandering exercise.  This has nothing to do with the boundary commission. This is a Fine Gael decision promoted by the present Minister for the Public Service for base political motives which will backfire because the people of Howth, Sutton and Baldoyle will reject this gerrymandering exercise.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I should like to thank you for providing me with this opportunity to raise this very important issue.  There is a crisis in the post-primary schools in Mallow due to the lack of available space.  Mallow is one of the largest towns in my constituency. It was heavily industrialised until recently but, due to the recession, it now has the highest unemployment figure in my constituency.  Unemployment in Mallow has risen from 450 in 1980 to 1,200 today.  Hardship is being imposed on the people in the town and in the rural areas with an increasing number of children seeking post-primary education.  This hardship is a serious indictment of Government policy in the East Cork constituency and especially in Mallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the two post-primary schools in Mallow is bad.  The Patrician Brothers who have served the town of Mallow for quite a long number of years have accommodation for only 460 pupils. I understand that approximately 150 extra pupils are applying for accommodation in 1985.  The Convent of Mercy have a better type school but they have the same problem with numbers.  They have to turn away children from rural areas and deprive them of post-primary education. The two educational orders are highly embarrassed as they have served the community in the area for over 100 <Col N="666" /> years.  The Convent of Mercy and the Patrician Academy are very close to each other and I understand they are prepared to share facilities which is further proof of their commitment to the Department. The local authority facilities of a swimming pool and playground are quite near and the Patrician Academy are making a free site available to the Department. They are prepared to make the mother house available to be converted to a school complex.</P>
    <P>I understand that the sanitary and toilet facilities are absolutely scandalous. There are facilities for only half the number of pupils and the overcrowding is absolutely ridiculous and is causing great hardship to pupils and teachers.  The total amount of floor area required in the Patrician Academy is in the region of 20,000 feet.  Plans were lodged in the Department in January 1984 but the Minister is continuing to drag his feet.  I have asked written and oral questions and I have written to the Department, but no great commitment has been given by the Department.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed that the Minister does not believe that the problem facing these schools are serious.  All possible co-operation has been forthcoming from the Convent of Mercy, the Patrician Academy and the parents associations to facilitate the pupils in the area and the Department.  It is now the Minister's turn to come to their aid and to approve the money to build and expand the Patrician Academy and to get rid of its derelict and prefabricated building.  The same applies to the Convent of Mercy.  These two schools are deserving of the Minister's support.  On behalf of the parents and pupils of the Mallow town catchment area I appeal to the Minister to provide the necessary funding.  We must not neglect these pupils.  We do not want them to become disillusioned and despondent in these times of great economic pressure and lack of Government policy to provide jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>Substantial sums of money have been collected by the Convent of Mercy in voluntary subscriptions.  I have with me <Col N="667" /> a number of letters I received from parents.  One letter refers to a site of 2.9 acres.  They have sports fields of approximately four to five acres.  It refers to the present building being a &ldquo;brothers' monastery and four rooms of old national school &mdash; over 100 years old; a building containing five classrooms built in the forties; a prefabricated unit containing six classrooms, one staffroom, two offices built in 1963; three small classrooms built in 1972, a bicycle shed underneath converted into three classrooms recently&rdquo;. That highlights the seriousness of the situation. Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Barry are well aware of this problem.  It is stated in that letter that the school roll went from 250 in 1970 to 480 in 1984-85.</P>
    <P>I asked a parliamentary question on 6 March 1985 and afterwards I saw a headline in a newspaper &ldquo;£1m for school&rdquo;.  We have not seen that £1 million yet.  In another letter I received it is stated:</P>
    <P>As you are aware, the number of pupils seeking admission to this school is increasing each year.  It has now arrived at the stage that I feel I am doing an injustice to the pupils each year by accepting all applicants.</P>
    <P>The existing building was planned to accommodate 400 pupils, but this year there are 580 children on the roll.  If I were to accept all that would apply next year the numbers would be 610-620. There is absolutely no way that we can cater for that number of pupils under the present conditions.</P>
    <P>We have just one Science Laboratory and 400 pupils wishing to do the subject...</P>
    <P>This letter refers to the Convent of Mercy.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to do the best we can in the present circumstances: classes being held during the lunchtime and after 4.00 p.m., but even at that not all pupils are able to have the practical experience these subjects require...</P>
    <P>...The school has certainly reached <Col N="668" /> saturation point now and I need to know at this stage what the present position is in regard to the extension to the school.  We are only asking here for what is urgently needed to provide the best education we can for Mallow girls.  The need for this extension is obvious, and the local people's support is evident in that they have raised the local contribution of £50,000 in little over twelve months.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting an immediate reply.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from the Minister dated 1 August 1984 in which he said:</P>
    <P>I wish to refer again to your representations regarding the proposed extension of the Patrician Academy, Co. Cork.</P>
    <P>The position is that it is proposed to develop this school to cater for 475 students overall.  In order to assess the accommodation needs of the school, and the extent and range of the new accommodation to be provided, the school Manager has been invited to complete an Educational Work Sheet, showing in full the curriculum needs of the students.  When this document has been received and agreement reached with the school authority, arrangements will be made to hold a meeting in the Department between the school's design team and officers of the Department to initiate the architectural planning of the project.</P>
    <P>We should cut out the red tape and get on with the job of developing these post primary schools.  We are talking about a large rural area with a growing population. Many more students will be coming on stream in the coming years.  I hope the Minister will cut out the red tape and get on with the planning stage and put the building up for tender.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to place on the record of this House my serious concern about post primary education in Mallow town as it exists today.  On numerous occasions I have been in touch with the Minister and previous Ministers about this appalling situation. <Col N="669" /> Mallow is a very big town with a population of 9,000 to 10,000 people.  It has a huge catchment area.</P>
      <P>Mallow at present has two secondary schools, the Patrician Academy and the Mercy Convent, and conditions in both schools are appalling.  There is a cliché, &ldquo;Cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  That certainly is not the case in Mallow town and hinterland.  The people there pay their taxes, their levies, their charges, but they are not being treated as the other taxpayers are.  They have been looking for two schools for many years.  The facilities are not there.  The Patrician Academy building has tin walls. I do not know how any teacher can teach there &mdash; I certainly could not.  One can hear the noise of the different classes at the same time and there are no toilet facilities.  The schools are almost falling down around them.  Very little progress has been made over the last number of years.  In the Mercy Convent the teachers are obliging the pupils by having classes after 4 p.m. but, unfortunately, some of the children cannot avail of these because they must catch the school bus home.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of improved post primary facilities at Mallow has been receiving careful examination in my Department <Col N="670" /> for some time.  There are three post-primary schools in this town, the Patrician Academy, the Convent of Mercy secondary school and the vocational school. Each of these schools has applied for capital grants towards the cost of additional or replacement accommodation and for improved facilities.  The examination of the individual and collective needs of the three schools has been carried out with a view to making accommodation and educational improvements through effective and cost-efficient use of available resources, taking care at the same time that we avoid duplication and waste in the allocation of capital and current resources.</P>
      <P>It has been decided that the three schools may proceed on an individual basis.  The Patrician Academy will provide 475 places overall and the Convent of Mercy will provide 550 places overall. These two schools will be grant-aided in the construction of extensions to assist in their development.  A new vocational school is being planned on a new site. This school will provide 425 places overall. As regards the vocational school, approval was given originally for the development of this school to cater for 500 students overall.  Subsequently, as a result of representations made by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee and after due consideration, it was agreed that the number of places to be catered for in the school would be raised to 550.  The planning of an extension to the school commenced and progress was made to the point where the developed sketch scheme for the project, submitted by the committee, was approved and the committee requested by my Department to submit the working drawings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This stage, however, was never submitted, as meanwhile the committee requested that instead of an extension, a new school be built on a new site which the committee had acquired.  The committee supported their request with a report on the situation in Mallow.  However, as the structural condition of the existing accommodation was satisfactory in that it was still usable, the committee <Col N="671" /> were asked to prepare a feasibility study, comparing the options of either building an extension to the existing structure, or of building a new school on a completely new site.</P>
    <P>When the feasibility study was received the Department carried out a full evaluation of the situation, examining the educational, technical and financial aspects of the options.  The result of the evaluation was that the Department agreed, in November 1982, that a new vocational school should be planned. Meanwhile the committee requested the potential enrolment figures be raised to 600 places.  However, the Department's examination of this request found that 425 places would be sufficient initially, as the indications were that enrolment was decreasing at the school.  The committee agreed to this matter.  Agreement was also reached on the range and extent of the accommodation to be provided in the new school.  Architectural planning of the new school was initiated in December 1984, at a meeting in the Department with the chief executive officer for the County Cork Vocational Education Committee and the committee's design team.</P>

      <P>The next step, the formal submission of an outline sketch scheme, has been taken by the committee.  The relevant documentation was received in the Department on 19 March and is now under examination.</P>
      <P>I am here to reply to a question on the alleged failure of the Government to provide adequate post-primary facilities in Mallow raised by Deputy O'Keeffe and I am dealing with that matter.</P>

      <P>The planning of the extension of 546 square metres to enable the Convent of Mercy secondary school to <Col N="672" /> provide for 550 overall has now reached stage 4 of the planning procedures.  This stage, recently received in the Department is at present under examination. The next stage will be the invitation of the bills of quantities.  When the examination has been completed and the documentation found to be satisfactory, the committees will then be advised on the preparation of the bills of quantities and the other contract documentation.</P>
      <P>The number of places approved initially for the development of the Patrician Academy in Mallow was 400.  This was subsequently increased to 475 in the expectation that the intake in the academy would remain at about 100 per annum in future.  The planning of an extension to enable the school to cater for 475 students overall had reached outline sketch scheme stage when, in September 1983, the school authorities, through their new manager, expressed reservations regarding development by way of extension.  The existing school is 150 years old and they proposed a new school on a new site.  However, having failed to locate a suitable site, they have now proposed a revised extension plan which would allow for the construction of new accommodation and would also utilise their private residence for teaching purposes. This has been under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held on 4 March 1985 to clarify the accommodation requirements of the school and the future use of the existing buildings, including the monastery. A schedule of accommodation was issued to Brother Simeon on 21 March 1985.  On Monday, 25 March, Brother Simeon rang the Department requesting a further meeting to clear up a few details.  This meeting has been tentatively arranged for Friday, 29 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When agreement has been reached of the accommodation question, arrangements will be made to hold a briefing meeting in the Department with the school's design team to initiate the architectural planning of the project.  It is considered that the enrolment potential of the Mallow centre will be well served when the proposed building programme <Col N="673" /> for these post-primary schools has been implemented.</P>
    <P>I have received a number of deputations from the Patrician Academy in Mallow.  They visited my house and I have arranged meetings with the officials in my Department.  There was quite a lot of indecision, not on the part of my Department.  Agreement was being reached on the future of the three schools in question.  I hope these schools will now proceed and that the Convent of Mercy, the County Cork Vocational Education Committee and the Patrician Academy will know what exactly they want and that there will be no further interruptions <Col N="674" /> in the provision of these schools.  I did not in my time build too many pre-fabricated schools.  They were there before my time. They were an extremely bad investment, not alone in Mallow but in other areas. Mallow is not, at post-primary level, the worst centre.  There are many more areas needing immediate attention.  This is what we are trying to do with the resources available to us.  As far as Mallow is concerned, any delay is not the responsibility of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 27 March 1985.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide levels monitored in each of the monitoring stations in Cork city and county for the years 1981 to 1984, inclusive.</P>

      <P>Carbon monoxide levels are not monitored in this country.  The results from the stations monitoring sulphur dioxide in Cork city and county are set out in the following tables which give the number of valid daily means from which the median value (middle ranking value) is derived.  The median is preferred to the average value in air pollution analysis. The gaps in the Cork County Council results are due to analytical problems in measuring low sulphur concentration.</P>

As the inspector had no details in regard to the taxpayer's employment position for the period from 6 April to 11 May 1984, a certificate of tax free allowances for 1984-85 on a non-cumulative (Week 1) basis was issued to him on 20 June 1984, pending receipt of the relevant details when he called to the tax office in August 1984.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 548 and 549 together.</P>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers is not an allowance as such but a restriction. The amount which could qualify for tax relief in respect of the capital cost of a car was limited to £2,500 by virtue of sections 25 to 30 of the Finance Act, 1973.  The limit applied in general to expenditure incurred on or after 16 May 1973.</P>
      <P>The restriction was subsequently eased to its present level of £3,500 by section 31 of the Finance Act, 1976, in respect of expenditure incurred after 28 January 1976 and the scope of this restriction was extended by section 32 of that Act to limit the amount of car running expenses which could qualify for tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full year costs to the Exchequer in 1985-86 terms of extending the limit of <Col N="474" /> £3,500 to the levels proposed by the Deputy are tentatively estimated as follows:</P>

      <P>I presume that the first part of the Deputy's question relates to the inclusion of Hodgkin's disease in the long term illness scheme.  It is not intended to include this disease in the scheme at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The refund of cost of drugs scheme provides a significant level of support for those who suffer from conditions such as Hodgkin's disease and who do not qualify for a medical card.  Under the scheme all expenditure in excess of £28 per month on drugs prescribed for use in a calendar month is refunded by health boards.  Persons who suffer from Hodgkin's disease <Col N="475" /> and who have medical cards obtain their drugs free of charge under the GMS scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to payment of the disabled persons maintenance allowance to persons suffering from Hodgkin's disease, payment of this allowance is made to persons who in the opinion of a medical officer are substantially handicapped in undertaking work of a kind which, if they were not suffering from a disability, would be suited to their age, experience and qualifications.  It is the degree of handicap rather than nature of the disease that determines whether a person qualifies for a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The allowance is subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>The question of carrying out repairs, reconstructions or extensions to hospitals in Country Clare is a matter for the MidWestern Health Board in the first instance.  The only proposal I have from the board at present relates to Raheen District Hospital where the board is anxious to carry out some improvements and this is being examined at present.  I have of course received a planning brief for the complete redevelopment of Ennis General Hospital but owing to the current difficult financial situation it is not possible to indicate when this scheme can be allowed to proceed.  I will of course be making some funds available for improvements at Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital as part of the programme for improving these institutions.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that an applicant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 23 November 1984 and her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her appeal on 28 February 1985.  The appeals officer also decided that she was not available for work from 23 November 1984.  She again claimed unemployment benefit from 8 March 1985.  Following inquiries which established that she is now available for work her claim has been allowed. All arrears due were paid last week and further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The means test for unemployment assistance is designed to ensure that all applicants for unemployment assistance are treated in an equitable manner having regard to the resources available to them.  The assessment of means is conducted by a social welfare officer who visits the applicant and takes into account all relevant details in each individual case.</P>
      <P>Under the legislation governing the scheme of unemployment assistance income in cash is one of the items which must be taken into account in assessing the means of an applicant.  The income to be taken into account is the income which the person may reasonably expect to receive in the year succeeding his claim.  It is sometimes necessary to estimate this by reference to income actually received during the previous year and the legislation provides that this may be done.  This is only done however where income in the succeeding year cannot be otherwise determined.  If an applicant is assessed with income in excess of what he actually earns subsequently, it is open to him to apply for a review of his means assessment at any time.</P>

He appealed against the decision and his case was returned to the social welfare officer to afford him a further opportunity of disclosing his means.  Following the completion of further inquiries a deciding officer assessed his means at £7.65 weekly derived from the profit from his holding. He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £79.10 weekly the appropriate rate £86.75 less means £7.65 effective from 18 November 1984.  He was paid a current week last week and further payments will be made as these become due.  He was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance pending the outcome of his unemployment assistance claim.

The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 6 March 1972 to 15 September 1984 when payment of disability benefit was disallowed following an examination on 3 September 1984 by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He is, therefore, not qualified for the receipt of invalidity pension.  However, as he has appealed this decision arrangements are being made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 10 April 1985.

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that an applicant is available for work and to fulfil this condition an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed from 26 April 1984 on the grounds that by <Col N="497" /> reason of not genuinely seeking work she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance and following an oral hearing of her case on 15 August 1984 an appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment. She has not signed as unemployed since 15 August 1984.</P>

This is the rate of pension to which he is entitled having regard the assessment of his means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding and capital.  In the light of the information provided, the Deputy's representations have been accepted as a claim for an increased old age pension on behalf of the person concerned.

      <P>An investigation of the old age pension entitlements of the person concerned revealed that there had been <Col N="500" /> an increase in his means.  Accordingly it was decided that he is entitled to a pension at the weekly rate of £15.30 from 1 February 1985.  This is the rate appropriate to the latest assessment of his means consisting of the weekly value of capital and a holding.  An application for an increase in pension was subsequently received from the person concerned stating that he no longer had any capital.  In the circumstances the matter has been referred to the social welfare officer for reinvestigation.

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 14 January 1984, fourth day of incapacity, to 11 January 1985. Payment ceased at that date as he had less than the required minimum of 156 paid contributions to his credit since entry into insurance to entitle him to payment in excess of 52 weeks.  According to the records of the Department, he has only 123 paid contributions.  He was notified accordingly on 26 January 1985.  In order to requalify for payment of disability benefit he would need a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which contributions at the appropriate rate have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He claimed unemployment benefit <Col N="501" /> from 1 February 1985 and his claim was allowed at the rate of £76.25 weekly.  He was not entitled to unemployment benefit during the period before 1 February as one of the conditions for entitlement is that the claimant must be capable of work and he had submitted medical evidence showing that he was incapable of work during the period.  He has accordingly been paid all unemployment benefit to which he is entitled and further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The widow's non-contributory pension which is in payment of the person concerned was recently reviewed to take account of increases in her British pension since the previous assessment of her means.  This review resulted in a reduction in the Irish pension from £23.30 a week to £11.30 a week with effect from 8 February 1985.  This is the rate of pension payable to a widow over 66 years and under 80 years with no qualified children whose weekly means exceed £34 but do not exceed £36.  The claimant's means, derived from a British pension, were assessed at £36 a week.  She appealed against this decision and her case has been submitted to an appeals <Col N="503" /> officer for determination and will be dealt with at the earliest possible opportunity.

He appealed against the disallowance and he was examined on 18 December 1984 by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His case has been referred to an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing as soon as possible.  He will be notified of the time and place of the hearing when the arrangements have been made.  There is no trace of hospital certificates having been received from the claimant.  He has been advised to forward medical evidence of the period of hospitalisation <Col N="506" /> and his claim will then be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a family income supplement at the weekly rate of £9.75 from 6 September 1984 and the order book was issued to the designated post office on 17 January 1985.  As it appears that the claimant did not receive the formal notification in the matter, a further notification has now been issued to him.</P>

      <P>The entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that an applicant must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to obtain work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 11 December 1984.  Following inquiries her claim was disallowed for a period of 6 weeks from 11 December 1984 and a further period of 6 weeks from 16 January 1985 on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her appeal on 21 March 1985.  The appeals officer also decided that she was not genuinely seeking work during the periods in question.  She continues to sign as unemployed and inquiries are being made to establish whether she satisfies the condition of being available for work from 27 February 1985.  Her entitlement to unemployment assistance from that date will be determined in the light of the outcome of the investigations</P>

A separate allocation for those activities will be made later in 1985.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 645, 646, 647, 648, 649 and 650 together.  It is not normal practice to furnish the information requested by the Deputy on an individual college basis.  In any event I am not satisfied that I would be justified in the utilisation of staff time which the preparation of a reply to questions of this nature necessitate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 651 and 652 together.  Regarding the provision of a new post-primary school on the east side of Galway city I refer the Deputy to my reply to her question, No. 702 of 11 March 1985.  The spare capacity in Galway post-primary schools is of the order of 140 places according to the information available to the Department.</P>
      <P>The Department would wish in an urban context such as this for a minimum of 500 pupil places required on a long-term basis and which were not available in existing schools, before it would provide a new school.</P>
      <P>Some 1,160 pupils from the east side of Galway are attending post-primary schools in the city at present.  Next September it is estimated that about 275 pupils for primary schools in that part of the city will enrol in post-primary schools. With regard to the provision of school transport, recognised post-primary pupils who reside at least three miles from their appropriate centre are eligible for school transport and may avail themselves of this facility subject to the conditions of the post-primary school transport scheme.</P>
