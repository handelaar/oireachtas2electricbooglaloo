      <P>&mdash;&mdash;section 4, which enables the Minister to grant licences authorising the carrying on of businesses within a free port; section 10, which adapts the law relating to customs duties in its application to a free port; and section 12, which enables the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing, <i>inter alia,</i> for the necessary customs controls and procedures to apply to a free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> The origins of this Bill lie in the deliberations of the task force on employment in the Cork area, which made a number of recommendations in 1984 designed to stimulate economic activity and employment in the Cork region. Among the recommendations was that a free port be established at Ringaskiddy.  I will return presently to the arrangements that might be applied to that location but first I want to indicate the nature and extent of the benefits which it is proposed would be conferred on businesses setting up in a free port.</P>
    <P>The financial benefits will derive from deferred liability for customs duties and VAT.  In the case of customs duties, the Bill provides that non-European Community goods imported into a free port will become liable for customs duties only if and when they are subsequently placed on the Community market.  This is the effect of section 10.  Goods originating in the European Community, of course, are in free circulation and are not subject to customs duties on arrival in the State in any event.  The benefit of this concession to the cash flow of a particular business will depend, of course, on the nature and extent of that business.  An indication of the degree of potential benefit is that the average rate of customs duty is of the order of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The proposed VAT reliefs are not provided for in the Bill.  They will be the subject of separate regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT Act.  The main thrust of the regulations will be as follows.  Firstly, a business operating within a free port would be able to import, without payment of VAT, materials, machinery, and so on, for use in the free port in connection with processing or manufacturing there.  Secondly, VAT would be charged at the zero rate on goods supplied within the free port itself.  Thirdly, goods entering the rest of the State from the free port would come under the internal VAT system if the subject of a sale, which would normally be the case, and would not then incur import VAT.</P>
    <P>Under these arrangements, finished consumer goods would not qualify for <Col N="1534" /> relief from VAT on importation into a free port nor in general would any other goods imported for re-sale.  Relief would apply to all materials, components plant or machinery imported for use by a manufacturing or processing concern within a free port.  This is the correct approach, since the purpose of the concessions is to stimulate economic activity and therefore employment within the free port and not simply to divert normal trade from elsewhere in the State.</P>
    <P>Apart from these financial benefits, a free port will also afford some less tangible but nonetheless real and valuable advantages, namely, a concentration of facilities and infrastructure leading to economies of scale, a more secure environment and simplification of customs procedures and documentation. These I expect to be attractive to small firms and to firms which might not otherwise become involved in re-export trade.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the initial area to be designated as a free port at Ringaskiddy will be comparatively small.  Cork Harbour Commissioners have proposed the designation of a 30-acre site of theirs at Ringaskiddy which is beside the car ferry terminal and near the deepwater berth which will be completed next year.  The commissioners have proposed that they should develop this site in conjunction with private interests.  Another possibility would be the provision and development of a site elsewhere in the area by private interests.  The designated areas can be extended by order made under section 2 of the Bill, when enacted, as the need arises.  I envisage the provision of infrastructure being phased in line with the development of activity in the free port.</P>
    <P>As regards the day-to-day management and control of the Ringaskiddy free port, I am still considering a number of options.  One of these would involve a joint venture between Cork Harbour Commissioners and private sector partners and this would tie in with use of the commissioners' site to which I have already referred.  Private investors, of course, would expect to earn a return on <Col N="1535" /> their capital through the sale or letting of accommodation in the free port to businesses establishing operations there. With my permission, Cork Harbour Commissioners will shortly test the market, as it were, by inviting potential investors in the free port to submit proposals on the basis of the joint venture approach.  This exercise is being conducted without any commitment since there are other options to consider.</P>
    <P>I would also be willing to consider proposals from the private sector to operate and manage the free port on sites other than that owned by Cork Harbour Commissioners. I have a fairly open mind on these questions at present and the feedback from the commissioners' invitation will assist me in taking decisions on these matters.</P>
    <P>I am aware that free ports in the UK have been slow to develop and that there have been criticisms that the customs regime is too rigid.  Here, as in the UK, the free port will be subject to the criteria laid down in EC directives.  We must remember that, to a large extent, a free port here is a free zone within a larger customs zone &mdash; the European Community. The regime in Ireland must, by virtue of our membership of the EC, be much the same as that applying to the free ports in the UK.  Like the free ports in the UK I do not expect the free port at Ringaskiddy to become an overnight success.  With vigorous marketing by the operator I am confident that firms will be attracted to set up in the free port over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the Government's concern in legislating to provide free ports here is to generate additional economic activity.  If the free port simply diverts economic activity from elsewhere in the State the concept will have failed. I would also like to point out that the Government have no desire that a free port should be used as a warehousing centre in which imports can be stored pending release for consumption on the home market.  If that were to be the case, the free port benefit would merely serve to subsidise the importation of goods and <Col N="1536" /> the end result would be to increase the competitive position of imports <i>vis-à-vis</i> goods produced at home.  What we wish to achieve is additional economic activity.  It is in the light of these factors that applications for licences to carry on activity within the free port will be considered.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that there exists already a number of mechanisms through which firms can suspend payment of customs duties.  The inward processing regime exists for non-Community goods. Firms who export a substantial part of their production outside the European Economic Community usually qualify for this regime.  A firm who do not at present qualify for inward processing could, if they set up in the free port, qualify for an inward processing type regime and thereby achieve deferment of payment of customs duty.</P>
    <P>I am proceeding with this enabling measure now while the options for the arrangements as regards development and management of the Ringaskiddy free port are being investigated, precisely so as to lend impetus to that investigation. The Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and I will proceed, on enactment of the Bill, to make the necessary orders and regulations as quickly as possible to bring the Ringaskiddy free port into being.  Work on the necessary orders and regulations will proceed while the Bill is being processed through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the course of my earlier remarks I mentioned the new deepwater berth being provided at Ringaskiddy.  The cost of the berth is being met from a State grant of almost £10 million.  When the berth is completed next year, it will be capable of accommodating vessels of up to 60,000 tons deadweight.  It will, therefore, be the largest common user berth in the State.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the IDA have a fully serviced 1,000-acre portside estate at Ringaskiddy.  This site and the port at Ringaskiddy together with industrial estates at Churchfield, Hollyhill and Togher in Cork have been designated by <Col N="1537" /> the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism as areas which qualify for higher IDA grants than are generally made available.  The Government have funded the cost of new infrastructure in the area.  This includes substantial process water supplies, effluent disposal and road improvements.  With the completion of the deepwater berth and the setting up of the free port the Ringaskiddy area will, I trust, prove to be a major centre for industrial activity in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last sentence of his speech the Minister of State said he trusts that the free port in the Ringaskiddy area, together with the IDA site, will prove to be a major centre for industrial activity in the Cork area.  That seems to long finger the very severe economic difficulties that obtain in Cork city and region now.  Earlier in his speech he said he did not expect that this free port area would bring immediate substantial improvement in economic activity in the area.  I do not have to remind the House how badly needed a stimulus to economic activity is at present in Cork city and area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to do a brief Cook's Tour through the Minister's speech.  It is an enabling Bill and no doubt, as happened in the House of Commons on the occasion when free ports were introduced in the UK, other Members of this House will be on their feet commending the free port type facility for their own areas.  The Minister of State said in his speech that the origins of this Bill lie in the deliberations of the task force on employment in the Cork area.  I am sorry that Deputy John Kelly is not in the House because Deputy Kelly often criticises the administration here for following in the footsteps of the UK Parliament in bringing legislation here and establishing customs and even order in the House, because this idea of a free port surfaced at the same time as it was a live political question in the House of Commons and in Government in England.  His acerbic tongue <Col N="1538" /> might be applied to this imitation technique that the Government are following.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State says that the financial benefits will derive from deferred liability for customs duties and VAT.  The House should take note that the concessions in this regard are not great considering what it means to a member of the EC which from 1 January 1986 will be a 12 country Community where we have, technically at least, a customs equalising zone.  One of the points that surfaced when this was being discussed in Britain was that there were very limited advantages in the establishment of a free port.  If and when a company is established to deal with positive promotion of manufacturing industry in particular in the area, it may bring the necessary stimulus to economic activity in Cork which, on the face of it, this Bill will not do.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentions the Ringaskiddy area and says that the area to be designated will be comparatively small.  He goes on to mention that the Cork Harbour Commissioners have proposed a designation of a 30 acre site at Ringaskiddy near the car ferry terminal and near the deep water mark.  He goes on to say that they have proposed that they should develop this site in conjunction with private interests but he does not say whether he is accepting their position or that that will be the site.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in his reply to state what is the Government's view as to the location of the site.  He says that it will be comparatively small, but he does not say straight out what the Government's decision on it will be.  He tells us that he still has an open mind about a number of options for day-to-day management and control.  I will be going through some of the points that surfaced when this debate was taking place in Britain.  One of the ideological points made in that debate was that the Government would give no aid whatsoever to the free ports in Britain. Would the Minister like to indicate in his reply what kind of aid he envisages <Col N="1539" /> for the activity, industrial and commercial, which the free port, it is hoped, will attract?</P>
    <P>One point the Minister of State makes which is important is not quite as relevant in the case of Cork as it might have been some years ago.  It is the question of relocation.  Because of disastrous economic policies, in Cork city there is very little major industry to relocate in any place because under this regime we have had the most prominent large industrial concerns closing down.  Examples are Fords, Dunlops, and Verolme Cork Dockyard.  They will not relocate on the new free port territory because they have been effectively killed.  The danger of relocation in Cork anyway from the immediate vicinity seems to be one that the Minister should not worry too much about.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentions the new deep water berth.  I had the privilege of allocating money for the development of that deep water berth and of inspecting the area and the large IDA site near at hand.  This Government's action was, of course, to withdraw the Government grant for the development of a deep sea port in Ringaskiddy and due to pressure from Fianna Fáil groups, national and local, the Government were forced, because of the disastrous position of Cork, to resume and develop the deep water berth.  So much for the Minister's thin speech.</P>
    <P>I will take a general look at the whole idea of free ports.  It is a proud boast of the Fianna Fáil Party that the first customs free port in the world was established by a Fianna Fáil Minister, the late Deputy Seán Lemass.  I took the trouble to study his speech in the debate on the Second Stage of the Customs Free Airport Bill, 1947.  We all know that he was a very practical man and his speech shows that practical bent.  It is interesting to read some of the prophesies made by people who were opposing the idea at the time.  In the debate on 28 January 1947 Deputy Seán Lemass said that as regards the developing of any processings business he would keep that in mind and <Col N="1540" /> that that was the way his thoughts were tending.  That was the famous occasion when Deputy Dillon &mdash; this has never been forgotten &mdash; talked about rabbits at Rineanna.  Deputy Dillon said:</P>
    <P>I do not think that rational people have any doubt that, in ten years' time, no transatlantic passenger plane bound for the Continent of Europe or Great Britain will stop at Rineanna, and if there was nothing but passenger traffic scheduled for Rineanna in ten years time we would have nothing in Rineanna but rabbits.</P>
    <P>He suggested to the Minister:</P>
    <P>...if we are to salvage anything out of Rineanna &mdash; and it is very problematical whether we will or not; it is more than likely that Rineanna will be a deserted wilderness in ten years' time and any aerial traffic we have will be handled at Collinstown or some station near Dublin &mdash; we must at once provide certain facilities and tell those we expect to use them what those facilities are.</P>
    <P>I give those quotations to warn people about prophesying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was a shrewd and able man who was perhaps inclined to let flamboyant language carry him away but, shrewd as he was &mdash; he was a business man also &mdash; he did not see the possibility of development at Shannon and he has lived, I am happy to say, to see a substantial industrial town at Shannon Airport and the airport being heavily used, in particular by the USSR Aeroflot operations. Shannon is on the way up again.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad debate at the time Senator Douglas said Shannon was an inappropriate name, that Rineanna was the correct name and that people might get the idea from a name like Shannon that they were landing in the middle of the largest river in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The most ideal position for a free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy might pick that one up.  The idea of a free <Col N="1541" /> port is not a new one and we know that even in medieval Europe, in the Hanseatic League, free ports were established for <i>entrepôt</i> trade in Northern Europe.  When the idea got under way recently in Britain a study was made of Hamburg, Shannon and Miami.  The comments of some of the people who were opposed to the whole idea but studied those ports are interesting.</P>
      <P>In Britain there were 45 applications. I do not think there will be that number in Ireland.  I am aware that, as the Minister said, this is enabling legislation, but I am sure there will be pressure from a number of areas.  Deputy Collins has already put in his claim and Deputy Hugh Byrne mentioned to me that Rosslare would be talking.  Deputy Kirk from Louth said that Greenore would be interested.  Of the 45 applications in the United Kingdom six were accepted.  It is important to establish the free port at Cork as quickly as possible and to proceed to consideration of the others because Southampton was one of the ones chosen for a free port facility in England.  As far as I know, with one possible exception, the companies chosen to run the free ports in the UK are not public companies.  That is important because the Tory Government have a kind of fixation about State investment. What suits them would not necessarily suit us, but I want to point out to the House that Associated British Ports has been chosen to run Southamptom.  Cardiff has also been chosen as a free port and Pearce (Wales) Consortium will run it.  Liverpool will be a free port and will be run by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company.  In the Midlands, Birmingham has been chosen with West Midlands Free Port Limited to run it.  Prestwick is the exception because Kyle and Carrick District Council and the British Airports Authority will be in charge of the development there.  A parallel could be the Cork Harbour Board, Cork Corporation, Cork County Council or any of the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy has been enunciated in relation to local government and, in accordance with Lemass philosophy, the suggestion is that local authorities should <Col N="1542" /> develop as agencies for industrial and commercial development.  In other words, that each county council or corporation could develop as industrial promoters. The other one chosen is in Ireland but, unfortunately, as of now &mdash; we are waiting for the Taoiseach's development &mdash; is not under the Dublin Government.  A decision was taken to develop Belfast as a free port.  Development there was listed for 1985, with Northern Ireland Airports Limited being the company charged with the responsibility for developing the port there.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that one of the representatives, called Dr. Paisley, indicated that he thought the airport should be combined with Belfast harbour on a joint basis for the free port.  Later when I deal with Miami, the most successful free port in the world, I will indicate what the prerequisites are.  Cork is lucky in that it has a harbour and a deep sea facility, thanks to a decision taken by a Government of which I was glad to be a member, and that it also has an airport capable and in need of development.  Those facilities are there as basic ingredients for the development of the Cork area.  The other areas mentioned, Shannon Estuary, Rosslare and Greenore, have their own strengths even if they are standing, perhaps, on one leg only, a sea leg which is always supposed to be a good one. Shannon Airport is near to the estuary for that development.</P>
    <P>One of the points made in the House of Commons debate was the one to which I have already referred and which the Minister mentioned, namely the danger of relocation.  There is not much danger of that in Cork.  Green field development seems to be the only possible way ahead for Cork.  One of the big advantages claimed for the free port idea is the cash flow. There may be a certain discrimination in favour of the free port in that there would be a hold-up of the customs duty and VAT in the constricted terms the Minister has explained.</P>
    <P>I want to call attention to an article in <i>The Economist</i> of February 1983 where they tell of the dilemma of a Mr. Jock Bruce-Gardyne who was asked to inquire <Col N="1543" /> into the possibility and the customs and excise officials said that the thing was not worthwhile.  Many of the towns mentioned in the original proposition did not achieve free port status.  Felixtowe did not achieve it but others did.  It is important to realise that the customs people were totally opposed to it in Britain when it was first mooted and indicated that on account of the existence of the EC there was very little that would be available in a free port which would not be available outside it, with a certain amount of administrative co-operation.</P>
    <P>A critical article in the <i>New Statesman</i> dealt with a number of points which may not be of great relevance to the free port at Cork.  The idea came originally from a labour ideologist and he pushed very hard for the establishment of free ports in order to re-animate inner cities, including Liverpool.  He said they were most successful where wage rates were low.  He was thinking mainly of the Far East in this regard.  That will not obtain as far as free ports in Ireland are concerned.  It was an odd ideological mix because Peter Hall, a Labour ideologue, was the first to moot the idea in 1977 but a very right wing economic institute, the Adam Smith Institute with bases in London and Washington, supported it.  It is from that source that the refusal to support with State finance comes in the scheme that has been developed in Britain and Ireland, since they decided to make a free port at the airport in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>The most successful example is Miami, the biggest privately-owned venture in the world.  It is well to look at it, although there may not be very much profit to be derived from a study of it.  The most important aspect is its location because it can deal with the United States, Latin America and Europe.  Miami had become even a holiday centre for Europeans until the dollar went through the roof and killed that business.  Miami is in a unique position, geographically speaking, for this kind of development.  It has a very large cargo airport besides the port, and the latter is the third largest on the Eastern coast of the US.  It is also interesting <Col N="1544" /> that a director of Miami was invited by the Scots to look at Prestwick and advise them on how to develop.  I am sure the Minister of State will not fail to get useful advice about the development of free ports in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One significant point is that there are only two customs officers covering this huge venture at Miami.  They are technically very well equipped.  An article in <i>The Times</i> on 11 May 1983 stated:</P>
    <P>Customs services in the Miami zone are provided by just two officers using extensive data processing equipment. The problem is that while they have the absolute right to open anything and everything, that sort of thorough search is physically impossible.  And this means worries about contraband.</P>
    <P>Drugs are a particular concern in the Miami area.  They have sniffer dogs but they have never discovered any drugs. The article continues:</P>
    <P>Security is provided by television and microwave systems while stock control is provided by the same computerised systems used by customs to ensure that what goes in is known to have gone out.</P>
    <P>Those problems will all surface in whatever free ports are established.  The Minister specifically mentioned Cork.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a big development, first-class world standard services must be provided.  There is the <i>entrepôt</i> aspect of the free port and I do think that is what this country envisages.  We are more interested in manufacturing industry, hopefully with native capital so that we will not have a larger black hole in the economy than we have as of now. Recently there have been worried statements about this year as well as last year.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read the comment of the Minister about Shannon.  I am quoting now from <i>The London Times</i> of 25 January, 1984:</P>
    <P>So off we went to look at three prime examples already operating under EC <Col N="1545" /> rules: Rotterdam, Hamburg and Shannon.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that he was against it from the word go or was conditioned, being the Minister in charge of that sector of customs and excise.</P>
    <P>The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>Rotterdam turned out not to be a free port by Community definition at all, while Hamburg was <i>sui generis</i></P>
    <P>&mdash; which is not an argument at all &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;having most to do with the ancient Hanseatic tradition of <i>entrepôt</i> business with eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Shannon was the real McCoy, but unfortunately its <i>raison d'être</i> had largely disappeared with Eire's entry into the EC.  Originally set up to rescue Shannon airport when the transatlantic airlines no longer had to stop there to refuel, it had become an industrial estate with special fiscal privileges; while Shannon airport was saved &mdash; just about &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and here we have the patronising remark &mdash;</P>
    <P>by vigorous promotion among the Irish American community of visits to the leprechauns.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is typical of that kind of smart aleck comment.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>We finally concluded that Customs was right to argue that free ports in Britian would have no tangible advantages....</P>
    <P>If you accept the ideology, he said that he had decided to go on ahead &mdash; and this was pork-barrel politics before the general election in Britain&mdash;</P>
    <P>Subject to one proviso: that any sites selected for experiment must stand or fall on straight commercial criteria &mdash; no subsidies or special privileges.</P>
    <P>I presume &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to confirm this &mdash; that we have no particular ideological hang-up about that <Col N="1546" /> matter.  We introduced some time ago, before the British, VAT at point of entry. The British have since then, as this House knows, introduced it.  This being so, an early boost was expected from the budget changes in Britain in value added tax rules for importers which came into effect from October 1, 1984.  Instead of postponing that payment for up to 11 weeks, importers would have to pay VAT immediately on the goods arrival, but in the free port area they would not have to do that and consequently there was an advantage there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will be bringing in legislation as the Minister of State has already mentioned.  When we are dealing with that, we will have another opportunity to discuss the advantages and disadvantages in that regard.</P>
    <P>I shall now make some comments on the Bill.  I do not wish to delay the House too long because I know that there are very eager people, particularly from the Cork and the Munster area generally, who are anxious to make a comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the Munster area generally, thinking it was safer to say that as Deputy Collins was sitting beside me.  I will not go into specific details &mdash; that would be a Committee Stage task &mdash; but I shall have some amendments.  I want to put in context where there should be amendments.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Each free port established under this Act shall be under the control and management of such person or persons as may be designated by order by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
      <P>It is our opinion that the powers given to the Minister there are unlimited powers and we shall be having a look at that section later on.  Section 4 states &mdash; 4and I want the House to take note that we intend to deal with this on Committee Stage also &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, grant or refuse to grant to any person a licence authorising the carrying on within a free port of any trade, business or manufacture.</P>
    <P>Speaking in general terms about that section, I want to say that we on this side of the House regard the power of the Minister there as too absolute and think there should be some, so to speak, court of appeal.  There should be some way of dealing with an applicant who has been turned down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) states:</P>
    <P>A licensee who does not comply with a condition attached to the licence shall, in addition to any other penalty to which he may be liable, be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
    <P>This also needs looking into.  I presume that there is a right of appeal there in the courts, when summary conviction is mentioned.  I should like the Minister when replying to clarify that.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (1) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, at his discretion, revoke a licence if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is satisfied that there has been a breach of a condition attached to the licence, or</P>
    <P>Would the Minister like to say if he can make provision for an appeal procedure there?  It seems that there are arbitrary powers available to the Minister in that section.  Would the Minister comment on that?</P>
    <P>Section 10 (4) also needs clarification, section 10 (4) (a) in particular, but probably we shall be able to tease that out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (1) puzzles me altogether. It states:</P>
    <P>The person driving or in control of, a vehicle in motion within 32 kilometres of a free port shall stop the <Col N="1548" /> vehicle on being required to do so by an officer of customs and excise.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister expand a little on that when replying?  Have not the customs and excise officers that kind of power anyway?  Is it necessary to state that within 20 miles of the free port in Cork this can be done?  I was under the impression, judging by events which took place in my own constituency when people were travelling late at night for various purposes, that the customs and excise people have that authority anyway.  If they have, I do not see why we should duplicate the powers or specify powers which already exist in a general way.  There is an old philosophical concept of not multiplying beyond what is necessary.  I should like to have the Minister's views on that.  It is a paradox that this is to be a free port but we have to have regulations which make it something less than free.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill in so far as it goes.  Other Deputies will have more to say about it.  We welcome the Bill but we do not think it will be a panacea for all the economic ills of Cork city which have been allowed to fester and which have affected that lovely vibrant city on the Lee.</P>
    <P>During the last two periods of Fianna Fáil administration we saw the fruits of the attention which the economic development of that city had got from Fianna Fáil and it saddens us to see those advances being allowed to evaporate.  I visited Cork last weekend and it is a sad place to be because of lack of employment.</P>
    <P>I hope that as well as the free port development in Cork we will have development in manufacturing industry which will provide employment so badly needed in that city.  We do not want relocated industries from elsewhere.  We hope the development will get adequate support from the promotional authorities.  I had hoped that the IDA site at Ringaskiddy would be taken into the free port area, but from the Minister's speech that does not seem to be envisaged, though the Minister did not come down on one side <Col N="1549" /> or another in regard to the specific area to be designated.</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous business to try to be a prophet, like the distinguished James Dillon tried to be when making a point against the Seán Lemass development at Shannon.  I hope the vision of the future will be of a vigorous industrial development backed by the deep sea facility and further expansion of Cork Airport.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us the benefit of his thoughts about other areas where they are anxious to have this facility afforded to them.  At the beginning of his speech he said it is not envisaged to apply it anywhere else for the moment.  We must remember that in another part of the country the British authorities are developing a free port. Southampton is being developed.  It has a short sea run to Europe and that is an argument for further development in other areas here.  I am sure Members who have a direct interest will be specific when they speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The big problem with free ports and free zones is that too many people believe the very idea of a free trade area will make it work.  Any enabling legislation is meaningless if the zone or port is not backed by the right geographical location, transport and communications.  It needs financial services, Government co-operation and the enthusiasm of companies, especially international ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we consider Ringaskiddy, Rosslare or any other possible free port in the south east or elsewhere, let us look at other countries who have free ports and free zones.  Free ports in the US go back to 1934 and there are 85 free trade areas, most of them formed since 1970. Most of them do not work, being little more than glorified bonded warehouses. Of the free zones that have worked Miami is the biggest.  It did not spring up overnight as an answer to the need to revitalise a depressed area where traditional industry had died.  It was not the answer to vociferous lobbyists who saw a free port as a status symbol for a problem area.  Miami has become one of the most <Col N="1550" /> successful free trade zones in the world because it is a strong, international financial centre, linking Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia.  It is next door to a large cargo airport and a stone's throw from Miami port, the third largest container terminal on the US east coast.</P>
    <P>The advantages of any proposed free port site must be strictly commercial and not political.  It must be more than a tax haven.  It must have distribution, customs, broking, freight forwarding and administration services, showroom space and, preferably, an industrial zone.</P>
    <P>In March 1984, enabling legislation was introduced in the British Parliament for free ports.  They had six in mind, Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Liverpool, Southampton and Prestwick.  They were given five years to prove that they could deliver.  To date only Liverpool and Southampton are measuring up, though it is early yet to judge the performances of the others.</P>
    <P>Britain, like ourselves, appears to have accepted the concept somewhat reluctantly. Today's free ports &mdash; there are more than 400 throughout the world &mdash; go back 100 years to Hamburg.  However, the Phoenicians started the idea about 2,000 BC, and merchants grew rich carving free ports out of the feudal hinterlands in the Middle Ages.  Southampton, of the six English free ports, was a perfect commercial choice, being a prosperous expanding port.  The others were the result of political decisions.  They were less natural and owe their existence to vigorous lobbying from areas needing jobs.  Is there a lesson for us in that?</P>
    <P>There has been a very big growth in free port traffic in recent years &mdash; it is estimated that 20 per cent of world trade takes place through them.  Most of this growth has taken place in less developed and developing economies where there has been spectacular success.  We must distinguish, however, between those and free port development in the EC context where much more stringent rules apply if we are not to over-estimate the value of free ports.</P>
    <P>There are free ports in Taiwan which give 70,000 jobs, three in Malaysia with <Col N="1551" /> 22,000 jobs, two in South Korea with 120,000 jobs, one in Mexico with 70,000 jobs.  The People's Republic of China have four experiments under way, the largest bordering Hong Kong.  These developing bonfire economies jettison all restrictions, derogate company law and planning permissions, etc.  They have cheap labour forces on top of advantageous customs and tax positions.  Here in Europe, free zones are much more restrictive to prevent excessive distortion of competition by free port concessions. For us this exercise today will be entirely wasted if the net effect is merely to relocate economic activity rather than generate new and vigorous trade in any new free port in this country.</P>
    <P>In his remarks the Minister outlined the advantages we will be claiming for our new free port, bearing in mind that Shannon still has space for new industries and companies to benefit from SFADCo's generous concessions, albeit less generous since our admission to the EC. As Deputy Wilson has pointed out, Shannon was a forerunner of free ports in this part of the world.  It was the first free port to be established in the modern era. Directly or indirectly 28,000 jobs are related to its establishment.</P>
    <P>The advantages which will apply initially to a free port at Ringaskiddy include deferred liability for customs duty and VAT.  As the Minister pointed out, the VAT regulations will be dealt with another day under the VAT Act.  The most pertinent few lines of the Minister's speech were those which read as follows:</P>
    <P>The proposed VAT reliefs are not provided for in the Bill.  They will be the subject of separate regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT Act.</P>
    <P>The key to the success or failure of what we are discussing today lies in those two sentences.  Let us appeal to the Minister for Finance, to the Revenue Commissioners, to adopt and interpret EC legislation in relation to free ports in the most liberal manner possible so that we here can benefit as best possible.  At the <Col N="1552" /> same time to be fair to those people in Cork, indeed to my constituents in Wexford and to our people generally, we must not over-emphasise the benefits that may accrue from a free port in any location. Apart from the general benefits on the VAT side and the other issues outlined by the Minister, there will be economies of scale which will help business and industry tremendously in any free port or zone area.  There will be a secure environment, simplification of customs procedures and documentation.  Would that we could bonfire all the red tape and bureaucracy altogether as they can do in most developing economies.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to address ourselves to the question as to why Ringaskiddy and not another port location in our country was chosen.  I wish Ringaskiddy well. Cork has had more than its share of economic disasters, unemployment and its consequence social problems.  It cannot but benefit from this move.  As Deputy Wilson warned us, I shall not prophesy to what extent it may or may not benefit, or what may or may not be the pitfalls. There I accept his wisdom.  However, was Ringaskiddy, from a national point of view, the ideal location bearing in mind that a proliferation of free ports on our small island has to be ruled out?  How can the Government know in advance of the much-heralded national ports policy what may be the ideal location?  Has Ringaskiddy been chosen &mdash; and I paraphrase my earlier words &mdash; in response to a vigorous lobby from an area needing jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be anything more than a glorified bonded warehouse or a status symbol for a problem area?  Worse again, as its origins lie in the deliberations of the task force on unemployment in the Cork area, as the Minister told us in his remarks, is it an attempt to allow the Government to be seen to be delivering? After all, if one sets up a task force, they must have something to show to justify their existence, something to recommend. Ringaskiddy will have its industrial zone but it has no natural, commercial activity and efforts to generate these have failed.  An existing, thriving port with natural commercial and geographical advantages would appear to be a prerequisite for a successful free port according to all the experience of our competitors, experience that goes back over many years.</P>
      <P>I repeat: a free port as an answer to revitalising a depressed area where traditional industry has died has never yet been a success.  We have the examples of 400 existing ones to look to.  None chosen on political rather than strict commercial criteria has yet worked.  I hope for Cork and for all our sakes that Ringaskiddy can be the first to break this rule.  I hope especially for Ringaskiddy's sake that it will not follow the same line, because I understand that the rest of the country's ports claim to free port status will be measured on the success of the Ringaskiddy experiment.  In Britain they gave them five years to measure up.  What will we give Ringaskiddy here to measure up before the rest of the country can be considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There were complaints made about those five years there, that they were not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but initially the idea was that they would have five years to measure up the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is our Government's attitude?  Is it Ringaskiddy regardless?  Has any other area a claim for free port status?  Will it be considered?  I am assured that the Government considered Rosslare.  I do not know in what depth or at what length <Col N="1554" /> I can only accept that they considered it but that word &ldquo;considered&rdquo; can mean a lot or a little.  In regard to the remainder of the ports and there are many apart from Rosslare, New Ross, Waterford, Drogheda, Greenore and Limerick which have all been mentioned, how will their claim to status be investigated?  On what basis will it be judged?</P>
    <P>I understand that the national ports policy will be included in a Green Paper on transport due out in a few weeks.  I must reflect again on the wisdom of coming down in favour of any one port, Ringaskiddy, Rosslare or anywhere else, in advance of the national ports policy. The south east region would appear to be the most suitable area geographically for any free port we might be establishing. There are many ports in the south-east with a claim to being suitable for consideration. SERDO, the South East Region Development Organisation, recently commissioned a report from An Foras Forbartha on the feasibility of free port development in the south east. Rosslare, New Ross and Waterford all have applied to the Government for free port status from this region.</P>
    <P>Rosslare was the first port to apply for free port status in 1981.  CIE are the port authority in Rosslare.  I am afraid that their response to a request for a submission by An Foras Forbartha for their consideration was less than enthusiastic, like that of the other port authorities in the south-east.  A short two weeks ago at a public meeting in Rosslare, CIE indicated that reclamation of land to the north west of the existing piers in Rosslare would not necessarily be a major financial consideration.  This would now appear to remove what heretofore was a major drawback to this port's claim of free port status, namely, an inadequate land bank.</P>
    <P>Over the next two years CIE are embarking on a £5 million development plan for Rosslare harbour port.  I understand that only today the car-coach customs clearance terminal building is due to start &mdash;&ldquo;at last&rdquo;, we all echo.  This programme will modernise the port, one which now ranks second behind Dublin <Col N="1555" /> only in trade value terms.  The latest figures available show that in 1984 11½ per cent of trade value throughput in our ports was in Rosslare.  This was an increase for 1980 of almost 3½ per cent, unlike Dublin, the leading port, which decreased over the same period from 36½ per cent of the trade value to 29½ per cent, a seven per cent decrease.  I accept that much can be made of statistics but Rosslare has made strong advances and is safely second to Dublin, the only two ports with double figure shares of trade values.  Waterford ranks next, in third place, with 7.6 per cent share of trade value.  New Ross is in ninth place with approximately .9 of 1 per cent of trade value or port throughput.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, established commercial criteria have been the main yardstick of successful free ports in other countries. We cannot afford to ignore the statistics before us and the Government cannot afford to ignore them either.  The bias of trade and the increasing exports to mainland Europe with a decrease in trade value to the UK are pointed out by the combined performance of the south-east region ports, Waterford, Rosslare and New Ross, which in 1984 accounted for 26.1 per cent of the Republic's exports, or 39 per cent by value of exports via sea ports alone.  Need I say that Rosslare headed the list with 15½ per cent?  Even if we were to accept that the Government are now in a position to state categorically the ideal location for our next free port &mdash; possibly the last free port which will be established given the size of the country &mdash; and even if statistics proved otherwise and pointed to political decisions rather than to sound commercial ones being a sound basis for choice, Rosslare's case for free port status must still head the list.</P>
    <P>The unemployment statistics for Wexford town and district hit a tragic 25 per cent in March 1985.  In Wexford we have the lowest percentage of adults employed in the whole country except, perhaps, in Donegal the figures for which are suspect on the grounds that many on the register are smallholders and technically not <Col N="1556" /> available for employment anyway. Therefore, I put those figures aside and reiterate that Wexford has the lowest percentage of adult population at work in the entire country.  Our difference from the Cork area is that our decline was slow and insidious and not dramatic and sudden enough to be studied by a task force.  Granted, we have a smaller population than Cork but our percentage employed is and has been for years above that of Cork.  These are tragic figures. However, I should prefer that a free port location was chosen on sound commercial grounds when a full review of the national situation was to hand.</P>
    <P>On commercial considerations Rosslare cannot and will not be passed over.  It is a specialist ferry port, non-tidal, the nearest port to Europe, has a swift roll-on roll-off service appealing especially to high value freight and a superb infrastructural service thanks to the ongoing commitment of Wexford County Council.  There is also a rail link, a large labour force and, most important, a strong history of profit.  From 1983 to 1984 profits doubled to over £1 million.  I think I am right in saying that Rosslare was the only profitable venture of CIE during this period.  It is with some interest that I note the increase in activity and concern by CIE towards Rosslare harbour. Thankfully it is happening, albeit late, but the cynic in me wonders if it has anything to do with the two sentences in the National, Social and Economic Plan suggesting a new port authority for the area.  That was in September 1984 and Deputy Browne will have to agree that we have had far more co-operation from CIE during the last 12 months than we have had in the years of my lifetime in Wexford.</P>

      <P>Thank you, I hope we will agree on other matters too.  As I said, profits doubled in one year in Rosslare and we know how difficult business generally was in the year.  They doubled despite the lack of commitment by all <Col N="1557" /> concerned.  Over one million passengers will have gone through Rosslare by December 1985.  There was an increase of over 6,500 coaches, with a corresponding increase annually over the years in the roll-on roll-off units and freight cars.  I wish Ringaskiddy every success and I mean that sincerely because I feel that our chance and the other ports' chance of consideration for free port status will depend on whether Ringaskiddy stands or falls.  I hope the Government have chosen Ringaskiddy for the right, sound reasons and I sincerely hope that they will not be raising the expectations of people in the Cork area unduly.  It is in all our interests that Ringaskiddy succeeds. The success of any free port enabling legislation rests in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to VAT regulations.  I appeal to them to be as liberal as possible and to ensure that the free port in Ringaskiddy and any subsequent free ports are a success.</P>

      <P>I dtosach ní mór dom, tréaslú leis an Aire as ucht an Bille a thabhairt os comhair an Tí.  Nílim sásta in aon chor leis an am atá tógtha ag an Rialtas agus an Aire an Bille seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I am, however, dissatisfied with some of its aspects.  It is not strong enough, it does not go far enough and it does not comply with the wishes of the task force set up by the Government to examine the frightful state of affairs in Cork, particularly under the Coalition Government.  I also condemn the late arrival of the Bill when we realise that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism indicated as far back as May 1984 that the Government has accepted at least that element of the task force report and said that they would introduce a free port Bill based on their recommendations.  Of course, in mentioning the task force, I should say that their report never came before this House and I have always had the feeling that there is so much condemnation of the Government in it that that is why it has never seen the light of day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been asked during the course of <Col N="1558" /> this debate why Ringaskiddy was chosen. This Bill is an enabling one and if other areas can prove that there is a need for a free port which would be commercially viable they will be given consideration.  I take Deputy Doyle's point that her county is worse off, as far as unemployed in concerned, than Cork.  It is a fair admission from a member of a Government party.  If such is the case because of the inactivity and dithering of this Government, I can assure the Deputy I will give my support to the granting of free port status for her area.</P>
    <P>Cork city and county have a number of natural characteristics that we realised would be of benefit to the region after our entry to the EC.  People may wonder why Cork has been selected to benefit from the legislation now before us.  We have the second largest concentration of population, we have a deep shelter harbour facility, the port is suitable for the establishment of heavy industries involving products and raw materials more easily moved by sea, and traditionally the lower harbour has been used by transatlantic liners.  This is adequate proof of its ability to receive large ships.</P>
    <P>In the sixties there were the first signs of moves by industry to take advantage of these facilities.  Another advantage was the proximity of Cork harbour to the Continent and its suitability for transatlantic trade.  Cork as the major port on the south coast should have been able to attract the bulk of trade between Ireland and the Continent.  Realising this, the local authority in the Cork area encouraged the IDA to acquire more than 1,000 acres of land.  Cork County Council saw the need to supply the area with an adequate water supply in order to encourage heavy industries to the harbour and they set up what became known as the Cork City and Harbour Water Scheme. To this end Cork County Council invested a sum of £47 million, but the only assistance given to them was a concession by the IDA with regard to 50 per cent of loan charges.  There was no other contribution to that scheme from any other source.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> We have spent millions of pounds on the road network in conjunction with the harbour board.  I am talking now about the sixties and the period up to 1973.  The schemes to develop the harbour and to provide a deep water berth were approved by the Government at the time. I will give the House some figures in respect of the tonnage of vessels entering Cork harbour.  In 1952 tonnage in respect of vessels from ports in England, Northern Ireland and the Republic amounted to 609,565 tons and in 1961 it had risen to 977,883.  In 1961 tonnage into the harbour from ports other than Great Britain and Ireland was 1,014,376 tons.  Clearly Cork harbour was rapidly developing trade with countries other than Great Britain, even before the prospect of our entry to the EC.</P>
    <P>Complementing the location of Cork as a port and its suitability for industrial development was a large agricultural hinterland. From the scale of the dairy products industries in Cork and the pigs and bacon industry in the larger area of Munster, it was possible to envisage how stronger trade links with the Continent could have given new opportunities for agricultural processing industries and the export of agricultural goods from Cork.</P>
    <P>During the seventies we made attempts to develop the deep water berth but it is an established fact that on two occasions the previous Coalition Government abandoned the development of this facility and at one stage stopped the work for the sake of £2 million.  We are all well aware of the commitment of Deputy Barry, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It was mentioned today that perhaps this free port area is being set up because of political pressure.  Undoubtedly there has been such pressure from the Cork area but it was warranted.  Much of it was combined political activity by all parties but it must be acknowledged that this side of the House also applied pressure. On a previous occasion when Deputy Barry commented on the shelving of the development of the deep water berth, he said that the £2 million would be spent when there was a firm commitment from <Col N="1560" /> industry to establish at Ringaskiddy.  I am very clear about that.  However, because of political pressure we got the Coalition Government to realise the need to continue this development and ultimately they relented.  They allowed the deep water berth to develop on the lines planned years before they came to office.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor the previous speaker need worry that the setting up of the free port area in Cork will shift economic development from other areas. It is my hope that this legislation will reactivate what existed already in Cork until the Coalition Government came to power, namely, industrial and economic activity and jobs for the people in the Cork area.  Even though I said at the beginning that this legislation is not strong enough, I am of the opinion it will give some hope to the depressed people in the south-west and that it will have a beneficial effect on the economic and industrial life of the Cork area.  I hope it will generate economic development rather than transfer it.  In any event, because of the inactivity of this Government, economic activity is so limited that it would be almost impossible to shift it from one place to another.  We have had nothing but closures and liquidations during the term of this Government.  Our economic development is too depressed to attract investment.</P>

Since 1973 we have had eight years of Coalition Government.  We can only hope that the Government will acknowledge the need that has been identified clearly by the local authorities involved and that instead of shelving £2 million for the development of the harbour will provide a roll on-roll off service.</P>
      <P>Somebody said that one can do anything with figures, but the record of Coalition Governments cannot be denied.  It is because of that record that our economy is in such a depressed state. There is no encouragement for the people to invest in the economy.  Coalitions have always blamed their failures on some extraneous events.  For example, in the 1948-51 period the then Coalition blamed the Korean War for their failures while in the 1951-54 period the scapegoat was the Suez Canal problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am outlining the need for this Bill.  While I welcome the Bill I condemn the delay in introducing it.  In May 1984 the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism announced that Ringaskiddy port and industrial estate would be designated and operated as a free port.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Bill goes far enough nor that it is strong enough in terms of what we have sought for the area.  I fear that the legislation will not be sufficient to encourage that sort of activity that would be warranted in terms of the preparations, infrastructural and so on, that have been made by the local authorities.  What is lacking is a commitment from the Government but that has been a feature of successive Coalitions.  I acknowledge that at times all of us who represent the Cork area spoke collectively for the area but I would remind the Minister that we have introduced motions here relating to various matters &mdash; unemployment and so on &mdash; in the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these efforts had the distinct objective of urging the Government into taking the action that was necessary.  But these kinds of delays are hallmarks of Coalition Governments.  Why has it taken from May 1984 to November 1985 to have the debate on the legislation begun?  The necessity for the free port was recognised in May 1984.  The consensus of opinion was that the change would help the Cork area in terms of industrial development and in terms of the creation of the employment that is so badly needed there.  Instead of asking why Ringaskiddy should be chosen, I will be expecting Government speakers to ask why such a long time has elapsed in dealing with the legislation.  I do not consider the Bill adequate to deal with the industrial area <Col N="1563" /> as well as with the port area.  There are limitations in the Bill but I hope these will be removed by the time we reach the Committee and other stages.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to the operator of the area.  Are we to witness another piece of political patronage in regard to the appointment of an operator and of the people concerned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had much of that kind of patronage from this Government but in the best interests of Cork one can only express the hope that they will not embark on a political patronage gravy train on this occasion.  The harbour board are to be commended for their submission to the Minister.  I am pleased that the Minister adopted some of the board's suggestions and proposals.  He is to be commended for that.  In setting up the operator appointment, the Minister should take account of the fact that the local authority in whose jurisdiction all the activity is to take place are Cork County Council.  Despite repeated requests to the Government for a representative from the county council to be appointed to the harbour board, we are still awaiting a response.</P>
      <P>I trust that the opportunity presented in the setting up of the operator position will not be lost in terms of a county council representative being appointed to the board.  In addition to the task force from which the proposal in regard to the free port emanated in the first instance, a working group comprising representatives of the harbour board, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and the IDA were set up.  That group made recommendations regarding the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy.  They completed their findings in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report said that the free port would be initially located on a 30 acre site on the Harbour Commissioners reclaimed land at Ringaskiddy and that the provision of future expansion of the free port <Col N="1564" /> be made on either the Harbour Commissioners' or the IDA's land, or privately owned land.  I hope the free port area will take in the massive land bank acquired by the IDA for industrial development for which Cork County Council are developing an infrastructure to serve the area.  I would also like to see a free port company operate manage, develop and market the free port on a commercial basis in conjunction with the Cork Harbour Commissioners.  That might eliminate some of the possible political patronage to which I referred but then I presume that there would be some political patronage from this Government among the appointments to the free port company.</P>
    <P>The experimental free ports in Britain have been in existence for over 12 months and the consensus of opinion is that the concept is being held back by inflexible attitudes and regulations.  The regulations have not been introduced with this enabling Bill.  They will be the key to the success or otherwise of the free port areas.  I must emphasise that.  We can talk about setting up a free port in Ringaskiddy, who will be involved in it and the possibilities of other free ports being set up throughout the country, but that is only part of the problem.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for the Minister to hear of the experience of the free port managers in Britain.  They say the rules are being interpreted too harshly and that a relaxation of attitudes would go a long way towards creating more confidence in this concept.  I strongly urge that the regulations be given the power they deserve to ensure that the setting up of the free port area in Ringaskiddy, and in other places later, will not be constrained or restricted and that the maximum value will be obtained for the free port area.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the setting up of a free port area in Ringaskiddy has been very largely motivated by the downturn in industrial and economic development in the Cork area.  We have the commitment and the will to rise from the ashes and to overcome all kinds of adversities, including a Coalition <Col N="1565" /> Government.  It was their lack of conviction and commitment to the Cork area that contributed to the present situation. I do not want to go into detail about any particular closure, but we have had many of them which were not listed or did not reach the national media.  Everybody in and outside Cork has heard about Dunlops, Fords and the dockyard but when these firms closed they took hundreds of small businesses with them.</P>
    <P>What happened to the famous statement by Government Ministers globetrotting to Detroit and other places that Fords would not be allowed to walk away from Cork?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is mentioned in this Bill.  He has to approve the licence. We were pleased to have him in Cork this week to announce a few very welcome jobs &mdash; he hopes 200 over a period of two years &mdash; and then he announced the jobs for Donegal and other areas.  I think it is significant that he came to Cork to make that announcement.  Obviously he did this because he was getting a feedback from his backbenchers who were telling him what the people in Cork feel about this Government and their treatment of Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined why Cork harbour should be the first designated free port area.  This occasion should not pass without mentioning Verolme dockyard. We should not shy away from this because the Coalition Government, having a 48 per cent stake in the company, allowed it to close and put all the workers on the dole queues.  Talking about a possible free port area in Cork gives us an excellent opportunity to refer to Verolme dockyard.  We are still awaiting the Government to encourage or generate some activity in the Verolme dockyard.  The Minister will have an input here as he will issue licences to people. What about his commitment to me and <Col N="1567" /> others from Cork about Verolme dockyard? It is ridiculous that a harbour as developed as Cork should be allowed by the Government to grind to a halt, like the dockyard.  What is more necessary in a maritime nation than to have a shipbuilding and ship repairing service?  Since Verolme closed the Government have done nothing to re-establish an element of ship repairing and ship building to complement the setting up of the free port area.</P>
      <P>My contribution has annoyed Government Deputies because I have outlined the facts which cannot be distorted despite all the propaganda.  In eight years out of 12 of Coalition Government there has been a depressed economy nationwide, and a loss of hope in Cork.  This is attributable to the lack of leadership in the Government, the lack of commitment by Ministers and the dithering about decisions which should have been taken to stem the rate of unemployment.  This Government stand indicted on their lack of performance in the crucial area of employment.  I hope that the setting up of the free port area in Cork, although the legislation is not strong enough, will encourage the people of Cork.  A free port area is badly needed in Cork in order to boost the morale of the people.</P>
      <P>Because of the introduction of this legislation Members from other constituencies will rise to support their areas and that is the freedom of democracy.  I have no doubt they will make good strong cases.  The case put forward for Cork in the request through the task force to Government for the setting up of a free port area in Cork is very strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many incentives are needed to ensure the success of this project.  The Minister referred to the non-payment of customs duties including VAT on goods entering the free port.  These incentives are necessary for the success of the port. Trading with the free port is to be exempt from VAT, including goods consumed in the port.  There should be permission to bring into the free port goods for duty free retail sales either for shipment as <Col N="1568" /> ship or aircraft stores or to persons leaving the State.  Where and when it applies duty should be assessed at the rate applicable either to the raw material entering the free port or the finished product at the time of leaving, whichever is the lower.  That is a reasonable incentive that could be included.  These sorts of incentives will be essential to the success of the operation.  Therefore, the small print in this Bill will be very important.  All operations within the free port area should be deemed exempted trading operations for the purpose of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958 or at the least, the maximum 10 per cent corporate tax rate should be extended to cover both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities in the free port.  The purchase of plant and machinery for use in connection with the free port should be exempted from all duties and tax.  This would give some teeth to the setting up of the free port area.  I hope the regulations will contain some of these incentives and that there will be flexibility in their application. We should give the free port area an Authority with the necessary machinery to be a successful operation.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to include sub-zones within the harbour area of the free port akin to those in the Gaeltacht and breac-Ghaeltacht.  The free port area would have neighbouring zones.  The area as announced today is on the limited side and this incentive could be used to create more activity in the harbour area.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, similar to other areas and at the discretion of the local authority, rates should be reduced in the first ten years after the construction of the free port.  That incentive should be examined carefully.  It was the subject of a recent court decision and we will not go into that now.  There will be another Bill on that before the House.  Other statutory authorities providing a service to the free port should be permitted, at their discretion to provide similar reductions in the cost of services.  That incentive would also be conducive to the success of the free ports area.</P>
    <P>Goods entering the free port from the remaining section of the port of Cork and <Col N="1569" /> also from the airports at Cork, Shannon and Dublin and inland clearance depots and foreign parcel post should be allowed to do so without delay by means of a simplified customs document.  We are all aware of the famous, infamous or otherwise, customs document that is giving so much bother even nowadays.  I hope small print will be included to clear the coast &mdash; or the harbour &mdash; of that sort of hold-up.</P>
    <P>The regulations should specify the circumstances in which goods within the free port are to be treated for the purpose of the Act and regulations as not being free port goods.  They should also specify the circumstances in which goods which are not within the free port are to be treated for those purposes as being within the free port area.  I know that we are not talking about regulations today.  We are talking about the Bill, but the regulations will follow on the Bill and I am availing of the opportunity of this Second Stage debate to include some incentives that I consider worthy of inclusion in the regulations when they are introduced.  The regulations when so introduced should be flexible enough to accommodate new and existing businesses wishing to set up within the free port area.  Barbed wire fences of red tape and bureaucratic legislation will be a discouragement rather than an encouragement to the satisfactory setting up and development of projects such as this free port area.</P>
    <P>In order that other speakers have the opportunity to contribute to this debate I will conclude more or less as I began by saying that I welcome the Bill at this stage, belated as it is.  I hope it will receive a free passage through the House and más maith is mithid, it should go through quickly and, given the necessary teeth for effectiveness its passage and support by the Government and the regulations that follow will help in some way to raise hopes, to turn the tide, to see at long last the oft mentioned light at the end of the tunnel about which we have heard from the Taoiseach and so forth.  This free port will become an effective reality for the betterment of the economic and industrial life of the Cork area in the first <Col N="1570" /> instance, then the whole south west area and, as a spin-off, the entire country.</P>

While the Bill does not, therefore, deal with any specific location, its primary purpose is to permit of the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  There are no plans to establish any other free ports for the moment.</P>
      <P>When the Minister decided to introduce this Bill he introduced it at an opportune moment when the economic conditions in this country had changed. As a result of Government policy there has been a dramatic decrease in inflation and a further incentive to industrialists to invest in areas of attraction.  Deputy Lyons made the point that the reason that Cork is such an attractive area is that there is high unemployment there.  He said that they need the work.  I agree with Deputy Lyons that areas of high unemployment should get help such as the assistance of a free ports Bill</P>
      <P>Deputy Lyons is more familiar than I am with the area and the location at Ringaskiddy, but he was very critical of Government performance.  He made political claims about the failures of various Governments.  He said that the Government have failed in the case of Fords, Dunlop and Verolme but, if what I hear from stalwart Cork Deputies is true, not all would agree with the performance of Deputy Lyons here this morning.  He cringed and whinged on behalf of Cork. The people who represent Cork are strong and well able to put their point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made a good speech about the Free Ports Bill here this morning. He analysed details of the Bill and made a case for and against.  He was pragmatic in dealing with it, but Deputy Lyons came in in a whirlwind of whingeing. He is the archdeacon of whingeing. I do not know that a blaze of this nature <Col N="1571" /> in this House will do any good for Cork or for the country, especially concerning a Bill to promote industrial development. All Deputy Lyons could do was whinge and cringe and he made not one valid point in all his argument.</P>
    <P>The free port idea has emerged mainly out of the success of Shannon which Deputy Wilson outlined.  He said that the free port in Shannon was established by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Seán Lemass, and he quoted from a speech of 1947 when the Shannon free port was set up.  However, the real benefits in Shannon did not begin to emerge until 1960, some 13 years later, when the Bill to set up SFADCo was brought in here.  That company utilised the power given in a Bill introduced by a Coalition Government to encourage industrial development introduced by former Minister, Deputy Norton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite wisely Deputy Lemass utilised all the benefits to encourage industry to set up here and I commend him for that.  I commend all the Ministers whose ideas were put to work to make Shannon the success it is.  At present 8,000 people are directly employed there and a further 20,000 indirectly.  All Governments have contributed to that success.  One would swear, listening to Deputy Lyons, that everything in the country is negative when we are in Government and that when Fianna Fáil are returned to power everything will be right, that they are the miracle workers.  Deputy Lyons seems to have a special wand to enable him to resolve the deeper problems in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest cheer heard in Cork, although Deputy Lyons will not admit it, was when the former managing director of Fords, Paddy Hayes, announced to the workers involved that he was closing the place and making them all redundant. The cheer that greeted that announcement was louder than any cheer at an All-Ireland.  That is a sad relection on the <Col N="1572" /> attitude of the people, but Deputy Lyons is fomenting the idea that there is some great benefit in getting major redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>The poor people in Cork realise now that the acceptance of large sums of redundancy money is not the be all and end all of everything.  I hope that, when the free port is established at Ringaskiddy, there will be a more responsible attitude to work practices.  The responsibility between management and worker is equal and that should be debated in Cork for some time.  Dunlop and Verolme went, but if those companies were competitive and if the work practices were not such that they impeded cost-effective ventures, they would have been better.  I do not see why the Bill should apply to Ringaskiddy if Deputy Lyons wants a continuation of the progress he is so proud of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson examined all free ports in the world.  It is interesting to read an article in <i>The Times</i> of 25 January 1984 written by Jock Bruce-Gardyne.  In the course of it he stated that a commission had examined three ports, Rotterdam, Hamburg and Shannon and said:</P>
    <P>Shannon was the real McCoy, but unfortunately its <i>raison d'être</i> had largely disappeared with Eire's entry into the EEC.  Originally set up to rescue Shannon airport when the transatlantic airlines no longer had to stop there to refuel, it had become an industrial estate with special fiscal privileges; while Shannon airport was saved &mdash; just about &mdash; by vigorous promotion among the Irish American community of visits to the leprechauns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a cheap snide comment.  However, I should like to pay tribute to those involved in SFADCo and the Aer Rianta staff who have promoted the airport successfully.  I am glad the Government have decided to invest a further £1 million in a new fuel facility for the airport which will enable airlines to buy spot fuel thus helping the airport to <Col N="1573" /> become more competitive internationally than it has been before.  I am glad the Government are proceeding with this because it is of interest to the people of the area.  The Coalition are doing something for Shannon.  Deputies, particularly those from the Cork area who might be taken in by the glory seeking of Deputy Lyons, should be more pragmatic instead of whingeing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne in his article continued:</P>
      <P>We finally concluded that Customs was right to argue that freeports in Britain would have no tangible advantages, but that nevertheless we ought to have a bash.  Subject to one proviso: that any sites selected for experiment must stand or fall on straight commercial criteria &mdash; no subsidies or special privileges.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the Cork area has special privileges in that special IDA grants have already been given to it.  He told us that those grants will apply to the free port area as well as to the other two estates, Togher and Hollyhill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions governing the admission and control of the type of business envisaged for free ports such as licences, customs procedures and other regulations are closely modelled on what has applied at the Shannon Customs Free Zone for more than 25 years.  The systems and procedures in use there have worked out very well in practice in that the movement of goods and business in general operate smoothly.  At the same time the powers of the relevant Ministers, customs officials and the administrating body at Shannon, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, are sufficient to correct any irregularities or abuses. Things have worked out well, not because of the type and extent of regulatory controls, but because of the manner in which <Col N="1574" /> they have been implemented at all times in a most helpful non-compromising way, particularly by the customs officials.  An example of this is the fact that goods arriving at Shannon are cleared very quickly by customs officials and released to the businesses operating there with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to strengthen the hand of the regulatory bodies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Communications and so on, and gives them fairly extensive powers.  In that respect the Bill is more detailed and specific than the legislation governing Shannon.  I am glad that the Minister has specifically excluded Shannon.  The reason legislation governing Shannon should be different is that the area caters specifically for aviation related activities.</P>
    <P>I note also that the primary responsibility for the vetting of projects and the issuing of licences rests with the Minister for Communications in this instance rather than with the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism as in the case of the Shannon free zone.  There are consultative arrangements in both instances between the Departments but, considering the objectives of the exercise, to bring economic activity by promoting employment-creating projects, surely the Shannon licensing arrangement is preferable.  That is a minor defect in the arrangements.  There is an element of duplication between Departments which may give rise to a risk of inconsistency in treatment.  I should like to ask the Minister to examine that aspect.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his work in connection with the preparation of the Bill which was introduced speedily.  Contrary to the impression Deputy Lyons is trying to convey, I would like to see genuine growth in industry in Cork and an upsurge in employment, but that means all heads getting together and using them properly to see that efforts like free ports succeed.  There should not be any hold back by the Revenue Commissioners, or any other agencies, in coming forward with schemes which will <Col N="1575" /> control estates such as that proposed for Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill which has been awaited in Cork for the last couple of years.  We are all aware that unemployment struck Cork very severely over the past three years, especially with the closure of such firms as Fords, Dunlops, Youghal Carpets and Verolme Dockyard.  These companies employed an average 1,000 people each and when they went to the wall that affected the inter-related service industries, small fabrication industries, and so on. This resulted in tremendous human tragedy in the Cork area which is being felt even more now, due to redundancies and unemployment benefits having been reduced over the time.</P>
      <P>What happened to Cork was an example of how a community can work together.  A task force representing the Harbour Commissioners, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and the IDA came up with the very good idea of a free port.  We can see what has happened throughout the world, with tax havens which benefit companies that are in there to make money for themselves, and the proper aim of any business is to make a profit.  We must encourage people from outside, or our own people, to set up businesses which will be profitable and create sustainable employment.  I have no hang-up about whether they are home produced or foreign based and with foreign ideas.  We must give the foreign based companies support to ensure that they will stay on a long term basis.  I am afraid that in the past we have attracted some businesses which were not sustainable long-term industries.  In Shannon we have an example of a free port area which has had tremendous success and it is important that we examine what has happened there.  It is regarded by all as a most successful venture which should be extended to other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force reported to the Government in April, 1984 &mdash; a year and a half <Col N="1576" /> ago &mdash; and now we have a Bill before us to set up a free port area.  There are regulations to be set out and various Government Departments are involved, such as the Department of Finance.  We have not heard much on that subject, but I presume the Minister will tell us what is happening there &mdash; whether the Departments are progressing in the preparation of the regulations and the legislation necessary to bring the free port into action.  The Government were remiss in allowing a delay of a year and a half before bringing forward this Bill and I question the reason for that.  I believe that they knew what they should do and I accuse them of holding the Bill in abeyance until the time was right for their own political ends.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally enables the Minister to establish limits on the free port.  His speech mentioned an area of 1,000 acres for Ringaskiddy under the aegis of the IDA and the Harbour Commissioners have proposed the designation of a 30 acre site for a free port.  Ringaskiddy is ideal for the setting up of the free port in Cork.  A tremendous investment has been put into the IDA scheme there over the past number of years and Cork County Council have spent £47 million. Many thousands of people living in the large county of Cork might feel that such money should have been spent on the roads of the county, which are deteriorating to an extraordinary extent.  That £47 million has been spent on bringing Ringaskiddy up to the standards necessary for the anticipated traffic into and out of the area.</P>
    <P>There have been many rumours circulating around Cork about industries willing and ready, straining at the leash, to move into the free port area.  So many have been mentioned &mdash; not by members of my party but of the two parties in Government &mdash; that a 30 acre site would not be sufficient.  I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of these rumours and will increase the size of the site, if necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 3 enables the Minister, by order, to designate people to control and manage the free port.  I am sure he will <Col N="1577" /> not allow his political persuasion to overrule his better commercial judgment in picking the proper persons to control the free port.  The people controlling this area should be commercially minded, good business people who have a good track record and will ensure that in the final analysis the decisions to be taken will be based on what is best for the commercial viability and the future of the port and for the betterment of the people of the area.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for financial inducements.  In it we see where the cash flow of businesses is helped and that is a good provision.  In times of tight credit and tough business conditions, cash flow is of vital importance.  Any provision is good which allows businesses a good cash flow to get in materials for the manufacture and production of goods and to pay for them when these goods are sold.  The Minister for Finance should take note of this when bringing in his next budget because we have VAT at point of entry hindering many industries trying to survive in today's tough economic climate. Removal of VAT at the point of entry should be extended to other goods.  I should like to ask the Minister if import duties are chargeable on diversions of goods which have been created in the free port area to non-Community countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that in regard to the day-to-day management and control of the Ringaskiddy free port he was still considering a number of options.  All decisions should be made by now.  The Minister has had sufficient time to come to a decision.  He also said that he had an open mind in regard to considering proposals from the private sector to operate and manage the free port. There have been some problems in regard to free ports in the UK and they have not developed as fast as had been expected.  When the Minister publishes the regulations it is important that the progress of the port is not impeded by red tape.  He mentioned the rigidity in relation to ports in the UK but he said that vigorous marketing by the operator would attract firms to the free port here over the next few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> Marketing is a vital aspect in the growth of our economy and not just in relation to free ports.  If our marketing in every area is not improved we will not be successful.  For instance, our agricutural produce is not marketed to the extent that it should.  Yesterday, BIM had a fish evening and it is the first time, to my knowledge, that there was an attempt by them to market fish.  Every morning at 7.40 on the radio, which is too early for such an important industry to advertise their wares, they give recipes.</P>
    <P>If the free port simply diverts economic activity, the concept will have failed.  If possible, the whole country should be a free port area.  I know there are problems in that regard but we are too small to be subject to the same constraints as industrialised countries like Britain and Germany. Of course we are constrained by the EC but something on a larger scale is called for rather than the provisions in the Bill.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes but I look forward to seeing more detailed regulations which, I hope, will make this a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enabling Bill and while some of us hoped that everything would be contained in one Bill we can still welcome this legislation in the sense that it gives very wide powers. Fears that the legislation might be drawn too tightly are not evident in the enabling legislation and that is welcome.  The Minister stated unequivocally that the primary purpose of this legislation is to permit the establishment of a free port at Ringaskiddy.  A Cork Deputy does not need to ask why Ringaskiddy was chosen. Nevertheless, the concept of a free port in Ringaskiddy needs to be seen in its proper context, nationally rather then parochially.  The facilities in Ringaskiddy do not exist anywhere else in the country and for that reason they do not belong to any area or region, they belong to the country as a major national asset.  Ringaskiddy has been the subject of enormous investment from the inception of the Cork harbour development plan during the reign of previous Coalition Government and it was carried on by subsequent <Col N="1579" /> Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments. Despite statements by Deputy Lyons there has never been any lack of commitment from either side of the House to the development of existing potential which, unfortunately, because of international economic circumstances, has not been fully realised.  This is part of an ongoing development programme of this huge port related industrial complex at Ringaskiddy.</P>
      <P>The land bank in the possession of the State through the IDA amounts to about 1,000 acres and there are options for further land acquisition there also.  The largest quantity of processed water provided anywhere in the country and comparable to that provided in many larger countries is also laid on.  Effluent disposal facilities exist and a deep water berth which will be capable of accommodating 60,000 tonnes deadweight bulk carriers is in course of construction.  It is necessary therefore that we would complement the facilities which exist there by a free port. That should not be seen as some sort of a sop to Cork as opposed to other areas. Ringaskiddy is a natural location for the first free port in Ireland and the benefit will be the stimulus it will give to employment in the Cork region, which so badly needs it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the fairly wide powers in the Bill.  Section 2 gives him power to establish or vary the limits of the free port.  Initially, the recommended area is 30 acres.  I hope the success of this free port will prove that this area is inadequate.  I understand that 30 acres is about what the Cork Harbour Commissioners and others interested recommended, and of course the acid test in three or four years will be a request to increase those limits.  The Bill provides for that.  Section 3 enables the Minister to designate persons to manage and control the free port.  There is provision to grant licences for the carrying on of business in the free port.  The Minister is given discretion in section 10, and section 12 introduces the Minister for Finance who will make regulations in regard to customs controls, etc.  The Bill seems to give <Col N="1580" /> all the powers needed to make this thing work.</P>
    <P>What are the benefits of a free port?  It needs to be said that though a free port has become a kind of slogan in Cork and elsewhere, it should be seen in its proper context.  It is not a panacea for all the woes of an area which is in need of rapid development.  If handled in the proper way it can be a substantial stimulus to development in the area.  The Minister referred to the advantages when he referred to customs duties and VAT.  It is not always appreciated that customs duties do not exist within the EC as customs duties, and therefore the benefits of being able to defer or avoid customs in some way applies only to non-European Community goods.  That is a qualification which limits the value of being able to defer or avoid customs duties.  Some companies would see benefits in this depending on the sources of the goods they import.</P>
    <P>On VAT the reliefs are more general and broader.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>A business operating within a free port would be able to import, without payment of VAT, materials, machinery, etc., for use in the free port in connection with processing or manufacturing there.  Secondly, VAT would be charged at the zero rate on goods supplied within the free port itself. Thirdly, goods entering the rest of the State from the free port would come under the internal VAT system if the subject of a sale, which would normally be the case, and would not then incur import VAT.</P>
    <P>Another advantage would be that the overall customs procedures will be simplified, particularly in regard to small companies who cannot afford the sophistication or the staff required to operate the customs duties procedures fully. Because of the enormous amount of documentation required it is very difficult for a small company to be involved with full customs procedures.  This will be simpler for them in the free port area and therefore it will be an attraction for business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The Minister said that the purpose of the concessions is to stimulate economic activity and therefore employment within the free port and not simply to divert normal trade from elsewhere in the State. That means that one business would not get advantage over another.  The purpose is to stimulate and attract to Ireland companies who would set up the kind of activities they might not otherwise set up.  The Minister referred to the extra confidence the free port will bring to the area and the stimulus it will give to industrial expansion there.</P>
    <P>We should look at experience of free port operations elsewhere in the world, and one is inevitably inclined to look at the UK if only for the reason that they operate in the same EC environment as we do.  It is noticeable that one free port area in Britain more than the others, Liverpool, happens to be attracting activity and has been a better magnet for activity than the others.  Their customs regime is less rigid than in the other ports. I think we should learn from that.  There are severe restrictions in EC legislation which limit flexibility in regard to customs and it is important that we should look at the Liverpool experience.  I suppose that is one of the advantages of coming into this later than other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill now before the House is to increase the limit on the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow from the level of £200 million set in section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, the Act which provided for the establishment of the agency.  A number of other technical amendments regarding the agency's borrowings are also proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency, since its establishment in 1981, has become a <Col N="1582" /> major force on the Irish housing scene. It has enabled thousands of people who might otherwise have been unable to do so to purchase a home of their own, and in doing so, has made a substantial contribution to the housing programme and greatly assisted the house building sector of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the setting up of the agency was a major innovation in the financing of house purchase.  The agency borrows on an index-linked basis from institutions such as life offices and pension funds and channels these resources into housing in the form of loans which are repayable on an income-related basis.  The demand for this kind of mortgage scheme may be judged from the rapid growth in the level of lending &mdash; from £55 million in 1983, its first full year of operation, to £72 million last year.</P>
    <P>This year demand has been boosted by the remarkable success of the new scheme whereby a £5,000 grant is available to persons surrendering local authority houses to the authority which provided them.  As a result increases totalling £15 million have already been made in the agency's capital allocation.  I am happy that I have recently been able to increase the allocation by a further £6 million bringing it to £86 million for the year.  This amount will ensure that funds will be available to meet the demand for loan payments as they arise.</P>
    <P>The provision of this level of funding to the Housing Finance Agency, especially when seen in conjunction with the continuing provision of substantial funds through the SDA house purchase loan scheme, is evidence of the Government's continued commitment to ensuring an adequate supply of mortgage finance from public sources to lower-income borrowers. The Government recognise the long-standing preference of our people for owning their homes if at all possible. In making available this supply of mortgage finance, together with the other incentives such as the £5,000 grant to which I have referred, the £2,000 new house grant and the £3,000 mortgage subsidy, the Government are giving substantial encouragement to would-be house <Col N="1583" /> purchasers to help them attain their goal of home-ownership.  A high proportion of people now availing of the Housing Finance Agency loans are either vacating local authority housing or would, in the absence of the scheme, be forced to rely on such housing to meet their needs.  The agency's loans, together with the other incentives, thus have the effect of reducing the pressure on local authority waiting lists and helping to make local authority accommodation more readily available to those who are not in a position to purchase their own houses.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that over much of the period since the agency was established conditions in the financial market have not been very favourable to the sale of index-linked stock, the agency has succeeded in raising substantial funding in each year of its operation.  Until April this year, each issue of stock had required the agency to pay a higher yield to the investor than the previous one.  However, a recent placement of stock at a yield of 4 per cent marked the first decline in the cost of long-term funds since the establishment of the agency.  It is to be hoped that the downward trend in interest rates will enable future stock issues to be made at lower cost.  Fortunately, the success of the Government's strategy in reducing inflation to low single figures has meant that, while the margin above inflation payable on the agency's stock issues has grown significantly over the last few years, the overall rate of interest charged to the agency's borrowers has been kept to a very reasonable level &mdash; 10.2 per cent being the rate most recently applied.</P>
    <P>The agency has had to supplement its funding from index-linked stock with short-term facilities negotiated through the banking system.  Short term borrowings are normally more expensive than borrowings raised by the agency's stock issues and, therefore, have an adverse effect on the agency's capacity to avoid losses on its operations.  It is, therefore, disappointing that the agency has had to resort to short-term funding to quite a significant degree.  I should emphasise in this regard that recourse to short-term <Col N="1584" /> funding does not reflect an inadequacy in the agency's capital allocation under the Public Capital Programme but is related to the market situation in respect of long-term index-linked stock.</P>
    <P>The level of demand for the agency's loans, to which I have already referred, and the consequent need to increase the capital allocation to the agency for 1985, have been such as to render inadequate the borrowing limit of £200 million.  Section 2 of the Bill proposes that the new limit should be set at £500 million.  The actual amount of borrowings will, of course, be controlled on an annual basis in accordance with the normal procedures in determining the appropriate Public Capital Programme allocation for the agency.  The increase proposed in the limit to £500 million has been pitched at a level that will allow reasonable scope to the agency in the continuing funding of its activities, while ensuring that the Oireachtas will have the opportunity of further reviewing the position in roughly three years time.  Given the ongoing nature of the agency's scheme, I trust that this proposal will recommend itself to the House as being a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>The present limit of £200 million is laid down in section 10 of the 1981 Act and the power of the Minister for Finance to guarantee such borrowings is dealt with in section 11.  These sections were amended by section 2 of the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Act, 1982, which relates the limit, and I quote, to the &ldquo;money actually borrowed by the agency&rdquo;.  Therefore, it had been considered that the statutory ceiling applied to the amount of funds actually accruing to the agency on the foot of stock issues. However, recent legal advice has been that the ceiling relates to the nominal amounts of stock without regard to any discounts at which it might have been issued.  It had been intended to include the provision increasing the borrowing limit and the ancillary provisions contained in this Bill in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, which was circulated recently.  But in view of the legal advice and the fact that the latter Bill, as a comprehensive Housing Bill, <Col N="1585" /> will require detailed discussion in both Houses, it has been necessary to bring the present Bill forward for early consideration.</P>
    <P>The other proposals in section 2 are to permit the agency to raise funds by means of promissory notes or bills of exchange and to change the basis for calculating the amount of foreign borrowings for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the overall borrowing limit.  The first of these amendments is simply to ensure that the option of utilising promissory notes or bills of exchange in the course of its funding activities is open to the agency should it deem it appropriate.</P>
    <P>The second simply changes the rule about the exchange rate which is to be applied in calculating the amount of any foreign borrowings.  Instead of using the exchange rate prevailing at any given time the calculation is made, as at present, the appropriate exchange rate will in future be that which prevails at the time of borrowing.  This will ensure that the borrowing limit is not exceeded simply because of an appreciation in the value of a foreign currency in which money might be borrowed.  Incidentally I should say that the agency has not so far raised any funds through the medium of foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes changes in relation to the powers of the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings which are consequential on the amendments to section 10 to which I have referred &mdash; basically, by the inclusion of reference to promissory notes and bills of exchange in view of the introduction of these in the preceding section.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the measures proposed are of a technical nature and are required to permit the Housing Finance Agency to continue its valuable contribution to the housing programme.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As the Minister has stated, its purpose is to increase the upper borrowing limit of the agency from £200 million to £500 million. This does not mean that an additional £300 million is now available for housing <Col N="1586" /> construction.  The position is far different. As the number of loans paid out each year multiplies, there will be a need for further revision of this limit in future years and I believe the present limit of £200 million may already have been exceeded.  I understand that up to October 1985, 11,000 loans have been paid involving payments of £217 million since the Housing Finance Agency paid out their first loan in August 1982.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether there is a retrospective aspect to this Bill and whether the Minister and the agency have already exceeded the authority given to the House in allowing them to borrow to a limit of £200 million.</P>
      <P>The growth in the number of loans paid out by the Housing Finance Agency does not mean that there has been a growth in the number of houses built to meet the needs of our young population.  The opposite is the case and the past few years have seen a dramatic fall in the number of new private homes being constructed. A number of significant changes have taken place.  Principal among them is the dramatic drop in the number of SDA loans which have been approved.  I will give some figures to indicate the extent of the drop.  In 1980, 10,381 SDA loans were approved and in 1984 only 4,959 SDA loans were approved, a drop of over 50 per cent or 5,422.  By any reckoning this is a massive drop.  The addition of the 1984 Housing Finance Agency loan approvals of 3,616 to the SDA approvals gives a total of 8,575, which shows an overall drop of 1,806 on the 1980 level of approvals for local authority loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the real figure which the Minister skirted around.  In highlighting the increase in HFA loans there is the danger that the uninitiated may come to the conclusion that despite what has been said elsewhere things are rosy in the house construction garden.  This is not the situation. One has to look at all the factors, not just one in isolation.  The HFA is a new body, only in its third year, and the growth is welcome but it is important to recognise that it is at the expense of the old SDA loan system which had proved <Col N="1587" /> reliable and helpful to tens of thousands of people building homes in the past.</P>
    <P>Probably of more significance is the switch in loan approvals from mostly new houses under the SDA system in 1980 to mostly secondhand houses under the HFA system in 1984.  In each year since the commencement of operation the HFA have approved more loans for secondhand than for new houses.  Since their establishment, 5,000 secondhand house loans were approved by the HFA, as against 4,233 loans for new houses.  This contradicts the Minister's argument that something is being done here to help the construction industry.  That is not the position.  Most of that money has gone into houses which were mainly changing hands and not into new houses.  Information supplied by all lending sources, the building societies, the banks, the HFA and the local authorities, shows that the proportion of mortgages approved for the purchase of secondhand houses went from under 50 per cent in 1976-80 to 58 per cent in 1983.  A total of 15,833 new house loans were approved in 1979 from all sources.  The number approved in 1984 was 12,385.  During that period there was a drop of 3,448 in the number of new house loans approved.  On the other hand, the number of secondhand house purchase loans approved in 1979 was 14,218 and the number approved in 1984 was 16,467.  While there was a drop of over 3,500 in the number of new house loans approved there was an increase in the same period of 2,249 in the number of secondhand house loans approved.  The number of new house loans paid by the HFA last year was 1,760 and the number of secondhand house loans was 1,867. The figures show that much of the money in recent years has been going to the purchase of secondhand houses.</P>
    <P>The drop in the number of new house loans is reflected in the fall off in the number of new private house completions, which have come down from 23,236 in 1981 to 17,942 in 1984, a drop of 5,294.  We are informed from a reliable source that a further drop is likely in 1985.  The Department's estimate is a <Col N="1588" /> drop of 1,000 in the number of new house completions in 1985 and the construction industry have put a figure of 1,500 on the extent of the drop this year.  The sad saga of the falling-off in the number of new homes constructed has continued in 1985, despite all the statements which have emanated from the Government and despite the attempts to paint a rosy image.  Mass unemployment has occurred in the construction industry because of the rapid fall in housing output.  The Government's decision to cut back on capital investment and introduce punitive tax measures, such as VAT at 10 per cent and the abolition of the section 23 tax incentives, together with many other measures, remain as monuments to the Government's incompetence in the area of housing policy.</P>
    <P>This was highlighted further by their sudden reversal of policy last week for inner city development and home improvement grants.  Welcome as this death bed conversion may be, it smacks of a panic measure taken suddenly without adequate arrangements having been made in advance to ensure effective operation. No firm costings are available as to the overall cost of some of the measures.  I believe the Government's figures grossly underestimate the eventual cost.  No details have been given of where the funds will come from to finance these changes.  No proper administrative arrangements had been made before the grants were announced.  It was extraordinary to see the documents circulated by the Minister stating that arrangements would now be made to have discussions with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that those benefiting from the new grants will use only registered contractors.</P>
    <P>Matters of that kind should have been worked out before an announcement was made.  Announcing the implementation of the grants scheme four weeks ahead created panic in certain sections of the construction industry where they were faced with imminent shut-down.  People withdrew their current applications and were proposing to wait for the improved applications that would not come <Col N="1589" /> onstream until after an inspection had been carried out by an officer of the Department.  We know from experience that this can take as long as three months. If the grants were not to operate until 1 December and the inspectors had to carry out inspections in all cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the change of heart, but it is evidence of a hodgepodge policy on the part of the Government. A study of the housing situation leads one to the conclusion that some strange things are happening.  The only reasonable conclusion is that emigration must have reached epidemic proportions resulting in the cream of the population, young educated parents, having to leave the country to find work and to rear their families abroad.  Inevitably they will buy their homes abroad.  There has been evidence of a fairly strong demand for home loans from the various lending agencies, including the Housing Finance Agency, and yet there is clear evidence in the Department's statistics of a dramatic drop in the number of houses being built. Money in the housing market must be <Col N="1590" /> leaking in some direction and the only conclusion one can come to is that there is massive emigration.  People are selling their homes and they are not using the money to reinvest in housing in this country. Rather, they are emigrating and taking the funds out of the country.  They may clear off their debts before they leave but certainly they are not re-investing in housing.</P>
      <P>This is a new phenomenon but it is not something the Minister has spoken about in seminars or conferences or in his contributions here.  It is important that we should have some independent State agency to look at the situation and give an objective opinion on what is happening. An Foras Forbartha play an important role in presenting objective data in regard to housing developments.  To support my contention that there is major emigration, that it is affecting housing and that it will have an effect on the demand for housing finance loans, I shall quote from a document from An Foras Forbartha.  It comes from the housing construction division of that body.  It states:</P>
      <P>Looking back now, the seventies present a remarkable picture and when we compare that period with developments so far in the eighties it is relatively easy to understand why there are problems in the housing market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document gives a graph showing disposable income in the period 1970-1979 and also in the period 1980-1984.  It shows it was up 50 per cent in the first period and down 5 per cent in the second period.  Employment was up by 100,000 in the first period and it has decreased by 45,000 in the period 1980-1984.  In the period 1970-1979 the number of people who returned to this country was 120,000, whereas in the period 1980-1984 we have had emigration and the figure given is 25,000.  Interest rates in the first period went from nil to -8 per cent and in the second period from -4 per cent to +4 per cent in real terms.  The population increased by 1.5 per cent per annum in the period 1970-1979 while the increase <Col N="1591" /> was less than 1 per cent in the 1980-1984 period.  The document stated:</P>
    <P>The factors listed in the table in one way or another affect the housing market.  There are others but it is unnecessary to get into too much detail.  The overall picture is clear. Almost all of the influences which generated the housing boom in the seventies have been dormant or strongly adverse in the first half of this decade.</P>
    <P>The income and employment/ unemployment changes have played a large part in weakening housing demand but some of the other changes are of special significance and I believe that the role of emigration may be one of those.  To consider this it must be emphasised that the total housing market is made up of new and secondhand homes, not just new homes alone. New building is not an independent activity, it is a process of adjustment between the existing stock and housing demand and the new housing sector is very strongly influenced by what happens in the secondhand sector.</P>
    <P>In addition there are problems both on the demand and supply sides of the market which explain why some of the present difficulties are so acute.</P>
    <P>Declining real incomes and emigration not only depress housing demand but may also increase supply. If income difficulties are severe a household may have to trade down or move into the rental sector to secure their financial situation.  If households are emigrating, they put a house on the market but do not repurchase.  In both cases, part or all of the proceeds of sale will not return to the housing market.</P>
    <P>The document sets out another table which illustrates the profound change which occurred in 1983, the year when emigration really took off.  The table runs from 1977 to 1983 and it shows the total mortgage finance paid on all houses as a percentage of the value of new private house completions.  For the years from 1977 to 1982 the relevant figure was 60 per cent, but in 1983 it jumped to 81 per <Col N="1592" /> cent.  The total mortgage finance paid on all houses for that year was £563 million while the value of new private completions was £698 million.  The construction division conclude as follows:</P>
    <P>The stability in the relationship between the total volume of mortgage finance paid out (for old and new houses) and the value of new housing output, for the period of the seventies shown here, is notable, as is the change in 1983.  It is unlikely to be coincidental that 1983 saw such a large increase in emigration.  This suggests that there is now a leakage of finance from the market as a whole and may partly explain the paradox referred to earlier of a buoyant mortgage sector and a relatively depressed housing market.</P>
    <P>Here we can see the effect of the failure of this Government's policies throughout the economy.  There has not been any real success in implementing any of the policies they have been pursuing in the past three years.  It is a sad record of failure for any Government.  I accept that there may be decent people in the Government who are seeking to do their best.  I accept that the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, makes a valuable contribution to the Government but collectively their policies are not succeeding.  The country's vital statistics are evidence of that sad fact.  Unless there are some major changes at Government level in the type of policies they have been following, we can only look forward with gloom to continuation of the present depressing environment.  The reversal we witnessed last week on the part of the Government may be an indication of an awakening within Government circles to the fact that their policies are not the right ones and that there is a need for major change.  We can only hope that there will be further changes in the direction in which the Government have been leading the country and that we will not have to wait much longer for those changes.</P>
    <P>Regarding loans in general and particularly in regard to the Housing Finance Agency, I should like the Minister to give the House some indication of the number <Col N="1593" /> of mortgage holders who are in default in terms of their repayments.  I am aware, from experience in my constituency and from what I hear from other parts of the country, that a very large number of people are in serious default in respect of their repayments to building societies and local authorities.  I am wondering what the position is in this respect in regard to the Housing Finance Agency.  Sadly it is a consequence of the failure of the economy that people are being thrown out of work and that consequently their income position changes dramatically with the result that they are unable to meet the commitments they have entered into with the lending agencies.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Housing Finance Agency have the advantage in that the minimum repayment requirement is 20 per cent of one's income.  That provides some hope for those who may be finding themselves in difficulty but, if their income and, consequently, their repayments fall, we must bear in mind that the debt is not eliminated, that it is being postponed and that there will be a big build up in the amount of capital and interest to be repaid in later years.  People who can afford to do so would be well advised not to agree to make repayments to the Housing Finance Agency at the lower level of 20 per cent of their income. In their own interest, they should endeavour so far as possible to pay something of the order of the going commercial rate. Otherwise the amount of payment being postponed will build up against them whereas if they pay more than the 20 per cent they will be eligible for a deduction from the capital amount thereby reducing the overall liability in the long term.</P>
    <P>We pointed to this difficulty when the agency were being established and we said it would present problems in later years for people who are not able to pay much more than the 18 per cent which was the minimum requirement at the outset.  Incidentally, I should be interested to learn what influenced the Minister to change the minimum level from 18 to 20 per cent of income.  There must <Col N="1594" /> have been some good reason for that change, some opinion formed in the Department as to the need for the change which, though it may seem small, was an upwards move from the original level.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know what the position is in respect of defaulters with the Housing Finance Agency, though one doubts that it could be as bad as is the case of the many thousands of building society mortgage holders who are seriously in arrears.  Evictions are taking place.  Only last week I witnessed one of these events in my constituency and this is an on-going trend.  Each Monday morning the District Court in Galway City is faced with a batch of summonses demanding surrender of homes for nonpayment of mortgages.  This is a feature elsewhere in the country also.  Unless there is some improvement in the economy and an improvement also in employment prospects thereby improving income levels and consumer spending ability, we will be faced with a major crisis.</P>
    <P>The decline is eating into the progress that has been made during the decades since we achieved our freedom.  After the last war we began to encourage industrial development and, with the change in population trends in the sixties and seventies, we made progress that we hoped would be permanent but, unfortunately, many of the gains achieved are being eroded and frittered away.  Many factories have closed and we dread the thought that we might return to the situation that prevailed in the inter-party Government days of the fifties when the keys were left in the doors of homes in Dublin and elsewhere while the occupants fled to England and other places because there was no opportunity for them here.  They were not able to meet their commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In those cases in which people are in arrears either with the Housing Finance Agency or in respect of SDA loans and where houses may have to be taken back, would it be possible for local authorities to be authorised to purchase these houses and rent them to the occupants instead of the occupant having to surrender the house and seek to be placed on the local authority housing list?  I appreciate that in <i>Building on Reality</i> and in circulars from the Minister, local authorities are being encouraged to purchase privately constructed homes on the open market.  That would seem to leave the way open for local authorities to buy these houses in respect of which the occupiers are no longer able to meet their loan commitments.  The question of whether such a policy might be implemented has been raised with me on a number of occasions by people who find themselves in this sort of difficulty.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the matter and whether he would encourage local authorities to go to the aid of people who are losing their homes in that way.  Rather than have an occupier leave his house, take out all his furniture and so on, the State might assume the ownership or part equity of the house.  There are many options in this regard which should provide a fruitful field and which the Minister might investigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference in the Minister's speech to the construction industry and I am sure the Chair will not object if I digress slightly to express my alarm at the continuing decline in the growth output and activity in the construction industry. From the noises the Chair is making, I realise that he does not wish me to pursue that road, so I can only hope there will be another occasion to record again the matter of this continuing decline and to <Col N="1596" /> draw the attention of the Government to the problem because there is a need for a more positive change in policy.  As I have said, there were signs of a change last week but the Government must be encouraged to go further.</P>
    <P>Sales of cement in 1985 are likely to be down 6 to 7 per cent on 1984.  Indeed, the figure for August is down 15 per cent on August 1984.  That is a massive decrease.  I appreciate that there were weather problems involved, but that factor alone cannot explain the decrease. The number of jobs in the private sector construction industry have fallen by 44 per cent since 1980.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reference in the Minister's speech to this industry. Unemployment in the construction industry is at an all time high.  The numbers unemployed in the industry have increased by 110 per cent since August 1980.  That is the figure for the period from August 1980 to August 1985.  That is a terrible indictment of the failure of the Government's policies.</P>
      <P>Housing, we are told, will be assisted in some way by the money being made available to the Housing Finance Agency.  That type of statement has been made before by the Minister but the completion rate does not bear this out and there is a continuing substantial drop in the number of new homes being built.  I have already put those statistics on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very distant from the target which the Government set themselves in their Programme for Government, announced when they came into office. They said their target was to achieve 30,000 new house completions per annum.  In December 1982 in a parliamentary question I asked the Minister if his target would be achieved in that year. His reply was that no specific time scale had been laid down but it was the Government's aim to progress towards that objective as quickly as possible.  &ldquo;As quickly as possible&rdquo; in this Government's <Col N="1597" /> language seems to be walking backwards, because instead of achieving anything like 30,000 new house completions the number of completions has dropped dramatically each year since they came into office.  How much of the Government's statements, programmes, policies and targets are we to accept?  Their optimistic statements that things are improving are never borne out when statistics are published later.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will not like me referring to these matters but it is my duty to do so in the interests of all those who have lost their jobs because of the failure of Government policy in this area. A great deal of the decline was caused by the Government's decisions on taxation and capital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are all inter-related and I do not see how I can make any contribution without referring to some of these matters. I will move on but first I want to ask the Minister if he will publish that report.</P>
      <P>When the Tánaiste was appointed Minister for the Environment he said that every effort would be made to ensure that these moneys were used to construct homes which would use the maximum volume of material produced in this country, and he had some derogatory things to say about the quantity of imported goods being used in building projects up to that time.  It is worth putting on the record a quotation from &ldquo;Foreign Trade in Construction Materials &mdash; 1984&rdquo; published by An Foras Forbartha:</P>
      <P>Imports of construction materials increased by £45 million or 12 per cent to £411 million in 1984 as compared with 1983.  Exports rose by £29 million or 15 per cent to reach £225 million in the same period.</P>
      <P>Almost all product areas showed an increase in the quantities imported. The share of the Irish construction market held by imports rose from 48 per cent to 56 per cent between 1983 and 1984.</P>
      <P>That was at a time when activity in the construction industry was falling.  That was a deplorable record.  They are sad statistics because they are evidence of jobs lost.  We should have a more active policy to ensure that home manufactured building materials are used in the construction of houses and other building projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that, as Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh is the person with primary responsibility for the construction industry and he will have to take whatever measures are necessary to <Col N="1599" /> reverse that trend.  He has not fulfilled the stated intention of the Tánaiste when he spoke here in 1983.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would refer to that report and tell us what action he feels might be taken even at this late stage to try to reverse that terrible trend.</P>

If so, is it available and when can we expect to see some results of the recommendations made?  Primarily I am anxious to get some information about what has happened.

      <P>During 1984 some local authorities informed applicants for Housing Finance Agency loans that because funds were limited the funds would have to be conserved for the most urgent cases. Some of these local authorities stated that single persons making applications for Housing Finance Agency loans would not qualify and they were refused.  There were a few.  I raised it in the Dáil and the Minister said he has given no such instruction to the agency and the agency had not imposed restrictions of that kind. Yet some local authorities, one in particular, introduced their own rules because they got a limited allocation from the Minister and decided that they would apply a set of rules which they had not been instructed to apply by the agency or the Minister.  In the interests of smooth and efficient operation of the agency in the future, I would like an assurance from the Minister that if local authorities are only acting on an agency basis for the Department they will not be allowed to introduce extraneous rules of their own design which would affect the applicant's standing in regard to his application.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will not again have action of that kind taken locally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the housing market that concerns me and which comes under the aegis of this Bill is local authority tenants, their opportunity to purchase their own homes, and the delay that has taken place so far.  We are now into November and the 1985 local authority house purchase scheme has not been made available to local authority tenants.  Will the Minister explain why there has been such a delay in 1985 in announcing the details of this purchase scheme?  These schemes are announced on an annual basis when there is an updating of the sales price mechanism for making the assessment of prices at which local authority houses are made available to tenants.  Until the sale scheme is made available for 1985, no tenant who applied in 1985 can buy his house.  The Government have put a stop to the purchase of local authority houses for anyone who wished to buy them from 1 January 1985.  This is a disgrace and I <Col N="1601" /> call on the Minister to remove that ban by announcing the details of the 1985 house sales scheme which facilitates the purchase of local authority houses by the tenants.</P>
    <P>Will the Housing Finance Agency approve loans for the private purchase of local authority flats from tenant purchasers? In the document <i>Building on Reality</i> it was stated that arrangements would be made to facilitate tenants of all local authority apartments and flats to purchase their flat or apartment if they wished.  Details of this arrangement have not yet been published so the arrangement has not been made.  Any person living in a maisonette, flat or apartment, or in any local authority dwelling which is not a house, does not have the opportunity to purchase it at present.  The Government made a commitment that they will be allowed to purchase.</P>
    <P>In the event of such a person being able to purchase when the scheme is in operation, in the event of his reselling the house, would the purchaser qualify for a Housing Finance Agency loan or would there be restrictions?  I have come across cases where the local authority refused a loan to an applicant because the house proposed to be purchased did not have a bathroom.  Yet the house for which the application had been made was a local authority house which had been purchased by the tenant who now wished to move elsewhere and sell it.  The person wishing to buy the house was refused a local authority loan because the house did not have a bathroom.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>With all the new increased grants for improving old houses, installing bathrooms, piped water and so on, there is nothing to stop the person who buys the house from installing a bathroom. Strange as it may seem, the house next door to the one I have in mind was bought with a building society loan.  I call on the Minister to make whatever changes are necessary to ensure that people wishing to buy such local authority houses can get a local authority loan.  If the Minister does not do that, he will eventually create a sort of ghetto.  It is not good housing <Col N="1602" /> policy, and I do not know if the Minister is aware of the consequences of that decision.  I ask him to change the rules as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister sent around a circular to local authorities announcing certain changes in the method of measuring houses for grant purposes.  In many cases, if one does not qualify for the grant, one will not qualify for some of the loans, mortgage subsidies and benefits available.  The manner in which a new house is measured for grant purposes is very important.  The Minister and the Department are being very niggling in their instructions issued recently, a matter which we hope to raise later on by way of parliamentary question if the question is reached.  It seems that the intention is to ensure that, if a garage is built onto a house, it can at no time in the future be capable of becoming part of the house.  If a garage can become part of the dwelling area of the house having regard to the number of windows in the house, or the location of the door connecting the garage to the house, and having regard to the general size and standard of finish, the garage will be included in the measurement, thereby putting the size of the house beyond the grant size and thereby denying the person the new house grant.</P>
    <P>The experience has been that people scrape the barrel and borrow money to build their own homes and many people put a lot of work into it.  They want to get a reasonably comfortable house for themselves, their wives and children. That is a very desirable objective.  They hope, if things improve in the future, to improve the dwelling.  That is the practical objective of most applicants for housing grants.  If this attitude is to be rigidly adopted, and it seems that it is to be because a circular was sent out for this purpose, every possible way that an applicant might circumvent the grant size measurement is excluded.  These were considered loopholes by the Department and they consider that some crimes were being committed.  However, people are to be applauded for building their own homes and, if, at some time in the future, <Col N="1603" /> they get enough money to convert the garage to an extra living room, I congratulate them on that.  They do this on their own initiative, paying for it with their own savings and they are not a burden to the State.  The small new house grant they got was probalby the catalyst that helped them along the road.</P>
    <P>They should not be denied that small grant now because of this new measurement system.  The instructions went into great detail.  If one has the walls plastered in the basement one will not qualify for the grant.  The walls have to be unplastered and the block face visible.  If a radiator is installed in a basement, one will not get the grant.  There is a whole series of ridiculous measures which exemplify the thinking behind the minds that drew up those regulations.  I am surprised at Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Fergus O'Brien and all the others approving that document and sending it out for local authorities and inspectors to implement. I do not accept it.  I am referring to the document sent out recently introducing severe regulations for the measurement of a house for grant purposes.  It is an extraordinary document.  I wonder if the Minister was aware that it went out.</P>

It will have a very detrimental effect.  Rather than encouraging people to build their own homes it will act as an obstacle for many of them.</P>

      <P>I will communicate with Deputy Treacy.  Before commencing Question Time let me say a word.  I am satisfied that the vast majority of Members of the House and the parties are not satisfied with the progress that is being made at Question Time, or that the best use is being made of Question Time. For example, yesterday, despite the best efforts of the Chair only a handful of questions were disposed of.  For the guidance of Members I would remind them that supplementary questions (1) must be totally relevant to the original question (2) must not impart information, for example, not keep asking the Minister if he is aware of certain matters (3) must not be argumentative.  Also the Chair decides on the number of supplementary questions which may be asked.  It is disorderly once he has called on the next question for a Minister or a Member to continue to deal with the preceding one. These are obvious and commonsense rules and Standing Orders require that I ensure their observance.  I ask for the co-operation of Members in the matter so that Question Time may become more effective.  I propose to tighten up the enforcement of Standing Orders at Question Time.  In fact, I was publicly asked to do so by a very responsible Member of this House yesterday.  I hope that we will not have any wrangling or argument and that the Chair's rulings will be accepted, and I trust that they will be reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally, including county roads.  The new road plan, which I published last January, sets out the Government's policies and provides a planning framework for the development of roads up to the mid-nineties.  State expenditure of some £500 million is envisaged in the period 1985 to 1987.  Under the plan, priority is being given to the allocation of road grants for the improvement and maintenance of the network of national roads and of major urban roads.  These heavily-trafficked routes are of vital importance to the economic and social development of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>This year's allocation of £152.5 million represents an increase of 20 per cent or some 12 per cent in real terms relative to 1984.  Expenditure on the improvement of county roads falls to be financed by local authorities from their own resources and is supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department. The selection of improvement works to be carried out with these funds is entirely at the discretion of each local authority.  This year's block grant allocation involved an increase of 10 per cent compared with 1984.  Earlier this year I announced that a grant of up to 75 per cent of the cost will be paid towards the cost of approved improvement works on the more important county road bridges with a view to the preservation of the county road network.</P>
      <P>In accordance with established practice under successive Governments, it is not proposed to make State grants available for county road maintenance.  Expenditure under this heading will continue to be financed by local authorities from their own resources.</P>

In extreme cases, from some of the plans I have inspected, it would not be possible to drive a car into those garages because of the position of access. In a number of cases reluctantly I had to refuse grants.  Since clarification of the position was needed I had to inform the authorities.  I should like to repeat that there has not been a change in the limit on the size and layout of a house that may be grant-aided.

The present rate of 9.75 per cent is the lowest which has applied since 1978 and is 3.25 per cent lower than it was between March and June this year.  The mortgage rate charged by societies is dictated by the interest rate paid to investors.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the question refers to the £5,000 grant available to local authority tenants and tenant-purchasers of at least three years standing who buy or build a house for their own occupation and surrender their local authority dwellings in a condition suitable for re-letting to a housing applicant.  Since the essential purpose of the £5,000 grant is to increase the numbers of dwellings becoming available for letting, the grant is not available to local authority tenants purchasing their dwellings under a tenant purchase scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Enviroment the reason for the delay in sanctioning approval for traffic control arrangements at Caherdavin Lawn-Ennis Road junction, Limerick; if he is aware of the extreme urgency in relation to this requirement as the present situation is entirely unsatisfactory to the residents of Caherdavin Lawn and greatly impedes the traffic flow on one of Ireland's busiest roads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On 3 May 1985 Limerick County Council submitted to my Department three alternative proposals for a solution to the traffic problem at the Caherdavin Lawn Park junction with the Ennis Road, National Route N.18.  The council's favoured solution was a roundabout. The other two solutions involved either traffic lights or a new one way exit via Cherry Avenue to Clonmacken Road.</P>
      <P>In June the council were requested to give further consideration to the merits of the Cherry Avenue extension as a solution. However, the council requested that their original favoured solution, a roundabout, be reconsidered.  As part of the reconsideration, a vehicle delay study and pedestrian counts were carried out by the council at this location in October at the Department's request.  The results of the studies indicate that neither a traffic roundabout, traffic lights nor pedestrian signal are warranted at this location.  Accordingly, on 1 November the Department asked the council to submit details and costs of the Cherry Avenue solution so that consideration could be given to this scheme for road grant purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The study in question was essentially a preliminary exercise which has led to a more detailed study in my Department of options for dealing with air pollution in the Dublin area.  This study extends to matters such as likely future developments in relation to overall consumption of energy and trends in the use of particular fuels, estimates of total emissions in the Dublin area in future years on the basis of the existing policies and the extent to which these emissions may need to be reduced in the interests of health and the environment generally.</P>
      <P>In the light of that type of analysis, it will be necessary to assess different possible strategies for minimising emissions, particularly as regards the cost and other implications for the State, as well as the individual consumer, of developing the use of different kinds of cleaner fuels and combustion processes.  I intend that this work will be completed as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, drafting of an Air Pollution Bill is in progress.  The Bill will update and extend existing legislation on the control of air pollution, permit the full implementation of EC legislation, and provide local authorities with all necessary powers to ensure good air quality in their areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, that would possibly be so.  If the Deputy requires the information available in regard to urban air quality generally &mdash; and in Dublin in particular where the greatest difficulties are noticed &mdash; it seems the case that the pollutant giving the most cause for concern is smoke arising from the combustion of solid fuels.  Various options for dealing with smoke pollution and the costs and implications of different solutions, including smokeless zones, are at present being considered in my Department. The working group referred to in <Col N="1615" /> the question carried out preliminary work on the options for dealing with the problem and the results of their deliberations show the need for further and more detailed consideration of the costs and other implications to the State.</P>
      <P>As regards Dublin's air quality generally, the position is that the EC Directive on Air Quality Standards for Sulphur Dioxide and Smoke came into force in July 1982.  On the basis of the relevant monitoring data, all the mandatory EC standards laid down in that directive in relation to sulphur dioxide have been met in Dublin and in all other areas.  The annual smoke levels at all the Dublin monitoring stations have met the EC standards since 1982.  There have been, however, excesses of daily smoke levels on some individual days and on some groups of three days and at some of the 14 measuring stations in 1983-84 and 1984-85.  That information is as complete and as up-to-date as I can give the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>While primary responisbility for ensuring the safety of people attending sporting events lies with the proprietors and management of the premises concerned, local authorities have statutory functions in regard to several aspects of the safety of buildings and other premises.  Under the Fire Services Act, 1981, local authorities have wide powers to enforce fire safety requirements in respect of sports stadia.  I have requested local authorities to ensure that their fire prevention programme makes provision for inspection of premises while in use, as this is the best means of ensuring that adequate fire safety requirements are complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of buildings is subject to building by-laws in certain local authority areas for the purpose of ensuring public health and safety in relation to structural stability.  Building by-laws will be replaced by building regulations which will apply throughout the country as soon as possible after the enactment of the Building Control Bill, 1984.  Where an existing building is dangerous, a local <Col N="1617" /> authority have wide powers under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, to take action to make the building safe.</P>
    <P>The question of violence and misbehaviour of spectators at sporting events is an operational question of law and order which is normally the subject of consultations between the Garda Síochána and the organisers in advance of the event for the purpose of determining the appropriate security measures.  The Minister for Education has adopted a coordinating role in relation to the promotion of measures to combat violence and misbehaviour of spectators at sporting events and has been in communication with the major sporting organisations in relation to a recommendation made by the Council of Europe in this regard.  The Council of Europe has also adopted a convention on measures to deal with spectator violence, particularly at football matches, and consideration is being given to the ratification of the Convention by Ireland and the legislative and other measures which will be necessary for its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have extensive powers under the Litter Act, 1982, to prevent and overcome the harmful effects of litter in their areas and I have repeatedly urged them to make full use of these powers.  I intend to make a further approach to local authorities in relation to the matter in the near future. I am firmly of the view, however, that legislative measures must be backed up in this case by the wholehearted co-operation of the general public.  Earlier this year, I established the Environment Awareness Bureau whose primary functions include the fostering at all levels of society of a greater appreciation of environmental values and a more caring <Col N="1618" /> attitude to the environment.  I am confident that the bureau's programmes will make a noticeable impact on the litter problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of us will have to agree with the statement made by the Deputy.  I do not think that the passing of an Act or the imposition of fines is the answer.  As I have said, it is a question of education of and co-operation from the general public.  We all know about people who litter and we must ensure that such people are discouraged.  All of us can do it.  When we see people dropping litter we should tick them off and tell they they are breaking the law.  That would have a very beneficial effect.  The maximum fine for littering offences has been substantially increased to £800 and there is also provision for a £5 on-the-spot fine system to be operated by litter wardens.  In the end it is a question of improving our own habits.  That would have a far more beneficial effect than all the legislation and the exhortations I can make as Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is his intention that local authorities will be given the sole responsibility for water pollution control in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which I issued in May 1985, on the reform of local government includes a proposal that local authorities will be given sole responsibility for water pollution control in their areas.  This was seen as one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening the role of the local government system and extending its mandate.  All aspects of the proposal will be considered and the views of all interests concerned will be taken into account before final decisions are made regarding its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special devolution implementation group, under the chairmanship of the <Col N="1623" /> Minister for the Public Service, has been established by the Government to monitor and promote the devolution programme generally.</P>
    <P>The proposal to assign additional responsibilities in relation to water pollution control to the local authorities is consistent with section 34 of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, which provides for the repeal of the earlier statutory provisions under which regional fisheries boards may initiate proceedings for pollution offences.</P>
    <P>However, the full implications of the proposal and the need for consequential provisions of different kinds will need to be considered before the matter is taken further.  In the meantime, I intend to intensify my efforts to secure full and effective implementation of the 1977 Act by the local authorities in all areas.</P>
    <P>I intend also to make the necessary resources available for continued investment by the local authorities in the provision of the treatment plants and other works needed to eliminate pollution caused by town sewerage discharges. Special attention will continue to be given to those locations highlighted in a 1983 report from the Water Pollution Advisory Council as meriting priority; improvement works have been completed or are already well advanced at many of these locations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the Water Pollution Act, 1977 is not being implemented by local authorities because they do not have the staff or the funds to pay staff.  Is he aware that the fishery boards and fishery organisations generally are seriously concerned because the Minister intends to implement section 34, giving sole authority to the local authorities for water pollution control?  They are concerned because the local authorities have not been implementing the 1977 Act even though they have responsibility for water pollution control.  Who will prosecute the local authorities in the event of them continuing to pollute waters after the implementation of section 34, which will <Col N="1624" /> repeal two sections of the Fisheries Act being administered very effectively by the fishery boards?  Does he intend to increase resources to local authorities not alone to ensure that they will prevent pollution but so that they will be able to employ staff to ensure that the 1977 Act will be implemented?</P>

There is a <i>prima facie</i> case against the divided responsibility that exists now.  It does not seem to be the best approach, as I hope the Deputy will agree.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority differential rent scheme provides for the assessment in full of income from self-employment after the deduction of pay-related social insurance contributions and any income tax payable on such income. Income received under the terms of the enterprise allowance scheme is assessable as part of the income accruing to the tenant from his self-employment enterprise. Because of the clear application of these general principles, no specific guidelines have been issued in relation to the rent assessment of tenants availing of the enterprise allowance scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in the light of the Zurich swimming pool disaster earlier this year, he can confirm that he has instructed officials in his Department to carry our a major review of all roof structures in swimming pools in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has issued to local authorities guideline specifications for swimming pools.  The type of construction recommended does not provide for reinforced concrete suspended ceilings of the kind which collapsed in Zurich.  No major structural problems have been experienced with the types of roof used in local authority pools in Ireland, or in pools provided by others with financial aid from the local authories.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance of local authority swimming pools rests with the local authorities themselves.  In so far as other pools are concerned, local authorities have power, under the Local Government (Sanitary Service) Act, 1964, to require the owner to carry out necessary works, or to act themselves in default, if the structure is considered to be dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Department ask local authorities to monitor the structures of these pools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the construction specifications are laid down by the Department and have been issued to local authorities.  From then on it is the duty, therefore, of the relevant local authority to continue to carry out monitoring procedures to ensure the safety of all aspects of swimming pools. I want to strongly draw the attention of the House to the fact that, whereas everybody would be concerned about the type of collapse that happened in Zurich with the consequent loss of life there, as swimming pools in this country are not constructed to the same specifications and use different methods, I would not like to cause any undue worry among the <Col N="1627" /> many people who find swimming pools of great benefit to them.  I am aware that, where they are either local authority pools or local authority-funded, the relevant local authorities do monitor the situation at those pools regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I am not trying to cause any alarm.  Would he say if there is any monitoring carried out of the actual chemicals in these pools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements for local authorities are clearly set out as to how they should carry out cleaning and maintenance of proper sanitary conditions in pools in their areas.  It is the function of the local authority to do this. I know that many local representatives lucky enough to have pools in their local authority area are very conscientious about seeing that the highest level of sanitary arrangements are maintained in those pools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many people fear the corrosive effect of chemicals on the actual structure of such swimming pools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the one hand corrosive effect chemicals may result in keeping the water safe.  In that respect a local authority must regularly inspect pools in their area, the construction of the ceilings and roof structures.  With the exception of one pool about which I do not wish to make any great point, small problems have arisen in that area, but I understand that they have been put right because of action taken by the relevant local authority which I would expect to be the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> any local authority pools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the effect, if any, increasing VAT on building from 5 per cent to 10 per cent has had on (1) construction output; (2) private housing output; (3) public housing output; and (4) levels of employment in the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 12 answered on 25 June last.  While it is difficult to be precise about the effect of the increase in the rate of VAT on building services, it is tentatively estimated that if the total effect of the increase is to reduce the level of output and employment in 1985, it will be by a very marginal amount, say 1 per cent, below what would otherwise have been reached this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In looking at this matter, account must <Col N="1633" /> also be taken of other matters, such as the boost to private housing output as a result of the increase in the new house grant, the effects of the £5,000 grant to certain local authority tenants and tenant purchasers to enable them to build or buy their own houses, the growth in the activities of the Housing Finance Agency, the reduced mortgage interest rate and the effects of the package of employment, taxation and financial incentives announced on 23 October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the boost to private housing to which the Minister referred when his own Department estimated that house completions have fallen by 1,000 units in 1985 and the Construction Industry Federation estimate that the decline will reach a figure of 15,000 units?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined quite a long list of incentives which will have an effect on private housing output.  This morning we debated the Housing Finance Agency and the additional funds required by them &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the evidence of the boost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which have increased from about £50 million to £86 million this year.  This took place in a short period of three years.  I also mentioned the effect of the grant of £5,000 to local authorities, the reduction of the mortgate interest rate, which is at its lowest for seven years, and the package regarding taxation and financial incentives. These will all undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on the industry.  I am aware that there has been a decline in private house building but it should not be overlooked that there was a considerable increase in the number of local authority houses built over the last few years. Although local authority house building is going ahead, due to the recession there had been a fall off in the number of private houses being built.  However, the incentives introduced, especially in the last two years, will have a beneficial effect <Col N="1634" /> and are seen as such by the Construction Industry Federation and welcomed by them.  Indeed road construction is another area which was given a large boost during the last year and has also been welcomed by the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that loan approval statistics for new houses from the big five building societies show a 32 per cent, 33 per cent and a 21 per cent decline in May, June and July respectively this year?  Furthermore, during the three months since the rate was increased, less than 30 per cent of the total new approvals were in respect of new houses compared to an average of 40 per cent during the first four months of the year.  Registrations with the national house guarantee scheme, which are an indicator of new work going ahead, are 16 per cent down over the first seven months of 1985 nationally with a 20 per cent decline in the Dublin region. Reliable indicators from manufacturers of building products supplying the rural one off house building sector show an even more dramatic decline in this sector. The statistics and forecasts which the Department are officially issuing support this view yet the Minister offers optimistic comments in the House.</P>

I would not like to take that facility away from them as they may feel charges are necessary to increase their revenue.  A number of questions were put to me.  The rates support grant will not be affected because a county council, an urban council, or a county borough wish to continue raising revenue through the continuation either of water or sewerage charges.

      <P>The effects on expenditure of the new improvement grants will not be significant in the current year.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

In the document <i>Building on Reality</i> under the general heading of &ldquo;Housing&rdquo; which includes SDA loans, HFA loans, local authority programmes and new home improvement grants, the overall figure is £397 million.  Even if what the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has suggested is the position, a sum of £12 million from a total of £397 million would hardly put a big dent in that policy.  The number of houses available to local authorities in the past three years has well exceeded the figures we set out, namely, an occupancy of 9,000 houses in the three years.  That number has been exceeded by almost 1,000 in one year.  A sum of £12 million will be required next year and if it is intended to find that in the total amount of £397 million it will not have too great an impact.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase to £500 million the amount the Housing Finance Agency plc may borrow for the making of loans for the construction or building of houses.  The present borrowing limit of £200 million is specified in section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981.

All of their work has stopped because of the announcement regarding a higher level of grant.  In many cases work is not proceeding because of instructions to withdraw. This is evidence of the lack of advance planning by the Government in introducing new measures.

I should like the Minister in his reply to give some indication as to how he will deal with the huge number of applications that will come to the Department for the new grants.  The present inspection rate is running from six weeks to four months.  That being so, it could result in a major stoppage in construction work for many companies while waiting for inspections to be carried out.  It is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changing the date to 18 November will not make any great difference unless an army of new housing inspectors are appointed to carry out the work.  If the Government had implemented the proposal in their document dealing with reform of local government which was issued on 30 May 1985, they would by <Col N="1677" /> now have transferred the operation of home improvement grants to the local authorities where there is sufficient engineering staff fully competent to carry out the work.  In many cases these engineers have a low workload because of the cutback in finance to local authorities.  I ask the Minister to refer to this matter in his reply and to give us some information as to how he will deal with what I consider will be a flood of applications.  He has grossly underestimated the cost of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said it yet. The Chair may not be aware that local authority tenants form a special category when applying for loans from the Housing Finance Agency.  They qualify for a higher loan than is the case of any other applicant.  Therefore, what is happening in the local authority housing area is relevant to how the Housing Finance Agency will operate.  One cannot differentiate between the two and say that, while one is relevant to the discussion here, the other is not relevant.  From your remark, I do not accept that you understand how the Housing Finance Agency works.</P>

      <P>May I now explain the importance to local authority housing and to local authority tenants of the operation of this agency.  I am sure you will agree that I am very relevant and that anything happening in that area is of importance to the whole area of the demand for housing.  That demand will determine how many people apply eventually for loans because, if demand dries up, the agency will have no option but to pack up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that a whole new picture is emerging in the area of the housing market.  Emigration is one of the <Col N="1680" /> new factors distorting the statistics.  The result of emigration and of the high levels of unemployment as well as the low level of disposable incomes is that people are not moving as they were into new housing. Instead, they are selling out and leaving the country so that the money involved is not going back into housing. The local authority house building programme in some areas is in need of a complete review because what was considered to be the need is not being reflected in the demand for homes.  Some local authorities have difficulty in finding tenants for some of their new houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my intention. This is merely a passing reference to previous passing references.  Obviously, the Deputy did not extend his memory far enough back to 1980 or thereabouts when the then Fianna Fáil Government in a fashion that could not be regarded as hotch-potch, but which could be regarded as extremely clinical, cut off grants overnight. There was no apology from any quarter on that occasion.  I regret that the Deputy did not see fit to mention that matter and I refer to it now merely to put the record straight in so far as his party are concerned in that area.</P>
      <P>The advent of the Housing Finance Agency has been probably the single most important factor relating to housing finance in Ireland in the past 40 to 50 years.  The establishment of the agency was decried by many people on the opposite side both here and at local authority level.  These people said this was an area that we should not become involved in that the agency would not work, would not get money and could not last.  They set out the reasons for what they foresaw as the failure of the agency.  From my dealings at local authority level with those who have applied for HFA loans I am aware that the agency have been of tremendous benefit to those who needed them most.  Many of these people had been up to then on the local authority housing waiting list.  We have now arrived at the situation where virtually every couple, provided either one has a job, are in the position of being able to purchase their own homes.  That has come about directly as a result of the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>It has been obvious since the inception of the agency that they have never had sufficient moneys in any year to meet the demands on them.  That is a healthy factor in many ways.  It is an indication of a very keen interest in these loans.  The Bill proposes to increase the borrowing power of the agency and this is to be welcomed as a most constructive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a few short comments on the way the agency operate and perhaps a couple of suggestions as to the direction in which we should move next. <Col N="1682" /> Regarding the financial requirement for 1986, bearing in mind that in the current year approximately £86 million will have been allocated through the agency, I feel that next year, provision should be made for a figure somewhere in the region of £125 million to £130 million. That may seem an exaggerated requirement but, as we know from experience, it is not good policy to set a target at the beginning of the year which will be readily exceeded and more money will be needed before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that a realistic allocation is made through the agency to the various local authorities at the beginning of the year, because that will eliminate any indecision on the part of people who want to borrow through the agency, or to build their own houses, and it might eliminate any lack of confidence in the building industry in those who propose to borrow from the agency.</P>
    <P>It is important to ensure that borrowers who hope to obtain loans from the agency have sufficient confidence in the scheme to be able to assure the builder or the vendor that money will be available quickly and in sufficient quantities to meet their requirements.  I ask the Minister to ensure this year, if possible, that the money is put up front at an early stage and that we do not have that kind of hiccup.</P>
    <P>In my view, when deciding applications for specific categories, the county manager should have a little more discretion for allocating Housing Finance Agency loans.  I am referring particularly to the ordinary HFA loan maximum of £22,500. In many cases that sum is sufficient, but this is not always the case.  I am speaking of a husband, a wife and a large family who would quality for a special category loan if they were on the local authority housing list and living in unfit accommodation for 12 months.  If they are living in a rented house which they hope to buy, or if they have to leave that house, they could find themselves living in unfit or overcrowded conditions.  It could happen that the landlord wanted his house back or he might want to sell it in the ordinary <Col N="1683" /> way.  These people are not being considered as special category applicants and can only receive a maximum loan of £22,500.</P>
    <P>The obvious way around that &mdash; and this is the advice being given &mdash; is for the person concerned to obtain a supplementary loan.  That is about the worst possible solution to the problem for that family. We are forcing them into borrowing from another agency and the repayments on the second loan will be competing with the repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  It could happen that the agency will be the institution to suffer when the crunch comes because, if they borrow from a bank or another agency, the chances are that the bank will bring pressure to bear more quickly and the borrower will have to repay the loan weekly. The repayments to the bank will be up to date but the Housing Finance Agency will suffer.  The whole question of whether they are able to meet their loan repayments could be brought into question because of borrowing from too many institutions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider increasing the maximum for the ordinary category loan from £22,500 to £25,500 or, failing that, allowing county managers discretion to accede to the full £27,000 special category loans where hardship is likely to be caused, where there are large families or where the persons concerned, as a result of circumstances outside their control, could find themselves on the local authority housing list and, consequently, having to be housed by the State.  Even though these families have not been on the housing list for 12 months, they should be considered for special category loans.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a number of cases which fell into that category and, it is important that the Minister should give the local authorities, who act as agents for the Housing Finance Agency, a little more discretion in that area.  The Minister would be safe in doing that because, as we all know from experience, county managers are responsible people and can be relied on to ensure <Col N="1684" /> that the agency's money is not wasted. Those of us who are members of local authorities usually try to get the manager to spend a little more than he is prepared to and thereby hangs another tale.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the competition between the Housing Finance Agency loan system and the SDA loan scheme and the fact that the number of SDA loans now being processed is decreasing considerably.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  The market requirements in this case are being met by the Housing Finance Agency and the SDA loan system and, most important, the State is winning because the Housing Finance Agency scheme is working so well.</P>
    <P>In 1980 we in Kildare had approximately 2,500 families on the waiting list. That has been reduced to under 1,000 primarily as a result of the activities of the HFA scheme.  That trend must be reflected in a number of other counties as well.  Wherever we can ensure that an individual whose wife or husband has a job and who are anxious to obtain a home for themselves and their families, our attitude should be to do everything possible to assist them.  When people are prepared to help themselves, and so create employment, we should do our utmost to ensure that State agencies assist them in a positive way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that a number of people who obtain HFA loans can be on a housing list and that a number of couples thinking of getting married have also become interested in that scheme, but one of the things that can hamper them is that they must have some savings.  I recognise that it is important to encourage people to save and to acquire a nest egg, but very often they may lose a chance to buy a house which comes on the market and in which they are particularly interested, because they did not have time to save.  One thing that happens is that the £2,000 new house grant is taken into the calculations when determining the 90 per cent loan which is available in all cases.</P>
    <P>If the Minister did not find some of my other suggestions possible, he might <Col N="1685" /> consider this.  Perhaps the £2,000 new house grant could be calculated as part of the deposit rather than as part of the 90 per cent loan.  In some quarters it is said that it is not advisable to encourage people to obtain a loan without having first gone through the trauma of saving. If it provides a couple with a house a little bit sooner it could ensure that we do not have young couples living in overcrowded and unfit housing conditions for long periods while they try to scrape up a deposit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the peculiar trends in the housing market.  One peculiar trend is that there are a quite a number of secondhand houses for sale.  It is not that the people are emigrating or walking out, locking the door and disappearing, as suggested by Deputy Molloy, but it is a result of a sharp increase in inflation in the price of houses and an increase in the number of houses built for a couple of years, when the party opposite were in power.  Such a programme could not be maintained and we now have secondhand houses on the market which were built expensively in a time of inflation and when people were granted loans on the basis of expected increased incomes based on high inflation. The depressed secondhand market is a result of that over-supply and new houses now are obviously better value for anybody buying a house.  In relation to secondhand houses it is important that my suggestion in relation to the increase from the £22,500 would be considered for those other than the special category cases.  That could have an impact on the secondhand market and assist the people who would ordinarily find themselves waiting for three or four years on the housing list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am glad the Minister is making more finance available to the Housing Finance Agency so that more money will be available for housing loans.  I hope it will alleviate the difficulties of people who hold HFA sanctions so that they will be able to come off bridging loans much more rapidly than heretofore.  Over the past year and a half people have been <Col N="1686" /> on bridging for a long time apparently waiting for the funds to come through to get their mortgages stamped and sealed.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the operations of the HFA.  They seem to operate differently from the normal traditional style of the other lending institutions in the repayments structure they operate. Where the other lending institutions have a standard repayment so that most of the pressures are on the borrowers in the initial two or three years, the HFA have the repayments index linked on a percentage basis which means that the pressure will come later on.  I am afraid that young married couples who borrowed from the HFA and set up home will find themselves in a couple of years with a young family and not in a position to meet their commitments.  It is all very well at the start when the repayments are low but as time goes on and the people get more normal family expenses they will be in a difficult situation.  Has any study been done of the impact of this type of structured repayments for the future? I hope people are able to meet their commitments but is the Minister satisfied that this type of arrangement is appropriate and can be sustained in the future by borrowers?</P>
      <P>As a result of the increase in VAT in relation to the building industry, as announced in the last budget, other financial institutions also serving the housing finance market have changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the Housing Finance Agency since their establishment in 1981 have been a major force in the Irish housing scene.  I would point out to the Minister that other forces operating in the same housing scene are now having a rethink and a restructured type of decision on people who make applications for funds to buy or build houses as a result of the change in the VAT rate where we now have the increased amount of VAT being deducted from a loan.  The Government are being blamed by these institutions for creating inflation in the cost of houses as a result of this VAT.  This means that a person who makes an application expecting to get 90 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;absolutely &mdash; of <Col N="1688" /> their loan now find themselves ending up just 20 per cent less than before.  Before this applicants for a loan on a £30,000 house would qualify for up to £27,000. As a result of this restructured situation where one-eleventh of the total price is being deducted from the loan against the 5 per cent VAT, people are finding themselves qualifying only for £20,000 against a £30,000 house.  People have not got the funds to go ahead and this will have a detrimental effect on the housing market and put extreme pressure on the funds of the HFA if allowed to go uncontrolled by the Minister.  I would ask the Minister to take cognisance of the situation and let us know what he proposes to do.</P>
      <P>I worry that the agency have to borrow funds from life offices and pension funds and perhaps that is why repayments are structured in the way they are.  We all know that people invest in these institutions in order to get a good return and these institutions boast about the high return they can give and about the way they can protect money against inflation. We can see a situation whereby the SDA loans which have been so vitally important could be reduced.  Our spokesman, Deputy Molloy, illustrated clearly today the reduction in the number of loans and the reduction in the number of houses built over the last number of years.  I appeal to the Minister, in tandem with this Bill, to review the SDA loan and increase the income limit to £10,000 and to increase the loan to £20,000.  By taking the two in tandem we can protect the solvency and the operation of the HFA and look after those on lower income scales.  Because of the way inflation is and the increase in VAT on building, it is now time to increase these figures for the SDA loans.  I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister will have some answers to the queries I put before him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Small Businesses Committee for some time has been considering ways of improving construction, demand and performance against a background of deep recession.  Construction output generally grew rapidly in the seventies to reach 18.8 per cent of GDP in <Col N="1689" /> 1979.  Since that time the sector has been in progressive decline and has fallen by a quarter in real terms and now it stands at 11.5 per cent of GDP.  Although the percentage of GDP accounted for by construction is now in line with that of other European countries, the decline in demand continues.  The Department of the Environment forecast a 4 per cent decline this year, even lower than last year.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the influence of the State on construction and its huge impact.  In 1984, 70 per cent of finance for investment in construction was chanelled through State sources including direct expenditure of Government Departments, local authorities, State agencies, health boards etc. and grants.</P>
      <P>Total mortgages for new houses advanced during the first quarter of 1985 were 2,850 odd.  This was down by 5 per cent on the same period in the previous year.  Building societies reported an 8 per cent decline and local authorities a 7 per cent decline, but the HFA a 2 per cent increase.  I am getting there, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <P>According to the construction industry there was a considerable rush by new house purchasers to complete house transactions before the VAT increase on 1 May and this resulted in an upsurge in loan advances during April which distorted the figures somewhat for that quarter, as will be seen when they are compared with the figures for the next quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us today is of a technical nature dealing with the HFA.  The agency were registered in February 1982 following the passing of the Housing Finance Agency Bill by the Oireachtas in late 1981.  They opened for business on 1 March 1982 and paid out their first loan on 31 August 1982.  The objectives of the agency at the time were outlined primarily as to attract long term funds for institutional investors, life assurance offices and pension funds by enabling them to <Col N="1690" /> invest in index linked bonds issued by the agency.  In this way additional financial resources were to be diverted into housing and consequently, the building industry would be assisted.  The more funds attracted, the more loans could be given.</P>
    <P>The second objective was that these funds were to be used to provide mortgages for house purchase at a rate of interest which would also be index linked; in other words, they were to provide mortages for a category of people who would not be eligible for conventional mortages. Annual repayments were to be related to the borrower's income and in this way the scheme would give access to home ownership to many who could not meet the high repayment burden in the early years of a conventional annuity mortgage.</P>
    <P>A feature of the scheme was that it would protect workers against a fall in income due to sickness or unemployment. In effect, the scheme was designed to open up house purchase to employed persons who previously depended mainly on the local authorities for housing.  The Act provides that the agency in performing their fucntion should ensure that, taking one year after another, all of their costs were met from their operations.</P>
    <P>To date in the three years since the agency commenced operations to the end of October 1985, about 11,000 households have purchased their homes with HFA loans involving loan payments of £217 million.  This money and the whole operation of the agency are Government guaranteed and the whole exercise before us today is to raise the limit of guarantee from £200 million to £500 million.  The agency have already exceeded somewhat the £200 million.  In addition an estimated 2,000 agency loans have been approved, but not yet paid, amounting to £40 million while another 2,000 applications are being processed.  This totals over 15,000 loans which have been handled by the agency, coming to £300 million.  We are not before our time in what the exercise is about.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the public capital programme allowed for expenditure of £86 million by the HFA.  This was increased somewhat <Col N="1691" /> in recent times from £80 million originally. To 1 November this year over 3,500 loans were approved in 1985 alone. These figures give some indication of the popular demand for the service being given by the HFA.</P>
    <P>Since the agency commenced operations, cash receipts from the sale of index linked stocks totalled £170 million. The shortfall is obvious.  However, the balance has been funded by the raising of short term borrowing.  Funding between stock issues has at all times been achieved by this method which is essential for a weekly flow of funds.  Many of us involved in local authorities and in helping constitutents to find their way through the mass of bureaucracy involved in most applications &mdash; and let me say that the HFA are no worse than any other in regard to red tape of this kind &mdash; found in 1984, in particular, that there was considerable delay on a month by month basis in payment of the loans once the mortgages had been sanctioned by the local authorities. I understand that funds were not coming through quickly enough to meet the demand on a month by month basis.</P>
    <P>However, in 1985 the situation appears to be more fluid, and my experience is that there has not been the same stop-go in meeting payments and, as a result, the problem with bridging has been reduced. We are inclined to criticise the HFA, the building societies, or financial institutions and blame them for bridging situations, but investigation often shows that the mortgagee is to blame, that the title is wrong or some legal difficulty is holding up the final sanction.  This year I have found far fewer problems with bridging with the HFA, and any of the delays I have investigated cannot be laid at the HFA's door.</P>
    <P>A borrower with the HEA may receive a loan equal to three times his or her income and make a repayment of 20 per cent of that income which effectively means a repayment to the agency of about 6? per cent of the total loan in the first year.  The net effect of this to the agency is approximately 5 per cent so, if the agency's money is costing any more <Col N="1692" /> than that, they are on a losing wicket. Then we must consider the cost of the administration which up to 6 June 1985 was about £200,000.  I understand that seven married people are employed by the HFA, and that is the sort of figure for administration that we are talking about.</P>
    <P>The sale of index linked stock with the low coupon is an ideal way of financing such a mortgage scheme.  The agency are, therefore, severely restricted in taking up funds which involve an initial repayment of over say 5 per cent, because that is the net gain to the agency in any one year on their first portion of any loan repayment. If the agency were to obtain long term loans at 12 per cent, the cost of Government gilts for example, they could absorb only an amount equal to 15 per cent of that taken up from the sale of the index linked stock.  The internal resources of the agency would then be fully committed to making these repayments and they would not, for example, be able to raise short term borrowing which is essential to the regular weekly flow of funds to mortgagees.</P>
    <P>During the past three years there has been only one year when the average mortgage rate of the HFA was above that of the more conventional type building societies.  That was in 1984 when the HFA variable was 13.95 per cent and that of the building societies was 12.06 per cent. This year the HFA variable is 9.95 per cent with the building societies at 12.07 per cent.</P>
    <P>In a sample analysis of the loans approved in the period 1 January to 31 July of this year, HFA report that 54 per cent of the loans issued were for new houses and 46 per cent for previously occupied houses.  This differs somewhat from the normal type of analysis of building societies and, perhaps, it reflects a particular demand that the HFA is meeting.</P>
    <P>The HFA are there for those who cannot afford conventional mortgages. Most of the people receiving mortgages from that agency come off local authority <Col N="1693" /> housing lists or are likely to be local authority tenants or tenant purchasers.  In a breakdown of all the loans and mortgages with the HFA one can see that 44 per cent were tenant or tenant purchasers of local authority houses, 21 per cent were tenants of private dwellings and the remainder were living with their parents. The HFA have been a particular attraction to single people who sometimes find it more difficult to get conventional mortgages, particularly from local authorities. Although 68 per cent of those who received HFA mortgages, over the last three years were married, another 10 per cent were single with no indication of likelihood to marry and another 20 per cent were about to marry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not deflected from the HFA.  Any statistics I am giving relate purely to the HFA and are by way of illustration why we are discussing this technical and limited Bill which is before us, thankfully, because the HFA are a <Col N="1694" /> success story.  When the HFA were established, they were given a mandate to raise long term funds from life assurance offices and pension funds by selling index-linked stock.  Over the past three years, despite falling inflation and very high rates of interest, the agency, amazingly, succeeded in raising £170 million from those sources.  In accordance with that mandate, those funds have been used to finance a mortgage scheme where the repayments are income related.  As 54 per cent of those loans have been used directly to finance the purchase of new houses, the construction industry has benefited tremendously also.</P>
      <P>I should like to develop one aspect of this issue.  The HFA have been given a mandate to raise money purely from life assurance offices and pension funds by selling to them their index-linked stock, but perhaps there is a case for de-restriction in that regard.  Perhaps banks, building societies and others might be attracted.  There is no question of an immediate tremendous interest in the short term, but de-restriction might leave the option open particularly if we are to have increased inflation.  The Minister should look at the possibility of de-restriction in regard to the prospectus of the HFA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that has increased demand for the services and the mortgages of the agency was the announcement in the national and social economic plan issued in September 1984 of the £5,000 grant for young people or people who were more than three years tenants in local authority houses.  In a way that increased the demand for Housing Finance Agency loans more than was expected.  In fact, the agency had a demand on them which was far above what was initially outlined for them when they were established.  The scheme has been tremendously successful and a large proportion of the people leaving or relinquishing local authority houses have turned to the agency because they can lend up to 90 per cent of the purchase price of a house.  As a result of the very prudent policy of the Government and the successful policies of the HFA the <Col N="1695" /> construction industry has benefited and many couples who otherwise might not be in a position to own their own home are now in a position to buy one.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, as with all other local authorities, the HFA have had a tremendous effect.  This year alone more than £950,000 has been spoken for, either approved or paid, in HFA loans and mortgages.  I understand that that is the experience of all local authorities.  The fact that the Bill is before the House is a tribute to the success of the HFA.  The theory behind the type of income-related mortgage that the HFA operate is sound provided house prices and incomes keep in line with inflation.  My only fear is that there would be any fallout between the three aspects, house prices, incomes and inflation.  If any one falls behind the other and there is a question of having to redeem a loan for any good reason, there may be a difficulty with the mobility of the mortgagee.  So far anybody who has had to redeem a HFA mortgage has not lost out but, in theory that could happen if house prices, inflation and incomes do not keep in line.  The success story of the agency has made the Bill necessary and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the Bill and the announcement by the Minister that an extra £6 million is to be made available to the agency.  I welcome that move as a member of Dublin County Council.  Many Deputies have referred to the success of the agency and there is no doubt that that is true, but we should all be sensible in this regard and state that the HFA loans are as successful as the SDA loans were some years ago.  The reason the agency have been such a success is that up to £22,000 is available for house purchase.  Tenants of local authority houses who surrender their houses can obtain up to £27,000, a considerable amount if one is anxious to purchase a new house.  We must remember that loans from the agency are the only ones available to many people anxious to borrow between £18,000 and £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> I hope a considerable portion of the £6 million will be channelled into Dublin areas.  In my constituency, Tallaght and Clondalkin, extensive building programmes are being carried out and many people are seeking loans for house purchases. It is my view that Dublin County Council are the biggest user of the HFA scheme.  I expect the Minister is aware of the number of Dublin people who are on bridging finance because very little money was available to Dublin County Council last August.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is pretty correct and I am not trying to be an alarmist.  The situation improved somewhat when additional funds were made available, I think in September, but the position is still pretty difficult.  A number of young people whose applications for loans have been approved under the Housing Finance Agency scheme are finding it difficult to have their loans advanced. When applicants apply to the council for a loan under that scheme, I gather they are advised to seek bridging finance and many are on bridging finance for a considerable time.  It is not a question of my being critical of the scheme, which I welcome very much.  I have been very much involved in it, possibly more so than many other Deputies, being a member of Dublin County Council.  I am sorry to have to tell of the number of couples and young people on bridging finance which situation arose particularly from the non-availability of funds in the period starting about August last.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that an additional £6 million is being made available and I hope that a considerable proportion of this will be channelled into use in the Dublin area.  The scheme has been a tremendous success but we must not lose sight of the fact that for house purchasers who wish to borrow in the region of £20,000, the Housing Finance Agency loan is the only loan available.  The Bill has my full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as one in a series of moves taken to improve the housing situation greatly.  Since 1979, <Col N="1697" /> for most Dublin TDs in any event, housing has been the biggest single problem experienced at clinics.  The housing list for local authority housing has greatly eased, mainly because of a substantial number of houses being made available by those local authorities but also because loans through the Housing Finance Agency have been made available for people to purchase their own homes and because of the incentive of the £5,000 grant to surrender local authority houses in order to purchase privately built houses.</P>
      <P>The housing situation is at the best state ever in recent history.  The problem in rehousing is not getting houses, but getting people rehoused in the localities that they choose, when there is no space for extension work.  The Bill improves the availability of loans and of housing alternatives for many citizens.  I would like to see the Housing Finance Agency becoming involved in funding the refurbishing of inner city blocks of flats. People would be quite happy to buy flats and live in them if these were of a good standard.  Section 2 of this Bill amends section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, to increase the limit on borrowings by the agency to £500 million.  I think the figure was £200 million.  That is a very substantial increase.</P>
      <P>We spend annually somewhere in the region of £210 million on building local authority houses.  The lion's share of these are built in Dublin and the standards used in building them are second to none.  They are very costly to build. Many of the people living in such houses would be quite happy to live in privately built houses not to the same standard if they aspired to owning those houses and could finance that ownership.  We put people into those expensive houses at fixed rents and in many cases that rent is as much as the people can manage to pay.  However, in some cases there are a number of people working in the family and they could afford to fund the purchase of a house if they could get together a deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>£210 million could probably finance <Col N="1698" /> borrowing in the region of nearer £2,000 million than £500 million.  I ask the Minister to look at the whole question of local authority housing.  Would it not be better to give a Housing Finance Agency loan to those people on the local authority housing list, funded by using the money spent annually in building local authority houses, to let those people purchase the houses automatically at 100 per cent loans with repayment of approximately 20 per cent of their income, whatever it happens to be, as the Housing Finance Agency system works at present?  That would save a vast amount of money on maintenance, sometimes of a rather trivial nature which people buying their own houses from day one would be quite prepared to look after themselves.  That would give a boost in the employment of people in the construction industry.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>A difficulty is experienced by many under the Housing Finance Agency which has been accentuated in recent times by the £5,000 loan.  This is probably best illustrated by giving an example.  A deserted wife has £85 a week income and lives in a local authority flat.  Under the three times income rule she would probably be able to borrow £12,500 and because she is a tenant for more than three years she could get the grant of £5,000.  If she were buying a new house, she could get £7,000 and a mortgage subsidy. The Housing Finance Agency rules, in their application, state that it must be earnable income, that a person on a deserted wife's pension, disability pension or something similar, is excluded. Even though with all the grants available they would be well able to fund the purchase of the house they are excluded and not given the alternative to live in a house of their choice.  Many small houses in the inner city could well be funded by people in this category.  I ask the Minister to arrange for the Housing Finance Agency to look at this provision which would make the loans being extended under the present legislation available to the widest possible range of people.  This would be in the interests of the applicant, of the local authority and of the Government <Col N="1699" /> and, from the point of view of self-reliance, people wanting to look after their own affairs, it is in the best interests of the community.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take the credit to this side of the House exclusively, but there has been an enormous improvement in the housing situation.  People who could not have hoped to be housed for many years are now being housed much more quickly.  This is due to a combination of the loans and grants which have been made available under various schemes. There are still people on the housing lists who would prefer to house themselves in areas of their own choice where there would be a proper housing mix.  The Minister should consider using the money he spends annually to service further loans under the HFA.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and on making available an additional £6 million.  I hope he will take into consideration the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West) Mr. Barrett (Dublin North-West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I welcome this Bill which increases the amount which the HFA may borrow. Since their establishment in 1981 the HFA have helped many people but they must belong to a certain category of people purchasing their own houses.  It is a step in the right direction and I am glad we are now encouraging local authority tenants to purchase their own houses. This will mean a slowing down in the movement of tenants.  A tenant who becomes a purchaser will have more interest in his or her house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £5,000 grant has proved very attractive but unfortunately the person availing of this grant has to move from his house.  I wonder why a grant is not available to encourage tenants to buy the houses in which they are already residing, many of them for a very long time.  I call on the Minister to introduce some type of grant to enable tenants to purchase their own houses.  They should be encouraged to stay in their own areas.  Although the grant of £5,000 has proved very attractive, it has created problems in <Col N="1700" /> some cases because tenants who are not working are not considered and those who qualify must move out of the area. Many of these people were leaders in their local community groups and there is now a lack of community leadership. These areas will become ghettos inhabited by poor people who cannot afford to move.</P>
    <P>Part of the area which I represent is Ballymun where there are 300 vacant flats.  In reply to a question the city manager indicated to me that many people living in that area availed of the £5,000 grant and moved to areas such as Tallaght, Clondalkin or Blanchardstown. The corporation have all those flats on their hands, as well as houses which are not regarded as attractive.  They find they cannot let many of those houses.  I am aware that the maximum rent in some cases is very high.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> These high rents also encourage tenants to buy their own houses.  In the Dublin area it is difficult to let local authority houses and Dublin Corporation have included single parents among those eligible. Only a short time ago they would not have been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major problem for tenants who are applying for loans in that it can sometimes take nine or 12 months to complete the purchase process.  I am aware that the processing of applications takes a considerable time and there is also delay in getting the property inspected. There is delay in dealing with the legal profession because a solicitor must guarantee to obtain title for his client and there can be considerable delay in establishing title.  I am particularly concerned about the delay in the issuing of cheques by local authorities.  In the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council areas only about ten cheques are handed out each week.  I should like to see an improvement in that position. Unfortunate people who cannot get their <Col N="1701" /> cheques are put under pressure by vendors and are forced to acquire bridging finance.  I hope that the Housing Finance Agency can eliminate the delay because some people are paying as much as £400 per month to the banks and financial institutions for these bridging finance facilities. I would ask whether Government cutbacks on staff recruitment to local authorities have contributed in any way to the delays in the issuing of cheques.</P>
    <P>An applicant for a loan gets three times his income or 90 per cent, whichever is the greater.  The repayment is 20 per cent of his earnings but many people do not realise that they will never own their houses at that rate of repayment.  They should be encouraged to pay more.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will enable many more people to buy their own houses.</P>

      <P>All of us welcomed the setting up of the Housing Finance Agency and we are pleased that they have been successful.  I should like to offer one or two observations about what I believe might be the way forward for the HFA in the context of the financial and technical measure before us.</P>
      <P>One of the HFA's best contributions has been to afford to people on housing lists an option to purchase and get off the housing list into permanent, owner-occupied dwellings.  This has filled a very important vacuum in the housing spectrum. That general thrust should be welcomed. At one stage people felt they had to be forever confined to living in local authority dwellings without the hope of ever owning their own dwellings and enjoying the benefits, privileges and dignities that go with it.  The HFA have to some extent bridged that gap.</P>

      <P>I had a Private Notice Question down for last Wednesday but I did not have an opportunity <Col N="1702" /> to have it discussed.  It was to ask the Minister for Health if he will make the necessary finance available to the Southern Health Board to enable hip replacement operations to be carried out in Tralee General Hospital as these operations were discontinued due to the lack of finance available to purchase orthopaedic implants.</P>
      <P>I now ask the Minister for Health if he will make the finance available to the Southern Health Board to enable hip and knee implant operations to be carried out in the Tralee hospital.  We are all glad and satisfied in Kerry that the most up to date hospital in Ireland was opened in Tralee 15 months ago.  It cost £20 million and it is a great asset in the county.  The people are satisfied completely with the general staff who are doing excellent work.</P>
      <P>However, we have a big problem.  We have not been having knee or hip replacement operations since 1 October because there is a shortage of finance to purchase the equipment for orthopaedic implants. The hospital staff are satisfied that if £20,000 were made available, or even less, to the Southern Health Board and allocated to the hospital, those operations could be carried out between now and Christmas.</P>
      <P>In Tralee we have two orthopaedic surgeons, one permanent and one temporary. The temporary surgeon replaces a permanent man who went to Dublin recently, but the appointment will be filled permanently in the near future.  The two surgeons are being paid by the Southern Health Board and it is important that they be given the equipment to do these operations.  We have a waiting list of 80 patients in Kerry and the cost of each operation, using the implant equipment, would be about £600.  The two orthopaedic surgeons could do six operations or more per week between now and Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the new general hospital was opened in Tralee, Kerry patients had to go to Cork and they were on a waiting list for one to two years, suffering <Col N="1703" /> tremendous pain from arthritic and rheumatic complaints.  Since the Tralee hospital was opened, the waiting list has been cut down substantially.  Unfortunately, Kerry seems to be the wettest county in the country and it is notable that many complain of arthritis and rheumatism.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board have been in communication with <Col N="1704" /> my Department regarding the level of orthopaedic implant surgery carried out in the board's hospitals.  The Southern Health board have informed my Department that, on the basis of the amount of money which they have allocated for implant surgery in 1985, it will be necessary to discontinue this work from mid-November. The board have requested an additional sum of £25,000 &mdash; not the £20,000 requested by the Deputy &mdash; to allow implant surgery to continue after mid-November.  The sum of £25,000 seems to be a ridiculously small amount of money in the context of a budget of £9.7 million for the Tralee hospital and a total budget of over £133 million for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I find it incredible that given the level of resources available to the Southern Health Board they could not effectively manage what is, after all, an elective service.

      <P>In conjunction with the introduction of the revised scheme of house improvement grants, a number of relaxations of the waiting period requirements have been made including the general reduction from ten years to seven years in the waiting period from the date of payment of a previous house improvement grant to the commencement of work under the revised scheme.  Under a further relaxation a grant may be paid under the new scheme for works to the basic fabric of a house in a case where a grant was paid under the 1981 scheme provided that the works carried out under that scheme were of a different category from the works now proposed.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts give planning authorities considerable powers to secure the satisfactory completion of private housing estates and I have no proposals to amend the Acts in this respect at the present time.

The conditions attached to planning permissions for housing estates and the enforcement of these conditions is of critical importance.</P>
      <P>My Department have advised planning authorities as to the type of conditions which should be attached to planning permissions for housing estates and the need for care and precision in drafting such conditions if effective action is to be taken at a later stage.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  26 and 34 together.  Functions in relation to the protection of trees in the interests of amenity are vested in local planning authorities.  In particular, section 45 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, empowers a planning authority to make a tree preservation order in respect of a tree, trees, group of trees or woodlands where such preservation appears to be expedient in the interests of amenity.  The effect of a tree preservation order is to bring trees of amenity value specified in the order within the planning control process, by requiring the consent of the planning authority to the cutting down of any such trees.  I have no proposals to amend the law in this regard but I am awaiting an opinion from the Attorney General on the question of whether it would be possible to restrict further the circumstances in which compensation may be claimed where a consent under a tree preservation order is refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing provisions of the Planning Acts, if properly applied, can be used effectively to protect trees of amenity value in many situations. In the near future, I propose to issue a comprehensive memorandum to planning authorities setting out the scope and opportunities available to them under the Planning Acts to promote and advance policies and objectives in relation to amenity trees.  The memorandum will include advice on the making of tree preservation orders and in relation to tree protection in areas zoned for development or on sites for which planning permission is granted.  The provisions of Planning Acts relate to the protection of amenity trees only and the use of land for forestry is exempted development. The regulation of forestry activity is the responsibility of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry who will shortly introduce a Bill to amend existing legislation governing the felling of trees <Col N="1647" /> and to increase the penalties for illegal felling.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="1648" /> Nos. 28 and 37 together.  The programme of tax incentives to encourage inner city development and reconstruction announced on 23 October last is intended to secure the redevelopment of areas most in need and where special efforts are required to encourage investment in urban renewal projects.  In deciding to apply the new programme to Dublin Cork and Limerick, the Government took account of the fact that these are the cities where the problems of inner city decay and dereliction are most acute, persistent and extensive.  The operation of the scheme will be kept under constant review bearing in mind the situation in other urban areas.  I should add that considerable benefits are likely to accrue in terms of employment in the construction industry and the refurbishment of many older housing units in inner urban areas from the revised system of housing grants which is also being introduced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 32 together.  In so far as my area of responsibility is concerned, I have already taken steps to deal with the problem of uninsured drivers.  Under the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984, the maximum fine for the uninsured use of a motor vehicle was increased from £100 to £1,000.  The mandatory period of disqualification for a second or subsequent offence of uninsured driving within any period of three years was increased from six months to one year. The sentence of six months imprisonment may be imposed instead of or in addition to a fine.</P>
      <P>In December 1984 I made the Road Traffic (Insurance Disc) Regulations, 1984, which provide that motor vehicles being used in public places must display windscreen insurance discs with effect from 1 July 1986.  The discs are being issued by motor insurers with all new motor policies and all renewals of existing policies and all insured drivers should have received the discs by 1 July next.  At present, my Department are engaged in a review of road traffic legislation, including that on compulsory motor insurance. I hope to be in a position to introduce a Road Traffic Bill next year.  It would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment in this matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>Because of their relatively high cost, local authorities have been advised that excessive or unnecessary use of aluminium or hardwood windows in their houses should be avoided.  However, where designs submitted by local authorities for approval provide for the use of teak or aluminium doors and windows, they are considered on their merits <Col N="1650" /> taking into consideration comparable prices for the components in question and their softwood equivalents.  The price and quality of building materials are kept under regular review in my Department with the object of getting the best value for money in the local authority housing programme.</P>

The estimated average weekly subsidy for a new local authority dwelling was £53 in 1980, £65 in 1981, £86 in 1982 and £89 in 1983.  The corresponding figures for 1984 are: Number of houses rented, 110,450; total rental income, £38.2 million; average weekly rent, £6.65; total housing subsidy, £149.636 million; average weekly subsidy per new dwelling, £85.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his earnings, derived from self-employment as a painter and from the benefit from his holding exceeded the statutory limit.  He appealed against the disallowance but an appeals officer also decided that his means exceeded the statutory limit, and he was notified of the decision on 1 July 1985.  It is understood that the person <Col N="1665" /> concerned is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 22 August 1985.  Inquiries had to be made to establish that she fulfilled the condition of being available for work before her entitlement to unemployment benefit could be determined.</P>
      <P>These inquiries were recently completed and her claim was allowed at the maximum flat rate of unemployment benefit appropriate to a married woman, £34.70 weekly.  A voucher for encashment at her local post office in respect of all arrears due issued to her on 29 October 1985.  Further weekly payments will be made as they become due.  Inquiries are being made at present to ascertain whether the person concerned may also be entitled to pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>It has been decided by an appeals officer that the person concerned is not entitled to an old age pension as he does not fulfil the statutory condition as to means.  The assessment of his means comprising the estimated income from a holding and the weekly value of capital exceed the statutory limit for entitlement to pension.  The transfer of his holding and the disposal of a large part of his capital have not been accepted for old age pension purposes.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 10 October 1984 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She appealed against the disallowance and she was examined by a different <Col N="1667" /> medical referee on 29 November 1984 who also considered her to be capable of work.  She was advised of this result and supplied with a form of appeal on 5 December 1984.  The completed form was received in the Department on 4 March 1985.</P>
    <P>The person concerned and her doctor were invited to attend an oral appeal hearing on 13 September 1985.  However, her doctor did not attend the hearing and the appeals officer requested a further examination by a medical referee before determining the appeal.</P>
    <P>She was again examined by a medical referee on 9 October 1985 and was again considered to be capable of work.  The appeals officer then decided that on the basis of the evidence before him that she was not incapable of work from 10 October 1984 to 25 September 1985, the date of the latest medical evidence before him.  His decision is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

As they did not come within the excepted categories for satisfying the living alone condition of the scheme her free electricity allowance was terminated.  In the light of the information now furnished by the Deputy further inquiries will be made in the case and when these are completed, her entitlement to the allowance will be reviewed without delay.</P>

      <P>A grant to enable Gort Golf Club to employ six young workers and a supervisor for 15 weeks was approved by my Department in December 1984.  Following a request from the club a second grant was sanctioned to enable the workforce to be retained for a further 15 weeks.  The project ended on 10 July 1985.</P>
      <P>Of the moneys due to the club, £13,050 has already been paid.  In accordance with the terms of Teamwork the balance of the grant due &mdash; approximately £600 &mdash; will be retained until a certified audited account of expenditure on the project has been received and examined.</P>
      <P>Due to exceptional demand for Teamwork in 1985 it was not possible to allocate further grant aid to Gort Golf Club. It is, however, open to the club to apply to the National Manpower Service for assistance under the social employment scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department has not been notified by the employer concerned under the Redundancy Payments Acts of the proposed redundancy of the person concerned and no application has been received for payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>
      <P>If the employment of the person concerned has been terminated and she considers that she is entitled to payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum she should apply for payment to her employer using form RP 77.  If the employer gives her a redundancy certificate (form RP 2) but refuses or is unable to pay her a statutory redundancy lump sum she should complete form RP 14 and send it together with the redundancy certificate to my Department where her application will be considered for payment from the Redundancy and Employers; Insolvency Fund.</P>
      <P>However, if her employer refuses to give her a redundancy certificate and pay her, the only way that she can establish an entitlement to a payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is by appealing to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a determination of her entitlement.  Form 51A may be used in the event of such an appeal.  I will send the Deputy copies of these forms.</P>
