      <P>Following the decision by the European Council in Dublin that the interim report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Institutional Affairs should be published, arrangements for its printing <Col N="2" /> were put in hands with the Council Secretariat. It is understood that printed copies will be available towards the end of this month when I shall certainly let each Member of the Dáil and Seanad have a copy.  In the meantime, copies have been placed in the Library where Members can consult them.</P>

      <P>Arising from the reply and the matters involved in what is called the Dooge Report, will the Taoiseach make to the House a clear and unambiguous statement that Irish neutrality is a basic principle of Irish foreign policy and is not for sale by the Taoiseach, Senator <Col N="3" /> Dooge, the Minister for Defence, or any other Minister of the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the question comes from a Deputy who, during the debate in 1981 when the Leader of the Opposition set out their policy on neutrality, said that in the referendum our people endorsed the decision to enter Europe and to participate in defence commitments after the achievement of political integration.  The House should at least know the point of view of the Deputy who asked the question.  With regard to the report, as the Deputy will be aware, Senator Dooge has put down a disagreement on the sections of the report dealing with defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the fact that the Minister for Defence has publicly expressed <Col N="4" /> views on Irish neutrality which are at variance with the Government's policy on neutrality, he will exercise his powers to move Deputy Cooney from the office of Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that Ministers of his Government can speak publicly on matters of policy in their personal capacities?  Is he satisfied that this should take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied with the answers my Ministers give to questions put to them.  The Minister in question made very clear the policy of the Government as set out in our Joint Programme and our commitment to a policy to maintain Ireland's neutral position outside military alliances which the Government have no intention of altering or weakening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the statement issued by the Minister he was not speaking for the Government and that he said that he was not speaking for the Government?  He was speaking for Fine Gael apparently, and in his personal capacity.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is highly dangerous to the national interest for the Minister for Defence in particular to hold views which are totally at variance with those of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister answered a question and stated the Government's position clearly.  He also indicated the position of the Fine Gael Party.  The Leader of the Opposition indicated the position of the Fianna Fáil Party in his formal statement on neutrality on March 11, 1981.  He said that being a member of the Community we would naturally be interested in the defence of the territories embraced by the Communities.  There is no question of neutrality there.  He said: &ldquo;In the event of the European states being organised into a full political union, we would accept the obligations, even if <Col N="5" /> these included defence.  We could not, and would not, wish to opt out of the obligations and aims inherent in the achievement of the ideal of European unity.&rdquo;  That was the position of the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying the Tánaiste was wrong in saying that the Minister did not speak on behalf of the Government, that he was not expressing Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the Minister made a statement on behalf of the Government.  When asked about the position of the Fine Gael Party he stated the position of the Fine Gael Party as the Leader of the Opposition indicated the position of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Each party has its own position.  As the Government, we have a joint agreed position which is set out in our Programme for Government, to which both parties are committed and which covers the lifetime of this Government and, as far as I can see, will cover the lifetimes of many Governments to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this issue it is important that we have absolute clarity.  Will the Taoiseach not agree that he and his Government are not helping the Irish public to achieve any degree of clarity on this matter when the Tánaiste publicly has to rebuke the Minister for Defence and reject what he said about Irish neutrality? At the same time a Fine Gael backbencher, Deputy McCartin, is continually making statements inspired by a certain wing of the Fine Gael Party along the same lines as the statement by the Minister for Defence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the Government is perfectly clear.  One newspaper misquoted Deputy Cooney in regard to one remark he made as relating to the position of the Government.  The <Col N="6" /> Tánaiste quite correctly clarified that.  I authorised that that clarification should be endorsed if necessary by me.  The position of the Government is perfectly and abundantly clear.  No attempt by the other side of the House through statements on neutrality will alter the position of the Government.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Defence also said there is some commercial value in being neutral and that it helps Irish trading interests in the Middle East and Africa?  Does he agree that it is degrading and belittling the country to assert that we are neutral for purely commercial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, arising from reports that emigration has again commenced at a <Col N="7" /> substantial rate, the Central Statistics Office is taking any steps to monitor the flow of people from the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): The Central Statistics Office have advised me that their best estimate of emigration in the period April 1981 to April 1984 is an average of 6,000 a year. Again their advice is that the best estimate suggests that emigration in the year to April 1984 was less than in the year to April 1983.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the national plan a group of population experts, drawn from inside and outside the Civil Service, was set up to advise on population forecasts over the plan period.  Their advice was that emigration in the years 1981 to 1986 would be on average in the range 5,000 to 10,000 a year.</P>
      <P>In the light of this I must reject the Deputy's contention that emigration has commenced at a substantial rate.  Clearly the Government are not happy that there is emigration.  Before, and in the national plan they brought in special measures such as the social employment scheme, the enterprise allowance scheme and the alternance training scheme to reduce the pressure on anybody towards emigration.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office have further advised me that statistics relating to international migration are generally derived from records based on administrative controls or procedures governing the movements of persons across national boundaries.  No such administrative controls which could provide a measure of emigration exist for movement between this country and Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office are in contact on a regular basis with their opposite numbers in Britain to establish the possibilities of using, for example, social security information to estimate emigration to mainland Britain.  To date they tell me the results are disappointing. Again the Central Statistics Office tell me that the numbers contacting various Irish societies and Irish centres in Britain were <Col N="8" /> quite small and would be a very inadequate basis for measuring emigration.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office have told me that they are re-examining the possibility of deriving reliable estimates of emigration from sample inquiries of passenger movement by sea and air.  The essential problem with this approach is that the Central Statistics Office are attempting through any sample inquiry to catch the very small permanent inward and outward flows from the total passenger movement by sea and air of six million per year.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office tell me that they are exploring all other possibilities for reliable measures of migration. In particular, they are including a new question in the annual sample labour force survey for 1985 to obtain information on people who have emigrated in the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply.  Is he satisfied about the accuracy of the figures coming from the CSO, having regard to the errors made in past years?  Is he satisfied with the methods used to produce the figures?  When will the next census be held?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I am quite satisfied that the CSO are doing everything possible to try to get proper figures which will be of benefit to everybody. All other steps possible will be taken to try to get correct estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm or deny that the latest approximate figures available in the CSO are nearer to 30,000 people for 1984 and that the figures which he has read out are the figures they have from official returns which do not take into account people who left the country in 1984 for the <Col N="9" /> United States, the Middle East and several other regions throughout the world? Does he agree that the figures do not include those who left on travel and temporary visas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire) Mr. Barrett (Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): Anybody who left on a travel visa naturally would not be taken into account in these figures because he would not be emigrating. The best figures available show that emigration between 1981 and 1984 was at an average of 6,000 per year.  The best estimate shows that the figure for emigration in 1984 was less than for 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was Minister of State with responsibility for the CSO, and I know, and the Minister should confirm for the House, that the official figures include all those who officially emigrate, but today people are leaving with temporary visas and holiday and travel visas. The Minister should have included these figures which, I believe, Government officials have put at 30,000 for last year.</P>

Is he aware that those young people are working illegally in the US and are therefore not protected in the event of accidents, injuries or bad health, and are putting themselves at very great <Col N="10" /> risk?  What interest are the Government taking in protecting those young people in the event of misfortune befalling them?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the steps his Department have taken to ensure that adequate Irish technology is available for the development of our oil exploration programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the highly speculative nature of oil exploration and the enormous costs involved, Government policy is to encourage the major oil companies to take up exploration licences onshore and offshore Ireland and to commit the necessary financial and technical resources to the search for hydrocarbons, rather than to promote the diversion of scarce Irish resources to such exploration.  This policy has worked well in practice and it is not proposed to change it.  The offshore licensing terms provide that oil companies engaged in exploration shall use goods and services of Irish origin in their activities, as far as they are competitive in regard to quality, service, delivery period and price, and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards monitor the performance of the companies to ensure that they comply with this requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding technology for production, as distinct from exploration, the position is that a considerable amount of planning has already been undertaken, using as a guideline the experience of the Kinsale Head gasfield, which was developed <Col N="15" /> between 1973 and 1978.  The IIRS have already initiated a major review of the capabilities of Irish supplies in order to achieve maximum advantage from any future development.  In addition, a survey is being carried out on the various technologies involved in particular systems of hydrocarbon development.  The IIRS have also provided for a number of specialised action programmes designed to assist Irish suppliers on specific problems which they are likely to encounter in a development situation, such as tendering for contracts and meeting the quality assurance requirements for offshore fabrication.</P>

In view of this I see no fundamental objection to the publication of the agreement we are now drawing up. Perhaps the Deputy would allow me some time to establish that there is not in fact any serious strategic or legal impediment in the way of doing this.  Even if there is an insurmountable problem in this regard, it would be my intention to enable the Deputy, as spokesman for Energy, to examine the agreement, as it would be desirable to eliminate any doubts of the kind which were expressed here in December.

      <P>I am sure the Minister can recall that towards the end of the last session we made a request to him that he consider placing this document in the Library.  That was some time ago and I would have imagined that some conclusion could have been arrived at.  If I am not to get the opportunity of looking at that document I must pursue during Question Time the various aspects of the agreement because we are not certain where we stand, particularly in regard to strategic oil stocks.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will make a statement on the discussions which have taken place with the British authorities in relation to the discharges from Sellafield nuclear plant since the recent announcement by Britain that discharges from that plant would be reduced further; and if he has insisted that discharge will be reduced to nil without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government are in regular contact with the United Kingdom authorities on all matters relating to the Sellafield plant and in particular in regard to the discharge reduction programme.  One of the most important channels of communication in this area is the Ireland/United Kingdom contact group which met in November of last year.  The next meeting of the contact group is planned to take place early this year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is the view of the Government that discharges from the Sellafield plant to the Irish Sea should be discontinued as soon as practicable, taking account of best available technology and in the meantime should be reduced to a level that is as low as reasonably achievable.  At the last meeting of the Ireland/United Kingdom contract group we strongly re-affirmed our view on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> At that meeting the United Kingdom authorities informed us of the programme of measures currently being taken at Sellafield to minimise the discharges to the Irish Sea.  These measures were outlined recently in a statement made by Mr. Jenkin, Secretary of State for the Environment, to the House of Commons on 18 December 1984.  They include the commissioning of a new effluent treatment plant by mid-1985, the introduction of a salt evaporator to reduce discharges arising from the reprocessing plant and the construction of a major new treatment plant to be in operation by 1991.  In addition a major revision of the current discharge limits is planned for later this year.  The introduction of short term discharge limits will have the effect of reducing the quantities which can be discharged at any one time as well as limiting the annual amount of discharge permitted.</P>
    <P>We will continue to be active in insisting that the discharges should be reduced to levels which are consistent with the best available technology with the objective of their ultimate elimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>From the contents of the reply it seems that the British Government are determined to continue their programme of discharging into the Irish Sea and have no intention of reducing the discharge to zero.</P>

If the authorities accept that discharges should be eliminated by any date, they are thereby admitting that they are harmful, damaging and detrimental to public health and that they should be ceased straight away.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to my question. When I suggested that that should happen the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Kavanagh, immediately rushed into the newspapers to say that I was being alarmist and foolish.  Fortunately, the British Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently bore me out and that leads me to my question.  If the British Director of Public Prosecutions can bring an action against these people&mdash; some people might call them criminals&mdash; in charge of Sellafield, is there any court, European or international, in which we could prosecute them for their criminal negligence in regard to these discharges into the Irish Sea?</P>

I explained clearly to the House that we are very concerned that <Col N="25" /> there should be nothing less than top class management at Sellafield.  I did not at any stage say that the policy of the British Government was to cease discharges from Sellafield &mdash; that is a figment of Deputy Haughey's imagination.  We are seeking to have discharges from Sellafield reduced to zero and we shall continue to press for that.  As regards the possibility of taking a law case in a forum other than in the British courts, I will have that matter examined and let the Deputy know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if Ireland's aid to the Third World will be increased to 0.7 per cent of GNP in line with the United Nations target; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions 15 and 16 together.  I am satisfied that the allocations for Ireland's programme of official development assistance over the last ten years have <Col N="31" /> been generous in the circumstances obtaining.  The financial provision for this purpose increased from £1.5 million in 1974 to £33.8 million in 1984.  This is equivalent to about a fivefold increase in real terms.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, official development assistance grew from 0.05 per cent to 0.23 per cent over the same period.  Thus we are now one-third of the way towards achieving the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as official development assistance whereas in 1974 we provided only one-fourteenth of the target level.</P>
      <P>These are satisfactory rates of growth against a background of ten exceptionally difficult years for the Irish economy and public finances.  Moreover, it is guaranteed that this rate of growth will be maintained over the coming three years in accordance with the provisions of the national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>.  On this basis, official development assistance will reach 0.275 per cent of GNP, or about £50 million, in 1987. The framework for planning provided by this undertaking facilitates effective implementation of the programmes concerned. Moreover, the House can be assured that against the background of the present crisis in Africa and the very generous response to it of the Irish public the Government will continue to strive to further increase their aid programmes in the future with a view to achieving the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as ODA as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in view of the fact that there is devastation and hunger in Ethiopia and the sub-Saharan Continent it is a sad day's work that the Government have reduced their commitment to alleviate world hunger from the original amount agreed in the Programme for Government between Labour and Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not abandoned our programme.  Given the very difficult financial position we have, our performance compared to other countries has been very good over the last ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people dying of hunger a short plane journey away from this country.  It is my understanding that the Labour and Fine Gael Parties entered into an agreement but the amount has now been reduced in the plan <i>Building on Reality</i>.  Will the Minister consider introducing a Supplementary Estimate in view of the generous response given voluntarily by the public at large?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the fact that people in many parts of the world are suffering from hunger and that the assistance voted by this House and given generously and voluntarily by the public makes a contribution towards alleviating that distressful condition.  In the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> there is a commitment built in by the Government to give almost a 50 per cent increase over three years.  If the Deputy looks around Europe and at wealthier countries he will not find that matched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that given the terrible poverty and hunger particularly among children in the sub-Saharan Continent it would be very difficult for us to ask other countries to set targets when we are not prepared to meet the targets we originally set ourselves and when the Government are not prepared to keep up with the voluntary target set by the public at large?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that. The Taoiseach did not find the slightest difficulty at the Summit held here in December in asking other Governments to make a special contribution towards the famine in Ethiopia.  I am certain that such a request from this country would be listened to and agreed to again because by European and world standards our record is extremely good.  We have no apology to make to anyone.  I should like to see us reaching our target of 0.7 per cent as soon as possible.  The fact that we have written into the plan an increase over the next three years which is way above any projected levels of inflation is <Col N="33" /> something we should be proud of and not something we should denigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state the Government's policy in regard to the UN target of providing aid equivalent to 0.7 per cent of GNP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the target we hope to achieve and we are determined to achieve it over a period of time.  We will be increasing our contribution threefold in the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must accept that the provision made in <i>Building on Reality</i> did not provide for an increase in aid to the Third World to meet the UN target.  The Minister must agree that the Government reneged on that target when they committed themselves to provide a lesser sum than the UN target over the period of the three remaining years that this Government claim they have in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  As I said in reply to the original question, the target of 0.7 still stands and I think that is what any party who might be in Government would wish to achieve. What we have written into our plan is a very ambitious movement towards achieving that target.  Our record in this regard is that each year, with the exception of one year, there has been a growth in the amount of aid under this heading in the various budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that because of the vast amounts the people have contributed voluntarily, they have indicated clearly their desire to aid the struggling peoples in the Third World especially in those places where starvation is being experienced? Surely the Government should respond to the wishes of the Irish people in this matter. <Col N="34" /> The people expect the Government to live up to the commitment they have made as a member of the UN and to reflect the concern expressed by the people for those who are starving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, is to amend the European Communities Act, 1972, so as to make as part of the domestic law of this State the treaty which amends as regards Greenland the treaties establishing the European Communities.  This treaty, which has been laid before Dáil Éireann, was signed by all member states of the European Communities on 12 March 1984.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that Greenland, a part of the Danish Realm, joined the European Communities in 1973.  The result of a referendum held in February 1982 &mdash; by which time Greenland had been granted home rule status within the Kingdom of Denmark &mdash; was that a majority of the island's population favoured Greenland withdrawing from the Community.</P>
      <P>The treaty between the Community and Greenland provides for Greenland's withdrawal from the European Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.  A protocol to the treaty provides that, once the treaty comes into force, Greenland will be associated with the Community, having the status of an Overseas Country and Territory.  As an Overseas Country and Territory, Greenland will be entitled to certain preferential access to Community markets.  In addition to the benefits conferred on it by its status as on OCT, the protocol to the treaty also provides that Greenland shall be granted free access to Community markets for its fisheries products.  This is particularly important for Greenland given that fish is one of its few natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been intended that the Greenland treaty would enter into force on 1 January 1985.  However, the treaty provided that, if all the instructions of ratification of member states had not been <Col N="236" /> deposited by that date, the treaty would enter into force on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification of the last Signatory State to take this step.</P>
    <P>In order to cover the possibility that national ratification procedures might not have been completed by the end of December, it was proposed that an interim regime governing the relations between the Community and Greenland should be put in place, pending the entry into force of the treaty.  Under this arrangement, Greenland, while remaining, <i>dejure</i>, part of the Community for a short time, would have been treated, for practical purposes, as if it had withdrawn from the Community.</P>

      <P>The entry into force of the treaty on the 1 January 1985 was, of course, the option preferred by the Danish Government and the Greenland Home Rule Authorities; but I understand that the short-term interim regime would have been generally acceptable, pending the coming into force of the treaty. Unfortunately, however, when the issue was considered in the last days of 1984, agreement was not possible among the member states of the community to the <Col N="237" /> putting in place of these interim measures.</P>
      <P>As far as our national ratification procedures are concerned, I had hoped that the Bill which is before the House today could have been passed by both Houses of the Oireactas and promulgated as law before the end of December 1984. Reflecting our commitment to minimising the delay in completing the ratification procedures, the Bill before the House today was introduced and passed by Seanad Éireann on 19 December 1984.</P>
      <P>The European Communities (Amendment) Bill 1984 will translate into the domestic law of this State the clearly expressed desire of the Greenland Home Rule Authorities to withdraw from the European Communities.  Their wish is that this should be realised as soon as possible.  Therefore, I am confident that Deputies will be able to give the Bill their full support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a necessary piece of national legislation to comply legally with what has already been agreed upon by the Council of Ministers and the Community generally.  However, what is rather perturbing so far as concerns the conduct of affairs by the Government, and in particular the conduct of affairs in Europe while occupying the Presidency, is that we are the country responsible for not allowing the new regime agreed on to come into effect from 1 January 1985. The withdrawal of Greenland from the Community and the setting up of a new association of relationship had been agreed by the Community but the new regime could not come into effect on 1 January because we did not order our business in this House in a proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government carry the responsibility for not bringing this legislation before the House in the last session. During our period of Presidency we were the only country in the Community that did not bring in the necessary national legislation to give effect to a Community decision.  In showing that kind of incompetence we incurred disagreeable comment within the Community, reflecting <Col N="238" /> on the capacity and ability of Ireland to hold down the Presidency in a proper way.  We also caused considerable trouble to a small and friendly country in the Community, namely, Denmark.</P>
    <P>All in all we have here an example of incompetence.  A small country can show its competence in the Community in the handling of its affairs, particularly when occupying the Presidency, as we did during the latter part of last year.  By not introducing the legislation in time to have it passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and due to our incompetent handling of the Presidency, we have caused considerable difficulty and annoyance and we have impeded the introduction of an agreed Community measure which cannot be implemented until this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Of course we support the passage of the Bill.  There is no fundamental opposition as far as we are concerned but certain points will be raised by other Fianna Fáil Deputies during the course of the debate, particularly concerning fish imports from Greenland.  However, I wish to concentrate on this single aspect of inefficiency and incompetence on the part of the Government and which is doing them no good.  I do not mind that in itself but I object when it is doing the country no good.  The ineptitude, inefficiency and incompetence that has been displayed is quite the reverse of the way a small country should proceed in the Community.  A small country must concentrate on being efficient and effective and must show an example in that respect.  In that way a small country such as Ireland can command respect from other member states and from the institutions of the Community.</P>
    <P>The malfunctioning of the Government in this respect has caused much adverse comment in the Community.  I have read it in the various Community journals such as <i>Agence</i> and other journals. Every other country had passed its domestic legislation well before 31 December.  The overall decision taken by the Council of Ministers and by the Community to allow for this quasi-separation of Greenland from the Community, <Col N="239" /> to remove it from full membership and put it into the association category, was put to the various Parliaments all of whom passed their legislation before 31 December to enable the regime to commence on 1 January.  The only country that stuck out like a sore thumb was the country occupying the Presidency at that time, namely, Ireland.  This was due to the inefficient and ineffective handling of our business in the Community.</P>
    <P>It is very much our business that we handle matters effectively and efficiently and many people here may not realise that.  This matter was not of great and direct concern to Ireland but the ineptitude of the handling of the matter by the Government put us in a bad light diplomatically and affected the image and reputation of this country in the Community.  I hope it will not happen again.  The Minister in his reply should be honest enough to deal with the matter. He should admit that a very grave error was made.  He should not try to slide over the matter, as he did in his opening remarks when he did not refer to it.  What I have said is the truth and the Minister is well aware of that.  He should apologise to the House, to the Community and to the Danish Government for the Government's incompetence and ineptitude in this matter.  He should make it plain that other matters of far greater importance will not be handled with equal ineptitude during 1985 and he should make a resolution for this year to that effect.</P>
    <P>This is only one part of the general picture of ineptitude and incompetence that has characterised this Government's handling of Community matters, not just during our Presidency but also during the agricultural price negotiations last year.  Very grave errors of computation were made which have now emerged and they considerably distort the case presented by Ireland in regard to the levy and other price arrangements made by the Government within the context of the annual agricultural price review in 1984.  Therefore, I would like to conclude on the note that it is <Col N="240" /> all important that above all else a small country must handle its affairs competently and effectively and this Government on any criterion in this matter we are discussing today show very serious incompetence, as they have shown in other areas such as the agricultural price negotiations to which I have referred. Other than that there is no objection to the various Stages being taken here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Greenland are taking this step, will they be accorded favourable status outside the EC and, if so, on what terms?  It seems to me that a number of countries have a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; each way, particularly former colonial countries which have a traditional relationship with Britain, and while they cannot join the EC because they are so far away, or do not wish to join the EC, they have a favourable trading status and we must compete with that favourable trading status, as a member of the EC, particularly in dairying. Is favourable status to be given to Greenland and, if so, on what basis and why?  Is it permissible for Greenland to have the benefits of coming out as they may be for that country and yet to have favourable status from within if they are to have favourable status?</P>
      <P>I see the words &ldquo;fishing&rdquo; and &ldquo;maritime production&rdquo; printed here in heavy letters.  I presume that this will not put our fishing and maritime production in difficulty, that it will not cause any unfair competition for them if this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am not sure what the population of Greenland is.  I do not think it is great.  Will it affect the representation of the Danish group within the European Parliament?  If this population number is significant what will be the situation of Greenland's representative <Col N="241" /> in the European Parliament?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that in this reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>While this may not be earth-shattering legislation, nevertheless it is sad that the Governments of the Ten were obliged to introduce such legislation. Greenland joined with Denmark and ourselves in 1973.  I am sure that they, like the Irish people, looked forward to great things as members of the EC, but in Greenland's case when they got their opportunity and their freedom they had a referendum and decided to withdraw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am prompted to speak in this debate on this legislation is because of the way things are developing in recent weeks in so far as our membership of the EC is concerned.  The time has come for us in this House and for the Government of the day to give some consideration to preferential access rather than total membership.  We all recall that many of us, in fact probably all people who are representatives in this House at this minute, went all over the highways and byways encouraging the people to support a referendum to join the EC, rightly so at the time from what we were told would be the case.  We were told that under the CAP we would have free access to all markets, unlimited supply, guaranteed prices, etc.  We were told that we would have a huge, expanding Regional Fund which would transfer the resources of Germany, France and England right through Ireland, including Dublin.  We were told also that social policies would be developed that would leave social schemes in operation here the likes of which we would never dream of.  Of course, recently in regard to our fisheries we were told that we would be protected. Also we were told that because of competition for more efficient and more greatly experienced manufacturers there would be some job losses in the manufacturing sectors here, and that has been the case. Tens of thousands of jobs were lost in many sectors of this economy.  While we have had some benefits, many under the CAP and some under the Regional and Social Funds, they are nothing like what <Col N="242" /> the people of Ireland were led to believe 12 years ago.</P>
    <P>If, as I have said, we are going to witness over the next two years the kind of policy decision that has been taken in the last two years, then the time has come for us to consider very seriously whether we are best served as full members of the EC.  We joined basically because of the benefits of the CAP, because for the first time after being plundered for 700 years by our neighbours we had now free access to a world market at guaranteed prices for our major industry, the agricultural sector.  We have seen what has happened to that in recent months.  We have seen levies imposed on excess production while at the same time our farmers have not had the opportunity of getting to the level of production, or anywhere near it, of our partners in Europe.  That is discriminatory, wrong, and the Irish people will not tolerate it for long.</P>
    <P>As far as the regional policy is concerned, we were told in 1973 that it would be a massive help to all of the developments that we could not afford to do ourselves.  What is happening now?  Of the Regional Fund 25 or 30 per cent goes to England and 36 per cent goes to Germany, the wealthy countries of the EC. What comes to Ireland?  About 5.5 to 6 per cent.  I am not blaming any Government for that or taking the opportunity to have something to say about Deputy Barry or his Government.  I am posing the question to all of us who are honoured to represent the people of this island now because another island of small population has felt obliged to vote to come away from the EC, and matters are heading in that direction as far as we are concerned. While all of this is happening and decisions are being taken that are adverse to the people of Ireland and particularly to the economy of Ireland, day by day our contribution to the EC budget is increasing massively.  Three or four short years ago it was less than £50 million or £60 million.  I am sure it is in the hundreds of millions now.  I am not asking the Minister to give a figure in that area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while on the one hand many of the dreams of 1973 have not been <Col N="243" /> realised or even come close to being realised and the horizon on the reality is very much dimmed at present, now we find ourselves contributing so much more than we ever expected.  Most tragic of all, we find that many of the traditional employment outlets in this country now no longer exist here.  We have suffered all the consequences that we knew would ensue and that we said to the people in 1973 would happen, without the advantages that we were told would accrue.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is sad legislation.  On the one hand, we have two major countries joining the EC and on the other hand an island with, a population smaller than our own, is deciding to leave.  That is why I took the opportunity not in any way to criticise Governments or the present Government, but to sound a note of warning because such a country has decided on this action and it may not be too long before we have to put the same question to our people in a referendum, as to whether they would like to continue on as at present or be just associate members of the EC.  We see day in and day out the many advantages promised to us being taken away or undermined.  We are not there with a begging bowl looking for what we are not entitled to.  We are there to play our part as Irish men and women in the European context because we are part of what we are told is a European economic community the philosophy and policy of which were to transfer the wealth and resources of major states to the poorer regions so as to have equalisation with the number of countries making up the Community.  The reverse of that has happened.  I am taking this opportunity to raise the flag with regard to this issue, which will be a very live one in the months and years ahead so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>We fully support this legislation, but are sad that Greenland has decided to withdraw.  I pray that this will not come about as far as Ireland is concerned.  I sound the note of warning that, if there are not massive improvements on the policy decisions which have been taken in recent times, that question will have <Col N="244" /> to be raised, and raised very seriously here.  If we are not given the rights to which we are entitled as members of the European Community, on the periphery of Europe &mdash; an island community at the very end of Europe &mdash; this question will have to be raised.  I hope that it will not come to that and that whoever speaks on our behalf at ministerial or government level &mdash; and I am honoured to be a member of the European Parliament &mdash; will highlight these very important problems and use this opportunity, when another island has seen fit to withdraw, to let our partners in Europe know that we are not happy with developments in the last 12 years.  We are prepared to battle on and play our part, but we want at least equal opportunity.  That is all that Irish men and women want &mdash; the same opportunities as their counterparts in France, Germany, the United Kingdom or any other part of the Community.  I hope all of us involved in comment on the European Economic Community will raise every opportunity to highlight the difficulties which will present themselves to us in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I feel that it is regrettable that this Bill should be before the House.  It is to some extent an indication of the failure of the member governments to convience Greenland that it should stay within the Community.  This must be a major embarrassment for the governments of the Community at a time when negotiations are taking place for enlargement of the Community.  It is also an indication of a growing disillusionment on the part of many people with regard to the Community and the way it is performing. The poor turnout in our recent European elections indicated that here there is a certain amount of disillusionment and dissatisfaction with the manner in which matters are shaping up within the Community.  The one lesson to be learned from the decision of Greenland to leave the Community must be brought home to the governments of the Community at a time when they are planning expansion and enlargement &mdash; that there <Col N="245" /> must be a greater commitment to resolving the major problems within that Community.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that we should have had to wait so long for this Bill, a delay which caused a certain amount of embarrassment because of the ineptitude of the Government in not introducing this legislation sooner, when the decision by the people of Greenland had been made to withdraw.  I regret that the Minister for Fisheries is not present.  I should like some indication from him, in particular, as to the serious implications for our fishing industry of this new arrangement. I am particularly concerned about the salmon fisheries.  As many of the Deputies know, it has been the experience that most of the salmon feeding grounds are off Greenland, the Faroes and in that general area.  It was through the goodwill and organisation of the Community that it was possible to make arrangements with Greenland and the Faroes to restrict salmon fishing which was damaging our stocks to an unprecedented degree.</P>
      <P>It has been established that because of recent developments in salmon fishing in the Greenland and Faroes area enormous damage was done to salmon stocks and that such damage will be done in the future.  It was possible, with Greenland part of the Community, to arrive at a regime by which salmon fishing, which is a relatively recent development in that area, was curtailed to a certain extent during our membership of the Community. We had hoped to further restrict salmon fishing in that area, which would be to the betterment of our salmon stocks, which are in a very critical state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Greenland is leaving the North Atlantic Salmon Convention Organisation. He will be aware that within that organisation some of the detailed negotiations in relation to conservation of salmon stocks between the Canadians, the Greenlanders, the Faroese and the Community themselves are worked out. I ask if, in leaving the Community, Greenland is planning also to leave the North Atlantic Salmon Convention Organisation.  That would be very serious <Col N="246" /> for us and a matter which should be taken up almost immediately by the Minister for Fisheries within the European Community.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear also from the Minister for Fisheries in what way the duty free access which is now an advantage to Greenland will affect our market situation here, bearing in mind that our fish market is in a chaotic situation at present, with hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of fish having been dumped in the first few weeks of this year off the south west coast in the Celtic Sea because of the unavailability of markets. Greenland now has access to markets and would appear not to have the same responsibility with regard to compliance with Community policies in relation to conservation and regulations on fish management in general.  These are just a few of the matters on which we need clarification. The situation is now critical in our fishing industry, with the threat of Spanish accession to the Community and the likely damage therefrom.  Unless our fishing industry is to be totally wiped out, we need to ensure that the new arrangements with regard to Greenland, bearing in mind in particular that country's very close association and agreements with Denmark, will not be to our detriment. I am sure that this matter is being watched by the German Government who have a very deep interest in this area also. We need to be vigilant in the Community to ensure that no further damage is done to our markets by the new arrangement because our market situation is at present in crisis.  Even now I am more concerned about our salmon stocks.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some indication here this afternoon, or if not at least to communicate with us later, whether once Greenland leaves the Community we will be in a position to have some supervision and control either through contact with the Community or the North Atlantic Salmon Convention Organisation to ensure there will not be irreparable damage done to our salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we should now be talking of countries leaving the Community at a time when consolidation within <Col N="247" /> the Community is needed, when there is need for resolution on the part of all member governments to tackle the serious problems obtaining within the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear the comments of Deputy Ray MacSharry, a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party representing this country in Europe and a member of a party who campaigned for and advocated most strongly the entry of this country into the European Community, express here today his reservations about the results of our accession and the position we now find ourselves in as a member of that Community.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a party and was personally involved in campaigning against the accession of this country to the EC.  As the years have rolled on since then I have increasingly come to the conclusion that the view the Labour Party took of our intended accession at that time was the correct one, that as an economic entity, as a country endeavouring to provide the best possible standard of living for its citizens, as we stand today we would have been better off had we never acceded to the EC.  For us it has turned out to be a disappointment in so many respects, a sentiment for the first time echoed here today by Deputy MacSharry. I was pleased to note that perhaps at long last the doubts and forebodings we expressed and the forecasts we gave at that time are beginning to be seen and recognised for what they are.  We were told this would be the great bonanza, for this country to enter the EC, a great bonanza in the first instance for our farming community.  For the first couple of years the farming community did well but that was not long lasting.  The sheen soon disappeared and we find now that the anticipated permanent bonanza for the farming community, which formed the major argument in favour of our accession, has disappeared, receded by the wayside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has become of our industries as a result of our accession to the EC?  For example, we have many skilled and <Col N="248" /> experienced motor car assemblers with a long tradition in that trade.  They no longer assemble motor cars.  We have paper makers of skill, with traditions for generations, who no longer manufacture paper.  In every one of those industries we have skilled people on the dole queues.  The fact is unavoidable, that our traditional industries have been very largely decimated, in all probability never to return as a result of the dumping of materials, mass-produced by wealthier countries than ours, with massive production facilities and with whom we as a small country cannot possibly hope to compete.</P>
    <P>We have seen the prospects referred to by Deputy Daly.  I agree with his concerns and fears about our fishing industry, another likely to be decimated, with serious inroads made into it as a result of the vital raw material of this country being so adversely affected by these powerfully geared-up trawlers and fishing interests from Europe.  The whole artificial set-up that the EC involves has proved a disaster for this country.  It is not a matter that we would have to cease trading with the EC countries if we were not a member.  It was argued that the whole of our trade would dissipate, that we could not trade with the vital European market unless we were a member of that Community.  Over the years that has proven to be an utter nonsense.  We have seen that countries who opted to remain out have experienced no problem at all in negotiating trading agreements with the EC from the outside and that they have done very well out of them. European countries and others further afield than the Middle East who are not members have experienced no problem trading with France, Germany and other countries.  We could have done the same.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage the feelings of our people and the disappointment felt about so many aspects of our economic life should be made known to our fellow members in Europe.  We should be pressing for a renegotiation of our position so that our industries can be maintained or perhaps reconstituted.  In carrying on any economic activity it is a great benefit to <Col N="249" /> be in control of one's affairs.  That independent position, traditionally ours until the Treaty of Accession, has been bargained away.  This means that the regulations with regard to what we can import, sell, how we sell it, what we control and how we manufacture, those rules and regulations come down to us now from Brussels and Strasbourg.  These decisions are taken in the light of large interests, big, multinational interests.  We cannot control, we are a very small fish in Europe in a very big pond and its results are manifest.  Its results are plain in our country, in the constantly rising unemployment figures, in the fact that so many of our traditional industries have gone to the wall and which could and should have been preserved.</P>
    <P>If a referendum were held today as far as the EC is concerned, I wonder what would be the result.  I would venture to suggest that its result and the comment of our people today on what has happened to us since our accession would be very different from what it was when the original referendum was held.  The whole exercise has proven to be a disappointment to our people and has done us intense damage.  We are now in that organisation but one can still get out, as the Bill before the House now shows.  I do not know to what extent our reservations or concerns about what is happening are pressed in European circles, whether they fall on deaf ears, to what extent they may fall on deaf ears, to what extent they are interested in a small nation, weak economically, on the periphery of the great power bases, the great economic population centres of the Ruhr, France, Germany, Northern Italy and so on.  The fact that the Greenland position has been shown up can be pointed to as an indication that small countries have their rights. We have our responsibilities to our population, our industries, to renegotiate the Treaty.  That can and must achieve benefits for us under the existing Treaty situation which is proving to be an increasing disaster for our country and its people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting <Col N="250" /> debate.  I do not mean to insult Deputy Lenihan in saying I shall not reply to the points he raised because they were just political points.  He felt he had to make them.  He made a ten minute speech on the basis of a three weeks delay in a ten year period, which is not really serious, and was unworthy of him.  He would have been far better off to have followed the line taken by Deputies Daly and MacSharry, and indeed to a certain extent by Deputy Taylor.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacSharry started off by saying, and Deputy Daly reiterated, that this was a sad Bill.  There is a little truth in that, but they greatly exaggerated the position.  It is pity that Greenland as a result of a referendum held there took a decision to leave the Community.  But they are not, in the sense that we understood it, European.  They are totally different culturally.  As a race they are a long distance away from the centre of the Community.  They are totally dependent on one commodity.  They are totally different from other European countries. However, I take the point made by Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Daly that it is sad that any body of people should decide to leave the Community.  But to continue then, as did Deputy MacSharry &mdash; and Deputy Taylor also took up the point &mdash; to question our membership of the Community on the basis of Greenland leaving is perhaps something we needed to debate in this House.  I do not know how representative Deputy MacSharry is of the thinking in his party.  To give him his due, Deputy Taylor adopted the same line his party adopted almost 13 years ago now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy MacSharry is representative of a body of opinion in the Fianna Fáil Party we need a debate about our continuing membership of the European Community.  I have no doubt about where my party stand.  I know that 100 per cent of the membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas elected on the Fine Gael ticket are for continued membership. Nobody disputes the fact that there were problems.  We knew when we joined that there would be problems.  In <Col N="251" /> the year just ended, the net transfer into this country was £650 million as a result of our membership.  That was the benefit in money terms.</P>
    <P>Against that Deputy Taylor would write off the job losses in industry and, with some justification, Deputy MacSharry would point out that we did not have 100 per cent fulfilment of what we thought was possible under the Common Agricultural Policy and the Regional Fund.  We did extremely well under the Social Fund.  The disappointment has been in our industries.  We were behind protective barriers.  Before we joined we were in the process of lowering those barriers.  We had signed a trade agreement with our nearest neighbour, at that time our biggest market.  We were lowering those barriers and the advantage in the home market was being diluted.  Since only two countries were involved we would have had the option of raising them again.</P>
    <P>We have lost jobs in industry for other reasons apart from our membership of the EC.  In many instances we have new industries which are orientated towards exporting to the Common Market.  We have attracted capital from Japan and America.  We now have industries with a potential to export all over the world.  If we look at our exports over the past five years, that fact is amply underlined and borne out.  The quality of the industries which replaced the industries that died is far superior.  They are far more capable of holding their place in the very difficult, harsh and competitive markets to which we have to sell if we want to stay in business.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point of which Deputy Taylor is losing sight.  We cannot hope to support our population at its present level and with the number of young people coming out of school &mdash; far more than in any other country in Europe &mdash; unless we have competitive industries exporting goods to Europe.  We have a huge advantage in the European Community. We have highly trained, well educated young people.  They are not available in Germany or in many other <Col N="252" /> countries.  These markets would not be available to us in future if we were not a member of the Community.  We must attract capital from countries outside the Community to establish further industries here.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry spoke about agriculture and our experience in the past few years.  The original Common Agricultural Policy was intended to ensure self-sufficiency in food in the Community. We joined on the presumption that we could contribute towards achieving that self-sufficiency and that we would derive benefit from our competitively advantageous position in the dairy sector. We have done that.  Despite some disappointments in the past few years about the introduction of the super-levy and price increases which were considered inadequate, every farmer is significantly better off now in real terms than he was 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly referred to the problem about our fisheries.  If there was not protection for Irish markets inside the Community, what condition would our fishing industry be in now?  We could not afford to buy the necessary vessels to protect our waters.  More than any other country in Europe we have far the greatest proportion of water to land.  How could we protect those water outside the Community? With a Common Fisheries Policy we can control the fishing in those waters. We would have no chance of doing that if we were outside the Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Taylor questioned our membership of the Common Market.  Deputy Daly had some thoughts about it as well.  Perhaps it is time we had a debate in this House on whether we want to continue to be a member of the EC.  I remember the referendum very clearly.  When we campaigned in 1972 we were not talking merely about advantages in money terms.  We were talking about political advantage.  We were talking about jumping out of the shadow of a very powerful economic and political neighbour and about taking our place in the heart of Europe.  I believe we have done that.</P>
    <P>I would regret it very much if there was <Col N="253" /> a movement away from that position.  We have not got all we wanted.  There is more to come.  We suffered a trauma because of the recession and the oil crisis after the 1973 upsurge in OPEC prices.  That had an effect on countries and the citizens of those countries.  In the past 12 months the dangers of the effects of that on the European ideal have been recognised. Over the six months of our presidency I noticed that there is now more concern about the development of the European Community as originally intended.</P>
    <P>We have come through a very shaky patch, particularly in the past five years. We are trying to get back to the path of growth, which is very important if we are to get work for the 13 million people in the Community who are now without work.  That is a frightening figure.  It is four times the population of this country. We must address ourselves to that problem and we must move towards the goal of European union for which my party and other parties worked 13 years ago.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised on the Bill before the House.  Deputy Mitchell raised the OCT status of Greenland. Community OCT status applies to countries which for cultural, economic or historic reasons have links with a Community member state.  Countries with this status have preferential tarifffree access to Community markets for their exports and normally receive aid from the European Development Fund and European Investment Bank &ldquo;soft&rdquo; loans.  As a developed country, relatively, Greenland will not receive aid from the EDF and EIB, though it will have access to EC markets for its fishery products provided that Community fishing vessels will continue to have access to Greenland's waters under the terms of fisheries agreements.  Deputy Daly wanted to know about North Atlantic salmon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was some concern when Greenland's withdrawal was being negotiated.  There was the point that Greenland should no longer be bound by international conventions for the conservation of salmon in the North Atlantic &mdash; that was part of the FCO agreement.  This would have the consequence of affecting salmon stocks in Ireland because of fishing in Greenland waters.  However, arrangements have been made for Greenland to accede to the convention and in the meantime the Greenland authorities have agreed to regulate salmon fishing as if they were bound by the convention.  I thank the House for its response to the Bill.  We may have a chance in the near future to come back on these matters.</P>

      <P>I want some clarification, particularly in relation to Greenland's free access to Community markets. Particularly when we have great difficulty in selling our fish in Community markets, it is ludicrous that the Ministers for Fisheries and Foreign Affairs should have agreed to this.  Greenlanders have the better of both sides &mdash; they can get out <Col N="255" /> of their membership or associate membership and still have free access to EC markets which are over supplied at the moment.  This will have a big effect on the fishing industry here.  Already we are seriously affected by the Spanish acces-º sion, and we have to contend with the reduction of quotas.  Our boats can never go to Greenland to take advantage of the benefits the Minister referred to because the Community will not give grants to boats in excess of 130 feet.  In order to fish those waters we would require much larger boats, but Community regulations are preventing us from investing in such boats.  I am concerned because the Minister for Fisheries does not appear to have become sufficiently involved in this.  That Minister has not been here today to participate in the debate and I hope he will display greater interest so that the fishing industry will not be affected as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I came in late and I should like if the Minister would deal specifically with North Atlantic salmon. It is entirely a matter for the people of Greenland to decide whether to depart from the Community.  We must respect them for their decision.  Greenlanders are part of the realm of Denmark.  This gives us an opportunity &mdash; the Minister will join with me in this &mdash; to pay a tribute to the outgoing Danish Ambassador.  He has represented his country with great honour and dignity in the past seven years.  He has gone back to his homeland and it is proper that we should pay a tribute to him as an excellent representative here of his country.  His queen and Government can be proud of him for the manner in which he upheld the integrity of his nation.  He would have been the doyen of the Diplomatic Corps here if it were not for the continued incumbency of the Papal Nuncio, who remains the doyen.  As a junior Minister in the Department of Foreign Affairs I had a relatively long association with the departed Ambassador for Denmark and I express our gratitude and appreciation not only of the Ambassador's work here <Col N="256" /> but of the association between Denmark and Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the seriousness of our problem in relation to the salmon fisheries.  The Minister may not be fully familiar with the details of the arrangements for the control of salmon fishing and the agreement between the Canadians, the EC and ourselves.  It is important to know about the salmon the Greenlanders are fishing.  There have been numerous scientific reports indicating that enormous damage is being done to salmon stocks in that area.  It is important that the Minister ensures that the loose arrangements outlined this afternoon are tightened up by the Community so that salmon fishing by the Faroese and Greenlanders in that area is eliminated. Such people never had a tradition of salmon fishing there.  In the new position I believe the opposite will be the case and that is why I am anxious that this matter is brought to the notice of the Minister for Fisheries.  He should be asked to take action in that regard.</P>

      <P>Deputies David Andrews and Daly referred to the International Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic and I accept the view of Deputy Daly that I am not fully familiar with the details of it.  I undertake to bring the remarks made by the Deputies to the attention of the Minister for Fisheries.  I should like to point out that the Greenland authorities have agreed to regulate their salmon fishing as if they were bound by the convention.  Deputy Daly feels that that is a little loose.  I accept that it would be better if they were part of the convention.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Fisheries to see if we can do anything in that regard. If they are not going to have in the future <Col N="257" /> the safety net of the European Community, and they are going to be dependent on fishing, I believe they will be more conservation conscious rather than less.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher spoke about competition from Greenland.  I do not believe that they will be in direct competition because the species of fish we catch and sell in the Community is different.  However, if they were full members of the Community they could continue to increase their sales within the Community but, most likely, they will not be allowed to do that now.  They would be allowed to sell into the Community at their existing level and not at an increased level.  Therefore, there is less danger now than there was in the past.  I am sorry that the Greenlanders have decided to leave the Community.  It is a pity.  I endorse everything Deputy Andrews said about the former Ambassador from Denmark to this country.  I will be happy to convey the Deputy's remarks to him.</P>

    <P>The commission's recommendations, as set out in the report, were made after a wide-ranging investigation of the law on civil liability for animals both here and in other jurisdictions, the results of which were published in a working paper in 1977.  The working paper has provided a wealth of information about a complex and difficult area of the law.  I would like to thank the commission for the excellent work that has gone into the working paper and the final report.  These are useful, indeed indispensable, documents for anyone interested in the subject.  I hope that Deputies will have found the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill helpful in their examination of the various provisions.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that one of the main purposes of the Bill is to amend the law about the impounding of animals. Animals wandering on the roads are a serious problem and there is a clear need to strengthen the existing law so that the problem can be dealt with effectively. One of the main inadequacies in the present law is that the Act normally relied upon in impounding wandering animals, the 1851 Summary Jurisdiction Act, does not give powers of impounding to the Garda specifically and, in any case, its powers apply in relation to ownerless animals.  Therefore, I am proposing in section 4 to give the Garda specific powers to impound wandering animals, and these powers will apply even where the owner is known.  For this purpose &ldquo;animal&rdquo; is defined in section 1 as meaning a bovine animal, horse, ass or other equine animal, sheep or goat.  The powers of impounding being given to the Garda will extend not only to animals wandering on the public road but also to animals trespassing on public parks or other open spaces owned by a local authority or State authority.  Local authorities are being given parallel powers to impound animals found trespassing in these public parks or open spaces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> As well as increasing impounding powers, the Bill proposes to improve the effectiveness of the impounding procedure itself.  This it does by amending section 8 of the Pounds (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935.  At present the Minister for Justice can make regulations under this section for the sale, disposal or destruction of animals found trespassing, wandering or straying, where the owner is unknown or cannot be found.  An order of a district justice is required for any sale of an impounded animal.  Section 7 proposes to amend section 8 of the 1935 Act so that, in addition to his existing powers, the Minister will be able to make regulations to provide that the sale, disposal or destruction of impounded animals will be carried out by order of the local authority &mdash; in this case, the county or city manager &mdash; and that these powers may be applied to impounded animals where the owner is known but fails to remove them from the pound.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to increase substantially the fines for poundbreaking and for breaches of the pounds regulations provided in the 1935 Act.  These increased fines are set out in the table to section 7.  The maximum fine for poundbreaking is being increased from £50 to £750, and that for breaches of the pounds regulations from £20 to £500.  Under amendments of the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1851, also set out in the table, the maximum fine for allowing an animal to wander on the public road is going up from a nominal 10p to £150 for the first offence and £350 for a subsequent offence. These fines will also apply to the offence of turning animals loose on the road, where the present fine is only 50p. The present level of fines has remained unchanged since 1851.</P>
    <P>I also intend to review the basis on which pound fees are calculated.  These fees are fixed periodically by orders under the Pounds Act, 1935.  The last order was made in July 1984.  I will not go down through the list of fees now but Deputies may be interested to know that they include fees of £13.20 for horses and £4.05 for cows in respect of each 24 hours <Col N="260" /> or shorter period.  The present fees do not adequately reflect the costs of impounding and, while no decision has yet been made on what the new scale of fees should be, I do envisage a substantial increase on the present level so that they will more closely reflect the actual cost of impounding to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined will have a major impact on the problems and dangers created by wandering animals.  The increased impounding powers, together with greater effectiveness in the impounding procedure, as well as substantial increase in fines and an increase in pound fees, will cause those who have been taking advantage of the present weaknesses in the law to take a more responsible attitude in regard to the control of their animals.  In the medium and long term I would hope that the effect of this legislation will be to curtail the number of wandering animals and, therefore, to reduce the need for impounding. In the short term, however, use of the increased impounding powers could cause an increase in the number of animals impounded.  This may lead to local authorities in some areas having difficulty in providing the necessary impounding facilities.  It would be wasteful of resources to try to meet a temporary need by opening new public pounds that might rarely be used once the legislation has had full effect.  To meet any short term demand of this kind I am proposing, in section 5, that local authorities may arrange for animals to be impounded in private pounds.</P>
    <P>Under this provision a local authority, if the need should arise, will be able to enter into arrangements with private interests for the impounding of animals by the Garda or by a local authority. The section will not be operable until regulations are made by the Minister for Justice in relation to impounding in those private pounds.  The regulations will cover such matters as the fees to be paid, the provision of veterinary services, transfers to public pounds, the sale, disposal or destruction of impounded animals pursuant to an order of the local authority concerned and the disposal of <Col N="261" /> moneys realised by such sales.  The maximum fines for breaches of the regulations and for poundbreaking offences will be the same as those for similar offences in relation to public pounds.</P>
    <P>Section 5 differs in several respects from a proposal in the Law Reform Commision's Report which would have authorised the Garda to impound wandering animals of any kind, where the owners were not known, with private persons willing to take on this task.  Thus, under the Bill, it will be a matter for the local authority concerned, and not the Garda, to make arrangements for the provision of private pounds though, once arrangements have beem made in any particular case, it will be open to the Garda to impound animals in these pounds. Secondly, under the Bill the range of animals which may be so impounded is restricted to the categories I have mentioned. Finally, the commission's proposal envisaged that gardaí in all areas could impound animals with private persons, wheras the Bill envisages that private pounds will be utilised only in areas where the need arises, as determined by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Another impounding provision recommended by the commission would have allowed the private detention of trespassing animals, even where the owner was known, with power to the occupier to sell the animals if necessary and to reimburse himself out of the proceeds, giving the balance to the owner.  As things stand, under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851, the occupier of land trespassed upon by an animal must return it to its owner, where known.  Where the owner is not known, he may impound the animal in the public pound.  In either case he may apply to the District Court to recover damages, calculated on a fixed scale, for any loss incurred as a result of the trespass.</P>
    <P>Over the country as a whole very few complaints are received about the operation of the present statutory provisions for the impounding of trespassing animals by private persons and I believe that to allow private persons to detain animals <Col N="262" /> where the owner is known would not be justified and might indeed lead to bad feeling and even violence.  The 1851 provision &mdash; obliging the occupier to return the trespassing animal to its owner, where known &mdash; was probably designed to avoid breaches of the peace.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with animals wandering from undeveloped housing estates.  I am proposing that the occupier of any undeveloped or uncompleted housing estate will be liable for damage caused by animals which stray from the estate unless he gives to the local authority and the local Garda superintendent a notice saying that he did not give permission for animals to be on the estate and authorising the local authority and the Garda to remove any such animals from it.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention that these provisions should apply to all such housing estates.  The idea is that they will be invoked only where wandering animals are causing a problem.  The local authority will be in the best position to determine whether a nuisance of this kind arises in relation to a particular site.  In that event, it would designate the site as a &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; for the purposes of section 6.  This provision is intended to curb a serious nuisance which the Garda and local authorities would not otherwise be able to deal with, as the animals causing the nuisance would be on private property. Once an area has been designated, the occupier will be likely to authorise removal of the animals since otherwise he will be liable for any damage they cause.</P>
    <P>I now come to the provisions amending the law relating to liability for damage caused by animals.  These are in sections 2 and 3 of the Bill.  I would like to preface what I have to say about liability for damage by animals by outlining some relevant aspects of the present law.  First of all, the term &ldquo;strict liability&rdquo; does not appear to have a clearly defined, universally accepted meaning but in the context of what I have to say it can be taken to mean liability that rests on the owner of an animal, irrespective of whether the owner is negligent.  The amount for which he is liable is reduced if there has been <Col N="263" /> contributory negligence on the part of the injured person.</P>
    <P>Strict liability in relation to animals exists in certain circumstances.  These are: (1) in the case of damage done by wild animals kept in captivity; (2) in relation to a domesticated animal, where it is shown that the animal's owner was aware that it had a &ldquo;vicious propensity&rdquo;; (3) where dogs injure cattle or sheep; and (4) in the case of damage by certain kinds of trespassing farm animals.  In other cases, the position may for practical purposes be taken to be that the owner of the animal will be held liable if the injured party proves that the owner had been at fault.  There is one important exception to that statement, namely, that an occupier of land is not liable in negligence if an animal strays from his land on to an adjoining public road and causes injury or damage.  In practical terms this means that, where a motorist or other road user suffers damage caused by an animal straying on to the public road, he has no recourse against the owner of the animal. This situation derives from the fact that, under the law as developed by the courts, the owner has no duty to prevent animals straying.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission proposed that the present law should be replaced by a general provision to the effect that the keeper of any animal should be strictly liable for any damage caused by it.  The damages payable would be reduced if there had been contributory negligence on the part of the injured person.  Strict liability would also be subject to certain qualifications where the injured party was a trespasser and it would not apply in the case of unforeseeable accidents, that is, &ldquo;acts of God&rdquo;.  In support of their proposal the Commission pointed out that there is already strict liability in many instances relating to animals; that strict liability exists, in this context, in many other countries; and that such a system would provide a clear and simple legal rule.  Their approach could also be supported by arguments based on the risk theory of liability; by economic arguments which would regard <Col N="264" /> injuries caused by animals which form part of a business for example, farm animals, as part of the producer's costs which should be borne by the producer rather than the innocent victim of a road accident; and lastly by arguments which suggest that in all cases, whether the animal is used as part of a trade or business or is merely kept as a domestic pet, the owner is the person best positioned to control the animal and to insure against the risk of injury that it may represent to other persons in society.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the consideration that a general scheme of strict liability would involve too great a change in one very important area.  For owners of livestock it would mean changing from a situation of virtually complete immunity to what might be described as almost the other extreme, liability irrespective of fault.  The proposal might also give rise to practical difficulties, for example, in relation to insurance cover, its availability and cost.  Moreover, as I see it, so far as road accidents are concerned it would be anomalous if there were to be strict liability for animals but not for motor vehicles.  These vehicles are much more important as a cause of road accidents, but in relation to them the law continues to apply the ordinary negligence rules.  I think therefore, that, though there is a good deal of merit in the commission's proposal, it would be premature at this stage to give effect to a general principle of strict liability for damage caused by animals.</P>
    <P>In the field of civil liability for damage caused by animals, the main practical issue is that of livestock straying on to the roads.  Under existing law an occupier of land is not liable in negligence if an animal strays from his land on to an adjoining public road and causes injury or damage.  The commission referred to dissatisfaction with this common law rule and it has been the subject of serious criticism in other countries.  They pointed out that this immunity is out of step with modern legal developments and current conceptions of responsibility and, in particular, present-day traffic conditions.  I <Col N="265" /> fully agree with the proposal of the commission that the immunity should be abolished and section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.  In future the liability of the occupier of the land in such cases will be determined by the ordinary negligence rules so that all the normal criteria which determine liability in negligence will apply, as will all the defences available against a claim based on negligence.</P>
    <P>Section 2 makes special provision, as proposed by the commission, for areas where fencing is not customary: under this provision, where an animal causes damage after straying on to the public road in such areas, a person will not be regarded as having committed a breach of the duty to take care merely by placing an animal on the unfenced land.  Finally, I propose that strict liability should be imposed in all cases of injuries or damage caused to any person attacked by a dog. This provision might be described as abolishing the principle embodied in the old saying that &ldquo;a dog is entitled to its first bite&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Under the present law strict liability applies in two cases where damage is caused by dogs.  One of these is where dogs injure cattle or sheep.  Another is where it can be shown that the owner was aware that the dog had a vicious propensity or disposition.  Showing that a dog's owner knew that his pet dog had this propensity is very difficult.  In other words, if a person is bitten by a dog, he would probably have to prove that the dog's owner knew that the dog had bitten someone previously.  Since 1906 there has been strict liability under statute where dogs injure cattle or sheep.  I am sure Deputies will agree that that is a proper and necessary provision.  I think they will also agree that it is anomalous that the present law appears to regard attacks by dogs on human beings as less serious than attacks on sheep.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the dog population has increased considerably in recent years and includes a substantial number of larger dogs such as alsatians and many that are unlicensed.  There have been many complaints about personal and material damage caused by dogs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="266" /> I am conscious that strict liability would not benefit persons injured by ownerless, or apparently ownerless, dogs but no amendment of the law on civil liability could remedy this problem. However, the imposition of strict liability should tend to deter the casual acquisition of dogs and help to ensure that they are properly controlled.  It may be said that the imposition of strict liability will lead to the taking out of insurance by most responsible dog owners and that this will leave them open to exaggerated claims for damage caused.  It appears, however, that insurance against the risk of such damage should be fairly readily available and, since the great majority of dogs are not kept for business purposes, there should be no question of the cost of such insurance being passed on to the general public.  I may add that strict liability where dogs attack people applies in many other countries.</P>
    <P>Section 3 therefore provides for strict liability for personal injuries inflicted by dogs.  This is done by re-enacting section 1 of the Dogs Act, 1906, which imposed strict liability where dogs injure cattle and sheep, and extending it to attacks by dogs on persons.  Provision is made for a reduction in the amount for which the dog's owner is liable if there has been contributory negligence on the part of the injured person.  Also, the ordinary rules of negligence, and not strict liability, will apply where trespassers are injured by dogs.</P>
    <P>To sum up.  As regards the civil liability aspects of the Bill, I believe there will be a general welcome for the abolition of the immunity enjoyed by occupiers of land in relation to damage caused by their animals straying on to the public road. Farmers have nothing to fear from the Bill and indeed I was glad to see reports of spokesmen from the main farming organisations welcoming it.  Most farmers are motorists and I am sure they will appreciate how anomalous it would be to retain the immunity for animals straying on to the road.  I believe there will also be a welcome for the introduction of strict liability for personal injuries caused by dogs and I hope it will cause the minority <Col N="267" /> of owners of dogs who are careless or irresponsible to exercise more control over them.</P>
    <P>However, the features of the Bill that will have the greatest practical impact are those providing increased powers to deal with the damage and nuisance caused by wandering animals.  The Bill gives those powers to the persons who are in a position to take effective action to counter the problem &mdash; the Garda and the local authorities in the areas concerned.  I am confident that when the Bill becomes law they will utilise the powers given to them for the benefit of the considerable number of people in many areas of the country whose lives and well-being, as well as property, have been damaged by those animals.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill in principle.  It proposes radical changes in the law relating to damage caused by animals straying on to the public highway and other public areas.  We welcome the Bill to the extent that some of its proposals will make our roads safer, thereby reducing the number of accidents which far too often have resulted in serious injuries, loss of life and damage to property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret, however, that, having taken the decision to bring in new legislation in this area, the Minister did not go all the way and incorporate proposals which would eliminate the need to bring in a new Dogs Bill which has been under consideration for some time and for which there is considerable demand.  I am sure that the Minister is aware from the various farming and other interests that there has been for a considerable length of time a fairly strong demand from interested parties in regard to the urgent need to bring in a Bill which would deal with this wider problem.  Has the Minister abandoned the idea of bringing in a Dogs Bill?  Perhaps even at this late stage he might consider expanding the scope of the present Bill to cover the wider field which the new Dogs Bill is expected to <Col N="268" /> cover and to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The Bill as circulated deals with this problem in a piecemeal fashion and the legislation will be all the weaker as a result. Section 2 (1) is almost a complete reversal of the law relating to owner liability for damage in that, as the Minister admitted, it abolishes the present immunity of occupiers of land adjoining the public road. Up to now this immunity entitled them to compensation arising from the death or injury to their stock.  It also granted them immunity against claims for compensation arising from injuries sustained in road accidents of damage to motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>The new proposal abolishes the common law rule and owners of land now have a duty to use reasonable care to see that damage is not caused by their animals straying on to the public road.  Section 2 (1) is very vague in its interpretation and the position has not been fully clarified in the Minister's speech.  The only reference in the Bill to this very controversial and serious area is in section 2 (1), which states:</P>
    <P>So much of the rules of the common law relating to liability for negligence as excludes or restricts the duty which a person might owe to others to take such care as is reasonable to see that damage is not caused by an animal straying on to a public road is hereby abolished.</P>
    <P>It is a confusing section, not easily understood or interpreted by laymen.  There is no reference in the section to a number of areas which will now give rise to serious concern, and even though the Minister clarified some of the points it is the Bill which will eventually be law and not what the Minister says in the House in relation to it.</P>
    <P>Will the new section grant immunity to land owners if reasonable care is exercised and if farmers maintain fences and take all reasonable precautions to keep stock from straying on to the road?  That section needs clarification &mdash; I know that the Minister has no intention of doing <Col N="269" /> anything shady or underhand in relation to this legislation &mdash; and should be spelled out clearly in the terms of the Bill.  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that such immunity will exist as far as the land owner is concerned.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister will consider this very important aspect of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>I will give the House a few examples of why such an amendment is fair and necessary.  Take the case of a farmer who has exercised all reasonable care to maintain his stock and fences but finds that a trespasser has left the gate to the field open, thus allowing the land owner's stock to get on to the public road.  As a result of a car accident the fence may be damaged during the night allowing stock to stray accidentally on to the public road.</P>
    <P>It very often happens that as a result of a storm trees are blown down resulting in damage to a fence which allows animals to wander on to the public road. Another example is where livestock are chased by dogs and forced over a fence on to the public road.  Such incidents occurred in the past and very often they resulted in road accidents.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that all the examples I gave are outside the reasonable control of the landowner and therefore his responsibility in relation to such acts should be clearly defined.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position.  If necessary I will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage.  I realise that such an amendment could be interpreted as weakening the proposed legislation and leave the law difficult to implement, but one cannot place a landowner in a position of negligence in situations over which he has no control and which were not created by him in the first instance.  That would be bad law.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) relates to occupiers of land.  The Minister will no doubt be aware that there are people who own livestock who are not the occupiers of land, except perhaps those who take the liberty of grazing the long acre.  The Minister referred to the dog's first bite.  I refer to the long acre and the legality of that title is open to doubt.  How will the provisions <Col N="270" /> of the Bill relate to such people?  Will the Minister have to amend the section to deal with the owners of livestock as distinct from the owners of land?  All through the Bill the term &ldquo;owners of land&rdquo; is used.  Does the Bill give the Minister power to deal with wandering animals?</P>
    <P>I will give another infrequent, but possible, example of a deer, fox or badger running on to the road and causing an accident.  Perhaps that is an insignificant point but I raise it in the context of the Bill referring to the owners of land and not the owners of livestock.  What will the legal position be in relation to such animals coming through the farmer's fence and on to the road?  The latter example may sound trivial on the surface but with the proposed changes in the legislation and the inevitable litigation resulting from road accidents in future it is important that our failure to legislate fully in relation to such incidents does not lead to unfair damages claims against landowners.</P>
    <P>It is important that the House consider fully all the possibilities which might arise and which this legislation is expected to clarify.  Section 2 (2) makes special provision for locations where fencing is not necessary.  I agree with this provision. Will this section apply only to certain specified open areas such as Phoenix Park, the Curragh, the Health in Portlaoise and other areas or will it apply in a general way to traditional open areas? Who will interpret what constitutes such open areas?  Will there be a Schedule to the Bill which will specify the open areas which would legally be interpreted and defined as open areas or will it apply to what would be known in each local area as a traditional open area?  It is important that this point be clarified.</P>
    <P>How will the Bill relate to the owners of livestock whose livestock graze in fenced commonage land where no single individual is charged with responsiblity for maintaining roadside fences?  There are large areas of land which are regarded as commonage land where there are fences of a kind between the land and the public road but no one farmer is entrusted <Col N="271" /> with responsibility for maintaining the fence.  Very often there is trespass from the land to the public road.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify what the consequences would be for the landowner whose cattle stray in such a case.</P>
    <P>These are all weaknesses in the Bill and if necessary the Minister should bring in suitable amendments.  I do not raise these points to weaken the legislation but rather to clarify the law particularly in relation to the injured party.  I agree that road users are entitled to maximum protection against the actions of careless and negligent landowners and others.  It is fair to say, however, that the vast majority of landowners because of their civic responsibility and in the interests of good husbandry make every effort to contain their stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Law Reform Commission Report Working Paper No. 3.  It states on page 90:</P>
    <P>The owner of an animal which causes injury should be made liable on principles of strict liability irrespective of fault.  Two exceptions should be made in such a system of liability: first, the defence of Act of God should be available to the defendant and second, in determining the rights of a trespasser who is injured by an animal ordinary negligence principles should apply.  In all such cases, however, the plaintiff's own fault should also be a ground for reducing the damages awarded.</P>
    <P>That would have provided a level of immunity for landowners in relation to claims made against them arising from the examples I gave earlier.</P>
    <P>I make this point in support of my earlier argument for exemption from liability in cases where there is no negligence on the part of land owners and where the Garda could easily use their judgment in distinguishing between the regular offender and the cases which arise inadvertently on occasion.  We all know of cases of trespass on the road on a regular basis but we know too of the rare and genuine case in which, even with the <Col N="272" /> best farm practice, animals stray accidently on to the public road.  I would be very concerned that the new legislation would include adequate protection for farmers in such circumstances.  The onus in such cases must be on the injured party in so far as proving negligence is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for increased powers of impounding for the Garda and for local authorities.  I do not wish to appear to be trivial in this regard but I might say that this is about the only new power on the horizon for local authorities but it is not one they are likely to welcome. As a member of a local authority I would say that this is a power we do not want.  If there is to be any reorganisation of the local authority system &mdash; and I doubt if anyone disagrees with the need for such reorganisation &mdash; I would suggest that the power we are talking of here be removed from local authorities at that stage and that they be divested also of their powers in relation to sheep dipping regulations, abattoir inspections and other functions that are unrelated to local government.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the Minister's speech concerned the establishment of pounds. In this regard I am concerned about the increased impounding powers being granted to the Garda.  I cannot understand the need for the provision to allow the Garda to move animals either to a public or to a private pound when the owners of those animals are known to the Garda.  Surely the logical, reasonable and least expensive procedure would be to take such animals to their owners.  I appreciate that in urban areas the situation would be somewhat different where a good deal of hardship and inconvenience can be caused to people as a result of animals straying into private property. In these cases it may not always be easy to identify the owners of the animals.  In such cases it is reasonable to have the animals removed to a pound.  My concern relates to the rural situation where very often animals stray accidently on to the public road.  It seems excessive to provide that in such cases the animals be rounded <Col N="273" /> up and impounded.  I am sure that the Garda will not welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what he has in mind in relation to private pounds.  He tells us that local authorities will be empowered to acquire private pounds.  Again, this is a power which I am sure local authorities would not wish for because there is a certain stigma associated with the procedure of impounding and we must realise that local authorities are an area of government associated closely with the community. I would find it difficult to envisage a local authority designating some private area under their jurisdiction for the purpose of impounding wandering animals particularly when the animals belong to the local farming community. The Minister has indicated that local authorities will have power to make arrangements for the establishment of these private pounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make reference to the question of animal health regulations in the context of the movement of livestock.  I take it that it is intended to have private pounds established in agricultural areas too so that cattle impounded would be being brought into contact with other livestock.  In that respect it is important that in legislation dealing with the establishment of pounds and the movement of livestock, we would take fully into consideration the regulations concerning animal health especially since this aspect is at present of such concern to the farming community.</P>
    <P>We tend to think of farm animals being the main offenders in so far as this Bill is concerned but I would consider it appropriate that there be a section to deal specifically with wandering horses whose owners have no land and who consequently are not in a position to contain those animals.  This is becoming an increasingly greater problem throughout the country.  The Bill relates generally to animals straying from lands but there are people who have no land but who have animals, mainly horses, and these horses can be the cause of much inconvenience to other people especially in urban areas. Many road accidents are caused by these <Col N="274" /> straying horses.  This Bill provides us with the opportunity of reducing substantially the numbers of uncontrolled animals on our roads but I submit that the legislation does not deal with that major problem. Horses other than those needed for transport should not be allowed on the public roads and even those needed for transport should be tethered when not in use. I make the distinction because there are families who because of social circumstances are compelled to travel our roads and to live by the roadside.  These people need horses to transport themselves and their belongings.  Unfortunately, though, many animals other than those essential ones are allowed to wander on our roads. I am not getting at the people concerned in any way but as legislators we have a duty and a responsibility to bring some kind of control into this general area. While conceding that they need the limited number of animals to which I refer we should incorporate in this Bill a provision covering the necessity to control the additional animals owned by people who have no land on which to contain them.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill imposes strict liability in all cases of injury or damage to any person attacked by a dog.  It is frightening that we have a dog population approaching three quarters of a million. It must be one of the highest dog populations in Europe.  The sign &ldquo;beware of the dogs&rdquo; from a national point of view is fairly relevant.</P>

      <P>It is more frightening to consider that over 80 per cent of the dog population is not licensed.  What is the position about injuries to persons or animals in relation to claims for damages? It would be almost impossible to prove liability.  Only 12 per cent of the dog population is licensed and in 1984 something in the region of half a million pounds from dog licences went into the Exchequer.  If we could collect licence fees for 50 per cent of the dog population we would get a return of £2½ million to the Exchequer.</P>

      <Col N="275" /> The losses in relation to injury and death to sheep is a major economic problem and is of serious concern to the farming community.  In 1984 out of a population of about 2 million sheep 15,000 were either killed or injured by wandering dogs, costing the agricultural community in the region of £1 million.  In Britain where they have 35 million sheep the damage through death or injury last year only amounted to £½ million.  That gives some indication of our failure to deal adequately with the problem.  I hope this Bill will be the start of a serious attempt to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The 1906 Act should be amended along the lines recommended by the National Council for Dog Control.  A more desirable solution would be to expand this Bill to deal with the dog problem in a wider context.  We at least have the opportunity to discuss the extent of the problem and the Minister has an opportunity to expand the scope of this Bill to deal with the problem.  It is interesting to note that the protection for persons proposed in this Bill is being provided by the expansion of section 1 of the 1906 Act which was introduced for the protection of animals. There is urgent need to take action to control the growing number of dogs. We are all aware of attacks by dogs on children old people and others.  It is a terrifying experience and the provisions in this Bill which removes the onus from the injured person to prove that the owner knew that the dog had a vicious disposition is to be welcomed.  It is important that the Bill protects the owners of watch dogs and guard dogs from injury claims from trespassers.  In our society people are looking for more protection and many genuinely rely on dogs for this protection.  It would be a nice gesture on the Minister's part to exempt old people from licence fees for guard dogs.  Many old people get guard dogs if only just to bark and raise the alarm.  This section is very relevant because of the increasing incidences of attacks on people and property.</P>
    <P>What is the position about stray dogs moving from premises to premises? <Col N="276" /> There is a weakness in the Bill in this respect.  How will the owners of such premises be protected from claims arising from an attack from a dog which has taken up temporary residence in his premises? Is there any protection in the Bill for the owners of premises which might be inhabited by a stray dog?</P>
    <P>The Bill does not do enough to deal with the very serious problem of dog control. It makes no provision for dealing adequately with stray dogs.  The Bill should have a section which would provide for the establishment of dog shelters. This would mean the employment of competent people in each county to deal with the problem.  The Bill will not achieve its objectives unless we make sufficient plans to control the dog population in an organised way in each county.  I should like the Minister to tell the House if he is making provision to enable local authorities to provide dog shelters and homes for dogs in the short term.  The time has come to take immediate steps to control the growing dog population. The threat of rabies, the safety of citizens from attack by dogs and the general interests of the farming community are factors we cannot ignore any longer.  I hope the Minister will incorporate such provisions in this Bill which would be self-financing from licence fees.  I have indicated to the House already that if we succeeded in collecting even half the licence fees we would have sufficient money to put into operation an effective dog control programme.  Unless we achieve that in this Bill the problem will remain with us for a long time.</P>
    <P>The onus and responsibility for the operation of a new dog control scheme should be removed from the Garda Síochána who are overburdened with work.  It should be transferred to local authorities where the scheme could be controlled, implemented and adequately organised by the employment of special wardens.  It is asking too much to expect the Garda Síochána at present to deal with such an irrelevant problem, as far as they are concerned, as the licensing of dogs.  They have much more serious matters to deal with and they are making a <Col N="277" /> worthwhile impact in their dealing with some of our more major problems.  We would be doing the Garda Síochána a good turn and leaving them free to deal with more serious matters if we made provision to transfer that power, and the obvious area in which to relocate that responsibility would be that of local authority administration.  Almost every local authority has met with the representatives of various interest groups concerned with the growing dog population.  The local authorities would be prepared to comply with the provision regarding the establishment of dog wardens and a system of collecting licence fees.  This would eliminate any cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We have scope in the Bill if we incorporate the necessary provisions to deal with the dog problem and this can be done with no additional cost to the Exchequer.  The scheme could be self-financing if dealt with in a businesslike way and that could be done within the terms of the Bill if it is suitably amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is overdue and which will deal with a serious problem in rural areas, namely, wandering and stray animals.  I understand the Bill has two principal functions.  The first is to alter the legal liability for stray animals on roads in the event of accidents and, secondly, to give new impounding powers and regulations to the Garda Síochána and local authorities to deal with stray animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1971 they enacted similar legislation in Great Britain and in 1976 they did likewise in Northern Ireland.  In 1982 we had the report of the Law Reform Commission which considered the area of legal liability and responsibility for stray animals.  I understand the Law Reform Commission were quite specific in terms of what they recommended.  They recommended that there be strict liability on animal owners for stray stock but, as the Minister has stated, this Bill does not go that far.  I am not a lawyer but I understand that in simple terms they suggested that by enforcing strict liability on owners the laws and the general principles of <Col N="278" /> negligence would be waived.  For instance, if an unfortunate motorist on a dark night ran into a wild, roaming beast, if there was strict liability he would just have to prove the fact as opposed to proving the farmer was negligent.  The powers of strict liability would mean a change in the present situation where a farmer is immune from responsibility for a beast involved in an accident to the position where he would be responsible.</P>
    <P>The implications of the report of the Law Reform Commission were unacceptable because they went too far.  The Minister rejected the full recommendations of the commission in this regard and that must be welcomed.  It is only fair and reasonable that farmers should be liable where they are guilty and that they should be convicted where guilty.  However, if they are not guilty, if it is a question of an act of God or some other such thing, then they should not be liable.  As Deputy Hyland pointed out, if a lorry crashes into a fence in the middle of the night and stock breaks out that is not the fault of the farmer.  To take a rather bizarre example, if one had a pet rabbit and a person travelling by motor cycle tries to avoid the rabbit and falls off, is the owner of the rabbit responsible?  He should only be responsible where it is proved he has been negligent.  One must balance the rights of the individual using the motorway against the rights of the stock owner. Abolishing the immunity of land owners is a step in the right direction but to go the whole way with regard to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission would be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us if he has given any thought to the effect of this Bill on insurance premiums.  At the moment farmers can obtain insurance cover against straying stock.  Now that it will be more costly to get such insurance there should be discussions with the insurance companies to make sure that the premiums do not rise excessively. Similarly, there should be a corresponding decrease in insurance premiums for cars because car owners will have the right to claim agains negligent stock owners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> Perhaps the Minister will clarify the situation with regard to supervised stock that are driven along the road.  If a farmer is driving ten beasts and one escapes and if he is not agile enough to capture the beast, what is the position if there is a subsequent accident?  We had a rather unusual situation in Wexford a few months ago when there was a circus in the town and six lions escaped, and some people expressed great concern in regard to public safety.  I would like some clarification as regards why in the outlining of the types of stock covered &mdash; cattle, sheep, goats and so on &mdash; wild animals are not also covered in that.  In conclusion on that aspect I refer to the Law Reform Commission's proposal to have strict liability. Motorists, as the law stands, have not to suffer strict liability and the reversal that they were proposing is too expensive.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the Bill deals with the extra powers of impounding by the Garda and local authorities. This is very welcome as are the regulations relating to untraceable owners of horses and livestock generally.  I have two queries on this.  Section 5 (2) of the Bill refers to private pounds, and Deputy Hyland referred to this but the point I have is different from the one he raised.  Local authorities will be given the right to take over private pounds.  I hope the Minister can assure me that my assumption that this will be done purely on a voluntary basis in terms of purchaser acquisition of these pounds and that there will be no question of CPOs or compulsory acquisition is correct.  Deputy Hyland referred to the care and supervision of these animals being subject to the animal health regulations.  I can envisage a farmer coming to collect his stock and finding that his stock may have been abused in the pound.  I hope that there will be proper care and supervision of stock and, on the other hand, proper supervision to ensure that there is no spread of infection of certain diseases while stock are in pound.</P>
    <P>There is one area that this Bill does <Col N="280" /> not deal with.  The Minister rejected the views of the Law Reform Commission and my views.  I am referring to the problem of ownership of strayed stock.  In my area it is very common for farmers to get up in the morning and to find in one of their fields a strayed piebald donkey or a pony or a collection of both.  The farmer makes inquiries among his neighbours to find out who owns these animals and they say that they do not own them.  After a week of exasperation he puts an advertisement in the lost and found column in the local papers that he has these stock. Typically near a small provincial town there may not be a pound in use in that area and there is no response to the advertisement.  That farmer is at great inconvenience through no fault of his own, probably due to someone who is more than careless, who has nowhere to graze his stock and deliberately puts them on the farmer's land.  What does that landowner do?  Surely there should be some procedure whereby landowners can not only recoup their expenses, be they for putting an advertisement in the local paper or for grazing the stock, but should be able in direct terms to have the onus put back on the original owner of the stock, and not on them, to locate the untraceable owner.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission recommended that there would be private detention of trespassing animals even where the owner was known but especially in areas where the owner was not known.  Therefore, the onus would be shifted to such an extent that whoever had lost stock or ran them in the nearest gate to a neighbouring farmer would have to get them back.  In this Bill, as laid down by the Law Reform Commission there would be powers of detention by that farmer and if, by a given date of two months when the farmer had advertised and so on, the stock was not claimed then it is finders keepers and losers weepers.  That simple maxim would be only fair and would deal with this problem very quickly.  The Garda and local authorities are not really interested in chasing after stock.  The poor, unfortunate landowners landed with these groups of horses and so on <Col N="281" /> should be able to deal with them in their own way.  The owner of the stock will leave them there as long as he thinks he can get away with it, and what I suggest is the only way to deal with it.  For the Minister or the Department to say that going by the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1851, there would be rows or violence between neighbours is totally irrelevant and out of date in 1985.  I ask the Minister to think about this position because it is untenable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to turn to another topic to which Deputy Hyland referred, a missed opportunity in terms of this type of legislation, a serious national problem.  I am referring to the savage, cruel and abominable attacks by stray dogs on defenceless sheep.  As Deputy Hyland said, it is estimated that in 1984 over 15,000 sheep and lambs were slaughtered or injured by vicious dogs.  Being a sheep farmer I know that it is simply impossible at certain times of the year to be in intensive sheep production because of the dangers of dogs and many sheep farmers living near urban areas have been driven out of sheep production because of it.  No words of mine can describe the remorse that farmers feel when they see these innocent sheep mauled, cut apart and slaughtered.  It is appalling.  Every time we see a farmer on the local or national media this matter is referred to. It is on the media, on television, on the front page of the local papers and there is always an outcry that something should be done about it, and here is an opportunity to do something, a missed opportunity. To combat this growing problem the national action committee for dog control was established a number of years ago made up of farmers' representatives, the IFA, the ICMSA and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Some time ago this group submitted a detailed report to the Government on what should be done.  Moreover, an inter-departmental committee was set up with five Departments, including the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the <Col N="282" /> Environment and the Department of Finance. They deliberated for one and a half years, as all good inter-departmental committees do, and they presented their report recently to the Government.  This Bill should have incorporated both of those reports because this matter is so urgent.  It seems to the average punter that there is buck-passing between Departments in this area.  I understand that now it rests with the Department of Agriculture.  When you ask the Department of Agriculture about it they will have a different story.  There is consensus on what would be the contents of a new dog control Bill.  The practical suggestions put forward are the full enforcement of the collection of the £5 licence and that the funds would finance one or two dog wardens per county, that there would be more dog shelters in an organised way, utilising the 50 per cent grant from the Department of the Environment through the local authority, and that there would be effectively proper and practical prevention of the problem of stray dogs attacking sheep.</P>
    <P>Those are my few scattered comments on this Bill.  In a general sense I commend the Bill strongly to the House and I compliment the Minister for Justice particularly on the volume of legislation that he as Minister has put through this House since he has been in this Department.  In reply to Second Stage of this debate I hope he will clarify some of the points raised in the debate and that he will liaise with his colleagues in Cabinet to ensure that the necessary measures are taken in relation to dog control and the attacking of sheep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I am not going to delay too long.  I followed the Minister's speech word by word and I am satisfied and delighted that he has brought in this Bill.  My hope and wish would be that when the Bill passes all Stages in this and the other House the law will be enforced.  I want to say to <Col N="283" /> Deputies here, and particularly to Deputy Treacy, that I am going to make a few remarks that I think are important.</P>
      <P>I am glad that people are no longer immune from having to repair fences on lands adjoining roads.  Many farmers have neglected fences on public roads and have been the cause of animals getting on to the roads, with a resultant loss of human lives.  Such straying animals have caused serious injuries and loss of life to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.</P>
      <P>This Bill imposes direct liability, without proof or fault, in cases where injuries are caused by dogs.  I do not represent a rural constituency, but have been always greatly concerned at the slaughter of sheep.  My sympathies are with the sheep farmers involved.  Up to now there was not much that could be done about this slaughtering.  Cattle are allowed to stray on to the highway and in my own constituency there is a great problem with regard to itinerant horses, particularly in the Finglas area.  One farmer in that area lets trailer loads of cattle out on the various greens in the area.  This causes many people concern. When this Bill becomes law I hope that it will be strictly enforced and that offenders will be dealt with under that law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious about some implications of the Bill with regard to the control of dogs.  There are many blind people who can get around only because they are helped by guide-dogs and these people depend on those animals.  Many blind people have been attacked and mugged by pickpockets, who are very prevalent in Dublin.  There has also been an increase in house robberies and the houses of blind people are no exception. A blind person living alone whose house has been broken into and who has a dog to protect him should not be responsible for damages or injuries caused to an intruder.  In recent times an increasing number of people, particularly in my own constituency, have dogs to protect their property.  These could be described as watch-dogs.  Many people are away from <Col N="284" /> their homes for long periods&mdash;for example, married couples who because of mortgage repayments both have to work. Such people have returned home from work to find their whole houses cleared out.  Where such people, or old people, must have the protection of a watch-dog, it would be very unfair to put on them the responsibility for damages or injuries caused to those who unlawfully enter their houses.  I shall be calling on the Minister to bring in an amendment to exclude such people from that responsibility. I am speaking of dogs enclosed in a house or building.</P>
    <P>Many business people, owners of supermarkets, shopkeepers, chemists and so on, have no option but to keep dogs as watch-dogs.  I appeal to the Minister to exclude such people who keep their dogs under control.  My attention has been drawn to a recent court case in which a householder had a dog which caused injury to a person who broke into the house to rob.  I am told that the robber took the owner of the dog to court and the judge agreed that the householder was responsible for the damage.  This should not be the case.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect in relation to this Bill, with regard to the impounding of animals.  This may not be as simple as the Minister has envisaged.  I can foresee great difficulty in my own constituency in the provision of pounds.  There would be widespread objections by the local residents to such pounds being placed near their houses.  Some time ago I raised this matter with Dublin Corporation and asked that the City Manager agree to look around the area of Finglas for the purpose of finding a site for the provision of a pound for stray animals.  Dublin Corporation agreed and took some considerable time in making this examination but where there were sites there was widespread local objection.  The people in the vicinity did not want those pounds.  In this legislation the Minister should have made it obligatory on the local authority to provide these pounds on local authority land.</P>
    <P>There are widespread problems in Dublin north-west with regard to stray <Col N="285" /> animals.  Many people have lost their lives as a result of such animals crossing the road, or the pathway.  The whole operation of the impounding of stray animals now depends on the Garda Síochána.  I agree with the contention of my colleague, Deputy Hyland, that the Garda will be unable to enforce these provisions themselves because in the Dublin area in particular the Garda in every station are very much under strength and it would be totally impossible for them to provide this service.</P>
    <P>I would endorse Deputy Hyland's suggestion that special wardens be appointed, whether to be employed by the Department of Justice or local authorities, who would perform their duties under the jurisdiction of the Garda, as do traffic wardens at present. I should say those traffic wardens provide an excellent service and relieve the Garda in relation to illegal parking.  Perhaps part of such special wardens' duties could be to look after dog licences.  That would be a full-time task for them.  Indeed not alone should such special wardens be appointed but special vehicles should be provided to take stray animals to pounds. The Minister will be aware that whether such pounds are established privately, by the Department or by local authorities, somebody will have to be appointed to keep watch on them.  I recall not so long ago that in the only pound in this city, on the south side, itinerants came along at night and broke down the gates in order to take away their horses.  I do not believe the operation of the provisions of this Bill will be as simple as the Minister envisages and that, unless he is prepared to appoint special wardens to carry out this duty on a full time basis, then I certainly do not envisage their successful operation.</P>
    <P>Stray dogs constitute a serious problem in many housing estates in my constituency. In the past the Garda have experienced great difficulty in identifying their owners.  Some time ago legislation was passed here to control dogs, obliging owners to keep dogs on a leash in public, dogs to wear collars with discs indicating the names and addresses of their owners, a law which has never been enforced <Col N="286" /> because had it been we would not now have packs of stray dogs rampaging around housing estates.</P>
    <P>I hope this will not be the case in relation to the provisions of this Bill and that they will be enforced.  That can be done only if it is not left to the Garda but rather with the assistance of special wardens to be appointed under their jurisdiction.  We are all aware that when such complaints are made to the Garda at present they will say they have not the time or the manpower, that such must be devoted to more serious matters such as those of attacks on people, of housebreaking, Garda attending courts and dealing with road accidents.  If the provisions of this Bill are enforced then I have no doubt but that they will eliminate the problem of stray animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome and practical Bill.  Indeed, it is long overdue. In the interim too much damage has been done to property, there have been too many deaths, too much damage to life, limb and property as a direct result of straying animals.  It has been a matter of some astonishment to many of us that in recent years Governments did not take practical steps to remedy this serious problem.  It has been evident to us all that neither the Garda nor local authorities were sufficiently empowered to deal effectively with the problem. Accordingly, I welcome this Bill most enthusiastically.  I feel sure it will be received with a high degree of jubilation throughout the country generally, in cities, towns and rural areas because the terrible hazard of straying animals on our main roads and roads generally poses one of the greatest threats to all of us who are road users.  Large numbers of straying animals rampaging through our towns and streets in built up areas constitute a frightening scene and has intimidated people without their having any effective redress.  The provisions of this Bill grapple effectively with that problem.  Its various sections indicate that the Government are making a serious effort to overcome what has become a major problem in recent years, existing legislation being <Col N="287" /> totally inadequate to deal with the problem of straying dogs, horses and animals generally.</P>
      <P>I hope that the fines stipulated here will have the effect of inculcating in all animal owners an awareness of their responsibility to control their animals and the fact that they are primarily responsible for any damage done by them.  The fines are substantial.  For example, contravention of the regulations may be punished by fines of some £500 and/or six months imprisonment.  That constitutes a reasonable deterrent, as do fines of up to £750 and/or nine months imprisonment for pound breaking offences.  I hope these penalties will ensure greater control and elimination from our roads and streets nationwide of these dangerous straying animals.</P>
      <P>I share the view that the matter of stray dogs has not been adequately dealt with in this Bill.  I believe the main brunt of responsibility in this area has devolved on and is being carried out by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to that body for the work they have been doing in this area, an invidious task.  In the main they are dependent on private resources, being essentially a voluntary body, dependent on voluntary assistance, State aid, in this area being very niggardly. It is true to say that local authorities can provide a grant towards the assistance of such bodies but in these times of financial difficulty many local authorities simply do not provide any such financial assistance.  Those who provide such assistance do so in a rather mean and niggardly fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should intervene here.  The Minister should play a greater role in this area.  I understand the Minister for the Environment can recoup the local authorities to the amount of 50 per cent of any moneys they may pay to this voluntary society.  That 50 per cent should be increased to 100 per cent so that the State would be seen to be playing its full role in enabling the society to provide dog shelters and, if our local authorities are <Col N="288" /> unable to do so, and the Minister is not prepared to provide for it in this Bill, to enable dog wardens to be provided to collect stray dogs, to impound them, and to put them down if this has to be done.</P>
    <P>Let no one think that I am knocking dogs in these remarks of mine.  Essentially I am a dog lover.  I have always kept dogs.  I possess a dog at present.  I realise what a wonderful pet and a wonderful companion a dog can be.  We can all become very deeply attached to our dogs, or cats and our animals generally.  We all love our animals, but we must deal with lost and straying animals.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals should be assisted in greater measure to enable them to perform their duties more effectively by way of the provision of shelters, the provision of vans to convey the dogs and the manpower to deal with the dogs.  A warden system should be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident that the dog licence should also be increased, and that a serious endeavour should be made to ensure that every dog is licensed.  Only a small fraction of dogs are licensed. Parents should be dissuaded from bringing home pets to their children which may grow up and be discarded and thrown onto the roadside.  There is a tendency at Christmas time to bring home a dog or a cat for the family.  Sometimes the welcome wears out rather quickly and the animal is discarded.  We should dissuade people from bringing home pets unless they are prepared to take on the responsibility of caring for and maintaining the animals properly.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what the position is under this Bill in respect of the animals of travelling people.  The animals referred to here in the main are farming animals, animals from private households and the animals of itinerants. These people tend to move about with all their goods and chattels.  Steps are now being taken to provide a better chance for those people to live at least in frugal comfort in our society, to be rehoused and absorbed into our society.</P>
    <P>The provision of halting sites is now a reality.  Power is now vested in county <Col N="289" /> managers to provide halting sites. Despite the wishes of members of local authorities that power is now there.  Halting sites are being provided for the travelling people, but with them will come their animals.  I pose the question: what is being done in respect of these halting sites where we will provide sanitary services, water supply, and so on?  Reasonable surroundings will be provided and everything will be done to make these people comfortable.  What of the animals?  Will there be a space for the animals?  Will it be fenced in?  Will there be grazing for them?  Will there be fodder and water for them?</P>
    <P>Will the animals be cared for as well as the people?  If not, we will still have to contend with straying animals, for stray they will.  I should like some thought to be given to that aspect of the matter so that when we provide halting sites we will also provide for the animals, which will include large numbers of horses, goats, dogs and asses.  We cannot blame these people if their animals continue to roam around the roads, the streets and the housing estates if we do not come to their rescue along the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <P>There was a tendency for certain members of our farming community to avail of what was known as the long acre and to put cattle and horses on to the roadsides to graze.  That practice may have been all right in the old days when we did not have large numbers of cars and vehicular traffic on our roads.  It may have been all right when our roads were much quieter but the day has gone when we can permit anyone of set purpose and deliberately to allow animals to stray on the main roadways or even the minor roadways.  They present a most horrible hazard to all of us who use the roads.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the sentiments of Deputy Hyland who feels that certain proposed powers in this Bill should not be proceeded with.  I very much welcome the powers devolving on our local authorities in respect of the acquisition of pounds, and so on.  As members of local authorities we found ourselves in a very frustrating situation down through the <Col N="290" /> years when we discovered that our officials were incapable of dealing with this problem.  Even the Garda were handicapped in large measure in dealing effectively with the problem.  Hence this legislation.  It is very desirable that powers should be vested in the local authorities so that we can have an effective say in this matter and have a controlling interest in this whole area to see that the law is enforced and that our officials do their duty.  I ask the Minister to differentiate between the powers to be vested in the Garda and in the local authorities and the extent and nature of the liaison between them.</P>
    <P>As a member of both south Tipperary County Council and Clonmel Corporation I will have to make representations about stray animals.  To whom will I go? My county manager and town clerk or the Garda?  Will I have to go to both?  We must be given a clear indication of the demarcation of powers as between local authorities and the Garda.  To what extent will they co-operate with each other?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any hard facts on the losses sustained through deaths of animals, damage to property and loss of sheep and other animals through injury? Do we have any reliable statistics?  Figures have been given.  For instance, it is estimated that there are 750,000 dogs in the country.  A figure has been given of the loss of sheep killed by marauding dogs.  How many people have been killed or maimed because of straying animals? What has been the loss of property?  The continuing slaughter of sheep is a disgrace to our society and something has to be done to end it.  If owners of animals cannot control them this House must take the appropriate steps to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill is rather limited because the liability rests with the animal owners. What will happen when an owner cannot be found?  Will farmers and urban dwellers get compensation when their property or farm animals are damaged or injured?  Can the Minister give us an indication of the size of the compensation that may be claimed when animal owners <Col N="291" /> are not known?  There are people in our society who can, and who by reason of their occupations do, abandon animals quite easily.  In such cases it is difficult to locate the owners.  It is a pity the Bill does not provide for redress by way of compensation in such cases.</P>
    <P>The Bill increases the powers to impound stray animals.  We accept that and indeed I welcome the entire Bill.  It is necessary and I hope it will get a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.  I congratulate the Minister on his initiative and I hope he will deal with the various questions asked.  The Bill will be welcomed by our people, especially by local authority members.  Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a local authority member I wish to be associated with the welcome the Bill has received, limited though the Bill is in many ways.  I have raised this matter here on many occasions and on 15 December 1983 I raised it on the Adjournment when the Minister for Agriculture replied.  He referred to the losses suffered by sheep farmers.  I had brought to his attention particularly the problems of Dublin sheep breeders.  I represent a constituency comprising many built-up areas and districts such as Bohernabreena, Brittas, part of Rathcoole and Saggart.  I was so concerned about the problem involved that I endeavoured to raise the matter again before the Christmas recess, knowing the trouble sheep farmers in the Dublin mountains were anticipating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives additional powers to the Garda and the local authorities but I doubt if it goes far enough.  It is all right to hear about the Bill providing additional powers, but what about providing facilities to back up those powers?  As a member of a local authority I fought for many months to have a pound provided in County Dublin.  To add to the problems and difficulties confronting the officials of Dublin County Council, there were objections from members of the public and of the county council.  In the end it was discovered there was no <Col N="292" /> money.  In other words, the provision of the pound was held up by lack of finance. If Fianna Fáil were in power I would now be referring to this problem in the same way.  A suitable site had been got and the pound was to be operated by a veterinary man, but when it came to signing the deal there was no money in the coffers and the matter was deferred.  As a result sheep farmers on the Dublin mountains continue to suffer heavy losses and wandering horses continue to cause havoc in built-up areas.  We must be honest and accept that the Garda have very few powers to deal with this problem.  I am pleased that the Bill proposes to extend extra powers to the Garda and local authorities but I hope the Minister, before the Bill passes, will tell us if the necessary finances will be made available.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill has gone far enough to deal with the problem of dogs that worry sheep and of unlicensed dogs. The Bill should have placed the responsibility for dog licences with local authorities. We are all aware that the majority of dogs are unlicensed but the Bill does not deal with that.  I hope an amendment to deal with that will be introduced on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, to have discussions with the Minister for Justice to ensure that a provision is included to deal with the licensing of dogs.  Such a provision would cover the problem of marauding dogs and would mean additional revenue.</P>
    <P>Last December I referred to the appointment of dog wardens.  The first dog warden was appointed in the constituency of the Minister of Agriculture and that county also provided the first dog shelter.  There is no doubt that they proved of great assistance to those trying to deal with stray dogs.  Some money was provided by Dublin County Council last year for the appointment of a dog warden under the ISPCA, an organisation that deserves our praise.  The dog warden operating in the Tallaght area is very efficient and must drive twice daily to <Col N="293" /> Grand Canal Street to put dogs in the pound.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot nowadays about the importance of sheep production but what have we done to help?  In December 1983 when I raised the question of marauding dogs I pointed out that while the majority of the population would be enjoying their Christmas meal the sheep farmers on the Dublin mountains would be patrolling their farms night and day to save their flocks.  On that occasion the Minister for Agriculture announced that a committee had been set up to investigate the problem. He hoped they would consider all the relevant points raised in that debate but there has been no reference in the Bill to the problem of marauding dogs.</P>
    <P>Wandering horses have become a major problem in urban and rural areas. It has been raised on many occasions in the House.  The powers of the Garda in regard to them are limited.  I accept that they have been given additional powers under this legislation but have they been given the necessary facilities?  I do not wish to be critical of the legislation but I must point out that at every meeting I attend in my constituency the first item on the agenda is the problem of wandering horses.  Public representatives have often raised the matter in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I note that a section deals with fencing. As a member of Dublin County Council I am aware that the biggest problem for the people of Tallaght, and other built-up areas, was created by Dublin Corporation. That body purchased large tracts of land and left them without fences. They can best be described as derelict sites.  Hundreds of horses roam those lands grazing during the day but at night they ramble throughout the built-up areas causing a lot of damage.  Local authorities should be held responsible for the fencing of land they purchase.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear about section 4 (2) (b) which states:</P>
    <P>(b)  In relation to any such public park or open space, the power to impound conferred by paragraph (a) on a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="294" /> may be exercised only where the authority concerned has so requested.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to undertake an immediate and comprehensive programme of investment and other measures designed to provide employment and to alleviate the widespread hardship caused by mass unemployment and to halt the rising tide of emigration.</P>
      <P>I understand there has been an arrangement to split time, but I am not too sure if this information has been passed to the Chair.  I understand I have 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>The reason Fianna Fáil moved this motion this week was that we felt that as Government meetings are taking place over the next few days there will still be time for them to reverse some of the policies they have pursued over the past few months which have not helped our unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>As the Dáil returns from the Christmas recess unemployment has risen to 225,000 and when account is taken of the unregistered youth, calculated at approximately 16,000, and the fact that some estimates state that over 30,000 people emigrated in 1984, the horrific magnitude of the unemployment problem can be seen.  The registered unemployed could pack Croke Park three times over and there would be still thousands outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Opposition benches over the last few months we have been reminding the Government that these levels of unemployment, the direct result of their policies, constitute a national scandal and contain the seeds of serious social disorder which can be seen almost daily in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and <Col N="295" /> Waterford.  Before Christmas the dramatic closures of businesses, such as Verolme Dockyard, Clover Meats, Irish Shipping, Travenol and Atari, show that not alone do this Government not have a policy to reduce the rising unemployment figures but that little is being done to protect existing employment.  Only the major industries hit the headlines but every Deputy knows that firms are closing in every town and city throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Because of Government policy there is an attitude of defeatism abroad and an almost automatic tendency to call in the receiver rather than attempt a rescue package.  No job is secure any longer and this has been seen in a number of industries.  Before Christmas the receiver was called into Atari, the employers left but nothing was done to save this business. I am sure some of my colleagues will cover Travenol and the other firms which have gone out of business.  This Government seem to be prepared to follow the line that if the political ship sinks they will bring the whole nation down with them.  They are politically paralysed.  Perhaps the dreadful truth will come home to them that they got it all wrong two years ago and that their policies started a downward spiral which has continued.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the problem of mass unemployment is first to identify solutions as a priority objective of economic policy and then to adopt a coherent set of policies to tackle the problem.  We believe the Government must play an active role in the economy by planning to implement policies for the creation and maintenance of jobs.  There must be a real attempt made to restore investment to the level it stood at in the late seventies. This requires a positive commitment to provide whatever resources are needed for job creation and a rejection of that part of the industrial White Paper since no money can be put back for job creation purposes because of the level of State finances.  It also requires a more positive investment in terms of cost taxation, public utility charges and positive support <Col N="296" /> for small enterprise companies very carefully selected by the IDA.  There should be a bias towards Irish entrepreneurs attempting to get new ideas off the ground and towards people with initiative. The recent statement by Pádraig White shows that he, if not the Government, is beginning to see that it would have been better if they had encouraged small enterprises rather than large concerns. This is something I have been saying in budget debates over a number of years.  I would be pleased if the Government, even at this late stage, saw the light.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil believe that we must select for growth those sectors which will provide added value to the economy and will bring technological spin-off benefits.  We have to develop a competitiveness based on technology, technical skills, quality, high productivity, export markets and back up services. We must strengthen our scientific and research base and high priority must be given to modernisation of equipment, the restoration of stocking levels in key scientific institutions and a concentration of efforts in technological innovations in the areas of biotechnology, micro electronics, food processing, mariculture and engineering.  Over the last two years this party highlighted those areas but still nothing has been done.  There must be a major expansion of our efforts at every level to promote export marketing and establishing new materials.</P>
      <P>Taxation policy can be used as a very powerful instrument for promoting employment opportunities.  The proof of the argument on self-financing was put forward by the leader of Fianna Fáil in 1983.  He said that selected tax cuts would help employment and would help to stop cross-Border trade.  These were major problems last Christmas.  Our leader was laughed out of the House by the Minister for Finance, who has since seen the light, and it is now seen by Deputies on all sides of the House and by those in industry that the Leader of the Opposition was 100 per cent correct.  We ask the Government to make further cuts in value-added tax at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme has always been an important instrument of job creation, both directly and indirectly, but since this Government took office investment in the productive sectors of the economy has fallen off.  Investment in agriculture and fisheries in particular is less than half the 1980 figure.  The construction industry has been one of the <Col N="298" /> major victims of this Government's policy.  There are over 40,000 building workers unemployed.  Even in monetary terms provision in the Public Capital Programme for 1985 for the construction industry is below the level for 1982.  A major revival in the building and construction industry, a major increase in public capital expenditure and incentives for private investment would be a key element in Fianna Fáil's programme for economic revival and, it is estimated, would create 30,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>Our State companies and local authorities have an important role to play in economic recovery because they are major employers.  They should not be starved of resources as they are at present, either through capital or current budget.  They should be encouraged to achieve their full potential but obviously that is being ignored as can be seen from the Government's provision to local authorities for 1985.</P>
    <P>The bringing of natural gas to centres around the country must be immediately undertaken.  There are jobs to be created in this area.  It would be a source of energy for industry but, again, we have seen how slow the Government have been to exploit the opportunity.  Instead of moving in some of the areas I have mentioned, the Government have followed policies which have created mass unemployment and rising emigration.  There is hardship and deprivation on a wide scale. Excessive taxation is crushing business and industry and depressing living standards.</P>
    <P>The Government should have policies which will inspire all sections of the community to strive to achieve targets.  However, the plan to which the Government are working does not have targets and does not inspire confidence.  There is provision for 11,000 jobs over the three year plan through special schemes.  The scheme which we spoke about prior to the recess not alone has not been implemented but has not even been launched. There was a commitment given in this House in Christmas week by the Minister for Social Welfare that the Minister for <Col N="299" /> Labour would come in on the following day to make a statement in that regard.</P>
    <P>The national plan accepts that unemployment will remain at its present level. Government policies have taken much away from those whose need is greatest. There are inadequate social welfare provisions, tax on clothing and reduction in food subsidies which is causing real hardship.  Over Christmas I read a number of statements from Government Ministers concerning the fact that 52 per cent of those who are unemployed are now on assistance.  It was this Government which reduced pay-related benefits in April 1983 and the Minister for Social Welfare changed the percentage for pay-related benefit, cut the number of days and extended the number of weeks.  His crocodile tears will not be accepted at this stage.  People who are on assistance are suffering as there is large scale hardship.  Anyone who knows anything about health boards or unemployment exchanges knows that this Christmas thousands of people were on their bended knees looking for miserly sums of money to tide them over that period.  If anyone attempts to say that that is going too far and is untrue he or she obviously spent Christmas in the sun, or at least out of the country.  The hardship, suffering, deprivation, the bank squeeze and mounting bills have escalated to an enormous extent.  The human misery and suffering in so many households, especially in cities, is appalling.</P>
    <P>The Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, have continually said in this House that they must follow policies of financial rectitude and that they cannot put any more money into helping those who are deprived through no fault of their own.  It is very sad and the Government should be honest and admit that they have failed.  The figures outlined in the national plan cannot be adhered to.  They said there would still be 210,000 people unemployed in April 1987 but the facts are that there are now 220,000 people unemployed, 16,000 of those unregistered, and 30,000 have left the country.  There was a pathetic answer <Col N="300" /> today saying that 6,000 people had emigrated from this country.  Even the Minister looked embarrassed because he knew he was speaking about the UK and ignoring emigration to the United States where people are working illegally on holiday visas.  If only the Government would admit the extent of the problem perhaps we could go forward.  There are about 270,000 people unemployed at present and shedding them from our shores does not make it any easier.  If the Government continue with their present policies there will be 300,000 people unemployed in 1985.  They should accept that the national plan is a sham and there should be something positive in the budget next week.</P>
    <P>I have tried to put forward my views in a constructive way and I hope the answer will not be the gobbledegook we heard since the national plan was announced. The Government should change their policy and next week they have a glorious opportunity to bring forward policies which clearly state that they will make a constant and sustained attack on the levels of unemployment.  Unemployment should be the central objective of Government economic policies, not borrowing, deficits or codding the people. The present document pays little attention to the problems of unemployment. It is not concerned with investment or job creation.  There are no proposals regarding short-term work for those in long-term unemployment.  There is no section on investment which clearly indicates that they have no interest in investment and in private industry to try to create jobs.  We know they are trying to demolish the public service although they are failing in that respect also.  They are not creating investment or opportunities. They are cutting investment in agriculture and have almost ruined the construction industry.  Where are their proposals for employment?  What do they expect? Is emigration the only solution?</P>

      <P>We boasted over many <Col N="301" /> years that we had a young, well educated, well trained and flexible population with a high proportion having gone through third level education.  Many people are trained in technology and scientifically orientated industries.  If Government policies are not geared to provide the opportunities of investment and creation of jobs, these young people will have no alternative but to emigrate.  I should like various Government spokesmen to say what they feel about the 50 per cent who are now unemployed.  What policies have they for the people who are on social welfare assistance? What policies have they for giving a boost to private industry and for investment in the construction industry? What have they to offer to the housing programmes? What policies have they in regard to infrastructural development either on a private or a public basis? What are their proposals in the life of the plan for the Public Capital Programme? What proposals have they in regard to mining?  What are their proposals in regard to any job creation? Is their policy to follow the line that it is easier to pay assistance to hundreds of thousands of people than to create industrial policy? They must create incentives and help those who are small but who have enterprise and ideas.</P>
      <P>This party support schemes run by AnCO, Manpower and the Youth Employment Agency although we feel they should be under one organisation working together and not as, at present, working against one another because of various appointments and other differences in policies coming from Government Departments within those organisations. We cannot have training courses for 60,000 or 70,000 people running continuously when there are no jobs on their completion.</P>

Perhaps this Government are following the pattern of other Governments when they lost elections.  They forfeited authority some time beforehand and lingered on in office but were no longer in power. Their ultimate defeat at the polls was a ratification of what had already occurred. If this Government have accepted that they have lost the next election and have accepted that their one job is to stay in power and put together things like the national plan and dodge legislation they should stand aside and let someone who cares about the country do something.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that there is considerable hardship being endured and suffered by the people and that we have reached a critical stage for the future of our country.  Daily we read about the collapse of traditional industries and of business liquidations and now we have a new threat to multinationals and high technology industries.  All this has resulted in a lengthening of the dole queues by those who never worked and have no prospect of working.  The emigration ship carries increased numbers every day and is releasing the enormous investment we have made in the educational process in this country to the benefit of our competitors.  It is leading to disillusioned and apathetic young people.  Daily divisions are created in the community which lead to cynicism about parliamentary life and the institutions of State. Young people regard Dáil Éireann as irrelevant.  That is a dangerous phenomenon and there is no doubt that there is a challenge to the authority of the State and to the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can no longer rely on the world recession and international stagnation as our excuse for poverty.  We have seen in the past year or so the growth which has <Col N="303" /> taken place in the United States and the OECD countries.  In the US in two months last year more jobs were created than were created in the continent of Europe in a decade.  We are not ideologically neutral as was stated by some Minister in the recent past.  We should learn from the techniques and strategies of the trendsetters in the creation of jobs. We must release venture capital outflows so that we can invest in high technology and particularly in biotechnology which will be the source of so many jobs for this country over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We must ask the Government to ensure that there is a moral acceptance of the justification of profits as a reward for investment.  This is a social attitude which must be worked on.  We must bring home to people the fact that benefits are available only from the wealth created from productivity.  The balance has gone wrong here.  Too many people are drawing from the resources of the earnings of too few.  The Government have a positive role to play in creating that kind of attitude in so far as entrepreneurs, risktakers, profit-making and wealth are concerned. The rewards for risk are not sufficient at present.  There is no real incentive for capital outlay in productive investment at home.  That is why there are so many countless millions of pounds leaving our jurisdiction and benefiting the economies of our competitors.  There is no economic sense in spending hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money seeking foreign investment and foreign industrialists to this country to locate here when we have failed to create the climate to retain our native capital.</P>
    <P>The Government have already admitted their failure as far as unemployment is concerned.  After three years there will be much more unemployment than we have at present according to the national plan, despite the special schemes which have yet to be fully announced.  These areas of social employment are not a lasting solution and should be recognised as such.  We should be talking about viable sustainable jobs.  They are the only <Col N="304" /> ones worth funding.  Further public service employment is no longer saleable in our economy.  We should create a climate for the private sector and that can only be done through realistic taxation and investment policies so as to stimulate enterprise, restore the work ethic and rekindle the fire of enthusiasm and confidence which is so much lacking not just in the work force but in management.</P>
    <P>The Government should terminate the stop-go public relations exercise about the state of the economy.  They have continued every day since the announcement of the national plan to talk alternatively about the calculated displays and prognostications of imminent disaster to be followed immediately by timid suggestions of recovery and a turn around in the economy.  The real political Scarlet Pimpernel stuff is at work as far as Coalition politics is concerned.  Why do the Government seek to intensify the cynicism of the public by trying to confuse the issues every day of their life? The yardstick of economic well being as it is understood by the electorate is how many people are on the dole on this day, how much disposable income have I got this day and how many people emigrated last month?</P>
    <P>Confidence is an essential but fickle ingredient in economic survival.  It is easy to undermine it but very difficult to regain it.  The people have lost confidence in this Government.  Their credibility is in tatters and no one believes they can regain the necessary momentum to sustain them.</P>
    <P>Let us take a few examples of where the Government could take measures to restore confidence in the economy and help create many necessary jobs.  Look at the smuggling which we have here today: £400 million of consumer spending in the North last year by people from the Republic.  It was spent because of the high VAT rates and adverse fiscal policies being followed by the Coalition.  It has resulted in a loss of revenue to the State, a loss of job opportunities, and small business confidence.  The high rates of indirect taxation have resulted in serious losses to the economy.  They have <Col N="305" /> resulted in goods and services being purchased outside the State.  There can be no justification for refusing a policy of a selective reduction of VAT on products which are sensitive to importation. These matters have been carefully scrutinised and analysed and it is accepted they could be self financing.  Why do the Government not take on board measures which would have such beneficial results for the economy and job opportunities which need to be created for people?</P>
    <P>The construction industry continues to decline in the volume of work and in the numbers employed.  There is no doubt that the public capital expenditure programme must be revitalised as far as the construction industry is concerned. We must encourage investment from the private sector.  The advantages are many. The construction industry is labour intensive. At present 45,000 people trained in construction are unemployed.  That is not to talk about the number of professional people who are also unemployed because of this.  We have the loss of manufacture of building materials which has resulted in increased imports in this area.  These are areas which should be tackled immediately by Government policy.  Another advantage is that of quick start-ups.  We are not waiting for downstream activity over a few years to provide jobs.  Once money is put into the construction industry there could be an immediate take up of employment.  We also have downstream activities in so far as manufacturing industry supplying materials to that industry is concerned.  These together with the essential needs of the people in areas such as roads, housing, services, bridges, car parks and all matters that need attention in the construction area, could be taken on board next week in the public capital expenditure programme for 1985.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has always acted as a barometer for an active economy. It must be said that having regard to the extent of unemployment in the construction industry, it is easy to realise that the economy has stagnated.  Let us consider the tourist industry.  We have been waiting a long time for an initiative <Col N="306" /> from the Government in this area.  We are embarking on a new season without having any great detail as to what proposals the Government may have to rejuvenate and revitalise this industry which has such potential for growth both in revenue earnings and in job creation.  The Minister has not yet delivered on the promises he made to the tourist industry. The Government have refused to recognise the difficulties of the industry. Changes can be made at the stroke of a pen which would have immediate results both in the level of job creation and in terms of advantages to tourism generally. We are talking about one of the few industries in which decisions taken now would have immediate results.  The tourist industry is a growth industry.  This is recognised internationally.  It is a labour intensive industry involving the minimum of imports.  It provides a greater return in revenue tax for every pound spent than is the case in any other exporting industry.  Yet it is not given the benefit of the advantages and incentives that are available to other export industries.</P>
    <P>Despite what people might wish to say, our market share of tourism has been falling.  We are not gaining at the pace our investment warrants.  That is why there must be a complete review of tourist industry policy, and that review can only be undertaken by the Minister.  Guidelines must be laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The criterion on which the tourist industry will survive or otherwise will be the criterion of value for money. We have all the natural amenities.  We have the people but we must give value <Col N="307" /> for money and we cannot do this unless we become more competitive.  Analytical study of the industry shows that it would be self-financing in the event of a substantial reduction in VAT levels.  Our pricing structure in terms of meals, drinks, petrol, transport charges and so on are out of line with the pricing structures of our competitors.  This prevents us from attracting greater numbers of tourists. Therefore, we must take the initiative.  In addition, we must do something positive in so far as access transport is concerned. We must realise that the only way to get money from tourism is by bringing the tourists in in the first instance.  One might think that is a simplistic deduction but it has not yet dawned on the various agencies involved in the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that our standards are right.  I should like to hear the Minister say that he is undertaking a review in that area also because in the absence of standards that are recognised both nationally and internationally it will not be possible to maintain our market share of the industry.  We have fallen behind in many ways but I wish to refer particularly to our industrial output in proportion to our population.  This is still only half that of developed small European countries. The cost of our essential services such as electricity, telecommunications, natural gas, road diesel and so on are out of line <i>vis-à-vis</i> our international competitors. Industrial electricity costs here are the highest in Europe despite our having a surplus generating capacity.  Why can we not utilise that resource to the best advantage by utilising capacity to the full, utilising the full workforce and by making electricity available at cheaper rates thereby encouraging energy intensive industries to the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the price of natural gas varies so much as between one user and another.  It is supplied to the ESB at one price and to industrial users at another.  I cannot see why we cannot make that natural resource available to heavy industrial users at the same cost as that which <Col N="308" /> applies internationally to our competitors. It is futile for the Government to preach competitiveness and to be placing management and production targets on the private sector while failing to implement an enlightened and realistic cost prices policy of their own.</P>
    <P>The recent experience in regard to Travenol raises some very important questions in so far as our dependency on multinationals is concerned.  What has happened in regard to that industry has had a very serious impact on purchasing capacity in the area of south Mayo.  In a two-year period £7 million will be sucked out of the economy.  We must concern ourselves with the question of dependency on high technology industries.  We rely totally on resources abroad for research and development in this regard. What has happened in the case of Travenol represents the first major multinational casualty in the health care industry in this country.  For that reason the event has taken on a much greater prominence and has been the subject of much greater reaction from the Government and from the IDA than one would normally expect in the case of an industry that would fail. In that area we had all our eggs in the one basket in terms of employment.  Consequently the impact on the community is that much greater.  I take it that was the reason for such an active and positive response from the IDA.</P>
    <P>However, there arises the question of the notice to quit that was received by the people in Castlebar and there arises the question also of the finances of the company concerned.  It was rather disheartening to hear a leader in the industrial sector say he was not aware of how much money that company were making or losing as the case might be.  The truth is that, despite having made money last year, the company closed.  The danger signals must have been visible long before the company decided to close but no one seemed to notice.  We must ask the question of what safeguards there are in respect of state investment and job security if, even when a company are making money, they may relocate elsewhere.  I understand that the decision in the case <Col N="309" /> of Travenol was made on a commercial basis and that a preferential location decision was taken in so far as the manufacture of the product was concerned.  The company decided to move to mainland Europe but one may ask what the reason for that decision was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but it may also have been related to the new French purchasing arrangements.  One may ask what EC protection we have.  Is this an example of what has been going on also in agriculture and in fisheries and which has been limiting our growth? It is possible that we suffer from an overdose of false nobility in acting as good Europeans and putting Ireland in second place? Every other member is putting the home country first and everything else afterwards when that suits.  While the decision that has been taken cannot be altered, it raises the questions of marketing and of the research and development of products being produced in Ireland but organised outside the State so that we end up with certain multinationals merely shipping to order while we cannot respond in the market place by reason of not having anything to do with the marketing strategy of the multinationals involved.</P>
      <P>I suggest, therefore that there be a greater link up with CTT and an involvement by the multinationals in our marketing strategy.  That should be part of any grant agreement.  Replacement technology for mature products should become a matter for concern.  We need an indigenous technological research unit so that we are not continually depending on outside sources for what we need in so far as technology is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had enough analysis of what our problems are.  We have been smothered in reports, commissions and consultancies. What is needed now is action on the part of the Government, bold initiatives rather than old, jaded policies.  We are suffocating in mediocrity.  There is an unwillingness to recognise the strength of <Col N="310" /> our economy.  I am asking the Government to take the initiative, on behalf of all of us, to restore confidence to the Irish people and to the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.  There must be a recognition of the potential in those areas and if we can co-operate together there is no reason for our not being able to reach the growth rates necessary to provide full employment for our people in our time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, recalling its approval of the National Plan, <i>Building on Reality</i> on 17 October, 1984, approves of the measures announced in the Plan to promote investment and the creation of employment over the Plan period&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This motion from the Opposition seeks to castigate the Government's measures to deal with the unemployment problem. In the last year the Government have initiated up to 20 new schemes to deal with unemployment.  We accept that this is not enough and we are continuing to work to devise more schemes and improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition party, who criticise us in this motion, have had the freedom from the pressures of office to work out better ideas for the past two years.  They receive an expenses allowance, to include research, from the taxpayer of £181,692 a year for this purpose, that is over a quarter of a million in the past two years. Yet in the two years they have not published a single policy document on any economic issue.  One must assume that it is their intention to produce no ideas of their own and confine themselves to criticism.  Yet common sense indicates, that in any walk of life, there is little point in criticism that does not contain an alternative approach.  There is no merit in what the Opposition are trying to do here today.  They should first do their <Col N="311" /> own job and work out their own policies and put them forward.  Then they will be in a position to criticise what the Government are doing.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk about some of the measures that the Government are in fact instituting to deal with the unemployment problem.  The first one I want to refer to is the proposed National Development Corporation.  The details of the corporation have been set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  The National Development Corporation is designed to represent a new approach to State involvement in economic activity. It is not designed to introduce a new layer of bureaucratic decision making into existing State enterprise.  Nor is it designed to duplicate the work of existing State companies or agencies.</P>
    <P>All will admit that the existing approach to State enterprise in Ireland has run into some difficulties.  That is not to say that it was not successful initially. Enterprises such as Bord na Móna and the ESB got many things going that might not have started at all without them.  But times change and we must change our approach in the 1980s and 1990s.</P>
    <P>The key new elements in the National Development Corporation approach to public enterprise are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the fact that they will have to sell off their investments within a period predefined at the time of the making of the original investment; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the fact that they will operate to a major extent in joint ventures with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise why these new approaches are being adopted.  It is natural that those who are familiar with the existing approach of State enterprise, where the investment by the State is permanent and the State is usually the sole investor, should question why the same approach should not continue to apply to new enterprises.  Some even see these changes as heralding privatisation of existing enterprises.  This is not what they are about at all.  They have nothing to do <Col N="312" /> with existing enterprises but are a new way of investing in new enterprises.</P>
    <P>These changes are being made so that a new form of enterprise will grow and expand.  They are designed to take account of the most modern thinking in respect of the product cycle.  They also are designed to recognise that the State has limited resources and must aim to get maximum new job creation for every pound it spends.  They also recognise the fact that much State enterprise in the past has run into difficulty because of excessive bureaucratic interference.  The requirement to sell off investments will have the great benefit of ensuring that the money invested by the State initially will be re-used in a succession of new projects rather than tied up permanently into the first one into which it is put.  Thus we will get more job creation for a given amount of money.</P>
    <P>This approach also takes account of the concept of the product cycle.  This concept, based on modern industrial research, is that every product goes through a number of phases.  The first phase is the research phase, the second, the product development phase, the third, the market entry phase, the fourth, the rapid growth stage, the fifth the maturity phase and the sixth the phase of decline.  All products eventually end up in a state of maturity and ultimately of decline.  The reality of State enterprise in Ireland today is that most of its money is tied up in products that were innovative when they started, but now are either mature or in decline.  This is when profits begin to fall and eventually losses occur.</P>
    <P>By requiring the National Development Corporation to sell off their investments at an early period, for instance during the period of rapid market development, this trap will be avoided.  The State will get the maximum capital gain from the sale of its investment, reflecting both profits already made and anticipated profits.  This money can then be reused by the NDC to start off another new project.  The sale price obtained will provide a ready evaluation of how well the NDC are doing their job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> Let us remember that the new technology of the mid 1980s will be old hat in the mid 1990s.  We do not want to tie up all our money permanently in the technology of the mid 1980s.  We want to have a constant stream of funds available to invest in new technologies as they arise over the next 20 years.  The &ldquo;sell-off and re-invest&rdquo; requirement has been designed specifically to ensure that the NDC can stay on the frontiers of technology without requiring a constant stream of new money from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is very important that Ireland should continually be on the frontiers of technology in industry.  There are many countries in economic history who were on the frontier of technology at one time but then went into decline.  High profits and prosperity are no guarantee against falling behind in the race.  At one time Britain was the world leader in industrial technology.  It is also arguable that Germany, very recently a world leader, is now falling behind.  It may happen that in a few years time Japan will fall behind. Countries fall behind because they become too comfortable selling mature products, while continuing to make an adequate profit, and fail to reinvest and direct resources into new products.  It is very easy to be comfortable if the balance sheet looks good this year and next year, and to forget about ten years hence.</P>
    <P>We are designing the National Development Corporation to ensure that this does not happen.  By requiring them to sell off old investments they will be specifically prevented from resting on their oars.</P>
    <P>The involvement in National Development Corporation projects of private enterprise partners is very important.  It is necessary to protect the commercial freedom of the corporation's investments. The sad experience of the past is that where a project is wholly State owned there is a danger that the Government will intervene from time to time to get the enterprise to do things that have a social or political value.  This can demoralise those managing the enterprise if it runs counter to their commercial judgment of what is best for its <Col N="314" /> growth.  This type of interference has helped the decline of many outstanding State companies.</P>
    <P>If the State enterprise is working in a joint venture with private investors, either on a majority or a minority basis, they will insist on a contract that excludes or regulates Government interference of a non-commercial kind.  This is the best possible guarantee that the enterprise will work with the primary purpose of making profits for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I hope that the National Development Corporation will inaugurate a new era in regard to State involvement in enterprise in Ireland.  We should try to get away from the situation where people take ideological positions on the issue.  Too many people try to defend the proposition that State enterprise is bad in all circumstances.  There is no reason why this should be so.  Equally too many people take the view that State enterprise is a good thing that should be pushed forward with little regard to performance or profit.</P>
    <P>My aim in designing the criteria for the National Development Corporation, which have now been incorporated by the Government in the White Paper on Industrial Policy as their decisions, is to put an end to this futile and divisive ideological debate.  I want to build a new consensus on a constructive partnership between public and private enterprise under strict and effective criteria.  I know that there will be those who might want to hark back to old-fashioned ideological positions about public enterprise.  I ask them to give the National Development Corporation a chance on the new basis that I have outlined.  I am confident that the requirement to roll over and reinvest, which is unique to the National Development Corporation, will enable it to achieve the ambitions of both the proponents of State enterprise who want an active role for the State on the frontiers of new technology creating new jobs, and those who want investments that are strictly commercial and do not require a constant re-injection of public funds to keep them afloat.</P>
    <P>Both can be satisfied by the basis upon <Col N="315" /> which the National Development Corporation has now been designed and I look for the support of all parties in the House for the National Development Corporation legislation when it is introduced in a few months time.</P>
    <P>I have given considerable time to the National Development Corporation because it represents a new approach to the State's role in job creation.</P>
    <P>However, it is far from being the Government's only initiative in this area. Let me list some of these other initiatives regarding job creation.  First, a technology acquisition and two new marketing grant schemes to help Irish firms launch new products and sell existing ones more effectively.  These will be introduced during the year.  Second, more money for enterprise centres by the IDA, bringing the total to five, to help people with ideas turn them into jobs and profits.  Third, a linkage programme to help Irish firms win orders from importers.  This will keep money in Ireland that is going abroad and allow many Irish companies to buy components produced here.  Fourth, a social employment scheme to give the long term unemployed the opportunity to do useful work and to seek part time work without losing an assured basic income.  This will help them to work themselves back into full time employment. There are too many people unemployed who could get work for one or two days per week but who cannot or will not take it because they fear they will lose benefit.  This new social employment scheme will allow them to do that as well as working for two and a half days.  It will help people to get back into work.</P>
    <P>Fifth, we are introducing a special training scheme to help the long term unemployed, many of whose skills are redundant and must be replaced with new skills.  We must recognise that some skills are redundant and people must get new ones.  This scheme which will be introduced for the long term unemployed will do something about that by a mixture of training and work.  Sixth, the Government have initiated a pay policy in the public sector that will, and has, lowered <Col N="316" /> pay expectations generally.  This will mean more jobs and much less taxation in the long run and it is very important for job creation.  Seventh, we have introduced an enterprise allowance and a pay-related benefit lump sum scheme to help unemployed people set up their own business. Eighth, we have instituted measures to build up the equity base of Irish industry by encouraging investment in it by venture capital, employers and the National Development Corporation.  A stronger equity base will help to insulate industries against fluctuations in interest rates.  Too many Irish industries are going down because they have borrowed too much as they have not enough subscribed equity from their owners.  By bringing in more equity, Irish industries will be less prone to buffeting by fluctuations in the financial markets.</P>
    <P>Ninth, we have introduced an intensive campaign to get retail outlets to stock more Irish goods and to help Irish producers gain access to the shelves of foreign associates of retail chains operating in Ireland.  We should not be satisfied just to get Tesco and Quinnsworth to stock more Irish goods in their Irish shops. We should aim to get them to use their influence with their companies overseas to get those shops to stock more Irish goods also. That is a campaign in which I have been intensively and successfully engaged in in the past few months.  Finally, we are instituting a streamlining of the services of State agencies supporting Irish industry through an overall management committee at national level and &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; for the entrepreneur at regional level.  Details of this were announced last Sunday.  Any person in any region can get information in one place and at the same time on all the State services available to set up a business rather than having to traipse around one office after another.</P>
    <P>I admit that no one of these measures alone answers the unemployment problem but they represent a coherent package. They will yield lasting results.  They can be improved upon.  I challenge the Government's critics on the other side of the House to abandon the wailing and <Col N="317" /> hand wringing and to come up with better ideas &mdash; if they have them &mdash; which will complement what has already been done without adding to future tax burdens.  Let us always remember that extra spending in 1985 means extra debt.  Extra debt means extra interest payments in 1986 and extra interest payments in 1986 means extra taxation and more out of work in 1986.</P>
    <P>We must constantly look for new ideas. I think one promising area for examination is that of the way we organise work. The era of the big organisation and the regimented 40-hour week workforce is over.  Information technology has killed it.  If Ireland is to win orders for work on world markets we must offer a more flexible package &mdash; working in small units, for irregular hours, on short-term contracts and in whatever way the customer needs.  Our tax and welfare system need to be reformed to ease the transition to flexible working systems.  This will take time, but that is where the critics should be looking, rather than calling for the solution of the 1930s to be applied to the problems of the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The Government's planned reorganisation of tax allowances and welfare payments for children into a single child benefit, payable to all, is possibly the direction in which our entire tax and welfare system should move.  The aim should be a scheme in which everybody can gain from extra activity and a society which recognises the value of all work &mdash; paid and unpaid &mdash; that contributes to a better society.  We must begin to see the stigmatisation and isolation of those who have lost their jobs as much as a condemnation of our society's system of values as of its economic efficiency.</P>
    <P>Having said some critical words about the general approach of the Opposition in this debate, may I endorse some of the remarks made by Deputy Flynn, whom I regret is not here at the moment.  I endorse what he said about the need for all of us in politics to inject a mood of confidence in our people and to give them a greater appreciation of our country's inherent strength.  We have the youngest population in Europe: that has been said <Col N="318" /> so many times it has become a cliche.  We have also the best educated population, one that speaks the language of international commerce &mdash; English &mdash; which gives us a great advantage over most Europeans.  We have a highly regarded higher education system with excellent graduates leaving it.  We have the ability that is second to none to co-operate as a people when we are faced with a challenge. One has only to look at what we have been able to do when put to the test to see how much potential there is here.</P>
    <P>We need to appeal to our people's sense not just of material gain but also of patriotism to get ourselves out of the present problem.  I know many will say it will be difficult to change our economic performance without radical reductions in taxation.  There are people who assume that the only motivation that people have for doing anything is the prospect of financial gain.  Of course we must do what we can in this area but we should not understimate our ability to motivate people to do something simply for the good of others.  Let us remember that most of the work done in this country is not done for financial gain.  Most important work is done in making homes and in voluntary organisations.  Most of the work done, without which we could not survive as a society, is done without the prospect of a financial gain.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us hope and endeavour to rekindle a spirit of patriotism and to have pride in our country and confidence in its ability to overcome its problems. Let us also get away from the situation where we isolate from society those who are unemployed.  Unfortunately, people who become unemployed soon find that they lose their friends, that those with whom they were associated while they were at work have less time for them than they had.  Not only do they opt out of work, they opt out of activity in their neighbourhood in voluntary organisations and they become demoralised.  We must realise that everybody, employed or unemployed, so long as he is doing something, paid or unpaid work, is contributing to our society.  That is why I said <Col N="319" /> that we see the problem of unemployment not solely as a reflection of our undoubted failures in the economic area but also as a reflection in part of a defective system of values.  The more this point is brought to people's attention and the more the patriotism of our people is tapped, the more we can hope to overcome our unemployment problems, as I am quite confident we will succeed in doing over the next five years.</P>

      <P>I trust that my contribution will not be interrupted unduly, as I respect the sincerity of the views held by the Minister and his attempts to redress the problems we face, in sharp contrast to his colleague who made a imbecilic one-line remark after our spokesman on Labour and the Public Service made his sincere views known.</P>
      <P>The points raised by the Minister sound good and there are some good ideas in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  I seek to obtain from this debate &mdash; and there can be a reply at its conclusion tommorrow night&mdash;the implementation of some of those ideas.  I would like to put that White Paper in perspective.  It refers simply to the creation of a maximum of 5,000 jobs per year, which is not going to redress the unemployment problem and is of no benefit to the vast population of young people who are coming on to the jobs market.  One in six of the workforce is at present out of work and one in 12 is on unemployment assistance.  At the end of December 119,626 were on unemployment assistance &mdash; that is 53 per cent of the total unemployed.  We were 50 short of 220,500 signing on at the unemployment exchanges in the last week of December and almost 69,500 of them are under 25 years of age, many of them without skills.  If we are to try to address ourselves properly to this problem we need fresh thinking and a radical approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that when we in Opposition speak about investment in the <Col N="320" /> public sector this Government portray us as in favour of profligate spending.  There is an area for prudent and proper investment in the public sector.  Despite the Minister's long appraisal of the National Development Corporation's role, I would like to point out that I have read the White Paper on Industrial Policy which was printed in July 1984.  It is now almost February 1985 and we are told by the Minister tonight that the NDC will not be in being for another three months. There is an obvious dichotomy between Labour and Fine Gael as to that organisation's role and whether they are to play an economic role in industrial development. Therefore, we are talking in very vague terms here tonight about what exactly this Government are doing to address themselves to the major social problem facing this country and many others in the developed world.</P>
    <P>Second, I come from a constituency, County Offaly, where 43 per cent of those unemployed are involved in the public sector.  I was delighted to hear the Minister tonight applauding the achievements of Bord na Móna and the ESB in providing not just social employment but also profitable employment which has involved great benefit and was in the national interest and the development of this country.  However, we know from the recent report on electricity prices that those 2,500 jobs are once again being placed at risk.  The Minister has spoken about trying to bring about a new consensus in Irish industrial circles.  If he wishes consensus he must have consultation. The real political problem that this Coalition Government face at present is that they refuse to consult with the major social partners before devising their policies over the next three years.  First of all, we had an academic scenario, the national planning board who brought forward many proposals which are so naive that they are not even worth mentioning. Then they went into hibernation for a few months to come out with <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.  If you want consensus, a unified approach, an attempt to solve for good and all this social evil, you must have prior consultation rather than the <Col N="321" /> present Government's approach of bringing about all the answers beforehand and then telling us that this is the only way forward.  The national handlers have, quite ably in my opinion, tried to portray to people in this country that there is only one way forward and that that one way forward is involved in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.</P>
    <P>Other alternatives are open to this country and to any Irish Government.  I want to revert to an area of significance to me, that is the whole situation regarding Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Eventually the bogs will be run out.  I stress that we had an official from the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism at our council meeting yesterday.  When he got the updated figures from the county development officer he had to accept that there has been a very sharp increase in unemployment in our county from the latter end of 1984 and that it is now at 18 per cent.  In that county 2,500 jobs are at risk and they could bring that unemployment figure to above 30 per cent in the very near future if remedial action is not taken.  What surprises me is that there is no incentive, despite much talk about the NDC, and no real attempt is being made to see what alternative use can be made of the many thousands of acres of cutaway bogs in the midlands.</P>
    <P>I, as a backbench TD, was able to get in touch with the European Commission on this matter with the help of my constituency colleague, Mr. Paddy Lalor, MEP. I asked about the possibility of getting funding for a midland research project and pilot scheme in relation to the food processing area in my constituency, and we got a very favourable reply from the Director General of the Regional Policy Directors in the Commission to the effect that the future development of a food processing industry in the midland area may well be eligible for fund aid, and as such a feasibility study of establishing this type of industry might also be eligible for fund assistance.  I do not know whether there is a unit within Government Buildings which tries to monitor the many regualtions and directives that come out of the <Col N="322" /> Commission and the Council of Ministers. A regulation of 1984 amends the European Regional Development Fund to allow for a large amount of funds to be available for research in various programmes which could possibly come under grant assistance from that fund. That regulation does not need enacting legislation in this country because it is a regulation from the EC.  It came into operation on 1 January 1985.  An indication of the inflexibility, immobility and inertia in Government Buildings is that it takes someone like me to go about inquiring, when we have many thousands of public servants who will never be unemployed as long as they are in the public service and the Civil Service.  Why can they not come up with this type of innovative approach and say exactly what is available to us in Europe in terms of developing various industries for which there are many millions of units of account in the EC at present? My colleague, Mr. Lalor, and I will be taking up this matter with the Department of Finance to ensure that a feasibility study is brought into being and that research is done in that area.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  It has a specific recommendation to set up a pilot scheme in the food processing area.  I should like to know tomorrow night if anything has been done since 11 July, the date of the publication of the White Paper, and if any specific measure has been taken. There are many recommendations in that paper which it must always be understood can only, at a maximum, create 5,000 jobs per year, which it totally inadequate. If we have no movement on trying to create 5,000 jobs per year, what hope is there of shortening the dole queues in the immediate future? It will be on that issue that this Government will stand or fall. Unless they show that a major effort is being made to redress this social evil they will have no chance at the polls. The Fine Gael Party are aware of that, which is why there are such disgruntled voices from their back benches.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the small industries programme of the IDA.  In <Col N="323" /> County Offaly in the last year only three projects received grant aid, two in relation to cheese and one in relation to distilled drinks to replace the Dew Mineral Waters factory in Tullamore which closed a few months ago.  It does not look as if that agency will redress the problems in my county.  There have recently been clinics on small industries in my constituency which I can guarantee not more that 20 people attended.  How can one get any reaction from people who might have an entrepreneurial spirit faced with the hopeless approach pursued by this Government? Nothing great can be achieved in Government or any area of life unless it is done with enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I was more distressed during the Adjournment Debate before Christmas at the tone set by the Tánaiste who ran through a prepared script and walked off as if there was no problem.  The attitude of this Government continues to be arrogant. They regard this part of the House as being destructive and, in the words of the Minister, to be talking in the terminology of the thirties.  I was not born in the thirties and I am not interested in them, nor are any of my constituents. However, I can tell the Government and the Minister that but for Fianna Fáil there would not be people living in the midlands. This was brought about by the dynamism of people like Lemass who set up Bord na Móna.  One must remember the old Cumann na nGael held attitude of James Dillon who regarded these achievements as white elephants in the red bogs of Ireland.  We now have his oratorical reincarnation in Deputy Kelly who also has phobia about State investment in the public sector.  If Deputy Kelly were representing Laois-Offaly, where 2,500 jobs are on the point of being lost at any moment, he would not applaud the performance of a Government which are simply setting up so-called independent bodies to look into electricity prices and so forth.  If this Government say that there is no option but to these jobs, let them have the political guts to say that they are making the policy decision in Laois-Offaly and cutting these 2,500 jobs <Col N="324" /> in Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Let them say that they are going to progress with Moneypoint.  I guarantee that progressing with Moneypoint would be at the expense of the turf-burning stations in Offaly.  The amount of money that the Government will have to spend on environmental protection when that totally coal-burning station is in full production will far outstrip whatever savings they hope for in closing the turf-burning stations in Offaly.</P>
    <P>A primary requirement of Government is to provide an alternative industry in my area if they do what they propose doing through this independent commission which they have set up.  With regard to this commission to inquire into the increase in price of electricity our then Minister for Energy, Deputy O'Malley, made a very valid point.  He asked why we were employing top advisers in the Department of Energy at £30,000 per year or whatever, if they cannot tell us why we are paying so much for electricity. Why must boards be set up when there is a major crisis in any sector of our economy?  We set up boards and bring in outsiders, while two-thirds of workers are employed in the public service.  Perhaps 40 per cent of these are in the Civil Service. If we are providing an adequate service and a proper Government structure there is no reason for having to go outside to find answers to problems which have been sitting on departmental desks for the last decade.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Our young people are becoming disillusioned because they see no response from Government Buildings.  These buildings have become a forum for a debating society.  They are no longer the centre for political action.  It is pressure groups and articulate vested interests who are having their say with this Government at present.  We have heard that the Minister for Social Welfare, a Labour Minister, has cut back on pay-related benefit and we are still awaiting widows and widowers getting the same supplementary help in terms of free telephone rentals and free fuel as deserted wives or unmarried mothers, although I have nothing against <Col N="325" /> these people and have the greatest sympathy for them.  If the Government are committed to young people and to trying to bring about a real change in society for the better, they must look further than <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The basic indicator in that document relates to keeping public sector pay at a low level.  We have seen from the arbitrator's decision over Christmas that that has now gone out the window and the underpinning statistic that keeps <i>Building on Reality</i> alive is now a dead duck.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy will not solve our unemployment problems.</P>
    <P>Regarding youth unemployment, 70,000 people under 25 years of age are at present unemployed.  We have a growing population which distinguishes us from our compatriots in the European Community. If we have a commitment to young people we need much greater investment in our educational system.  It is time that the third level institutions were brought to the centre of any industrial strategy which will be successful in redressing our major problem.  This has been done in other countries &mdash; Japan, West Germany, France. We will have an increasing number of pupils trying to get into third level education throughout the nineties and into the year 2000.  We must consider that the enrolment rate has increased in the age category for entering into third level education from 12 per cent in 1968 to over 20 per cent in 1980, an increase of over 66 per cent in the past decade. We need, as a matter of urgency, a proper programme in our educational system.</P>
    <P>If we have a commitment to them, we must provide facilities for young people. I say to the social democrats in Fine Gael and to the so-called socialists in Labour who talk about social justice, that if they continue leaving the present third level education buildings as they are, and increasing the fees without increasing the grant allocation at the same time, there will be an exclusive third level set-up. There will be far fewer people getting into third level education out of the growing number of applicants.  Only those with <Col N="326" /> the finance will be able to go ahead with this education.</P>
    <P>There is all the talk about social justice and equality of opportunity which rings very hollow to the many students denied an opportunity to develop personally and economically simply because they belong to a lower income group.  If this Government are serious about young people let us see some investment in them.  They should remember that one cannot get round young people merely by stating that borrowing is being kept to a certain percentage of GNP.  The only way in which young people can respond is through the provision of facilities, with the necessary capital investment, to enable them make the sort of contribution they will have to make if we are to redress this major social problem.</P>
    <P>Despite the many ideas put forward here this evening by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism we have seen very little action.  He spoke of the linkage programme with a view to substituting imports.  I have been talking about endeavouring to develop a research programme in my area for the food processing industry which, according to the director general of the Regional Policy Committee of the EC, is possible and to which there was a favourable response.  I should tell the Minister that I am talking about an industry through which we can substitute £600 million worth of foodstuffs at present imported which could be replaced by Irish produce. We heard so much from the Minister this evening about project development and technology for the nineties.  I am talking about harnessing the natural skills of our people in rural areas, that is a basic knowledge of agriculture.  Probably alone in this respect in the modern EC, we have many people with a good knowledge of agriculture.  It is those types of skills we should be harnessing rather than going in favour of major investment to bring about technological competence allowing us to increase our markets worldwide in those high-growth industries.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the tragedy of Ethiopia has brought home to us that people must be fed.  One can have all the technology <Col N="327" /> and star wars one likes but one's people must be fed.  There is in the EC an undercapacity in many agricultural products, vegetables etc. which we can provide. This Government are allowing the energy industry to be run down in some areas because they are not introducing the same type of maintenance budgets as heretofore in order to allow those plants to keep going.  They are simply allowing them to run down.  There appears now to be a conscious effort on their behalf to redress that situation because the Minister for Energy visited the Moneypoint plant recently and applauded the great work being done there.  It should be remembered that, after 50 years of Laois-Offaly people working hard to build an industry, lauded by anybody who knows about it, thousands of cutaway bog will revert to the moorlands of the twenties. At that stage probably it will revert to the natives only being able to use that area to hunt out snipe for the gentry in the shooting season.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that feelings run very high on this issue.  As a representative of Laois-Offaly I have a duty to let people in the ivory towers of Government Buildings know that we will not accept a run-down of that industry.  If the recent by-election results were insufficient to get the message across to the Government, I can assure them that when the next general election takes place if they do not nail their colours to the mast on this issue they will have no hope of receiving any decent Government representation in my constituency.  If they allow the present industry to be run down they must provide an alternative.  Our constituency has been denied, generation after generation since the fifties, any indigenous or indeed foreign-based industry, because we had Bord na Móna and the ESB.  It should be remembered that it was a Fianna Fáil Government who established that originally and who were castigated by the then Opposition.  A major responsibility rests on the Government in this respect.  I am providing constructive proposals which should be followed by well paid officials of the Department of Finance along with <Col N="328" /> the Regional Policy Committee of the EC to ensure proper planning so that in five or ten years time, or whenever, we will have an industry which will not alone provide food for this country but which will become an example to the European market.</P>
    <P>Only when we begin to start looking at things in that kind of perspective will we have any hope of curbing the present trend of rising unemployment.  Make no mistake about it, major social change will ensue unless people in my constituency, and the electorate generally, see a flexible, innovative approach on the part of Government.  Take the example of a young girl or boy leaving school with no skills, who is in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Because he or she is living at home, out of their means tested assistance of £42, will be deducted £29.  Are this Government trying to tell me that any 18 year old is prepared to live on £13 a week in this day and age? This is the type of contention made by young people when they listen to politicians talk about commitment to them and what a great natural resource they constitute.  It should be remembered that they will not become the great natural resource if they continue to be treated with that type of contempt.  Investment must be provided in the areas about which I have spoken, particularly in that of education, to allow them to acquire the types of skills about which the Minister spoke and which do not come out of thin air or walk out of the Irish Management Institute filtering down to the population. They will come about only if there is commitment on the part of this Government to the appropriate investment.  An economic correspondent writing in the papers around the New Year put it quite bluntly, that it is simply not enough to be triumphalist about keeping borrowing on target over the last 12 months.  We have seen from this document that the Government regarded the borrowing to be £645 million over the year.  It has been shown that they were £50 million under that target, which illustrates there was no need to abolish food subsidies because they cost only £16 million, meaning also that <Col N="329" /> another £34 million could have been injected into the economy over the last three months of last year.  I would say to the Government &mdash; if their borrowings have been under target &mdash; let the Department of Finance release the appropriate money which they are saving on the backs of the unemployed, giving them a chance to use those £34 million profitably.</P>
    <P>There has been much moralising, there have been many laudable recommendations from this and that committee but the time has now come for action.  The Government have now been two and a half years in office.  There has been the National Planning Board, the national plan and so many inter-departmental committees established without any action being taken on the ground.  At present the NESC report is being drafted and which is supposed to bring about new criteria in order that the Minister may redesignate certain areas which no longer require to be so but such is the inflexibility of the relevant regulations that seemingly we must await 30 per cent and 40 per cent unemployment before such areas are dealt with.  I should like some assurance, even at the conclusion of this debate, that everything is being done at full speed to have the recommendations of that report implemented.</P>
    <P>This Government will be remembered for the production of glossy reports, the contents of some of which carried good ideas.  I do not question the sincerity of any member of the Government benches. But until such time as these proposals are implemented on the ground, through the necessary heavy investment &mdash; because we have a growing population different from any other in Europe &mdash; and unless such investment is done over the next decade, there will be no hope whatever for the country and the Government will receive their answer when they face the people.  Until then we shall continue to be as constructive as possible despite the continued portrayal by the national handlers that the people on these benches are being destructive.</P>

      <P>To ask the Minister for Justice if he will have legal costs made available to the Hayes family of Dromcunnig, Abbeydorney, County Kerry, in the tribunal which is being held in Tralee in the Hayes baby case.</P>
      <P>I ruled that that matter was in order on the Adjournment in so far as it related to the question of the costs of the inquiry. I must make it clear, however, that any discussion on the matter at issue before the inquiry or the conduct of the inquiry by the judge or anybody else would be very much out of order because it is clearly a matter which is currently <i>sub judice</i>.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I should like to thank you for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  This is a Private Notice Question I put down to the Minister for Justice and to the Government.  I wish to request the Minister for Justice and the Government to have legal costs made available to Joanne Hayes and the Hayes family of Dromcunning, Abbeydorney, County Kerry, who are involved in the judicial tribunal which is being held in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case is known as the Kerry babies case.  The Hayes family are in pretty poor circumstances and they are not in a position to meet the legal costs involved in this tribunal.  As a family they are going through a very difficult time, and they should not be subject to the additional worry of the costs of the tribunal.  It is <Col N="331" /> very unfair of the Government to make a decision to hold a judicial inquiry without making legal costs available to the Hayes family, and particularly to Joanne Hayes, who are the principal witnesses in this case.  Joanne Hayes is there as a witness and not as a defendant.  She seems to be a citizen alone fighting for herself.  In my county Joanne Hayes has tremendous support from the people of her own parish in Abbeydorney and, indeed, tremendous support from the people of County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I will get away from it.  It is very important that the Government should make a decision here tonight to have the legal costs paid for the Hayes family.  They are under great strain and it would be a great help to the family if they got an assurance here tonight from the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Government that legal costs will be made available to them.  I know the judge is to make a decision at the end of the tribunal about the legal costs, but at this stage the Hayes family are going through enough without having to worry about whether or not legal costs will be made available to them.  I am not trying to pre-empt the decision of the judge at the end of the case, but the Minister for Justice could prevent a great deal of worry and trouble by making a decision on behalf of the Government to have legal costs made available to the Hayes family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy McEllistrim, for giving me some of his time to enable me to support the points he has made.  The Hayes family and the gardaí at the centre of the Kerry babies tribunal will be liable for thousands of pounds in legal costs. When the Minister announced in this House the setting up of the tribunal I specifically asked that the legal costs of all parties involved should be covered by the Government.  All parties involved have been under terrible pressures and strains during this inquiry.  Now they have to face massive bills for legal expenses. This adds to the pressures on them.  Their own individual financial position would not permit them to meet this financial burden which will have to be met by somebody at the end of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister appreciate the severe mental pressure which is being exerted on all the witnesses at the tribunal because of their uncertainty about the question of legal costs?  With the tribunal going on for so long and with costs mounting daily, the time has come for the Minister to clarify the Government's position on the question of costs.  I appeal to him to make an announcement tonight on this point.  Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done to all parties involved in this tribunal.  It was established by the Government, and witnesses called who have to employ expensive legal representatives to ensure that their legal rights are fully protected should not have to suffer financially.  Surely the Government will accept and honour their obvious financial responsibility and not pass the buck to the learned judge in charge of the tribunal.  The Government decided to seek to find out the truth in this sad situation and they must be liable for that privilege.  A Cheann Comhairle, in view of what you said at the outset I will refrain from mentioning the present trend of the tribunal and the treatment of witnesses, but they are of great concern not alone in Kerry but throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> While I appreciate the <Col N="333" /> concern of Deputy McEllistrim &mdash; and Deputy Foley &mdash; that must have prompted him to raise this matter, I have to remind the Deputy and the House generally that I dealt very fully with this matter when moving the Resolution to have the Tribunal of Inquiry established and in fact, in replying to the debate, I dealt specifically with questions raised in relation to the legal costs of the parties to the case &mdash; for the record, all that is to be found in column 2194 of the Official Dáil Report of the debate for 11 December 1984.</P>
      <P>As I explained then, the tribunal has power under section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, to direct that the costs of any person appearing before it should be paid by any other person, including the State, when, having regard to its findings and other relevant matters, it considers it equitable to do so.  As I said previously, there is therefore a clear legal framework for having the question of legal costs, and who should pay them, determined and in the circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on this question pending the completion of the inquiry and the issuing by the tribunal of any directions which it might decide to make under the power conferred on it by the statutory provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the way that the Oireachtas saw fit to deal with this matter when enacting the relevant legislation in 1979 and, whether we like it or not, that is the law <Col N="334" /> and we are bound by it.  My own view is that it is right in principle that the question of who should bear the costs should be decided by the tribunal and that it is right that such a decision should be taken in the light of the findings of the tribunal and on the basis of what the tribunal thinks is fair and reasonable.  The judge constituting the tribunal will have heard all the witnesses and in the course of setting out his findings will have decided where the rights and wrongs of the situation lie. He is the person who will, therefore, be best placed to decide this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right to expect the Minister or the Government, in the light of the clear provisions of the law, to say any more about this at this stage &mdash; certainly commitments cannot be given about the costs of any of the parties &mdash; and we should remember that there are other parties and that, so far, only part of the evidence has been heard.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point that the inquiry is in progress at present and that all persons who have an interest in the issues have been allowed by the tribunal to be legally represented before it and have an equal level of legal representation. There is no question, therefore, of any party being deprived of adequate legal representation for lack of means.</P>

    <P>The estimated cost of official car transport (i.e. £78,000) which applies to the cars of Government Ministers also applies to that used by the Leader of the Opposition.  A figure of £2,000 in respect of the occasional use of official car transport by the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs &mdash; who does not employ official drivers &mdash; is included in the figure of £6,923.41 above.</P>

      <P>): The State mining lease granted to Tara Mines Ltd. on 19 September 1975 provides for the payment of a royalty of 4½ per cent of the profits of the company as assessed by the Revenue Commissioners for purposes of corporation profits tax.  The profits of the company for tax purposes since trading commenced on 1 January 1978 have not been agreed with the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, no royalty payments have been made as yet by the company.  Having regard to that situation, consideration is being given to the question of what action might be taken in regard to the possible liability of the company for royalty.</P>

      <P>): The comments in a British Sunday newspaper to which the Deputy refers are, of course, entirely unacceptable and offensive to Irish people everywhere. They were made in the aftermath of the Brighton bombing and as the Deputy will be aware were totally unrepresentative of the general reaction of the British media following that outrage.  The utter horror with which the vast majority of the Irish people and the leaders of all the constitutional nationalist parties in Ireland view such terrorist acts is now I feel well understood in Britain.  Having said that, however, it is a serious matter when the editor of a British national newspaper writes in such a provocative, offensive and indeed racist way and entirely ignores the unanimous condemnation of the Brighton outrage expressed by political leaders here at home and by the Irish community organisations in Britain.  It would be a mistake, of course, to attach too much importance to such ignorant and bigoted remarks particularly when there is reason, as I say, to hope that there is now a greater understanding of our position in Britain. Nevertheless I can assure the Deputy that the embassy in London have drawn the attention of the relevant newspaper at a senior editorial level to the offence caused by these remarks.  I can also assure <Col N="39" /> him that in my contacts with British Ministers I have drawn attention to the damaging impact of such anti-Irish comments made in the British media on relationships within these islands and in particular on the position of the Irish community in Britain.  He will appreciate that in the context of the relationship between newspapers and Government both here and in Britain it is best to express our concern to political authorities in this general way.  The embassy in London will continue to monitor the British media for instances of such anti-Irish prejudice and protest to the individual print or electronic medium where appropriate.</P>

An amount of £8,807 was refunded to my Minister of State for transport costs while a further sum of £28,125 was paid by way of salary and expenses of two drivers provided for the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>): There are no grants as such available for this type of work.  However, there is provision in my Department's Vote for 1985 for expenditure of £1 million on special housing aid for elderly persons living alone.  In the context of the national plan there will be similar provisions in respect of 1986 and 1987. The particular scheme is administered by a task force set up under the aegis of my Department and the operation of the scheme is a matter for the various health boards.  Arising from the recent attacks on elderly persons, the task force have agreed to treat the fitting of locks, etc., to make dwellings more secure as work qualifying for assistance under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Allocations for 1985 have not yet been made with the exception of the grant in relief of domestic rates, the grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land, road grants and the local improvements scheme.  In the case of the grant in relief of domestic rates, allocations to local authorities have been increased by about 0.71 per cent in each case while the increase in the case of the grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land is about 0.87 per cent.  As in previous years minor adjustments may have to be made to take account of commitments from previous years.  Information on the 1982, 1983 and 1984 allocations follows together with details of the 1985 allocations for the grant in relief of domestic rates, the grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land, road grants and the local improvements scheme.</P>

However, from the information supplied by the Deputy, it appears that the person in question would not be entitled to a £1,000 new house grant because he is not a first time purchaser.  As he is now a local authority tenant he may be eligible for the £3,000 mortgage subsidy as a special category applicant.  The necessary application forms and details have accordingly been sent to him.  The question of sanctioning a loan is a matter for the local housing authority.</P>

      <P>There is no record of the receipt in my Department of an application for a new house grant from the person named.  An application was received from a person of the same surname and address in 1980 and the position in that case has not altered since my predecessor replied to a similar question on 5 July 1983.  The problem in this case is that the applicant has not so far confirmed that his house is completed and occupied.  Neither has he responded to a request by the Department in relation to the execution of his mortgage deed.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 require, <i>inter alia</i>, that when in use in a public place: (a) a motorcycle must be fitted with a silencer to reduce noise to a reasonable level, (b) the silencer must be maintained in good order and may not be altered in such a way as would cause greater noise, and (c) a motor cycle may not be driven in a manner as to cause excessive noise which could be avoided if reasonable care were exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement of those regulations is a matter for the Garda Síochána and penalties are imposed by the courts for breaches of the provisions.

      <P>Primary responsibility for the conservation and future planning and development of the amenities in the Dublin Bay area rests with local authorities. As planning authorities, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation are obliged to include objectives in their development plans for the preservation and improvement of amenities in their areas and to take such steps as may be necessary for securing these objectives.</P>
      <P>As sanitary authorities, the three local authorities are responsible for the provision of water and sewerage systems and are involved in a number of projects which will improve the water quality in Dublin Bay.  It is expected that the greater Dublin drainage scheme which is being jointly provided by Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation will be operational by early spring this year.  This scheme will improve the quality of effluent being discharged into Dublin Bay with a resultant improvement in the water quality of the bay itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contract documents for the extension (Phase II) of the sewage treatment works, Ringsend scheme, are at present under technical examination in my Department.  This scheme will provide extra capacity at the Ringsend works which will ultimately facilitate the treatment of sewage from the greater Dublin drainage scheme.  I hope to be in a position to convey a decision to Dublin Corporation on this scheme shortly.  The <Col N="71" /> Ringsend works provide primary treatment of sewage discharging to Dublin Bay.  The provision of such is consistent with the conclusions of Professor Crisp's report which showed that the assimilative capacity of the receiving waters in Dublin Bay is adequate to take the discharge of effluent which has received primary treatment.</P>
    <P>The preliminary report submitted by Dún Laoghaire Corporation for Stage 2 of the Blackrock main drainage scheme (Option 3) is under examination in my Department at present.  I hope to convey a decision to the corporation on the report very shortly.  This scheme when operational will further improve the quality of effluent discharging into the bay.</P>
    <P>In September 1984, the Minister of State at my Department requested the three Dublin local authorities to co-operate in the preparation of a water quality management plan for Dublin Bay.  I have recently been informed that the elected members of all three authorities have now approved of proposals that An Foras Forbartha be requested to undertake the studies required for the preparation of such a plan for the bay and the tidal section of the River Liffey, and that the Eastern Regional Development Organisation would commission An Foras to carry out the work and provide the necessary co-ordination of the project.  The preparation of a water quality management plan will do much to establish the facts, identify the direction for future policy in relation to trade and sewage discharges and establish a framework within which the bathing places and other amenities in the bay area can be preserved and developed.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. D.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">

      <P>As the operation of traffic lights is a matter for the road authorities themselves it would not be appropriate for me to issue such a directive.  However, road authorities are given every encouragement to provide traffic light synchronisation, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Since 1979, Dublin Corporation have operated a central computer system to which traffic signals have been connected on a phased basis, the first phase of which will be completed this year.  On completion of this project, known as Urban Traffic Control (UTC), traffic signals on all the main traffic routes within the approximate boundary of the Grand Canal and the North Circular road, will be synchronised.  The cost of this scheme has, since 1982, been financed fully by State grants, paid by the Department of Communications.</P>
      <P>It is the general policy of each of the road authorities in the Dublin area to provide synchronisation on the major routes where this is desirable and feasible. However, outside the area covered by the UTC system, the scope for synchronisation is limited, having regard to factors such as the type and volume of traffic and frequency of junctions.</P>

      <P>Regarding directional traffic signs this is a function of the road authorities. There is an on-going programme, financed with 100 per cent State grants, for the provision of improved signs of this nature on the national roads.  This programme will continue until all national roads are adequately signposted. In the case of roads other than national roads, it is a matter for each road authority to decide the priority to be given to signposting and to provide the necessary finance from their own resources (including <Col N="73" /> the rate support grant), supplemented by the annual block grant provided by the Department.</P>
      <P>In a memorandum which was issued yesterday to road authorities in connection with road grant allocations for 1985, road authorities were reminded of the need to rectify any deficiencies in signposting.  The provision of street name plates is entirely a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the position is as stated in the Question.  State grants for private forestry are paid solely at the Minister's discretion.  In so far as existing landowners are concerned&mdash; irrespective of the location of their lands <i>vis-à-vis</i> State forests &mdash; there is no restriction on payment of a planting <Col N="87" /> grant, provided that the work fulfils the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In situations where land is being purchased for planting in the vicinity of a State forest and which in the Minister's opinion would more appropriately be incorporated in the on-going build-up of that forest, the Minister reserves the right to withhold a planting grant.  Prospective purchasers are advised to inquire in advance from my Department as to whether the lands being purchased will be deemed eligible for grant aid.  In practice, the exercise of the Minister's right to refuse grant is kept to the minimum.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department had been considering a substantial development scheme, including an extension to the pier, for Schull harbour when it came to light that the existing pier, which will be the basis for the new scheme, was deteriorating rapidly.  Following a survey of the damage, it was concluded that a boring survey of the pier foundations would be necessary before repairs could be undertaken, towards the cost of which I had approved a substantial grant to Cork County Council.  The results of the boring survey are expected shortly but until they are examined I cannot say when the repairs to the existing structure, which are essential to the main scheme, can be put in hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>): The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>As regards the remainder of the question, it would appear that the Deputy is concerned with the position of an employee whose employer defaults in the payment of PAYE and PRSI.  Such default does not in general place the employee at any disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In the case of PAYE, if the tax is deducted but not remitted to the Revenue it is the practice to give the employee credit for the tax deducted and to repay any tax over-deducted provided the employee supplies reasonable proof that the deduction has taken place.</P>
      <P>As regards PRSI, benefits will be paid provided the Minister for Social Welfare is satisfied that the default in paying PRSI has not been with the consent or connivance of, or is not attributable to any negligence on the part of, the insured person.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am satisfied that the position of an employee whose employer defaults is adequately protected under existing legislation and practice and that further action such as that suggested by the Deputy is not necessary.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that, in addition to her earnings from employment, the taxpayer has since the year 1981-82 been in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance.  The amounts received by way of deserted wife's allowance are, under existing law, chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the tax is collected by restricting the tax-payer's tax-free allowances by the amount of the allowance which is then paid without deduction of tax.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer first revealed that she was in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance in a return of income dated 9 April 1984. Her tax-free allowances under PAYE were not restricted to take account of this allowance for any year prior to 1983-84.</P>

However, the coast protection works carried out at Rosslare between 1957 and 1965, which have been maintained by the Commissioners of Public Works, have been successful in holding the beach line, thus averting further recession of the coastline.

      <P>On 30 October 1984 I met with a delegation from St. Michael's House when we discussed the difficulties being experienced by that organisation.  Following this meeting I increased the 1985 allocation to St. Michael's House by £150,000 to meet some pay costs which had, heretofore, been met from private resources.</P>
      <P>There is also at present an adult day care unit under construction at Belcamp, County Dublin.  This unit will provide 70 places for mentally handicapped persons. It will be ready for occupation in March and the staffing requirements are being considered by my Department at present.</P>

      <P>Eligible persons have to wait approximately six months for dentures in Waterford city and county.  This is due to curtailment by the health board of the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme due to lack of funds and to staff shortages at the health board's dental clinics.  Every effort is being made to bring the dental staff complement of the health board up to full strength and this should result in an improvement in the provision of dentures in 1985.</P>

    <P>The issue and withdrawl of medical cards is a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board.  The basic criterion for issue of a medical card is that the applicant be unable to arrange general practitioner services for himself and his dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines are issued annually for the purposes of guidance in the determination of eligibility for medical cards.  I would however stress that the issue of a medical card in any particular case is at the discretion of the relevant CEO.</P>
    <P>Similarly, medical cards are withdrawn when it becomes evident that the holder no longer satisfies the criterion for possession of a medical card.  The figures indicated in the above table take account of changes in the manner of assessing the eligibility of persons aged 16-25, bringing the manner of assessment into line with that applied to the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>The national position regarding the number of valid medical cards and the number of persons covered (including dependents) on 30 November 1984 (the latest date for which figures are available) and 31 December 1982 is indicated below.</P>

      <P>Managers of branch employment offices are employed under a contract for service and as such are not permanent and pensionable civil servants. There is a scheme of retirement gratuities for branch managers who retire on grounds of age or ill health or abolition of office but there is no provision within this scheme to allow for service in the Defence Forces to be taken into account in the calculation of the gratuity.  This scheme was negotiated and drawn up as an agreed recommendation within the context of the Branch Manager's Conciliation Council.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme, which forms part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, was introduced in 1980 principally for the benefit of elderly or incapacitated persons depending on long-term social welfare or health board payments.  Recipients of short-term payments were not included. Guidelines for the operation of the scheme have been issued to health boards each year in a Departmental circular before the commencement of the heating season.</P>
      <P>In the recent High Court judgment the judge ruled that a phrase in the circular relating to the non-inclusion in the scheme of persons receiving short-term social welfare payments was <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister and that the health board was therefore incorrect in disallowing the application of the person concerned on the strength of the circular in question.</P>
      <P>To establish the legal basis of the scheme it is proposed to make regulations prescribing the conditions for the granting of fuel allowances under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme under the powers which are provided in the legislation to prescribe matters in relation to that scheme.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that the husband of the person concerned must have left her of his own volition.  In order to assist in establishing this it is a routine requirement in cases where a divorce is involved, that a copy of the divorce petition by the party initiating the divorce proceedings be produced.  The <Col N="131" /> reason for this is that this document normally relates the reasons upon which the divorce is sought and may give an indication towards resolving whether the husband left of his own volition.</P>
      <P>As there appears to be particular difficulties in this case in producing the required documentation, the local officer of the Department is now being asked to investigate the matter further with a view to ascertaining if the information which is required to enable a decision to be made on the person's application can be obtained without recourse to the documentation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts, an increase in respect of an adult dependant is an integral part of the pension and is payable to the pensioner.  It is only paid direct to the adult dependant where the <Col N="152" /> domestic circumstances provide sufficient grounds to warrant such an arrangement, e.g. in a case where the pensioner does not provide for the dependant on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Requests from the person concerned to have the increase in respect of an adult dependant paid direct to her have been investigated on two occasions and she, as well as the husband, was interviewed by the officer.  The evidence available to the Department as a result of these investigations is, however, that the husband gives the amount of the increase to her each week.  In the circumstances there are not sufficient grounds to warrant payment of the increase directly to herself.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare in view of the many attacks on our senior citizens if he will now consider abolishing the means-test on old age pensions so as to allow and encourage them to deposit their savings in saving institutions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation governing the old age pension scheme the value of savings must be taken into account in determining the amount of pension to which a person is entitled.  In calculating means however there are various exemptions and a person can in fact have a large amount of savings and still qualify for pension.  A single person can have savings of up to £2,987.50 and a married <Col N="160" /> couple double that amount and still qualify for full old age pension.  Reduced rate pensions may be paid to persons with savings of up to £2,747.50 for a single person and double that amount for a married couple.</P>
      <P>The attacks to which the Deputy refers are a cause for serious concern.  People must be dissuaded from keeping money at home which could expose them to the risk of such attacks and to this end a leaflet is currently being distributed through post offices to all social welfare pensioners.  This leaflet gives details of the sums non-contributory pensioners may hold and still qualify for pension.</P>
      <P>Abolition of the means test for old age pension, which would lead to additional expenditure estimated at approximately £150 million in a full year, is not a feasible option in present circumstances.  The existence of the means test should not cause pensioners to keep their savings at home and every effort is being made to ensure that they do not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was awarded a retirement pension from 23 February 1984 at the maximum rate payable to a single man.  The rate payable since 4 July 1984 is £47.55.  He had previously been in receipt of invalidity pension to 20 June 1984, at the maximum appropriate rate and arrears of retirement pension in respect of the period from 23 February 1984 to 20 June 1984 less the amount of invalidity pension paid to him in the same period were paid by payable order on 25 June 1984.</P>
      <P>The weekly rates of pension were increased from 5 July 1984.  A supplementary invalidity pension book implementing this increase at the weekly rate of £2.80 had been issued to the designated post office of payment in April 1984.  This book was not returned to the Department but was cashed by the pensioner in addition to his retirement pension.  This resulted in an overpayment of £36.40 which is being recovered by deducting the sum of £2 per week from his retirement pension from 6 December 1984.  The overpayment will be fully recovered on 3 April 1985 and the rate of retirement pension will then be restored to £47.55.</P>

      <P>A detailed explanation of the reasons why the person concerned did not qualify for a widow's contributory pension was given in a written reply to a previous question from the Deputy about this case, answered on 3 May 1984.</P>
      <P>There has been no change in the position since that date.  The qualifying conditions for receipt of a widow's contributory pension are not satisfied on the claimant's own, or her late husband's, insurance record.</P>
      <P>All insurance numbers given by the Deputy were taken into account when the claim to widow's contributory pension was initially examined and subsequently disallowed.  The &ldquo;old insurance number&rdquo; quoted refers to a man of the same name but not the claimant's late husband.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claimant is currently receiving widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £58.25.  This is the rate payable to a widow under 66 years with three qualified children who has weekly means exceeding £20 but not exceeding £22.  Her means derived from a two thirds <Col N="170" /> share in a farm holding are assessed at £20.46 a week.  An application from her for an increase in this pension on the grounds of reduced means is at present with a local officer for investigation and she will be notified of the outcome as soon as the officer reports.</P>

However, following that examination the medical referee expressed the opinion that he was capable of work and consequently further payment of disability benefit was disallowed.

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of an unmarried mother's allowance since 31 March 1983.  She returned her allowance book on 30 <Col N="183" /> December 1983 because she had commenced employment.  Following a report by a social welfare officer it was confirmed that she had been employed from 21 October 1983 and her means exceeded the limit from that date.  Her allowance was consequently terminated, with effect from 27 October 1983.  However she had cashed her allowance book up to 4 January 1984 and in so doing incurred an overpayment amounting to £524.70.  Since she did not make other arrangements for refunding this overpayment, it is being deducted over a period from other payments being made to her by the Department.  She reapplied for unmarried mother's allowance on 31 October 1984 and the allowance was restored to her with effect from 1 November 1984.  An allowance book with orders payable from 20 December 1984 was issued to her.  These orders are for a net amount of £45.05 per week, after allowing for a deduction of £6 per week towards recouping the overpayment.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the person concerned had also been claiming unemployment benefit and £5 per week had been deducted from this towards the repayment. Deductions from this ceased with effect from the week commencing 27 December 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrears of £408.40 in respect of unmarried mother's allowance were due for the period from 1 November 1984 to 19 December 1984.  Against this amount £219.76 was offset in respect of excess unemployment benefit of £219.76 already paid for the same period and which arose because of the reduction in the rate of unemployment benefit payable to her to half the personal rate from 1 November 1984 consequent on her concurrent entitlement to unmarried mother's allowance. This left a balance of arrears of unmarried mother's allowance for that period of £188.64 which was offset against the earlier overpayment.  The balance of the overpayment was then £116.91.  Since then a further £5 was recovered from the unemployment benefit payment in respect of the week commencing 20 December 1984 and £30 has <Col N="184" /> been deducted from the unmarried mother's allowance in respect of the five weeks since 20 December 1984.  This leaves a net balance outstanding of £81.91 at present.</P>

      <P>Special arrangements were made to issue disability benefit payments over the Christmas period which resulted in payment being issued to 24 December 1984 in advance of medical evidence.  There was a delay in issuing further payment because it came to light that he was in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the health board from 25 December 1984.

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 565 and 566 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sporadic occurrences of tuberculosis in badgers and deer have been confirmed but available evidence suggests that infection in these species has not been a very significant factor in the spread of the disease.  Extensive epidemiological studies indicate that in the main the disease spreads from herd to herd through direct <Col N="197" /> contact between animals, the result in many instances of inadequate boundary fencing.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, epidemiological investigations have been instituted by my Department to determine the most likely cause of disease spread in the area.  My Department does not rule out the possibility of wildlife being a factor and the involvement of badgers is being explored further with the co-operation of the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>As regards the future of the disease eradication programme, I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 7.36 of the Government's National Plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to TB breakdowns in herds in the Ballybay, Carrickmacross, Clones and Clontibret areas.  These were largely attributable to <Col N="198" /> lateral spread of the disease due to poor fencing and fragmentation of holdings.</P>
