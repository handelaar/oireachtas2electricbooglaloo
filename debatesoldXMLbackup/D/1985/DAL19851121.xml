      <P>The Chair is operating under an order of the House which was made on Tuesday for the conduct of this debate.  In regard to time-sharing a practice crept in here during recent times of splitting time.  It was usually done by an order of the House.  It was sometimes done informally.  I have now decided that, as from now, there will be no more time sharing unless it is done under an order of the House before the debate begins.  Otherwise the Chair will proceed in accordance with the Standing Order.</P>

    <Title>Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach on Tuesday, 19 November 1985:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, 1985, between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom which was signed at Hillsborough, Co. Down, on 15 November, 1985 and copies of which have been laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;having regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland;</P>
    <P>recalling the unanimous Declaration of Dáil Éireann adopted on the joint proposition of An Taoiseach, John A. Costello and the Leader of the Opposition, Eamon de Valera, on 10 May 1949 solemnly reasserting the indefeasible right of the Irish Nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory;</P>
    <P>recalling that all the parties in the New Ireland Forum were convinced that a united Ireland in the form of a sovereign independent state would offer the best and most durable basis for peace and stability;</P>
    <P>re-affirming the unanimous conclusion of the Report of the New Ireland Forum that the particular structure of political unity which the <Col N="2968" /> Forum would wish to see established is a unitary state achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the unionist and nationalist identities;</P>
    <P>while recognising the urgent need that exists for substantial improvement in the situation and circumstances of the nationalist section of the community in the North of Ireland and approving any effective measures which may be undertaken for that purpose, refuses to accept any recognition of British sovereignty over any part of the national territory;</P>
    <P>and requests the Government to call upon the British Government to join in convening under the joint suspices of both governments a constitutional conference representative of all the traditions in Ireland to formulate new constitutional arrangements which would lead to uniting all the people of Ireland in peace and harmony.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Haughey).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am resuming where I left off last night and I am prompted to recall a statement made by the founder of this party when he resumed a speech in Ennis by saying, &ldquo;As I was saying before I was interrupted...&rdquo;, referring to his having been taken away as a guest of the British nation.  I do not claim to be in the same category since it was the time of the House which caused me to be interrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subscribe unreservedly to the desire for peace, unity and justice for all the citizens of this island and particularly for the Irish people and the Nationalist people in the Six Counties.  I am not inferring simply geographical or political unity.  Those things, yes, but unity in mind, body, soul and spirit as well.  These are the aims for which my party were set up and to which I subscribe.  These were the aims for which people strove through centuries of oppression and which caused the many insurrections and blows for <Col N="2969" /> freedom.  The patriotic phrase &ldquo;Ireland unfree shall never be at peace&rdquo; is the true position to this day.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, distasteful and objectionable that this Government should have signed an agreement which reinforces the British shackles on this island and on our people in the Six Counties. It is also regrettable and despicable that the Taoiseach and his Government are collaborating with the British Government against the wishes of the majority of the people of this island. Nowhere in that agreement is there one sentence, one word of commitment by the United Kingdom Government to remove themselves and their supports from this island.  Until that indication is given and that commitment is written into an agreement, any other agreement falls completely short of what is required.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing much from Government speakers about the agreement giving the Government the facility to make proposals and suggestions.  I contend that this is nothing new.  We have been making protests, suggestions and proposals, but of course, Britain being the final arbiter on any such proposals or suggestions means that we have not gained much, if anything, from our proposals. This agreement does not alter that position one way or another.  We may make what proposals and suggestions we like, but it was clearly stated and confirmed at least three times during the press conference after the signing that final decisions on matters relating to the Six Counties are the property of the British Government, while decisions for the Twenty-six Counties are to be made by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Why that was added I am not so sure. Was there something sinister in that indication by the British Prime Minister at the press conference?  More than once it was indicated during the press conference that the Six Counties are still the property of the United Kingdom Government. That sovereignty was subscribed to by our Taoiseach by his assent.  He was sitting beside her and did not give any indication <Col N="2970" /> that what she was saying was unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>A very well orchestrated propaganda job was carried out in support of this agreement.  It was very sad for the people of this island to learn of the confirmation by this Government in an agreement with the UK Government of the partition of our country.  I indicated earlier in my speech the various facets of the creation of Partition and the confirmation of it by the repeal of the External Relations Act, but this agreement stitches into an international agreement for all time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the partition of our country.  People supporting this Government and accepting that position should examine their consciences as to where they stand with regard to unity.  Of course they may be taking a lead from the fact that the Taoiseach is regretting that Articles 2 and 3 are in the Constitution. We have heard again and again about the legitimacy of the Unionist position, which we are well aware is totally against unification.  We on this side of the House have always said that there is room for each tradition, culture and ideology in this island.  Even to the present day we have people in the Twenty-six Counties who are loyal to the union and to the British Crown.  There were many more of them when the State was set up but gradually they became part of the so-called Twenty-six County Republic. There is only one Republic as far as I am concerned and it has 32 counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not helping to achieve unity by stitching into an international agreement the confirmation of what was done in setting up the Six Counties by means of a mythical Border.  The purpose of the agreement, the bottom line, is devolved administration in the Six Counties and <Col N="2971" /> then it is proposed to liquidate the Conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Liquidation is the hallmark of this Government.  I conclude by saying to my friends from Cork, former lord mayors, that those who have their photograph taken so often under the portraits of MacSweeney and MacCurtain should think of their ideals.  It is attributed to Traolach Mac Suibhne that he said: &ldquo;That we will achieve our freedom I have no doubt &mdash; that we will use it well I am not sure&rdquo;.  This is an indication of the measure of freedom which we have achieved not being used so well in this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be contentious but, listening to Deputy Lyons last night and this morning, I have to say that the type of speech he made is not part of the solution of the problems of this island but is part of the problem.  It is symptomatic of the partitionist mentality and the type of rhetoric that has done more to contribute to the problems we have today than it has ever contributed to healing those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney sought to make a speech yesterday evening but was not permitted to do so.  However, like other Members I have had the privilege of reading the speech and I wish to share some of the sentiments which she sought to express, and may yet have the opportunity of expressing, by saying with her and with colleagues on this side of the House such as Deputy Yates, Deputy Birmingham and others that as a member of the younger generation of politicians I have no interest in the tired sloganeering and redunant pseudo-nationalistic rhetoric which has contributed to rather than healed the divisions on this island.  I have no interest in perpetuating the politics of the past which have copperfastened not merely the territorial partition of this island but the partition of hearts and minds of the people of two different traditions on this island to the degree that for decades we ceased to talk to each <Col N="2972" /> other and merely talked at each other, neither side really listening to what the other was saying and not really interested.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House I believe that I and all other democratically elected Members, have a duty to adopt new approaches and attitudes, to establish the framework for new structures which create the possibility of reconciliation and give to all those living in the North, particularly, the young people there the hope and possibility of peace.  My commitment is to see a return to normality on this island and an end to the tragic and senseless loss of life and violence we have seen over the last 16 years.  As democratically elected constitutional Nationalists, our primary concern must be to bring an end to violence and to establish the conditions within which there can be reconciliation between the two fragmented communities in the North and a healing of the divisions which exist between the peoples of two different traditions.  A recognition of the existence of these two traditions, each imbued with different identities, political allegiances, aspirations and ethos was for the first time unequivocally and unanimously recognised as a political reality by all the constitutional Nationalist parties in the State in the Forum report.  The need to accommodate the aspirations of the two traditions with new and workable political structures was also clearly articulated in that report in paragraph 4.15 which states:</P>
    <P>The solution to both the historic problem and the current crisis of Northern Ireland and the continuing problem of relations between Ireland and Britain necessarily requires new structures that will accommodate together two sets of legitimate rights:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the right of nationalists to effective political, symbolic and administrative expression of their identity; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the right of unionists to effective political, symbolic and administrative expression of their identity, their ethos and their way of life.</P>
    <P>The agreement entered into on Friday <Col N="2973" /> last at Hillsborough provides a framework within which the legitimate rights of both traditions are recognised and can provide the basis for a system of Government within Northern Ireland in which both communities can participate on equal terms.  The agreement affords an opportunity for a new beginning after 16 years of the most terrible bloody violence and instability which has at times threatened to engulf the whole island and which has in the short space of time since the signing of the agreement resulted in the death of three more people in the North.</P>
    <P>It is an agreement born of a desire by the people on this part of the island, certainly by Members on this side of the House and also born of a desire held by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, some of whom have not been given an opportunity of speaking, to provide for peace and stability within a political framework which can, if given the opportunity to operate, provide the essential fabric to surmount and overcome the deep fears of the Unionist community and the deep sense of alienation felt by the Nationalist community.  It provides a mechanism for the beginning of a solution.  None of us pretend that it is a solution in itself.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Cluskey's speech yesterday and I share all the anxieties and concerns expressed by him as to how events may unfold over the next six to twelve months.  Anyone in this House who pretends that this is the solution to the problem is talking nonsense but I do not think that anyone is suggesting that.  We are merely saying that this provides a new framework within which a solution can be found.  We have a duty to provide such a framework and there is also a duty on Members of this House and the Government to do something to solve the problems on this island.  Successive attempts in the past ten years to provide for a power-sharing Executive or form of partnership within the confines of Northern Ireland within which both communities could participate at an executive level in the administration of Northern Ireland, have sadly failed.  As a result, a new framework had <Col N="2974" /> to be found which offered the opportunity of peace and progress.  We now have the framework but, effectively having provided it, we must now wait and see how things develop over the next 12 months.  We must seek to ensure that we overcome the very real fears which exist in the Unionist population.</P>
    <P>No one in this House wishes to replace the alienation of the minority community in the North with a new-found alienation on the part of the majority community there.  Let no one in this House underestimate the fears of the Unionist majority or seek to dismiss or ridicule them.  These fears are bred of a belief that this agreement is the first step along the road to their being forced against their will into a united Ireland within which, they believe, their cultural heritage will not survive and in which they also believe that their religious and civil liberties will be threatened and diminished. They distrust and do not believe us when we say that we have no such intentions.  They look to our Constitution and various laws in this State and perceive them as unduly favouring the ethos of the majority religion on this island and fear for their future.  They see the preservation of the British link as a guarantee that they will not be drawn into and submerged within what they perceive as a State whose civil laws and administrative practices are, in areas of particular sensitivity, dominated by the influence of the Roman Catholic Church.  Every time a bishop in Limerick or the Archbishop of Dublin instructs or lectures Members of this House on their duty to legislate in accordance with the teachings of the majority Church, the fears of the Northern Unionists and Protestants are heightened and their perception of the threat posed by us to them is, in their eyes, confirmed.</P>
    <P>It has been said by the Taoiseach and other speakers, but it must be said over and over again in the hope that someone in a position of leadership within the Unionist community in the North will listen and accept our bona fides, that this agreement is not an attempt to provide for unity by stealth or to drag or coerce <Col N="2975" /> one million people into a Republican State with which they cannot identify and of which they wish to be no part.  This agreement affirms that no change can be brought about in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority of its people.  This principle should provide the Unionist community and the Northern Protestant majority with the assurance that is needed to lay to rest the fears that have been aroused within that community and the fears which men who seek to benefit from raising such fears are seeking to generate.</P>
    <P>It is our duty in the weeks to come to emphasise our commitment and our desire to bring about peace and reconciliation.  If on occasion what we say is greeted with disbelief we need to remember that the problem of the North today, the suspicions and fears of the Unionist leadership, are not a British problem or of British creation, not a creation simply of the UK Government which some people on the other side seem to suggest religiously as a matter of theology.  The problems of the north today are as much our creation as of the British.  Just as the Unionist community over the years have used political slogans and Lambeg drums as a substitute for political analysis, we on this side of the Border have shouted &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo;, and spoken of unity in terms of territory and not people, in total disregard of the traditions and aspirations of the Northern majority.</P>
    <P>To the Nationalist community the establishment of the Inter-governmental Conference as envisaged in the agreement is a recognition of their aspirations and a recognition in a formal treaty by the UK Government of the right of this State to speak for the Nationalist community.  It will be the concern of the two Governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, operating as of right as parties in the Conference, to deal with measures that affect the government of Northern Ireland.  The agreement extends to this State, for the first time as a legal right, an opportunity to contribute to peace and reconciliation in a manner never previously possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2976" /> Members of the Fianna Fáil Party have contended that the agreement offers us nothing.  To that, it is worth saying that it extends to us for the first time since the foundation of this State the possibility of making a constructive contribution to the administration of Northern Ireland beyond merely engaging in rhetoric from this side of the Border.  It affords and extends to us in the form of an international agreement an entitlement and a right not previously afforded to us.  It affords us an opportunity to extend to the Nationalist community a form of representation that they had not perceived as possible to date and which responds to and recognises their political aspirations.</P>
    <P>Like my constituency colleague, Deputy Kelly, Deputy Cluskey and others who have spoken, it was my hope that this agreement, of itself, could provide for a system of devolved government in Northern Ireland in which the democratically elected representatives of both traditions could work together for the benefit of all the people in the North of Ireland.  But for devolution to work, an essential prerequisite is a general acceptance in both communities that there should be mutual participation in an executive decision making process.  To date, that has not proved possible and there has been a failure on the part of the Unionist community to recognise the need for the minority community to participate at executive level in the administration of Northern Ireland.  It is to be hoped that in the not too distant future the approach and the attitude of the Unionist majority will change.  The desire to achieve devolution and the intention to seek it again in a way that will be acceptable to both communities are implicit in this agreement because the agreement envisages certain powers to be exercised within the Conference being devolved to a Northern Ireland executive acceptable to both communities.  The hope must be that we will see such a form of devolution in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Curiously, little if any reference has <Col N="2977" /> been made during the debate to the proposal in the agreement for the establishment of an Anglo-Irish parliamentary body.  This emerges from the document published in 1971, the Anglo-Irish Joint Studies Report, and it is my hope that Members of the House, including those Members on the Opposition benches who are so hung up in the rhetoric of Republicanism and unity, will see the benefits and possibilities implicit in the establishment of an Anglo-Irish parliamentary body, not as a parliamentary forum to dominate the Unionists but as one capable of creating the possibility of establishing a forum within which democratic politicians could come together representing not merely the Dáil and the Westminister Parliament but also including democratically elected politicians from the North who are not currently members of the Westminister Parliament. They could join with us in a parliamentary body in which they could express their views and their opposition and allow for an interchange of views and an intermingling of thought which has not proved possible since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I would hope to have support from all Members of the House in calling on all sides to establish such an Anglo-Irish parliamentary body as soon as possible with a view to providing a forum for dialogue and debate of a constitutional nature, a forum in which all of us on all sides representing all traditions might isolate the men of violence from both communities.</P>
    <P>I have listened more in sadness than anger to the Fianna Fáil contributions. Artificial irrelevant arguments about <i>de jure</i> recognition of British sovereignty and alleged constitutional violations are of no relevance to the thousands of families in the North of Ireland who have seen husbands, wives and children killed and maimed.  Curiously, little reference has been made by Members on the other side to the plight of those families and their concerns.  We have had what I would describe as an up beat version of irridentist green republicanism, speeches by <Col N="2978" /> members of a party locked into the politics of the past, caught in some kind of time warp or twilight zone in which the realities of today are based on what happened in the twenties.  The vast majority of the people who are being killed in the North of Ireland today neither know nor care what happened in Ireland in the twenties or thirties.  What they are anxious to see is a return to normality in their community and an end to the killings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  There has been talk of subverting the Constitution, of moving away from our constitutional commitments.  In his contribution last night, Deputy Flynn went so far as to suggest that the Taoiseach was disloyal to the Constitution, a sort of Fianna Fáil version of the shouts of &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; that the more extreme Unionists have thrown at the UK Prime Minister in the Westminster Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the long, irrelevant and inaccurate legal lecture delivered by the Leader of the Opposition, it was interesting to note his anxiety to quote Article 2 of the Constitution but very coyly to avoid any specific reference to the content of Article 3.  Article 2 refers to the national territory consisting of the whole island of Ireland.  It is on that Article that Members of the Opposition have sought to beat the drum and said we were all about to subvert the Constitution &mdash; it was suggested that in some way we were handing over or renouncing a sovereign claim to portion of this island over which we currently exercise jurisdiction.  Of course, the fallacy in this entire argument can be realised when you look at Article 3 and discover that the drafter of this Constitution, a former Leader of Fianna Fáil and former President, Eamon de Valera, had a far clearer view of where our jurisdiction lay.  Article 3 states:</P>
    <P>Pending the re-integration of the national territory, and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application <Col N="2979" /> as the laws of Saorstát Éireann and the like extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>The Article effectively says that all laws passed by this Parliament apply to the Twenty-six Counties, to the Republic of Ireland as currently constituted, and have no application of any nature whatsoever to the North of Ireland.  That Article effectively recognises the dominion of the UK Parliament over the North of Ireland and its power to pass laws that affect its daily life.  The Article constitutes a recognition of the fact that we in this State do not exercise a sovereignty over the people of Northern Ireland to date.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the Constitution, which the Leader of the Opposition did not wish to quote, or forgot to refer to, does not confine the Irish nation to any territorial expanse and does not proscribe the Irish nation, whether some of us wish it to be there or not, from having a form of territorial boundary or border on this island and different forms of government. That Article refers to the Irish nation affirming its inalienable and indefeasible right to determine its relations with other nations and to develop its life, political, economic and cultural in accordance with its own genius and traditions.</P>
    <P>The problem with the rhetoric of Irish territorial unity and with the redundant Republic rhetoric of decades gone is that it was based on the recognition of one tradition only on this island and never sought to implement the aspirations and intent of Article 1 of the Constitution which was to give a real recognition and role to the different traditions.  For the first time in the history of the State that role is properly recognised and being given the opportunity to flourish in the context of the Hillsborough agreement.</P>
    <P>References have been made to our abandoning the claim to Irish unity.  In this agreement we are not abandoning anything because the agreement effectively respects the different aspirations of the two different traditions in the North and also our claims and aspirations on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2980" /> Personally, I would accord much greater importance, however, to the achievement of unity and reconciliation between peoples than to the achievement of a territorial unity.  To Fianna Fáil it appears that the territorial imperative comes first.  As a party who subscribed to the Forum report it appears that Fianna Fáil have learned no lessons.  It is the emphasis on territorial unity as the all-important goal of Irish Nationalists which through the decades helped to bolster and add to the fears of Northern Unionists. The Leader of the Opposition is opposed to the agreement on the basis that it does not provide for territorial unity.  That is an approach resplendent with all the effectiveness of the old political catch-cries and sloganeering of &ldquo;Up the Republic.&rdquo;  The proposal for a constitutional conference contained in the Fianna Fáil amendment is so out of touch with the reality of what is achieveable within the political cauldron of Northern Ireland as not to be worthy of consideration as a serious amendment to the motion.</P>
    <P>Objections have been raised to our registering the agreement at the UN.  Distinctions were made by the Leader of the Opposition between what he said in the communique issued in 1980 and what is said in the Hillsborough agreement. Much emphasis has been placed on the statement in the Hillsborough agreement that any change in the status of Northern Ireland can come about only with the consent of the majority of the people of that part of the country.  The Leader of the Opposition admitted he made that statement in the communique issued in 1980 but he said that was only a communique, that it was not a legally binding agreement.  Does that mean that when he put his name as Taoiseach to a communique issued jointly with the Prime Minister of another sovereign State, he did not mean what he was saying?  Did he mean what he was saying?  Was he committed to what he was saying?  Did he understand what he was saying or is he suffering now from some form of temporary political amnesia for no reason other than that the present Taoiseach <Col N="2981" /> was the person who was at Hillsborough rather than Deputy Haughey?  I fail to understand the Deputy's expression of an alleged distinction between what he stated in the 1980 communique and what is stated in the agreement.</P>
    <P>As one who has been a Member of this House for only four years, it sticks in my gullet that Fianna Fáil should project themselves as the only true Republican party committed to unity.  During my time here that party are the ones who have done most to confirm the fears of Unionists as to their fate if ever they should become embroiled in a united Ireland.  When a Catholic Bishop said that all Members of this House &mdash; excluding, possibly, four of us &mdash; must enact legislation that reflects the moral teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, how many Members of Fianna Fáil or of the leadership of that party stood up in public to proclaim the sovereign right of Members of this House to behave as legislators representing peoples of different traditions in a sovereign Republic? Likewise, in the area of social reform &mdash; the litmus test, so far as many in the north are concerned, of our commitment to pluralism &mdash; where are Fianna Fáil when called on to protect the position of the minority in this State?  What have Fianna Fáil done to indicate their willingness to act on the realities considered as necessary elements of a framework within which a new Ireland could emerge?  These elements are stated clearly in the Forum report.  They are in paragraph 5.2 (6) which reads:</P>
    <P>Civil and religious liberties and rights must be guaranteed and there can be no discrimination or preference in laws or administrative practices, on grounds of religious belief or affiliation; government and administration must be sensitive to minority beliefs and attitudes and seek consensus.</P>
    <P>That is not set out in the Forum report as something that may happen if and when we have unity.  It is referred to as a necessary element of a framework within which a new Ireland can emerge. What contribution have Fianna Fáil made <Col N="2982" /> in the past four years to the emergence of such a new Ireland?  I shall be very interested to hear what their members have to say on that issue when they move away from the Republican rhetoric we have been subjected to in this House.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, in his address to his party's conference a week before the agreement was signed, said that if there was an agreement and if it should make progress with the healing process, he would support it. John Hume, Séamus Mallon and Austin Currie, the men who have been in the front line, whose lives have been at risk regularly as opposed to the position of the armchair Republicans on this side of the Border, have welcomed this agreement as a first step along the road to providing an accommodation and a solution to the problems of Northern Ireland.  They see the agreement as providing a framework within which progress can be made to achieve peace.</P>
    <P>My hope is that, as the dust settles and as people have time to think and contemplate, the Unionist community within the North will see the agreement as providing a framework within which peace can be achieved and normality returned to Northern Ireland; that they will see it as something which can provide hope for the young people of that region, a generation of young people who for the course of their entire lives so far have known of nothing but bombings, murders and maimings carried out in the name of Republicanism.  My sadness is that the type of <i>rationale</i> we hear from the IRA and from Provisional Sinn Féin to justify their campaign of terror and violence, allegedly in the name of achieving unity, has put the possibility of unity light years away.  The type of rhetoric we hear from them as a justification for their deeds has been put to us in a little more up-beat sophisticated form in the type of rhetoric that has been indulged in in this House by far too many members of the Opposition. It would have been my hope that we would all have been united in this House in support of the agreement but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In the hours remaining for this debate <Col N="2983" /> I should like to hear from the Opposition whether newspaper reports of an alleged shift in their view are correct.  No such shift was evident in anything Deputy Lyons had to say this morning.  In the context of the Opposition having had an opportunity to contemplate not merely what is in the agreement but also the consequences of what they have been saying, I should like to hear what they have to say now as to what should be done in the short term to bring an end to the killings and the violence and to provide an acceptable, devolved administration in Northern Ireland within which both communities can identify.  Shouting, &ldquo;up the Republic&rdquo;, will not solve the problem.  It is time that lesson was learned by each Member of the House and by each party represented here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, I thank you very sincerely for calling on me to speak in this debate.  I am grateful for this opportunity in particular because I regard this debate as of major importance for this country.  It is clearly the most significant thing that has happened in terms of Anglo-Irish relations and the situation in Northern Ireland since the Sunningdale Agreement 12 years ago. Comparisons are drawn with that agreement from time to time and, while what has happened under the Hillsborough agreement is perhaps less all embracing, less spectacular, than Sunningdale, in the context of its time the Hillsborough agreement is certainly no less important, and in many respects may prove to be more sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us have complained that, but for the reaction of a spineless British Government in May 1974 &mdash; led by Mr. Harold Wilson with Mr. Merlyn Rees as Northern Ireland Secretary, neither of whom had the backbone to stand up for a week or so to undemocratic pressure against the power sharing executive &mdash; things would have been well ever since. What is needed now is some resolution by the British Government to stand up to something similar.  The Unionist reaction to this agreement is very different from <Col N="2984" /> their reaction to Sunningdale.  While a substantial segment of Unionists were prepared to go along with Sunningdale, particularly with the power sharing aspect, we would be foolish if we deluded ourselves into thinking that almost any Unionists agree with what is being done now.  That has been pointed out in this debate by, among others, Deputy Cluskey, Deputy Kelly and Deputy Shatter and it is perhaps going to be the most significant reservation anyone should have, not the kind of reservations that are being expressed about the Government not getting enough in this agreement. This is a delicate situation; it is fragile &mdash; I think that was Deputy Kelly's word and I concur with it &mdash; and it will have to be handled very gingerly.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to point out that, while one can see why the Unionists have such a widespread feeling that they have been betrayed in some way, at the same time one should not be afraid to say to them that the fact that they were not consulted during the negotiations which have taken place over the past 12 months is the fault of nobody but themselves.  Would they have been prepared to sit down at a conference to discuss the kind of things that were discussed?  Would they have been prepared to sit down and help to formulate an agreement the primary purpose of which is to vindicate the rights of the minority in Northern Ireland where they have not been vindicated up to now, and to redress the wrongs against them which have not been redressed up to now? Unhappily, I am afraid they would not.</P>
    <P>When they complain about the lack of consultation &mdash; and ideally negotiation on every agreement should include the parties who will be affected by it &mdash; it is only fair to ask them who they consulted in the 50 years they were running Northern Ireland without let or hindrance.  I have a feeling &mdash; I hope I am not doing them an injustice &mdash; that many Unionists believe that, because things are changing and because the balance is beginning to be equalised, those who are now beginning to have a say will be as ruthless as the Unionists were in the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>This House should give them the assurance <Col N="2985" /> that that will not be so.  I do not think any Irish Government seeking to underwrite the rights of the minority in Northern Ireland would ever allow a situation to arise where anything other than a fair balance would be achieved and maintained, and it goes without saying that no British Government would allow it either.  At the heart of the fear of the Unionists is that terrible feeling that others may act towards them as they acted towards others.</P>
    <P>That being said, this House and the country as a whole would do well to realise that the great difficulty in the coming months, and perhaps in the coming years, is not whether enough was got from this agreement but what the Unionist reaction is likely to be, how it is going to be handled by the British, how the Irish Government will face up to that, what sort of speeches will be made in this House and elsewhere in the Republic, and what effect that will have on the attitude of the Unionists.  All those points are very relevant.</P>
    <P>I do not see how anybody who has the freedom to exercise his or her judgment in this House can do other than support this agreement.  It is a very important step forward in relation to Northern Ireland since the latest session of the appalling troubles began in the late sixties. The criterion by which we should judge the usefulness or otherwise of an agreement like this is what will it contribute to the well being of people on every part of this island and will the well being of all people be advanced or set back by this agreement?  The answer patently is that the well being of all the people cannot be set back, and, hopefully, will be advanced and therefore we should give it our support.</P>
    <P>Having sat here for some hours last night and this morning I cannot help thinking that much of what is said in this House is painfully irrelevant to the problems and troubles which beset the whole of this island, and particularly the northern part.  The verbal Nationalist semantics of 50 years ago seem to be more important than the death, suffering and unemployment which are rampant <Col N="2986" /> on this island.  We are expected to look backwards and not to look at the situation as it exists.</P>
    <P>The person most quoted in this debate, as he often is in this House, is Eamon de Valera.  To some Members of this House, and to some people in this country, Eamon de Valera is a bit like what the bible is to members of a fundamentalist sect &mdash; a text has to be produced for every conceivable occasion.  We had a good example of that today when Deputy Lyons was speaking.  The Deputy was speaking last night and he started again this morning.  The Deputy started off with the phraseology that Eamon de Valera used after he had been arrested in Ennis in August 1923 &mdash;&ldquo;as I was saying before I was interrupted.&rdquo;  It is an indication of how important it is to have a text.  If one has a text one cannot go wrong and one has the kind of reassurance that certain fundamentalists have when they are able to quote a particular text.</P>
    <P>The truth is that there was not anyone in 20th century Irish public life who was better at adjusting to circumstances in which the country found itself at any time and there was not anyone better at doing what was practical for the country at any time, than Eamon de Valera.  If he was not what I say he was, would there have been a Fianna Fáil Party?  Within four years of having fought a civil war mainly on the question of the oath the Fianna Fáil Party sat in this House, and thank God they did.  Ireland has greatly benefited from that fact.  Let those who are worried now ask themselves if de Valera was a young man and was sitting in this House today, and his colleagues like Frank Aiken, Seán McEntee, Dr. Jim Ryan and Seán Lemass were sitting here today, and nobody had any labels attached to them and they were asked to make up their own minds on this agreement, does anyone seriously think that all of them would not support this agreement? I know that they would support it.</P>
    <P>People think that the whole Nationalist concept and the whole Republican concept is something static and sterile which never moves or grows and which never gives.  That is not so.  Nobody knew that <Col N="2987" /> better than Eamon de Valera, the man who is quoted, as it were, in the case against ratification of this agreement.</P>
    <P>Much argument has been made in this debate about the question of the recognition of British sovereignty and a breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution.  If there is a breach of any Article of the Constitution the only thing to do is to go to the courts on it as the court is the only body which can declare whether or not there is a breach.  A political declaration that there is a breach is meaningless. Apparently we will not have any court cases because it is well known in advance that there is no prospect of their succeeding. On the whole question of possible breaches of Articles 2 and 3, admissions of sovereignty and so on, Members of this House who are genuinely concerned about that should read some of the recent articles.  In a number of journals in the last few days, Professor Kevin Boyle of UCG makes it absolutely clear that there is no validity in those points and he drew attention to the consequences of our entering into the EC and our signing of the Treaty at that time.</P>
    <P>This agreement is entirely consistent with the Forum report and with the spirit of the report.  I supported both the Forum report and its spirit and a week or two later I had the Whip of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party withdrawn from me for doing that.  Because I supported the Forum report to the extent that I was expelled from the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, it is consistent that I should support this agreement today.  The agreement will give rise to difficulties.  Some will be severe and some prolonged and most probably in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately there are a lot of us in the South who do not seem to care very much about the difficulties in Northern Ireland. Nonetheless, the fact the those difficulties would clearly arise and one could say that they have already arisen within the last few days, does not mean that the Government were wrong to negotiate this agreement.</P>
    <P>Should the Government have simply done nothing and left things as they were? <Col N="2988" /> Should they have made no attempt to break the log jam?  No one could seriously suggest that a serious effort was not warranted to try to break the log jam of death, suffering and economic destitution which now constitutes so much of the scene in Northern Ireland.  If nothing was done what would have happened here in relation to Northern Ireland was that we would have had more empty rhetorical statements, more drum beating and demands for the impossible and an unwillingness to accept anything less than the unatainable.  Would that be a proper way to conduct Anglo-Irish or Northern Ireland policy?  It would not, and no one could suggest that it would.  It was only right that every effort should be made to come to an arrangement of some kind that would advance the situation in some way, however delicately and however slightly in certain respects.  That was done.  An agreement that has some remarkable qualities, which is ingenious in certain respects, has been achieved.  Its very ingenuity is one of the factors adding to the fear of the Unionist population at the moment.</P>
    <P>At a time when it is not entirely unfashionable to criticise many aspects of the public service it is a great pleasure for any of us to be able to stand up in this House and say that the skill, endurance and determination of men like Nally, Donlon, Lillis and Dorr are a great credit to this country and the Irish public service. I wish things could be so organised that the skill that men of the type I have mentioned have shown, could also be shown in other Departments because there are men of no less skill in other Departments whom the system defeats from making the sort of contribution they are quite capable of making.  In paying tribute to those who went through the mechanics of bringing about this agreement one should also pay tribute to those who politically, perhaps more than anyone else, helped to bring it about, the SDLP.</P>
    <P>I cannot imagine a more sterile situation for any constitutional political party than that which faced the SDLP since that sorry day in May 1974 when the <Col N="2989" /> Northern Ireland power-sharing Executive was allowed to collapse.  They were a parliamentary party with no Parliament to go to.  They had to argue the case of constitutionalism, when all the evidence around them seemed to indicate that they would get nowhere because the British Government would never listen to them. After 11 patient years their point of view has at long last prevailed and, when the time comes at some distant point in the future to assess their contribution of sheer political skill, one of the smallest parties in Europe, who spent less of their time in Parliament than any other, will turn out to have been one of the great successes in terms of constitutional parliamentary politics because of their triumph over all the pressures on them of violence from one side and of being totally ignored from the other.  Congratulations are in order to such a gallant band of men and women as the SDLP for what has now been achieved.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable and should not be ignored that worldwide reaction to this agreement has been so entirely favourable, thank goodness.  I cannot recall anything of that nature happening before. We would be very foolish indeed now if we were not to avail fully of that goodwill. Goodwill is the important thing.  People talk of very large sums of money which I am sure will be welcome too, but they are less important than the positive goodwill and support that are there on such a wide scale at present.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I have made clear.  I intend to vote for this agreement in the division that will take place here this evening. Such action is portrayed very frequently as &ldquo;O'Malley votes with Government&rdquo;.  I am not voting with the Government.  I do not care who is or who is not voting for this agreement.  I will vote for it because I think it is right.  I believe I will be voting with The Workers' Party who I understand will be voting for it.  The Workers' Party are not normally my cup of tea, but I am voting for this agreement because I think it is right and for this House to reject it would be unthinkable.</P>
    <P>What would be the consequences of <Col N="2990" /> this House rejecting it?  If Deputies feel that the consequences of rejecting it would be unthinkable they should not vote against it.  I shudder to think what the consequences of rejecting it would be.  I can understand that many people who are no longer in this House and who were in it in the past, some of whom are still alive and many of whom are not, would have welcomed the opportunity to support today a document with a new concept of Anglo-Irish relations, a new attitude towards Northern Ireland, something that would have been difficult to envisage only a few years ago.  I remember sitting in the Cabinet one day in 1972 when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, produced a telegram he had received from the then British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, which said: &ldquo;Do not complain to me about things that are happening in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is none of your business&rdquo;. Thank God the day has dawned when that is no longer so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement signed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 15 November last represents the remarkable outcome to historic discussion aimed at securing a real change in the whole context of the problem of Northern Ireland. We have heard no more elegant tribute to just how remarkable that outcome is than the one from the last speaker, Deputy O'Malley.  For more than 60 years we have witnessed a sterile debate about the divisions on this island.  Successive attempts to come to grips with the problem have foundered on the rocks of Nationalism and Unionism, a Nationalism where unity has traditionally and narrowly been defined in terms of territorial unification, and Unionism which has concentrated on the preservation of elitist political and social structures for the benefit of in reality a small minority of the Unionist population of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This island cannot become a natural political unit until the deep divisions between communities North and South are reconciled, until a common consensus <Col N="2991" /> about the best route forward economically, socially and culturally shall emerge, until the differences in tradition and belief and the diversity of the separate communities are recognised and accepted as a whole.  We must understand, as John Hume at the last SDLP annual conference said, that the recognition of diversity is the prerequisite for political unity.  It is the people, not the island of Ireland, who are today divided. The people of this island have paid a bitter price for the failure to accept these differences of culture and tradition and to respect the integrity of belief with which they are held.</P>
    <P>The core of the problem is manifested in the deep divisions between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  A bitter harvest of violence and murder, of economic stagnation and decline has been reaped from the alienation of the minority community in Northern Ireland. An even more bitter harvest would be reaped by any attempt, now or in the future, to enforce any form of political reunification in a wider context without the full assent of the Northern majority.</P>
    <P>There has been no tradition of political accommodation in Northern Ireland. This agreement enshrines an unequivocal acceptance of the legitimacy of both traditions in Ireland.  It represents for the first time a positive basis for fruitful dialogue and action between the two traditions leading to reconciliation, peace and stability.  Moreover, in establishing the Republic's right to regular, formal participation in Northern Ireland's affairs it constitutes an important step towards breaking the political deadlock which has characterised not just Northern politics since 1920 but the politics of this entire island.  The agreement primarily represents a framework but it has been widely welcomed for coming at the right time &mdash; at a time when mutual trust between the communities is at its lowest ebb.</P>
    <P>The novel inter-governmental arrangements do not inhibit the prospect of involvement by the majority community. The framework set out in the agreement <Col N="2992" /> represents an historic opportunity.  The challenge which we still face is the more formidable task of translating respect for the two traditions into forms of Government and institutions acceptable to each tradition, and ensuring that those traditions are adequately represented at all levels of policy making, administration and social and community activities.  The task facing the two Governments is to fill the vacuum that exists in the political life of the communities in Northern Ireland, and to remove the internal tensions and communal fears of dominance and discrimination that need very much to be allayed.</P>
    <P>The participants in the New Ireland Forum had identified the need for a new momentum.  The Forum said that Britain had a duty to respond now &ldquo;in order to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are not condemned to yet another generation of violence and sterility&rdquo;.  It also acknowledged that there would have to be some reconciliation between the communities in the North before there could be any reconciliation between the two parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The parties in the Forum by their participation in its work committed themselves to join a process directed towards that end.  The agreement signed last week will bind the British and Irish Governments together in action which will show that this process is more powerful than the IRA and any Unionist extremists who want to take to the streets.  It is a matter, as the joint communique said, of determination and imagination.  It is not an attempt to wrap up the future of the North by dismissing the majority community and imposing solutions against their will.</P>
    <P>The consistent position of the Labour Party has been that progressive politics in Northern Ireland can only be based on a clear understanding of the cultural, civil and human rights which must be respected there, as indeed they should be respected in any truly democratic society. Such a basis links a socialist approach in Northern Ireland to democratic socialist politics elsewhere, and by this link seeks the support of socialists who share a concern <Col N="2993" /> for peace and justice.  In this instance I was pleased to see that the British Labour party, the main Opposition party in the House of Commons, warmly supported the agreement and that we received messages of support and solidarity from the Socialist group in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the difficult and apparently unpalatable realities of political life in Northern Ireland have become an excuse for some in deciding to face only half the issues, leaving the other half to take care of themselves or to be exploited by political and paramilitary forces with scant regard for democratic principles. There has always been a temptation, for instance, to ignore the cultural divide or to dismiss it as some imperialist hangover or as another unacceptable face of capitalism which will disappear as history takes its course on this island.  Significantly, the political rhetoric of both communities has often echoed the triumphalism of majorities.  By not mentioning the existence of minorities in the south or, indeed, the north, the problem can be glossed over as if it did not exist.</P>
    <P>This kind of political rhetoric has a long history here.  In the 18th century the Protestant ascendancy in Ireland could regard the existence of the majority nation as being beneath political consideration. When certain Unionist leaders have spoken about democratic rights of &ldquo;the Ulster people&rdquo; or &ldquo;the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;, they have tended to dismiss the rights of the substantial Catholic minority who are also in Northern Ireland.  The Nationalist tradition has also been diminished by attempting to adopt an almost exclusive definition of what it means to be Irish and by allowing a particular religion, namely the Roman Catholic Church, to become too closely identified with Irish identity.  Many of the standard phrases of our political culture in every day use, even in this Chamber, convey the impression of a homogeneous people with a singular thread of history. We speak of the Irish people, the people of Ireland, our national tradition.  This kind of imagery has one outstanding attraction: its simplicity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2994" /> The failure to recognise fully cultural rights is central to the problem of the minorities in all of Ireland; the Protestant minority in the whole island and the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.  In the light of the historic circumstances, it is clear that the cultural traditions in Northern Ireland are a prime political reality and that the unresolved problems relating to their co-existence have to be tackled as a matter of priority. This failure to achieve a stable co-existence hitherto has in large measure explained the failure to effectively tackle the grave socio-economic problems which affect Northern Ireland, to achieve a dimension of co-operative endeavour between North and South even where it is crystal clear that such co-operation on selected economic issues would be to the mutual benefit of both the Republic and the North.  One graphic example of that has been the act of fíor-gael Republicans in blowing up the electricity connection between the Northern Ireland Electricity Board and the ESB in the name of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>The possibility of advancing measures which will work to the economic advantage of our communities North and South, and especially in those areas which have suffered most severely as a result of the instability of recent years is a vital part of the framework established by this agreement.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to under-estimate the opportunities which are being offered to communities North and South by this aspect of the agreement and the prospect which it offers for promoting greater communication and more open dialogue between individuals whose political allegiance and opinions might be diametrically opposed but who share a common economic interest which may now, possibly, win support in the form of up to $1,000 million of external economic assistance.</P>
    <P>By way of illustration I would point to one small but not insignificant example of how this dimension of the agreement may operate in practice.  As Minister for Labour, I have been particularly struck by the potential for broadening the <Col N="2995" /> experience of young people and assisting them in their employment needs through establishing exchanges between community training workshops, North and South.  I intend to try to build on the limited experience of young worker exchanges between community managed projects in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  These exchanges have been developed in recent years and have served both to benefit the individuals involved and to promote greater understanding between communities.  The growth of community development in Ireland has given way to local organisations working energetically to identify the employment needs in their area and seeking to harness the resources and potential to meet these needs at local level.</P>
    <P>Community groups are well placed to build bridges in a divided society, to look to new approaches, to accommodate a reconciliation of views.  It is a measure of the significance of this agreement that, in the process of its implementation, it will enable both North and South to develop and improve the economic links which have been long established.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the role of the Labour movement on this island and the way it has been involved with the struggle in the last 100 years to try to find accommodation between North and South, between the different traditions.  The trade union movement in Ireland has from its origins &mdash; which we commemorate in the foundation of the Belfast Trades Council in 1881, the Dublin Trades Council one hundred years ago, and the establishment of the Trade Union Congress in 1896 &mdash; been a united nonsectarian force.  This unity has survived the weaknesses endemic in a labour movement caught in the vortex of a Nationalist struggle.  Throughout the last century memorable occasions have occurred when co-operation was reestablished among the disadvantaged and the unemployed who were traditionally divided on religious grounds.  Trade unionists will, I hope, recognise their real interest in putting pressure on their political <Col N="2996" /> representatives to endorse political structures and institutions which can draw support throughout the community and avoid the sterilty of Orange and Green exchanges.  The inequalities within their communities have been exacerbated through unemployment and dependence on social security.  The joint efforts of two Governments to promote the economic and social development of those areas which have suffered most severely can harness the energies of the trade unionists who courageously promoted the &ldquo;Better Life For All&rdquo; campaign which was aimed at promoting peace on the factory floor.  That is one area in that bitterly divided community of Northern Ireland where sectarian violence is least evident.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the operation of the Inter-governmental Conference as a means of addressing key issues in such areas as job discrimination and job creation. As an instrument for promoting cross-Border co-operation it will function somewhat on the basis of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, an arena in which I have worked closely with the present Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Tom King, when he held the United Kingdom brief on employment issues.  I have a high respect for his ability and, indeed, his commitment to find a practical solution to problems that previously evaded all solution.</P>
    <P>Both the legal systems of the Republic and Northern Ireland are underpinned by legislation emanating from the European Community and by the requirements of many international conventions to which the Republic and the United Kingdom Governments are signatories.  I am eager to build on the sharing of experience between AnCO and the Northern Ireland Authority and in industrial relations where the Labour Relations Agency in Northern Ireland already plays a variety of roles which I have identified in proposals for industrial relations reform.</P>
    <P>Here in the Republic of Ireland the Conference will also provide a framework for reviewing the work of the regulatory bodies designed to reduce <Col N="2997" /> inequality of employment opportunity between the two religious communities &mdash; the Fair Employment Agency and also the Equal Opportunities commission for Northern Ireland.  These are critical areas in which law enforcement can provide an instrument for reform.  Unemployment often breeds a cynicism about the equity of legal remedies.  This in itself can become a major source of alienation and result in a reluctance even to pursue legitimate complaints.</P>
    <P>I want to address my comments to those people, North and South of the Border who feel that this entire debate and entire issue is something that has nothing to do with socialists or those who would espouse a left wing philosophy because I believe that they are wrong in that view.  It is my considered opinion that the Anglo-Irish agreement should be recognised by the left in Ireland as an unique opportunity to break out of the sterile world of civil war politics in the South and the sectarian politics in the North so as to establish a strong socialist and labour movement on this island.  The labour movement in Ireland, both North and South, is industrially strong and politically weak.</P>
    <P>The absence of a strong labour political presence in Ireland has contributed directly to the low level of living and working conditions here today in comparison to the rest of Europe.  No labour movement, no matter how influential economically can sustain and consolidate the interests of its members and their families if it does not have direct political power as well.  Nationalism and Unionism have been cynically exploited by gombeen merchants in the South and sectarian industrialists in the North to divide and weaken the strength of the labour movement.  In the short term, their actions resulted in temporary success, but the very failure of native Irish capitalism North and South has been borne most heavily by the working populations of both communities and indeed both traditions.</P>
    <P>Poverty does not discriminate on the grounds of religion.  The absence of a strong politically based labour movement <Col N="2998" /> has seriously inhibited the successful economic development of our economy since 1920.  Despite our protestations of independence or having broken the link with Britain too often we look for comparison to the United Kingdom and draw our political models from its experience, which because of its size and economic history, is both misleading and unhelpful.</P>
    <P>I would put a counter-view for consideration to this House.  The smaller countries of Northern Europe with a strong labour movement, both economic and political, give us a better indication of what Ireland has lost because of the divisions of 1920 and the failure and ineptitude of both Unionist and Nationalist conservative parties.  It is a matter of historical record, in fact, that in 1920 &mdash; the time when we were first about to get our independence &mdash; Finland, Denmark and Belgium had an economic and social position similar to ours.  Today, we lag far behind them, socially and economically. The labour movement has played a major, yet quite different role in each of these three countries since 1920.  Today, politically strong, the labour movement and the left in these three European countries have ensured a standard of living and economic development which has so far eluded us on this island.</P>
    <P>For me, as a democratic socialist, the real tragedy of the division of this island has been the resultant economic backwardness which our working people have had to endure at a time and during an era when it was not necessary and could have been avoided.  To add insult to injury, the social and economic exploitation by Irish capitalists, in the name of either Nationalism or Unionism, was eased by the way in which romantic ideals and irrational fears were cynically manipulated to ensure the division of the Irish working class.</P>
    <P>What has been achieved in Denmark, in Finland and in Belgium since 1920 has been denied in Ireland largely because of the failure to establish an acceptable political unity on this island and the consequent deliberate exploitation of that division by native capitalists who, in <Col N="2999" /> the final analysis, were not even successful in creating a stable economy, North or South.</P>
    <P>Since 1920, however, and particularly since 1969, the left in Ireland has been uncomfortable in dealing simultaneously with the issues of Nationalism and Socialism. A 32-county Workers' Republic appeared unacceptable to Loyalist workers in East Belfast, and the advocacy of the two nation theory in effect condemned the Republic to the perpetuation of the sterility of civil war politics.  Many Irish socialist thinkers have preferred to ignore, or wish away, the ideological problems of the national question and have sought simply, as democratic socialists, to decry violence and terrorism.  I do not think that is an adequate response, and our lack of a clear position on this issue has confused and disillusioned many of our supporters.</P>
    <P>I have always argued for radical democratic socialist politics on this island as I am convinced that that holds the only prospect for real social and economic progress. We certainly need such a policy. We have the highest level of unemployment and today, both North and South the fastest growing labour force of all the European Community countries.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the agreement and to the way in which it emerged.  I was, I think, the first Southern politician to formally endorse, on behalf of the Labour Party at the 1983 SDLP Conference, John Hume's call for the establishment of a Council for a New Ireland which subsequently became the New Ireland Forum.  I did so because socialism in Ireland needs a new framework within which a revitalised labour movement North and South can demand and obtain real social and economic progress.</P>
    <P>It is my considered view that the Forum report and the Anglo-Irish agreement provide a framework within which both traditions can be accommodated and whereby the labour movement can advance.  Accordingly, I appeal particularly to Unionists in the North, who have at heart the real interests of their working class constituents, to give the framework <Col N="3000" /> of the agreement a chance to work.  The guarantees in the agreement for the political and cultural position of the Unionist community have been openly and warmly given by us, perhaps not by all of us, but certainly by the majority in this House.  I believe and am sure that the Dáil will substantially endorse this agreement and will want, as generously as is possible, to ensure that it works for the benefit of all the people on this island.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of demographic history and for most families a degree of loss that our people, North and South, have of necessity travelled to the four corners of the world, driven by the social and economic failure of Irish politics at home over the last 100 years.  They were spurred on to ensure political success in the new lands to which they travelled.  The success of the Irish in the politics of the United States is well known, but today, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well as Britain have in their Governments and their Parliaments, politicians of clear Irish origin who have successfully operated in large and culturally diverse countries. Are we incapable of emulating their success and do they not all wish that the divisions which drove away their grandparents should at last be resolved by this generation of Irish politicians on this island?  It is some time now since the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Prior, shortly before his departure from that post, told the House of Commons: &ldquo;The dangers for the people of Northern Ireland of sitting back and doing nothing are greater than the obvious risks of seeking to make some political advance.&rdquo;  This agreement confirms a remarkable act of faith in the scope for political initiative.  It should not be seen as any abandonment of the Unionist people.  Indeed, the undertakings given by the Republic recognise the integrity of the Unionist and give the lie to any threat of domination of one community over the other.  It is a clear indication of the seriousness and the potential success of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I listened with respect to the contribution offered here today by Deputy O'Malley. He articulated what the supporters of <Col N="3001" /> Fianna Fáil feel around the country which, regrettably, is not being articulated for reasons that are entirely due to the decisions of the Fianna Fáil party here &mdash; and which are entirely their affair because it is not for me to comment on the internal affairs of that party.  Whilst he said that he may not articulate the views of those people in Fianna Fáil who are allowed to speak in this debate at present, I put it respectfully to the Deputy who represents Fianna Fáil in the House at present, Deputy O'Rourke, that Deputy O'Malley has certainly represented the views of many Fianna Fáil supporters whom I happen to know.  He did so in a spirit, not of going over to the Government side as he clearly indicated, but of simply supporting something that should in his view be supported.</P>
    <P>This agreement should be given a chance to work.  Most importantly, it is the only agreement that is available to us and, as he said, is the only one to emerge over the last 11 years in a manner that enables the prospect of some progress to occur in Northern Ireland.  I strongly commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to contribute to this debate which I regard as a very important one.  I regard it as an honour to speak to the amendment to the motion put down by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a very broad ranging speech, particularly interesting from an historical, social and political point of view, I regret that the Minister for Labour tarnished his contribution at the end by introducing politics, something many of us had decided &mdash; under instructions from our Leaders &mdash; we would not do, that rather we would remain unacrimonious in debating this issue.  He spoke of what he is convinced is the Fianna Fáil point of view throughout the country.  I strongly refute the allegation he made about our party.  I do not wish to travel the path of division that he took in his remaining words.  But I want to place on record that the sentiments I shall express <Col N="3002" /> are those held by the party I represent.</P>
    <P>There are two issues in this debate that I want particularly to highlight.  The first is the role of the Opposition.  I have had occasion many times in this House to highlight what I saw to be the extreme reaction of the Government to anything said by the Opposition.  On many occasions they clearly indicated that we had not the right to oppose any debate or motion which they introduced in this House.  On educational matters I have had occasion to become extremely irate with the present Minister for Education when she chose to say, in so many words, that we had not the right to criticise policies she was introducing.</P>
    <P>When this present Dáil began its first session on 14 December 1982, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism introduced a motion in the House for the reform of Dáil procedures. I spoke on that day and said clearly that while such revised procedures would be welcomed with regard to committees of the House, Question Time and so on &mdash; leading to a more businesslike, efficient approach to business &mdash; there still remained the clear duties of the Government and Opposition &mdash; the Government to propose, the Opposition to oppose or amend.  In this instance that is precisely what we have done.  We have stated clearly what is our position and put forward a constructive amendment.  When we become aware that this agreement is awash with approval by other countries, it would be as well to dissect such blanket approval, to pierce through the mists of euphoria that surround it.  It appears that almost any country one can think of &mdash; for example, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, all of the EC countries &mdash; has come out in favour of this agreement. However, on the one hand to say that that is their approval and this is Fianna Fáil's non-approval is so to belittle the matter as to render it a very foolish agreement. It should be remembered that those countries are concerned with their affairs.  They are concerned, in a very peripheral sense, with what happens in the small island of Ireland.  They welcome what the information given them envisages <Col N="3003" /> as a step forward.  We see the matter acutely as it happens within our own country.  Therefore, to equate worldwide approval with domestic disapproval is not to equate like with like.</P>
    <P>Without seeming to be declamatory or vain, I would point out to the House that we have a clear duty &mdash; being the largest single party in the House and representing the greatest number of our people &mdash; to examine every aspect of legislation put before us and, in particular, to give this agreement vigorous scrutiny and decide where it conflicts with the best interests of our people.  Having done that our next duty is to welcome any commitment which would better the living conditions of the people in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We wish to clarify our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Constitution and our claim to unity.  We clearly oppose the confirmation of the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom.  We oppose the British sovereignty claim over the Six Counties because it undermines our claim to unity. That is the point most worthy of attention in this debate.  The very fact that this Anglo-Irish Agreement has been signed as an international agreement to be ratified legally has put back the legitimate claim to unity.  It is sad that that aspect has not received much comment in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong of us, as the largest party in this House, not to examine every line of this agreement, not to point out clearly where it conflicts with our Constitution.  That is precisely the basis on which we voice our disagreement to it.  Whilst we remain in Opposition we shall continue to exercise the right of putting forward our points of view, of having them listened to, accepted or rejected, but certainly of having them expressed.  It is regrettable that people appear to think &mdash; because we have a point of view and have taken a particular stance &mdash; that we are obstructionists. That is not the case, as our amendment clearly demonstrates. Indeed, I might quote here the penultimate paragraph which reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3004" /> while recognising the urgent need that exists for substantial improvement in the situation and circumstances of the nationalist section of the community in the North of Ireland and approving any effective measures which may be undertaken for that purpose, refuses to accept any recognition of British sovereignty over any part of the national territory;</P>
    <P>There is no dichotomy in our debating issues which have arisen in this House. We point out the dangers, what essentially this agreement means to the people of Ireland.  We then move on to express approval of any inter-action between the communities which will lead to an improvement in their living conditions and their hopes.  We have also pointed out the pitfalls inherent in this agreement. Leaving aside the constitutional issue, with which I have dealt, one of the real dangers of this agreement is that England may well now feel they have done with the question of Ireland, that they can effectively put it on the back burner.</P>
    <P>Whilst the question of the North of Ireland is of everyday, consuming interest to all of us here, in the English context it amounts to just one more problem in the overall canvas of their many private, domestic and international affairs.  I could imagine the British Prime Minister feeling well pleased with her day on Friday last, with the year's events which led to the signature of the agreement, going back to her domestic and international problems and saying, &ldquo;That is the end of Ireland now.&rdquo;  That is the great fear we would have, a fear that in effect the movement had ended.  As well as underlining and emphasising Partition, rather than any diminution of it, our fear would be that this agreement would place people in a limbo, in a suspended type of situation, without any movement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour in his contribution, which was historically very interesting in a political sense, spoke of the great movement in co-operation there has been between labour agencies in the North and the South.  He spoke of the <Col N="3005" /> various cross-Border activities in which he had been engaged in co-operation with various Northern agencies.  This type of thing has been going on for some time. To claim that the signing of this Anglo-Irish agreement will suddenly lift all that to a hugely different plain is to give it an importance which it does not really have. There has been co-operation between North and South in various areas for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in co-operation in the educational field.  I have been involved in this area, not on the ground but through various debates, seminars, lectures and practical expositions of what has been happening in education and co-operation between the North and the South.  Working along those lines I went to the library to look up the work of a famous educationalist in Ireland in 1830. It is very instructive to read what JKL, the Bishop of Kildare, the great Dr. James Doyle, said in 1830 about the education of young people: &ldquo;I do not know of any means which would prepare the way for a better feeling in Ireland than uniting children at an early age&rdquo;.  Those remarks of that eminent educationalist are relevant 155 years later.</P>
    <P>There have been great moves in co-operation. At primary level the INTO are a 32-county union representing national school teachers, North and South.  At second level there are the great activities of Co-operation North which have facilitated for a number of years the movement of students and the growth and vigour of ideas in second level education. I noted from their recent seminar and annual meeting that they had in a practical fashion identified students who had left their second level schools in the North and come South to engage in school and domestic life here, while a like number had gone northwards to do the same. This is practical politics which I would like to see extended.</P>
    <P>There is great scope in third level education for both student interaction and economic growth.  The Williams Report of 1984 was later consolidated and elucidated by the Higher Education in Ireland, Co-operation and Complementarity <Col N="3006" /> Conference which was sponsored jointly by the Northern Ireland Economic Council and the National Economic and Social Council.  It went through the recommendations of the Williams Report and came up with practical propositions. It is in the area of higher education that there is greatest scope for economic development.  There should be a fuller investigation into sharing of educational facilities at third level, not only in Border areas but throughout the country.</P>
    <P>All of us on local authorities have for years been assuming our own mantle of cross-Border co-operation by exchanging visits.  I have happy memories of visits as chairman of my local authority to the local authority with whom we had twinned in the north and of the ideas with which we came back, particularly in the leisure field.</P>
    <P>The recommendations which have come up in the joint survey by the National Economic and Social Council and the Northern Ireland Economic Council relate mainly to third level education. They suggest that we should have a higher education liaison committee which would operate North and South. The demographic structures of student population here mean that many more young people are seeking access to third level education than there are places available.  In the north the numbers seeking access to third level education had been static for a few years and have now begun to decline.  In the years ahead there will be an over-capacity of places in third level institutions in the North and we will have an under-capacity.  There is clearly room for huge improvement in the use of facilities.</P>
    <P>When I read the original Williams report and the survey, it quickly emerged that the dissemination of information to would-be students, both North and South, is inadequate.  It should be made clear to students what type of courses could be obtained in the North and in the South.  There should be an equalisation of grants as between North and South and students should be informed about the qualifications necessary to get into third level as distinct from what we operate <Col N="3007" /> with the leaving certificate.  There would have to be harmonisation in those areas before this could be pursued fruitfully. The initial surveys indicate that the attitudes picked up by students from the South who go North and vice versa are enormously positive.</P>
    <P>The young people have come to learn that the people from each jurisdiction are generally warm, welcoming and receptive. There should be harmonisation in relation to the availability of places and in relation to the rates of grants and entry qualifications.  It is not widely known, for instance, that there is no institute for the study of veterinary sciences in the North and students from there have always had to come South to pursue their studies. The Minister for Labour spoke about the co-operation he had received with the development of the two communities and there is still great scope for development in education.  This is an area which would open up great vistas and potential for improvement in the relationship between the two communities.</P>
    <P>The role of the SDLP has been mentioned by Members from all sides of this House.  There is no doubt that over the past number of years the SDLP have borne the heat of the day in Northern Ireland.  They have laboured under vicissitudes and stress which nobody in this House could really understand.  In every structure that has been attempted their voice has been heard.  Whilst it might seem to the SDLP and some of their members that we in Fianna Fáil take issue with them, it is a falling out among friends.  The friendship and links between the SDLP and our party remain strong, tangible and real.  When the history of these times is written the efforts of the SDLP will be well documented.</P>
    <P>I wish again to state clearly our role as the major Opposition party and to clarify the very real dangers inherent in the Anglo-Irish Conference.  We have pointed out the diminishing of the idea of unity contained in the agreement. However, having pointed that out we must express our point of view.  As far as every day life in the North is concerned, <Col N="3008" /> education, housing, prison, social and work opportunities, lack of discrimination in jobs and so on where there is room for improvement, of course all people of goodwill hope that improvements will come about, but that in no way takes from our essential opposition to the article in the agreement which underlines Partition and does nothing to remove the veto and the prop which the Unionists had for so many years and which is the main obstacle to a move forward in the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I support the motion moved by the Taoiseach on Tuesday.  I do so because I recognise that any arrangements which improve conditions and benefit the people of Northern Ireland, this community and mainland Britain, are deserving of our support.  It is unfortunate that all parties do not subscribe to this view and I hope that, even if at the 11th hour the main Opposition party cannot see their way to supporting the motion, they will not obstruct and oppose it.  To do so would be to further delay any possible improvement.  It is clear that good work has gone into this agreement and that the negotiators deserve the utmost credit.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the origins of this agreement.  Over the past 16 years many lives have been lost, mainly in Northern Ireland, but also here and in Britain.  Innocent people have been killed and many others have suffered as a result. As another speaker said earlier, this agreement can only help to improve the situation.  We must face up to the difficulties ahead.  The agreement will not be a panacea for all ills but it represents a start.  If the agreement were to save even one life it would be worthwhile.  When people are killed, while we express sympathy and outrage at the time of the atrocities, we soon forget what has happened. We should never forget that many lives have been lost and it is important that those of us elected to serve the people should do nothing by our words or actions to affect the wellbeing of people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3009" /> The agreement represents a fresh hope and start, and deserves to be given a chance.  Of course, it will need to be improved at the review period and the people involved in working out the agreement may, from time to time, see that amendments are necessary.  However, it must have the support of this House. Many of the Members opposite hope that progress will be made but they will never relinquish their aspirations &mdash; and mine &mdash; to an eventual reunification of Ireland. The agreement is a first step towards that goal and in the short term it will improve the situation in the North.</P>
    <P>Our ultimate objective must be the cessation of violence and attacks on people.  There has been far too much loss of life, bitterness and attacks on others by both sections of the community.  While I do not want to dwell on them, they should not be forgotten as it is only by remembering what has happened that we can move forward.  I hope that the work carried out by members of the Government and various dedicated civil servants who worked on last Friday's agreement will result in peace and reconciliation in the days, months and years ahead.  There is no change in the constitutional position. That is clear from the joint statements in the communique, and trying to sidetrack the agreement is not helpful.</P>
    <P>Our clear aspiration is for unity but we must realise that that can come about only with the consent of the majority up there.  I particularly support the role of the SDLP in the past few months and over the years.  They have shown dedication in the face of opposition from the men of violence and from others.  They have worked for peace and reconciliation with dedication when life could have been much easier for them.  They know that progress will take a long time.  Great respect is due to their leaders and to rank and file members of the party, as well as to supporters.  They have been a live force in trying to keep democracy alive in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the implementation of the agreement both Governments will work hard to ensure the well being of the people in the North, to endeavour to <Col N="3010" /> improve their lot.  I hope the British Government will act with resolution and commitment to ensure that the terms of the agreement will be fulfilled.  It will be a long road with many obstacles and difficulties from time to time, and both Governments must show a clear understanding of their job and act with resolution and dedication to see that the ultimate targets will be achieved &mdash; the improvement and the well being of the people in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This agreement is but a first step and it should be given a chance to work.  It is unfortunate that already people have tried to obstruct it without even knowing its terms and its aims.  I hope that in the years ahead our Ministers, particularly Labour, Justice and Education, will bring the expertise of their Departments to bear on the promotion of co-operation between the two parts of the island. There can be co-operation in regard to policing, transport, justice and health through exchanges of views.  I welcome any prospect of investment in the North, particularly the money which would appear to be coming from the US, which would increase industrial job prospects for the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is important that both identities and traditions in the North will be respected.  This can be done through this agreement, which must be given a chance.  Eleven years after Sunningdale we have been given another chance and we must work to achieve our goals.  I hope we will seek compensation for the efforts put into this agreement, and I hope that when the Conference meets its members will dedicate themselves to achieving progress for the benefit of all sectors throughout the island.</P>
    <P>I look back with sadness at the cost of the violence in the past 16 years, not only in lives but in damage to property.  That should encourage all of us to give the agreement a chance to succeed and to consider any arrangment that will benefit the people of the North whose lives must be safeguarded.  I hope nothing said in this debate will do anything to prevent achievement of that aim.  I appeal again to Members opposite to support the <Col N="3011" /> agreement fully.  Perhaps it can be improved in the days ahead but it must at least be given a chance.  To obstruct it or to hinder its effectiveness could cost more lives.  The Member sitting opposite is a reasonable and dedicated worker in this House and I am sure he believes that this arrangement must be allowed to work.  I will conclude by giving the words of a former American President:</P>
    <P>Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though chequered by failure, than to take rank and file with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the grey twilight which knows not victory nor defeat.</P>
    <P>I hope we will face up to this challenge of obstruction which may cost more human lives.  I hope the statement issued by Fianna Fáil yesterday will mean they will come some way towards accepting the agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Séamus Mallon said on RTE during the week that five times each week he must drive past Milltown Cemetery and Long Kesh and that as he drives past those places he asks himself if there is anything politically he can do to end the suffering of people in the prison and to prevent the kind of tragedy that led to those other people being in the cemetery.  He continued that that was the background against which he had to measure everything and said: &ldquo;In many ways the peace and happiness and the lack of tragedy in lives of people in Northern Ireland are more important than my own deeply held convictions and let me tell you that my ideological convictions are very deep indeed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to approach my contribution to this historic debate in that spirit.  I shall begin by saying that there are positive detailed aspects of the agreement which I hope will help to calm fears and to reduce the alienation of the minority in Northern Ireland.  There are aspects of the agreement whereby the British appear to be committing themselves, given certain conditions, not to impede <Col N="3012" /> ultimate unification.  There is some effort by way of the agreement to reduce the day to day suffering and, overall, there is a final review procedure so that this document can never be said to be the final word on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides legitimate scope for genuinely held reservations.  I do not think anybody is suggesting that one should not have some reservations about such an historic agreement.  Not to have reservations would be to negative the whole notion of parliamentary democracy.  I have personal reservations about the agreement and this is the place to mention them.  For instance, I am concerned that some of the responsibility this State will have now may turn out to be responsibility without power, but I hope that will not be the case.  I am concerned too, about the Conference.  I know there are people who differ strongly from me on this but I am concerned that along the way the Conference may become somewhat defunct and taken over by the devolution process in which case what we are doing here would turn out to be setting up an arrangement for devolution.  It is important to mention that reservation.</P>
    <P>I share increasingly the views of my constituency colleague, Deputy Kelly.  I think we can say this without rancour: Deputy Kelly expressed concern about our doing a deal with the British Government in the sense that, unfortunately for all of us, as we know too well, our history has shown that any time we have put great faith in that quarter we have been let down.  That does not mean we should not try again.  I share Deputy Kelly's concern in that regard.  It has become increasingly difficult in this part of the island to rise above that suspicion in regard to doing business with the British Government.  However, we must make the effort and regard it as part of a process.</P>
    <P>Another reservation I have is that the British Government apparently can end this agreement or not implement it in certain areas.  That is apart from the section 11 review clause.  One would have expected that there would have been <Col N="3013" /> something in the agreement to prevent that onesideness.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reservations that one legitimately is entitled to hold and to put forward and this is the place to put them forward.  These reservations on my part are purely on a personal basis.  I do not think anyone could read the agreement and say it is perfect.  In fairness to Members opposite, they are not saying that.  What they are saying is that there are reservations but that we must keep them in perspective.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the SDLP. Though tribute has been paid to them so many times, we cannot do so often enough.  They are the people who, through the long dark days of the seventies, were the authentic voice of the Northern Nationalists.  I can do no better than quote the Leader of the SDLP, John Hume, when at his recent Party conference he said: &ldquo;We have stood up for the needs and the rights of our people against all attack, whether from bombs or bullets, from gunmen or Governments and from those who would rule and those who would ruin us.&rdquo;  One could not disagree with those sentiments.  The SDLP know all about the long dark days of the seventies. They know about the bloodshed and about the widow makers of Northern Ireland.  That party stood between bloodshed and democracy.  They stood for decency and constitutional politics for a long time in an unsalaried, unselfish but dedicated and committed approach to solving the problems of this island.  They have been in the forefront of the Nationalist cause.  They have refused to yield to the men of violence.  Without the SDLP throughout that time in Northern Ireland, there would have been to a much greater extent a valley of blood.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make a lengthy contribution to this debate.  My purpose in speaking is to point to some positive aspect of the agreement and to express a number of personal and deep reservations about it and to point, too, to the tremendous role played by the SDLP throughout those past difficult years.</P>
    <P>It is no secret in this House that I would have been one of those people who, <Col N="3014" /> among others and through my party, would have been advocating a conciliatory line to try to bring about progress in Northern Ireland.  I am addressing my comments to the nation as well as to all sides of the House.  In terms of reaching some conclusion in this whole area, I remind the House and the people outside that this evening this agreement will be passed by this House.  I do not think there is anyone on any side of the House who would wish to obstruct the agreement.  I do not think there is anyone either in the House or outside it who would not wish the experiment well and it is an experiment, no more and no less than that. Neither do I think there is anyone on any side of the House who would not wish the agreement luck and say that, once we have had our debate here and aired our differences, the people are entitled to the agreement being allowed a fair chance and the chance to find out what it can achieve as another experiment in the long line of attempts that have been made to make progress in this very difficult area.</P>
    <P>Therefore, after this debate has concluded I should like to see all sides of the House forgetting the deeply held differences that have manifested themselves. Nobody should stand in the way of those who consider the agreement to be exciting and to have every chance of success. At the same time, those people can reciprocate in a sincere way by allowing that, if there are people with genuine reservations, they are entitled to those reservations but that, in the meantime, we should be prepared to wait and give the agreement a chance to work.</P>
    <P>Once passed this evening the agreement should attract the commitment and the loyalty of all constitutional politicians as an experiment adopted by the Oireachtas and by the people of the State parallel to a very careful, critical monitoring of the situation.  I do not think anybody suggests that a sovereign parliament would not monitor the working of such an historic agreement and all Members of this House will be monitoring it too.</P>
    <P>It was clear from the television scenes of last evening of the clashes with the <Col N="3015" /> Unionists in Northern Ireland, how much work we have to do to calm the fears of the Unionist population.  That is why I stress once again that we should take our decision in this House with dignity and respect and work together for peace and reconciliation on this island.  I believe there is nobody in any party who would be found wanting in that search for peace and reconciliation, whatever political labels people may wear in this House.  I make a plea that there be no division among the Nationalists and the people in this part of the island who have a special place in their hearts for our fellow Irishmen, the Unionists, and to seek a United Ireland based on the diversity of the traditions which exist on this island, where total political and religious freedom is taken for granted and not something one still has to fight for.</P>
    <P>There are some positive aspects to this agreement but I hold some very deep reservations about others.  I commend the role of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in a search for peace on this island and I make a plea for less division among Nationalists in trying to tackle this intractable problem.  At the same time there is no need for anybody in this House to give up, water down, walk away from or feel ashamed of his national aspirations to Irish unity.  I came into politics 20 years ago, and one of my reasons was to see in my lifetime genuine unity, North and South, and I and other Deputies will continue to work to that end.  I do not believe we will get that unity by watering down genuinely held aspirations, but what we must do is hold those aspirations dearly and honestly, express them openly and then seek to work an accommodation with people who hold opposing views.  I believe that is possible.  One need only point to the United States of America where there is a tremendous diversity of opinion, race and colour.  They have found expression in a common movement and a common cause, which is the United States of America.</P>
    <P>They are the challenges.  I honestly believe that this generation of Irish <Col N="3016" /> people will not thank politicians if in the long term we do not express our views honestly, pursue them honestly and seek to keep division among the people on this part of the island to a minimum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand and sympathise with the feelings of Deputy Brennan because of the situation in which he finds himself.  It is regrettable that the Nationalists in this part of the country cannot manage to achieve unanimity on a tentative approach to a matter of this nature.  It is apparent from what he said that he regrets that fact too and I am afraid it does not present our position in the way I would have liked.  This is a matter which should transcend party politics and it is regrettable that it has been made an issue of party politics.  That was one of the great things about the Forum, on which I had the honour to serve.  Being an assembly of all Nationalist opinion in the island, we discussed our varying emphases on our positions, and there were differences in emphasis, but at the end of the day we achieved that unity in our position which is what made the Forum report and the Forum accord a major factor.</P>
      <P>We should have maintained that unity in the present position.  After all, we all subscribe to the common bond of being constitutional Nationalists.  That factor united us in the Forum.  In the Forum we all recognised that although we had that common bond there was one section of the four groups which held a special position, and that was the SDLP.  We had to recognise that they were in a different position because they lived in the North day in and day out.  It was part of their experience and the experience of the people they represented.  They all lived with those problems and suffered in the same way.  We accorded them a very special position.  We all listened to them with particular attention because they were speaking of what was happening on the ground.  That is why I and my party had to give particular attention to the views and feelings of the SDLP on this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have fears about this agreement and <Col N="3017" /> I hope they will not be realised, but one is bound to have fears and concern about this.  Had the SDLP, being the constitutional Nationalists who live in the North, not wanted this agreement, I would have had very serious and grave doubts about it.  They feel that in the interests of the people they represent there is promise and hope in this agreement. That was a major factor in our supporting this agreement while hoping and praying it will achieve its objectives, but that in no way detracts from our aspirations for a unitary State, to which we all subscribed in the Forum report as being the ideal solution.  I do not want to go over ground which has been covered many times before, but I can find nothing in this agreement which in any way derogates from that aspiration.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the fears and insecurities of the Unionists and the effect this agreement will have on them, but fear and insecurity are not commodities which have been confined in the North to the Unionists.  All the people of Northern Ireland have suffered from the appalling breakdown of law and order, the killings, the explosions, the brutalities, the unemployment and the devastations of the economic position in the North.  In relation to Unionist fears and insecurities do they want that situation to continue or do they want it to change?  The years have rolled on and that position has continued.  There has been plenty of talk from here about working for a unitary state from a constitutional position, and from the North about their fears and the ongoing security question, but the killings went on and there was no light at the end of the tunnel &mdash; nothing to work for.</P>
    <P>The object of this agreement is to allay the fears of the Nationalist community and give them an involvement in the governing institutions in the North which affect them, and all the decisions which affect their daily lives, their employment or lack of employment, and their very life and limb.  If the agreement can give them a feeling of involvement with their own destiny and a measure of control over their position, the hope is that this <Col N="3018" /> will induce the Nationalist population to rely on the institution being set up by the agreement and take away the very substantial measure of support which they have given hitherto to paramilitary and destructive organisations.  We must accept that, before we can make any progress in the North, the first thing we have to achieve is peace so that the economic situation can hold and improve.  Without that basis for work, nothing can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The terms of the agreement are very modest.  The agreement does not give the Conference any power to make laws in the North or to direct anybody to do anything.  All it does is provide that this Conference being set up may make representations on various matters.  As practical politicians we all know about making representations.  We make them every day of the week to different Ministers and we know what the effects of the representations may be.  I will not say that they never come to fruition, but the very major proportion of the representations we make achieves little.</P>
    <P>The Unionists must appreciate that power is not being given to the Conference, that it is a matter of making representations. The Irish Government have been given power to put forward views and proposals, but there is no obligation on the powers that be in the North to accept those views or proposals.  It is a very modest step forward.  There is a fair measure of truth in the proposition that it does not do a great deal more than put a formality on an already existing situation.  There was nothing to stop the Irish Government from making representations to the British Government or any other Government either directly or through one of the international institutions, and I am sure such representations have been made on many occasions.</P>
    <P>We have had many debates here in which we called on Ministers of the Government to make representations on issues affecting Northern Ireland, so it only puts a formality on an existing situation. Perhaps the Taoiseach put it rather strongly when he said that Nationalists <Col N="3019" /> could now raise their heads knowing that their position is and is seen to be on an equal footing with that of members of the Unionist community.  That puts the context of the agreement rather further than it warrants.  That agreement, giving a right to make representations only, will not put the Nationalist community on an equal footing.  It falls far short of that position.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the Unionist community appear to have reacted against it.  They see a situation where political representatives and civil servants of the Irish Government will go North and will be involved in meetings and in making representations.  The big factor in what we are saying seems to be that this will take place in Belfast and that it will be some kind of an affront.  I wonder how important is the location of the meetings of the Conference?  Perhaps it would be a good idea to give consideration to having the Conference meet sometimes in Belfast, sometimes in Dublin, and sometimes in London.  The object of the exercise is the hope that this will bring about a settling down of things in the North which will arise from the Nationalist community diminishing their level of support for paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>If that were to be achieved and if there were a substantial reduction in if not a disappearance of the violence that we have known, would not moderate Unionist opinion come to the conclusion that this was a step forward?  If the violence were reduced in that way there might be a rethink by moderate Unionists and perhaps that fear and insecurity of which they make so much would be reduced substantially.  Too much is made of this fear and insecurity on the part of the Unionists, particularly in the context of this moderate agreement.  On the one hand the Unionist position is backed up by the British guarantee and, on the other, by the guarantee given in the Forum that only with their consent would their constitutional status be changed. Those guarantees and the other major guarantee of having a substantial <Col N="3020" /> majority, 1,000,000 strong approximately, are balanced on the other side of the scales against the Irish Government's right to put forward views and proposals.</P>
    <P>I was a participant in the Forum and I am a member of the Irish Labour Party. I subscribe to the objectives of the Forum and I aspire to the ideal of the unitary State, but to achieve that end requires work, sacrifice and concession not only by Unionists in the North but also by us down here as Nationalists.  We require to do many things to work towards that end. We need to make much more progress much more quickly in the liberalisation of our legal system than we have been prepared to do.  A very tentative beginning was made with the measure on contraception, which was welcome.  It was a measure difficult to achieve but it was a start.  However, we have much more to do and we must be prepared, if we are for real on this aspiration, to have a rethink on our attitudes to our civil legal system.  I find it very interesting and just a little strange that Article 8 of the agreement refers to &ldquo;areas of criminal law applying in the North and South respectively which might with benefit be harmonised&rdquo;. I wonder why the question of the harmonisation of the law should be confined in the agreement to the realm of criminal law.  I would have thought it an exercise well worth while to say that we would also work towards the harmonisation of the civil law under which very great disparities exist between North and South, particularly in the realm of civil rights.  For example, the right to obtain a divorce in respect of a marriage which has broken down exists in the North and does not exist here.</P>
    <P>I advocate strongly a liberalisation and progress of our civil law, but from that I would not have it implied that there is in any way any lack of religious freedom in this part of the country.  Such is not the case.  I am proud to be able to stand here and say that as a member of a very small religious minority, the Jewish faith, we in our very small community here, which represents a very tiny percentage of the population, enjoy and have always <Col N="3021" /> enjoyed full and complete religious freedom under successive Governments. Both Coalition and Fianna Fáil, going back over the decades, have bent over backwards beyond the call of duty to ensure that every requirement needed by our faith to enable it to be practised was provided for it.  I must pay tribute to that here as I have done in fora abroad, most notably in the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to say that I am happy with our legislation on matters of personal status.  I am not.  There is no case for having the legal system of the State in accord with the faith of one religious entity, even one representing a massive majority of the people.  I do not believe either that liberalising our laws here will in any way make those adherents of the Catholic faith any less sound in the observance of their religion.  I do not think that has happened to the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and if such liberalisation was brought in here I do not think it would in any way adversely affect that.  Religious rules or precepts of religion do not require of necessity to be enacted in law.</P>
    <P>I do not say &mdash; although it has been said many times &mdash; that this should be done for the purpose of making us here more attractive for unitary purposes to the North.  It should be done for its own sake.  That has been said many times. However, if it was done here an unavoidable consequence of it would be that Unionists in the North who place a very high value on the liberal nature of the laws on personal status would regard the State here in a somewhat more amenable light.  A very major step forward would result if efforts were made to harmonise the civil law more so than the criminal law as referred to in Article 8 of the agreement.  We can make progress if we want to in our aspirations towards achieving the unity of this country.  We have work to do to achieve that and we must readjust our thinking.  It will not be an easy or a short task.  Will that task ever be capable of achievement?  I believe it will.  I recall something that made a great impression on me.  Among the many deputations we interviewed at the Forum <Col N="3022" /> was Dr. Cullen, Professor of Philosophy at Queen's University, a person in the Unionist tradition.  He gave oral evidence to the Forum on 8 December 1983 and I quote from a section of that interview at page 34 of the Forum report.  He was asked by my party colleague, Senator McGonagle, in what circumstances he would envisage a no-change attitude notwithstanding that the Unionists may change their minds.  Dr. Cullen replied:</P>
    <P>If we believed that the Unionists would not change their minds we would not be here today wasting our time. We are here out of a conviction that Unionists can be persuaded, provided certain guarantees are specifically stated ... But I am saying that there is no possibility of that in my generation...</P>
    <P>Therefore, he holds out that, given the right conditions in the North and South, we could, though not in this generation, see a move towards the position we all hold so dear, that is the achievement of a unitary State by consent.</P>
    <P>I hope sincerely that the agreement will make some initial progress towards that end in the North, and if we are prepared to take the bit between our teeth in our legislation here and in other ways perhaps the next generation will see that achieved. Sometimes the intransigent positions that one hears about and sees emanating from the North would lead one to abandon that objective but we must not do that.</P>
    <P>Quotations have been the order of the day in the course of this debate with people like Mr. de Valera and Presidents of the United States being quoted.  I should like to give a quote in conclusion from a different source in the context of recognising the great task we have ahead of us in trying to achieve peace on this island and working towards the aspiration of our unity.  The quote, which emanates from a section of the Talmud known as the Ethics of the Fathers, was written many thousands of years ago and is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3023" /> It is not incumbent on you to finish the task but neither may you desist from it.</P>
    <P>The work towards that end must go on however long it may take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Mindful of this momentous occasion when we are discussing a proposal which seeks to regulate Anglo-Irish affairs as they affect Northern Ireland, I should like to stitch into the record of the House the fact that I, like all members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, will always lend support to anything that will help the Nationalist community to live in equality with their neighbours in the North of Ireland.  However, the fact that the two Governments intend to bring this matter into an international forum and register it as an international agreement between two sovereign States entrusts upon this party the necessity to examine its implications in detail.  We are obliged to assess how the agreement will stand up to the fundamental analysis of the problem as outlined in the Forum report.  What we are not doing, although I regret to say it was tried by certain Members on the Government side of whom I would have expected more, is to embed ourselves in old traditional ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education in her contribution referred to drum-beating and suggested that the Government parties were the progressives in modern Irish political life.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare, whose contribution has been stitched into the record, will live to regret the day that he questioned the commitment of our party.  He said he gave us the benefit of the doubt in regard to our rejection of violence in all its forms.  In the last three days we have been attempting to put the constitutional Republican position in a modern context and not as a holy grail of sterile Nationalism or Republicanism as was inferred by some Members on the Government side, in particular members of the Government who said they entered into this agreement in good faith.  It is important that it goes from the House that we see <Col N="3024" /> the problem in a modern context.  We will develop that philosophy adhering to the fundamental Republican principles on which our party was founded.  The Taoiseach, and the Leader of our party, at the outset of the debate requested that there should be respect for the sincerely held views of all Members.  All Members from this side of the House who have contributed adhered strictly to that request but, unfortunately, some members of the Government have attempted to preach to us as to what we should do in this regard.  They failed to show the mutual respect to Members which they expect Nationalists and Unionists to show each other in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I request those on the Government side who will be making a contribution later today to acknowledge that what we have been saying in the last three days represents sincerely held views.  We respect the views of other Members and we expect that our sincerely held and expressed views are accepted as such without Members inferring or imputing any motivation to be party political or otherwise.  Having listened to almost the entire debate &mdash; I believe I was present for more of the debate than any other Member &mdash; I believe those comments are necessary to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>The reason why we must take a stand on this relates to the fact that this is no tacit agreement.  It is not a new consensus that has come about.  It is proposed that the agreement should be registered in an international forum when it has been passed by the House.  While fundamental objections were outlined cogently and coherently by our party Leader in relation to the dilution of the integrity of Irish sovereignty in the agreement we also object to its compromise on the legitimacy of Irish unity.  In registering the agreement at the UN the Government, on behalf of the Irish people, will be limiting the ability of future governments to raise this matter as they see fit on behalf of the Irish people at international fora in future.  I wonder if it is wise that the historic and legitimate right to unity of our people &mdash; that is not an attempt to <Col N="3025" /> diminish the Unionist contribution that can be made in this country &mdash; is to be limited.  The implications of registering the agreement at the UN should be thought about long and hard.  I question whether the Government have this right.</P>
    <P>The New Ireland Forum put in a modern context the position of constitutional Nationalist parties on this island. While the Unionists did not see fit to attend the Forum those who read the report, and understand the spirit of it, will agree that it has taken into consideration Unionist feelings as much as it could do in their absence.  We have heard in the course of this debate about the hard work that has been done by the public servants, and the Government, in the preparation of the agreement but we must not forget about the hard work and dedicated service of public servants in bringing the New Ireland Forum to fruition.  The Forum set out the parameters within which any Irish Government is entitled to come to a Treaty arrangement &mdash; this agreement will have Treaty status &mdash; with the UK in regard to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important therefore to understand and remember that the party leaders in the Irish Government signed the New Ireland Forum, as did the Leader of the SDLP and the Leader of this party.  We should not forget that set out there was the context in which we should pursue Anglo-Irish relations.  I submit that on a careful reading it is not said anywhere in the New Ireland Forum report that one can enter into an agreement of the type which we envisage here.  It is stated in paragraph 5.10 that other views can be discussed.  In paragraphs 5.4 to 5.10 inclusive are set out precisely the structures to which those Nationalist parties would subscribe in the event of there being an international agreement with Britain.  To allow the spirit of the Forum to continue, paragraph 5.10 is inserted to ensure that we continue to talk, continue to try to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>When it comes to entering into a solemn international agreement between two sovereign States, no matter how committed you are to believing that a certain structure will bring lasting peace <Col N="3026" /> and stability, you cannot go outside the parameters of the Forum report.  By doing so you are rejecting the clear, fundamental analysis of the consensus of the four Nationalist parties in that document. It states the truth, that it transcends Northern Ireland.  More importantly paragraph 4.1 states:</P>
    <P>The present formal position of the British Government, contained in Section 1 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act, 1973, is that the only basis for constitutional change in the status of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom is a decision of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  In practice, however, this has been extended from consent to change in the constitutional status of the North within the United Kingdom into an effective unionist veto on any political change affecting the exercise of nationalist rights and on the form of government for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This agreement does not deal properly with the Unionist veto which, since the inception of Northern Ireland as a state, has proved, to have been the main obstacle to any proper political development or progress as we understand it in any western parliamentary democracy. That veto ensures that Unionism remains an exclusive establishment, that the rationale of Unionism will fail to accommodate the legitimate and historic right to unity in this country.</P>
    <P>We have heard much from the Government benches today and over the last few days about the necessity to accommodate Unionists.  I agree that that is patent and obvious.  It is necessary to accommodate Unionists and Unionism in any new agreement, but obviously the corollary to that must be that it is necessary for Unionism to accommodate the Nationalist aspirations of the community in the North and the stated and obvious desires of the majority of the people on this island in relation to whatever new political structures we wish to develop to bring political change, progress and stability to this country.</P>
    <P>As long as that veto remains &mdash; and <Col N="3027" /> make no mistake, it does remain in Article 1 of this agreement &mdash; Unionism need never accommodate Nationalism. The unacceptable face of Unionism which we have seen most clearly over the past three or four days since the announcement of this agreement will remain in the leadership of Unionism as long as the British Government accept its validity within the context of Northern Ireland, a state which has been set up &mdash; and this is an historical fact &mdash; to maintain sectarian dominance, and the boundary of which is artificial.  It makes no political sense.  It is economically destructive and has proved to be more culturally divisive than anything else in the country since its foundation.  We cannot deny that it is an historical affront to the people of this country.  I ask Members on the other side of the House to accept the sincerely held views of members of this party, many of whose families followed that party since its inception and stayed with it because it holds those views dearly.</P>
    <P>While we are not here to espouse sterile Nationalism, we are here to explain it in its modern context.  That does not mean we should be asked to deny the existence of the fundamental analysis which forms the very basis of Fianna Fáil and what that party stand for.  It is wrong to ask us to do that.  It is not so much a price that we are not prepared to pay; it is a price which we cannot pay because we sincerely believe that to do so is to depart from the fundamental problem.  It has been stated by certain Members of this House that by so doing Fianna Fáil are not interested in day to day reconciliation or in what is happening now.  We are interested.  We want lasting peace and stability.  We want to accommodate our brothers and sisters who are Unionists and have a Britishness.  We say that it is not incumbent on this Dáil to deny the facts as they are seen.  If, by the removal of the veto, the unacceptable face of Unionism is brought back to the political reality that we are all living on one island and must accommodate each other, not simply accommodate them, then we may <Col N="3028" /> see some semblance of political realism and progress from the Unionist side.</P>
    <P>For too long now we have been told that we must do this and that.  The Forum report shows precisely how much we are prepared to do.  The fundamental point is that Unionism must face reality, and not be held up in a threatening way. Unionists must not fear an overriding Nationalist flood.  They must realise that as we must live with them and want to live in peace and stability so, too, must they live with us.  Within the context of the natural unit of this country we are prepared to work as perhaps no generation has been able to work before us for lasting peace and stability on this island, giving the Unionists irrevocable guarantees to ensure that their identity is protected and that their contribution or potential contribution to this country is recognised.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specifics of the Anglo-Irish agreement, it has been said that we have here a consultative role.  Anybody acquainted with legal terminology will see that there is no consultative role in this agreement.  Nowhere in that agreement is there a legal obligation on the British Government to come to the Irish representative, prior to any decision being taken which affects the Nationalist majority, to discuss it with him.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Barry, luck on the basis that this agreement will be passed this evening, but it is his onerous responsibility to make the first move.  At all times the first step must be taken by an Irish Government, placing an additional obligation on them.  But having instigated the move, having expressed their views in the agreement, they have no input into final decisions, which remain with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom Government. That is not a consultative role in any legal sense.</P>
    <P>Primarily this agreement is based on the good faith of the British Government. It appears the Taoiseach is convinced of their good faith.  If that is so one might well ask why have we not seen, prior to this agreement, conduct on the part of the British Government which would <Col N="3029" /> demonstrate that good faith?  Why was the signing of this agreement not suspended until we saw how that good faith operated?  When in the past ten to 15 years, let alone the past 60, have we seen evidence of that good faith?  Only 12 months ago the same United Kingdom Prime Minister, in the House of Commons, questioned the right of the Irish Government to make representations on behalf of the Nationalist minority.  One might well question this sudden conversion on the part of the British Prime Minister reputed never to make a U-turn. So far we have not seen any evidence of that good faith.  Therefore, why was it necessary for us to participate in this solemn agreement before it was forthcoming? It is easy to see why, because Article 11 of this agreement states:</P>
    <P>At the end of three years from signature of this Agreement, or earlier if requested by either Government, the working of the Conference shall be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any changes in the scope and nature of its activities are desirable.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in that Article does it state that Article 1 is renegotiable; everything in the Inter-governmental Conference is re-negotiable except Article 1.  One might well ask why is that important to the British Government?  Why was it necessary for the British Prime Minister to state it three times in the course of the press conference &mdash; because this does give legitimacy to the Unionist position and dilutes the integrity of Irish sovereignty, flies in the face of Irish Nationalism, past, present and future.  That is why we had to participate in this agreement. That is why there was the build up over the last three months, because Britain got what they wanted from an Irish Government &mdash; the legitimacy of the Unionist position within a Northern Ireland context.  That does not mean that I am not interested in everyday reconciliation. This agreement constitutes a major step forward for British interests in Ireland, for Unionists' interests in Northern <Col N="3030" /> Ireland, being totally exclusive of Nationalists' interests in the Six Counties which the same agreement seeks to protect. That carries the seeds of more alienation that anything else of which I am aware and I know the views of some Northern Nationalists.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I express deep reservations about this agreement.  I wish it well if it is to be ratified because I do not subscribe to violence.  I said in my opening remarks that I deeply resented the Minister for Health and Social Welfare last evening deciding, in his usual sanctimonious way, to give me, as a member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and my colleagues the benefit of the doubt in regard to my abhorrence of violence.  Quite rightly, he proceeded to denounce IRA violence.  However, he did not denounce, as have motions passed in this House, institutional violence.  That is why we question the validity of an agreement which fails to come to grips with fundamentals.  We must come to grips with fundamentals if the registration of this agreement means that we limit the ability of this and every future sovereign Irish Government to discuss the matter of the legitimate right to unity wherever and whenever we please.  I do not believe any Government have the right to do that.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that had there been other members of Fianna Fáil here they would have voted in a certain manner in relation to this agreement.  I am the least experienced member of the Parliamentary party.  It has been suggested by others that young people are in favour of this agreement.  I am the youngest Deputy in this House and, in relation to both those suggestions, I have to be honest, that it would be purely subjective for me to make any statement in relation to them.  I do not believe it relevant for me to say whether I think Fianna Fáil people or young people would accept it. I do not see how any politician would have the ability to look into his heart and contend that those people would have accepted it, or that young people accept it.  I do not know and I do not think anybody else does either.  In refusing to <Col N="3031" /> accept the implications of this agreement, stating simultaneously &mdash; because there have been implications to the contrary by other Members in this House &mdash; that we seek reconciliation and support any advance in the Nationalist position in the Six Counties, I believe we are adhering to the very fundamentals on which this party was founded, a party which, when founded, had to stand alone.  This party must now stand alone regardless of whatever is the media perception of our stand nationally or internationally.  I believe our stand is right, that if one wants to deal with the British Government, to bring lasting peace and stability to the northern part of this country, the fundamental analysis of the report of the New Ireland Forum must be adhered to.  I defy any Member of this House to show me where there is in that report of the New Ireland Forum any criterion, any reason that we should agree to this agreement and have it registered in an international forum. Paragraph 5.10 of the New Ireland Forum report said:</P>
    <P>The Parties in the Forum also remain open to discuss other views which may contribute to political development.</P>
    <P>To be consistent with the fundamental analysis of the New Ireland Forum report can anyone show me how one can legitimately sign this agreement?</P>
    <P>I ask the House to consider the positive aspects of our amendment, to accept its fundamental concept as constituting the basis for real negotiation and settlement of this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to have the opportunity to contribute to this historic debate.  All too few of us have been able to do so.  The Anglo-Irish agreement represents an important and quantifiable leap forward in the relationships between this country and the United Kingdom and between the two traditions on this island. No agreement between sovereign Governments about issues which are deep, fundamental and divisive can possibly be reached without some degree of give and take on both sides.  If, as we <Col N="3032" /> all believe here, a political dialogue is the only way to solve what is practically insoluble, it follows that such dialogue is not about victory or defeat but about compromise, negotiation and agreement. So it is with this agreement.</P>
      <P>The judgment of this House should, therefore, be primarily directed to assessing the content of the agreement and its prospects for success.  Does the agreement represent a good deal for the people of Northern Ireland?  Does it represent a good deal for the people of the Republic? Does it represent a good deal for the people of the United Kingdom?  They are the questions.  I would not attempt to answer the last one because that is a matter for another Parliament, but I will try at least to answer the first two.</P>
      <P>Before doing that I want to comment on one of the most remarkable features of this whole affair.  For once public expectations were substantially exceeded by what was achieved.  Any of us who have ears have been hearing that message in recent days.  Over the past year the man in the street had little or no expectation that the tortuous process of dialogue between the two Governments would lead to very much.  At least that was my perception.  The reaction since last Friday has been dramatically different. People of various political persuasions and of none are enthusiastically endorsing the agreement and certainly everybody I have met wants to see it work and wants to give it a chance.  Some have reservations about detail but I have not met anyone who is not in favour of giving it a chance.  That is encouraging.  It has spread across party political divides.  The man in the street is invariably a good barometer and he seems to be saying loud and clear that this is a good agreement, a substantial step forward and we should get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot, of course, speak for the man in the street in Northern Ireland but at least from the Nationalist side I am encouraged by the positive and practically unqualified support of the SDLP. We all are.  I fervently hope that in time the Unionist man in the street may also <Col N="3033" /> see that this agreement represents a fair and good deal for him as well.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the terms of the agreement itself.  The preamble is very enlightening.  It sets the tone and establishes the objectives when it refers to diminishing divisions, achieving lasting peace and stability, reconciling the rights of the two traditions, those who wish for no change in status and those who aspire to a united Ireland.  It affirms a complete rejection of violence and refers to building a society in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination and intolerance. Finally, it refers to the participation of both traditions in the process of government.  Surely they are commendable objectives which all of us in this House would share.  The Articles which follow seek to build a framework &mdash; nothing more &mdash; upon which a building which would embrace those noble objectives can be erected in time.</P>
    <P>In Article 1 the status of Northern Ireland is addressed honestly, openly and factually by the two Governments, while at the same time accommodating the aspirations of both traditions to work through the democratic process for their longer-term goals.  From the Unionist viewpoint their current status is secure unless and until a democratic majority of all the people of Northern Ireland decide to change it.  From the Northern Nationalist point of view and ours the aspiration towards a united Ireland is accorded full recognition.  From this point forward it will be very much up to the Nationalist tradition, North and South, to convince in time our Unionist fellow Irishmen that their destiny lies with us.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has affirmed for the first time in a formal international agreement that it has no interest in remaining in Northern Ireland if and when a majority there freely decide to join a united Ireland.  There is no longer any ambiguity, no longer the suspicion that Britain or NATO have wider strategic interests in Northern Ireland.  That is all gone.  The issue for Nationalists is clear and straightforward.  We must work to unite all of the people of this island rather than all of the land.  The land will <Col N="3034" /> follow.  That is a long term goal but it is a goal which this agreement, far from diminishing, actually brings into sharper focus.  It concentrates the mind on the job rather than on the dream.</P>
    <P>Article 2 and the following Articles establish the Inter-governmental Conference and this is certainly an innovative and unique proposal.  While the United Kingdom could not accept the full implications of joint authority as envisaged in the Forum report, the Inter-governmental Conference goes a long way to providing for the first time a really substantive role for the Irish Government in the affairs of Northern Ireland.  That is a major breakthrough and is seen to be.</P>
    <P>Article 2 (b) states that determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences.  That positive form of words as well as the scope of the terms of reference of the Conference seem to add up to a very important and worthwhile structure.  I would take issue with the previous speaker.  It is more than a consultative role in reality, as I will demonstrate in a moment.</P>
    <P>The agreement lays strong emphasis on encouraging the development of a devolved power-sharing Government in Northern Ireland and incentives to this end are contained in Articles 4 and 5. This must surely be the right direction &mdash; the encouragement of local democracy in Northern Ireland.  If both traditions can in time be persuaded to work together in a devolved Government, tensions and frustrations must be eased, with a corresponding reduction in the level of violence, bloodshed and destruction.</P>
    <P>Articles 7, 8 and 9 specifically provide for the Inter-governmental Conference to consider a number of the most sensitive issues in Northern Ireland, including security, prisons, the administration of justice, cross-Border co-operation and a range of other subjects.  To find that we are now in a position where we can have a real input to questions affecting security, treatment of prisoners and the administration of justice, about which we are all concerned in relation to Northern Ireland courts and, of course the question of <Col N="3035" /> cross-Border co-operation in a whole range of topics, is an important march forward and I cannot understand why anyone would not see it as progress.  It has to be to the benefit of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland &mdash; and they see it already &mdash; to have a senior Irish Cabinet Minister and his advisers regularly articulating their fears, concerns and aspirations at this Inter-governmental Conference, the terms of reference of which include that &ldquo;determined efforts shall be made at the Conference to resolve any differences&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While technically the Conference does not give the Irish ministerial representative any decision making role, it is obvious that if &ldquo;determined efforts&rdquo; are made to resolve differences it is incumbent on the system to produce results and that those efforts should be seen to succeed. Otherwise the Conference could not work and would quickly disintegrate and I do not believe that that is what the two Governments intend.  I am convinced that both of them intend to ensure that it does work and is seen to work.  However, it cannot work unless the process which I have just described produces results on the ground.</P>
    <P>I choose my words carefully when I say that I am saddened that all constitutional Nationalists cannot unite behind this agreement.  I respect their point of view but, nevertheless, I am saddened by it. The historic inability of Irish nationalism to present a united front is exposed once again and such disunity inevitably diminishes this noble initiative.  That is why I regret it and I especially regret it because I recognise that the Leader of the Opposition established the framework from which this agreement was fashioned.  Historians will surely record the irony of it all, with Mr. de Valera in his time building on a treaty espoused by his political opponents and, in our time, the Taoiseach building on a framework established by Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>The future prospects for the agreement must concern us all.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs said in Cork last Sunday that putting in on paper was the easiest <Col N="3036" /> part and we all know how hard it was to do that.  The prospects for this agreement must surely rest on its acceptance or rejection by the two communities in Northern Ireland as well as on the determination of the two Governments to make it work.  Nobody can yet say what level of acceptance the agreement will receive in Northern Ireland.  One thing is certain, the extremists on both sides have a vested interest in its rejection and they may stop at nothing in pursuit of that objective.  This agreement does not challenge any section of the Northern Ireland people except the men of violence on both sides.  We must do everything in our power to demonstrate that by word and action this agreement threatens nobody but the gunmen, the terrorist and the sectarian murderer.  Let us hope and pray that moderate people of both traditions can make common cause with the two Governments against the cult of violence and the underlying alienation on which violence feeds.  The people of Northern Ireland have endured a long and agonising nightmare.  This agreement provides a candle of hope in a dark tunnel of despair.  It is a fragile light but it can light other candles and, in time, the darkness. It is a brave and valiant attempt by two democratic Governments to show that the political process can triumph over the bomb and bullet.</P>
    <P>It is no exaggeration to state that democracy is on trial in this agreement and it cannot be allowed to fail.  I am pleased to support this historic agreement enthusiastically and I congratulate all those who worked so hard to bring it about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government motion before the House calls for support for the Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985, an agreement already signed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  To vote for such a motion implies acceptance of each and every Article contained in that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are parts of this agreement which could result in significant improvements for the minority community in the Six Counties and if one could be certain <Col N="3037" /> of their implementation, those parts of the agreement will certainly have my full support.  There are 13 Articles in this agreement and though I would have serious reservations about the manner of their implementation and the eventual outcome, I still believe I could give qualified support to 12 of the Articles in the agreement</P>
    <P>However, the motion calls for support for the full agreement and this includes Article 1, on the status of Northern Ireland.  I cannot and will not accept this Article, which in my view, gives a veto to the Unionist against the eventual reunification of Ireland.  I cannot accept that the majority in the partitioned area of our national territory should hold such a veto.  A line of partition was carefully drawn by the then British Government in such a way as to ensure that the partitioned area would always have a strong majority of Unionist voters.  This, then, is a British manufactured majority; an artificial majority and is not based on true democratic principles.</P>
    <P>I am also of the opinion that the British Government are only interested in solving the violence problem in the Six Counties. I believe they entered into these negotiations with the Irish Government with the sole intention of achieving means to eliminate violence.  Having failed over the past 15 years to put down the men of violence on their own, the British Government, out of frustration and in desperation, are now prepared to offer a limited role to the Southern Government in the administration of the Six Counties in the hope that such involvement will placate the minority Nationalist Catholic Republican community who hopefully will withdraw their tacit support for the men of violence.</P>
    <P>I see in this agreement, therefore, another attempt by Britain to deal with the effects while making no move to eliminate the cause of these troubles which, of course, is Partition itself.  Having witnessed the indifference of successive British Governments over the past 63 years, the Irish people are entitled to wonder about this latest agreement and where it will lead us.  The road to Sunningdale was <Col N="3038" /> charted by Fianna Fáil, the road to Hillsborough was started by Fianna Fáil, the tragedy in both cases, maybe, has been that both of these agreements were entered into on behalf of the Irish people by a Coalition Government.  Were the British Government willing to enter into an agreement with a Fianna Fáil Government, I have no doubt that the National aspiration for eventual unity would be more adequately safeguarded.</P>
    <P>In the many meetings I have had with British Ministers and Members of Parliament, I have always found them more than willing, indeed anxious, to discuss the Six Counties problem.  Their interest, however, has always centred on how to stop the violence, how to return the area to normality.  Mention the aspiration of the majority on this island for unity and they just do not want to know.  This has been the British blind spot over the years and they have always avoided any moves which would eventually result in unity. They have a difficulty, I believe, in understanding the in-built resentment of Irish people to the injustice done over the centuries which the Southern people see perpetuated in the deprivation of the Catholic minority community in the Six Counties since they were partitioned off from the rest of the country 63 years ago.</P>
    <P>The real value, then, that I see in this agreement is that at least it addresses itself to the plight of the minority community, and if their social and economic conditions can be improved by the implementation of parts of this agreement then those parts can be welcomed. Those who signed the agreement are making elaborate claims that wonderful improvements will follow.  I hope they are right.  So far, their claims are based on their trust in British assurances and only time will show how Britain will act. Let us hope history will not repeat itself.</P>
    <P>I have unbounded admiration for the members of the SDLP Party whose leader, John Hume, is in my view probably the outstanding political figure of the past decade.  The courage and determination shown by Hume, Mallon, Rogers, Currie and others in the face of extreme provocation have been exemplary <Col N="3039" /> and I hope their decision to support this agreement in full will not affect their party's commitment to the establishment of a 32 county democratic State.</P>
    <P>The SDLP decision in this matter reflects their priority to achieve immediate improvements in the quality of life for their people, something we, too, recognise as urgent and indeed essential. I believe, however, that SDLP supporters will recognise the dilemma facing Fianna Fáil and that they will understand why Fianna Fáil, representing the broad Nationalist view on the whole island, cannot endorse any diminution in the constitutional claim to sovereignty over the whole of the island.  Acceptance by Fianna Fáil of Article 1 in the agreement would represent a reneging of all that our party have stood for since their foundation by Éamon de Valera.</P>
    <P>As a Fianna Fáil Deputy I see great merit in many aspects of this agreement if they can be properly implemented, and I believe they should be given a chance to work.  I know the vast majority of our supporters want to see the Conference succeed.  We wish the Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, every success in this most difficult assignment.  We congratulate the civil servants who have worked so diligently to establish the Conference.  I would urge the Unionist communities to give their support to the working of this Conference and I would hope that they will not allow their response to be influenced by a small but vocal group among them who have already raised a protest.</P>
    <P>Having said that I see some merit in parts of this agreement, I must now caution against the many pitfalls.  It has been very difficult to get the British to act on the Six County problem.  We painfully recall the stark &ldquo;Out, out, out,&rdquo; response to the Forum report.  What is now proposed falls far short of any of the Forum's proposals and let us be clear that what in fact is being proposed is an internal arrangement which in my view could only result in the re-establishment of a Six County devolved Government, that is, another Stormont, only this time the Nationalist minority might no longer be <Col N="3040" /> discriminated against.  The Six Counties will remain under British rule and Britain will have achieved its objective of alienating the Nationalist community from the men of violence who we hope will cease their operations.  Such a scenario will be a serious setback to achieving the unitary State, and though it could bring improved conditions for the minority, there is no guarantee that the violence will end.</P>
    <P>In wanting the establishment of a unitary State, I recognise that progress towards that objective will be slow &mdash; it will not be successfully established by any overnight decision.  The conversion of the minds and hearts of thousands of Unionists to acceptance of a unitary State will only result from a gradual process involving many nudges along the way from the British and sometimes from the Irish Government.  I believe this agreement can prove to be an important nudge on the road to unity.</P>
    <P>However, I believe that the ultimate goal of Irish unity could be lost were Fianna Fáil to agree today to this first Article in the agreement.  Whatever else we in Fianna Fáil will agree to, we will never renege on our commitment to a united Ireland and we cannot therefore vote in favour of this agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat saddened by the approach adopted by the Opposition in this debate.  Like previous speakers, I am sorry that all Nationalists south of the Border have not come out with one voice in the interests of Nationlists north of the Border on this agreement. I have just got a few minutes and in that time I should like to put a few questions to the Opposition because there is a responsibility on them to answer some questions for the benefit of the House and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Opposition are to form a Government in the future, do they intend to repudiate the agreement?  This must be clarified before the debate ends.  What do Fianna Fáil propose to do if they form a Government?  Do they intend to polarise the views of the Northern Unionists and Nationalists and, as a result of such polarisation, continue the murderous <Col N="3041" /> campaign that has gone on there for the past 15 years?  Do the Opposition intend to leave children without fathers and sometimes mothers?  Is that their wish? Do they intend to increase the terrible heartbreak that has extended throughout Northern Ireland in the past 15 years?</P>
    <P>This is the time for questions to be answered clearly.  Various arguments have been made against the agreement, particularly in relation to its constitutionality and Irish sovereignty.  If the Opposition feel sincerely that this is unconstitutional do they intend to challenge the agreement in the High Court? There is an opportunity if they wish to take it up and I challenge them to do so if they feel so strongly about it.  Something tells me that there is too much empty rhetoric coming from the Opposition.  It is evident that they do not believe in what they have been saying but they feel there is an obligation on them to go on with the rhetoric that has been going on in Ireland for the past 60 years.  In that time what have we achieved?  We have achieved nothing.</P>
    <P>This agreement is the first political move since 1921 to give some ray of hope to the Nationalist community in the North and I am heartened that all Nationalist opinion there welcomed the agreement.  The Nationalists in the North appreciate the tremendous generosity, good will and good faith that have been extended to them by two Governments of two very different backgrounds.  That culminated last Friday in an agreement signed by Mrs. Margaret Thatcher and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say to the Northern Unionists that they have nothing to fear from us Nationalists in the South, that the vast majority of the people in the South are anxious to see peace and harmony in Northern Ireland. This document is an instrument of peace and goodwill, an instrument that can be used for political progress.  It is seen as a start, a formula that can be worked out.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Eddie McAteer was Leader of the Nationalists, at a party in Stormont he said that if the Nationalists should ever <Col N="3042" /> come to power they would not deal with the Unionists in the same manner as the Unionists had dealt with them because the Nationalists had learned from their experience of injustice.  Here in the South there is nothing but goodwill among the Nationalist population.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, including the Opposition, before 5.15 this afternoon to answer questions that have not been answered before.  This matter is much too serious.  There are lives at stake and therefore there is an onus on all in this House to look at the agreement seriously and to take the positive step this afternoon of supporting the agreement.</P>

    <P>Every effort is being made, within the available resources, to ensure that claims are processed as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any particular problem in the case of farmers' sons specifically and I can assure the Deputy that applications from claimants in this category are dealt with similarly to all other claims for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of any cases which have been the subject of a long delay he should advise the Department of the details so that the cases can be followed up.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are severe hardship cases relating to applications for unemployment assistance, cases which have been under consideration for at least six months and which relate particularly to the sons of small farmers?  Is he aware also that in such cases the smallholders have been asked by officials of the Department to supply statements of income and expenditure in respect of their holdings?  What exactly are the Department's policies in regard to these applications?</P>

      <P>As I have stated, each case must be investigated in order to establish eligibility for unemployment assistance, entitlement to which is based on a means test.  That has been the procedure since the inception of the scheme. While it is not possible to generalise in these cases, I am sure the Deputy can cite instances in which there appear to be long delays, but the vast majority of cases are dealt with relatively quickly having regard to the type of investigations that must be carried out.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position has become much more serious in the past six months or so and also that it is only within that time that unemployed persons who are married and who have families and who live away from the family farms have been asked <Col N="3044" /> to have their parents submit statements of income and expenditure in connection with the applications for unemployment assistance?  This is a cause of grave concern to those people who must wait a considerable time before their applications are decided.  In many cases action is taken only after parliamentary questions have been tabled about the delays.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that all applications are treated similarly and that all claims are processed as quickly as possible.  There is no distinction drawn between applicants for unemployment assistance.  The fact that an applicant may be a farmer's son who is living away from the farm does not mean that the time taken to process his claim will be longer than is the case in respect of other applicants for unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In these types of cases of small farmers' sons who are unemployed and living away from the family holding, would the Minister agree that the investigations would seem to infringe on the privacy and rights of the applicants to the extent that in many cases there is an investigation also into whether these people are employed by their parents? Many of these young men are adults&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking whether the Minister agrees that there might be an infringement of the privacy of the applicants to the extent that information may be related to their parents which the applicants would not wish their parents to have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant section of the Social Welfare Act provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing from the use of property which is used and enjoyed by the applicant is included in the calculation of means.  One can <Col N="3045" /> readily visualise cases in which farmers' sons, though living some distance perhaps from their father's farms, would have some beneficial interest in the farms and therefore would be assessable on that basis.  Such cases are difficult but the information must be obtained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. Would the Minister not agree that in many cases it is blatantly obvious that since the applicants reside away from the family holding they do not have any income from those sources and that it is an infringement on their privacy if, in the process of the investigation of means, their parents are notified of the applications for unemployment assistance? We are talking about men who are married and leading lives of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that where there appears to be a beneficial interest, that interest is taken into consideration. In practically all of those cases in which there appeared to be delays, investigations showed that the delays arose from the non co-operation of the applicants in providing the information necessary to enable a deciding officer to reach a decision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has made or if he plans any changes to the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 49 of 1985; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations referred to prescribed the conditions for the payment of fuel allowances by the health boards.  Further regulations entitled the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowance) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1985 &mdash; S.I. No. 334 of 1985 &mdash;<Col N="3046" /> made on 3 October 1985 amended the earlier regulations to provide that persons who are not in the categories specifically provided for in those regulations but who received a fuel allowance under the arrangements which existed prior to those regulations, may, if their circumstances have not changed, continue to be entitled to an allowance.</P>
      <P>The amending regulations provide also for an increase from £4 to £5 in the weekly value of the allowance with effect from the commencement of the heating season in October 1985.  No further amendments are contemplated at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it considered necessary to amend the earlier regulations which had been made only some time previously?  Also, can the Minister indicate how many people will be affected by the new regulations and how many will qualify for the fuel allowance under the new regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer to the first part of the question is that the amendment was made to provide against any hardship because prior to the present heating season discussions were held with the Eastern Health Board concerning the implementation of the regulations.  It emerged in the course of these discussions that while persons on short-term payments had not been provided for under the previous arrangement, many such persons had been granted fuel allowances by the health board who felt they had the flexibility to do this under the guidelines where they considered it was warranted.  They considered that under the regulations they would have no such flexibility and that the persons concerned would have to be disallowed.  That is why the further amendment was brought in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any arrangements been made to inform the people who have already been refused the fuel allowance under the existing regulations but who may possibly qualify under the new regulations of this?  If I was unaware that these new regulations existed, it is <Col N="3047" /> highly unlikely that most of the people who are entitled do not know about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the health boards and the community welfare officers are aware of the position and I cannot see any major administrative difficulty in this area because there would be a record of those who received the allowance last year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 3 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The conditions for payment of fuel allowances by health boards under the national fuel scheme are prescribed by regulations.  Under these regulations a person in receipt of a long term social welfare or analogous payment may, subject to certain conditions, be eligible for fuel allowance provided that he is considered by the board to be unable to provide for his heating needs.  Persons in rural areas in receipt of such payments who have been unable to save turf because of the bad summer could qualify under the scheme.  Application should be made to the local community welfare officer.</P>
      <P>I consider that the health boards have adequate powers under the regulations to cater for persons in the categories concerned who need assistance towards their heating needs.  The value of the weekly fuel allowance was increased, as provided in the budget, from £4 to £5 a week with effect from the beginning of the present heating season in October 1985.  There are no plans at present for any further increase in the value of the allowance.</P>

The inquiries, which were extensive, were recently completed and the case was than referred to an appeals officer for determination, at the earliest available opportunity.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will discontinue the <Col N="3053" /> recently introduced practice that demands medical certificates from social recipients to be posted to his Department and revert to allowing these medical certificates to be handed in to local offices, thereby eliminating the extra cost to the individual of postage stamps.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced a Post Office Box Holding facility (P. O. Box 1650) in October for medical certificates sent by post by disability benefit claimants.  The facility is designed to segregate medical certificates from other items of post and thereby enable benefit payments to be dealt with more expeditiously.</P>
      <P>If they so wish claimants may continue to use the arrangement whereby medical certificates are handed in to any of the Department's offices for transmission to the disability benefit payments section and many, in fact, still do so.</P>

      <P>Which system do the Department regard as the most efficient in relation to processing certificates?  It seems that when they are posted by claimants many certificates get lost.  I am not attributing the blame solely to the Department.  Would the Minister advise applicants to hand in certificates at the local exchanges rather than posting them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the post office box facility was designed to cater for the people who normally posted their certificates.  When one considers that approximately 52,000 medical certificates are received each week in the Department, the post office box facilitated an improvement in the system. Those who usually hand in their certificates to the local offices may continue to do that if it suits them better.</P>

Tallaght Welfare Centre has also accepted on an informal basis medical certificates from persons in the Tallaght area for transmission to the Department through the postal service.  People posting their certificates post them as per the instructions issued and the people who hand them into the various offices of the Department can continue to do that.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of farmers in County Donegal who have been factually assessed for unemployment assistance since PLV was declared unconstitutional by the High Court; the number whose benefit has been increased, reduced, terminated or unaltered as a result of being factually assessed; and the cost or saving to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 22 together.  Following the High Court ruling arrangements were made to have the means of all nationally assessed smallholders assessed on a factual basis.  The factual assessment exercise was commenced in May 1983 and up to the end of October 1985 a total of 10,554 smallholders were assessed of whom 962 were in Donegal.  The number of cases remaining to be assessed at the <Col N="3058" /> end of October was 79.  There were no outstanding cases in Donegal.</P>
      <P>The result of the factual assessment was that payment was increased in 3,118 cases, reduced in 4,327 cases, terminated in 3,089 cases and remained unaltered in 20 cases The corresponding figures for Donegal which have been extracted from the total figures just mentioned are 461 cases of increased payment, 358 cases of reduced payment, 140 cases in which payment was terminated and three cases where there was no change.</P>
      <P>As regards the expenditure effects of the change-over to factual assessment, the position is that expenditure budgeted for unemployment assistance for smallholders this year at £37.84 million is considerably higher than the £34.34 million spent in 1982, the last complete year in which payment was made on the notional basis of assessment.  The increased expenditure combined with the lower numbers in receipt of payment means that the average payment to recipients has increased considerably.</P>
      <P>A desirable effect of the system of factual assessment of means is that it ensures that the available funds are concentrated on those most in need.  In addition the change-over to factual assessment ensures that all smallholders receiving unemployment assistance are now entitled to annual budget increases which they did not receive while notionally assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has stated that in the factual assessment 4,327 small farmers had their unemployment assistance reduced.  Many of these farmers, some of whom are known personally to me, have probably fewer than half a dozen cattle and in many instances one or two cows.  In view of the particularly difficult season we have had, weatherwise and so on, would he consider relaxing the means test or at least give consideration to the extra expenses incurred by these small farmers to buy feedingstuff, etc., to get them through the coming winter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be <Col N="3059" /> aware that under the scheme it is open to recipients of unemployment assistance if they feel their means have worsened since their previous assessment to apply for reassessment.  I suggest that they do that, if, as the Deputy stated, their income has decreased and their expenditure has increased.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, includes provision for the removal of the existing limitations on the eligibility of married women for unemployment assistance.

    <P>The method of financing the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, whereby expenditure was shared by the Exchequer and the local authorities, proved unsatisfactory in practice and the Government have accordingly decided that from 1 January 1986 the scheme will be paid for entirely by the Exchequer, with rates support grants by the Exchequer to local authorities being adjusted accordingly. The arrears due by local authorities at 31 December 1985, after allowing for contributions made by the authorities in 1985 and for certain adjustments agreed by the Government, will have to be paid off by the authorities, and a period of five years is being allowed for the discharge of the balance due.  Discussions will be held between the health boards, local authorities and the Departments concerned to work out the arrangements for paying off the arrears.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken the advice from this side of the House that the system of payments should be changed and transferred to the Exchequer rather than being left with local authorities.  Since there is more than £20 million due by local authorities, and since they do not have any part in the implementation of the scheme and determining the eligibility for supplementary welfare payments, will the Minister concede that at this stage the amount due by local authorities should not be taken up by the Exchequer because it will prove to be a very expensive imposition on the resources of local authorities over the next five years?</P>

      <P>It has not been accepted. The claimant lives on a 19-acre farm.  The land is considered fair and has a valuation of £13.  The claimant transferred this land to his nephew and the estimated income from this holding with a stock of 15 cows, five calves and six one and a half year olds, less operating costs of £2.000 was estimated to equal £4,000.  The claimant <Col N="3064" /> is in beneficial occupation of a second holding of 19 acres which is owned by his brother who lives in England.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his Department have taken any steps to establish the level of non-take up by persons of social welfare benefits to which they are entitled; if he has any plans to increase public awareness of people's entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not have the resources to undertake formal measurement of the level of non-take up by persons of social welfare benefits to which they are entitled.  This would require very complex and expensive household surveys.  There is little evidence of lack of take-up of departmental schemes.</P>
      <P>Considerable efforts are made by the Department to increase public awareness of entitlements by providing information on schemes and services.  Those efforts fall into three categories:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department now have 31 public offices and information centres.  The information service in over half of these offices has been improved by the <Col N="3066" /> installation of computer visual display terminals.</P>
    <P>The Department produce a wide range of publications about their services, which are distributed through their information centres, voluntary information centres, at seminars and on request to various organisations and individuals.</P>
    <P>General information booklets and booklets setting out the rates of payment of various schemes are widely distributed in addition to a range of individual leaflets on schemes.  New leaflets have been added recently, specifically designed to improve awareness of entitlements, for example <i>Social Welfare and School-Leavers</i> and a <i>Checklist for Pensioners</i>.  I have arranged for a selection of these publications to be sent to the Deputy for information.</P>
    <P>The Department advertise extensively when new schemes are introduced, or existing ones amended, and also when there is a need to make the public aware of administrative changes.</P>
    <P>Each of these three methods is being improved and developed as resources allow.  In addition, officers of my Department take part in seminars and educational and training courses around the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Proinsias de Rossa Proinsias de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister's Department have even an estimate of the sum which has not been taken up by people who could be eligible?  I assume that in preparing Estimates the Department have a fair idea of what should be taken up, given the level of unemployment, disability and so forth.  Could he indicate what estimate there would be of lack of take-up?  Would he not consider also information centres or officers being made available in labour exchanges where many social welfare recipients have to attend?  This might improve the take-up of many benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to their general information sector, the Department <Col N="3067" /> have a network of information outlets throughout the country.  In Dublin there are three public offices at Oisin House, Pearse Street; Phibsboro Tower, Phibsboro and Gandon House, Amiens Street.  There are also information offices in Crumlin and Ballyfermot.  Outside Dublin there are information officers stationed in 26 employment exchanges in the major centres of population.  About 82 per cent of persons aged over 66 years are in receipt of a pension or other long term social welfare payment.  The 18 per cent remaining would be public service pensioners.  About 63 per cent of widows are in receipt of a widow's pension and there is about 100 per cent take-up on the children's allowances.  In the case of unemployment there is no reason to believe that the take-up is less than 100 per cent.  It is more difficult to measure disability benefit take-up.  That is a general broad indication that I have given the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>A Christmas bonus amounting to 75 per cent of the weekly entitlement will be paid in the week ending 6 December 1985.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid as usual to pensioners and persons receiving allowances in the nature of pensions.  There are approximately 119,000 of these.  It will also be paid to the long term unemployed, that is, those who have been unemployed for 15 months or more, of whom there are some 105,000.  In all, therefore, some 524,000 will benefit from the bonus payment.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the long term unemployed have been included and, because of the consequential big increase in coverage of the scheme, each person who qualifies will get a bonus of 75 per cent of normal weekly entitlement.  The new arrangement will not involve a saving for the Department.  On the contrary there will be an additional cost.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the undue delay in dealing with unemployment assistance appeals; and if he has any proposal to speed up investigations and decisions on such appeals especially in relation to claims for smallholders assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 23, 41 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Detailed statistics are not kept of the average length of time taken to process appeals under the various social welfare schemes.  Significant delays can, however occur where an oral hearing is necessary and particularly where further investigations of means by the social welfare officer are looked for before the decision is made.  There has been, however, in recent months, a significant reduction in the time taken to deal with all appeals under the unemployment assistance scheme, including appeals from smallholders.</P>
      <P>This improvement in processing appeals also applies to cases which are the subject of an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>The improvement arises largely as a result of the appointment of two additional appeals officers at the end of last year and the appointment of a number of temporary appeals officers last May to deal with oral hearings of appeals by smallholders.  Every effort is being made to process appeals as quickly as possible within the constraints of the staffing and other resources available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in general the waiting periods for these appeals to be heard extends from four to six months which is totally unacceptable?  Would the Minister inform us if any specific methods were undertaken by his Department this year to help advise smallholders who felt they had been hard done by by social welfare <Col N="3074" /> officers in informing them of their rights to appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, the Department are making every effort to improve the situation.  In his question the Deputy referred to appeals under the new arrangement announced on 12 June last which is that all smallholders who appeal against their means assessment may request oral hearings.  These cases are dealt with by four appeals officers who are appointed on a temporary basis to deal mainly with oral hearings and smallholders' appeals.  The appointment of the four temporary appeals officers has meant that smallholders' appeals are now dealt with more quickly.</P>
      <P>However, it does not follow that reinvestigation of means by social welfare officers &mdash; which must take place when an application for a review of means is lodged &mdash; has been speeded up because delays can ensue.  So while the appeals problem has been tackled there still remains some problem of delays at social welfare officer level because it is only when cases are determined by a deciding officer that a smallholder may appeal his assessment.  A feature of the new arrangements for dealing with smallholders' cases and which contribute to a speeding up of the process, is that details of the various items of income and expenses upon which a deciding officer makes his decision are given to the applicant. As already mentioned, when appeals are lodged, the smallholder has an opportunity to put his case in detail to the appeals officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While respecting that the additional appeals officers will help, I did ask the Minister if any attempt had been made by his Department to increase public awareness, particularly amongst these smallholders, of their right to appeal?  The Minister did not seem to have any specific information that there had been any attempt.  Is the Minister aware that his colleague, Deputy Donnellan, Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, flooded the west with circulars to all smallholders on the <Col N="3075" /> western seaboard whose cases were up for appeal or who had lost their unemployment assistance payments?  Is the Minister aware of that, or is he trying to conceal it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the contents of the circular to which the Deputy refers.  If the content is designed to inform claimants and people who appeal of their rights and the procedure, then it is in line with what the Deputy was looking for in the earlier part of his question.  He wanted to know about the attempts we were making to inform people of their rights and what they should do.  I do not think the Deputy should complain if the Minister of State goes out of his way to do that.  A major improvement is the procedure introduced during the year whereby claimants are given details of the exact basis on which assessments are made.  This was never done before and it is a big help to claimants if they wish to proceed with an appeal.</P>

      <P>In his statement on employment and tax reform to the House on 23 October last the Taoiseach stated that the Government are considering proposals for the overhaul of the disability benefit scheme.  At the same time the Taoiseach also stated that the National Economic and Social Council would be asked for their views.  This has been done and the views of the council are awaited.

      <P>When the Taoiseach made his statement on 23 October in relation to short term disability benefit, one assumed he was referring to those who were less than ten weeks on benefit. The Taoiseach may not have been aware that most people on disability benefit are on long term benefit.  Of the total of 77,000 people on disability benefit, 63,000 have been claiming for over ten weeks and only 14,000 for less than ten weeks.  Does the Minister not accept that it would be very difficult to work out this method because we would be totally reliant on employers, since the provision of medical referees would not be possible under the type of scheme suggested by the Taoiseach?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish agreement is a solemn treaty between the two sovereign Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom and it is proposed to register this treaty at the United Nations.  A major point in this whole matter is that it is a signed treaty and not just a statement of intent or the type of political communique which emanates regularly after meetings of political leaders. It is the treaty which creates binding legal obligations not just for the present but for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3113" /> This is of paramount importance in considering Article 1 in which an Irish Government confers legitimacy for the first time on the union of Great Britian and Northern Ireland, in direct conflict with the Constitution of the Republic of Ireland, from which the Government and this Oireachtas derive their powers.  This cannot be dismissed as a mere legalism, as it has been called in the course of this debate.  It is a living, vital fact that operates into the future that unless Article 1 is renegotiated the Irish State and the Government representing that State are precluded from ever raising the issue of Irish unity at any international conference or at any judicial tribunal anywhere in the world.  This is not just a matter of harking back in the past.  It is the future which is being jeopardised by this treaty, not just the past or the present.</P>
    <P>Article 1 also incorporates the guarantee of a Unionist veto over the status of Northern Ireland.  This has been rightly identified over the years by all Nationalist leaders of varying political parties and groups as the main stumbling block to any movement in the direction of ultimate unity.  It was clearly identified as such in the report of the New Ireland Forum and it is central to the thinking of all the signatories to that Forum report.  It is central to the thinking of all constructive Nationalists in this island that the basic blockage to any progress lies in this guarantee to the Unionist population in the North-Eastern part of our island and that guarantee not alone remains but has now been enshrined into a treaty between two sovereign Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>To declare that if in the future &mdash; this is the saving clause that has been used by the Taoiseach &mdash; a majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the Governments will then introduce legislation to give effect to that, is a very circumscribed way of making a virtue out of necessity.  It is a basic political fact of life.  If that situation <Col N="3114" /> ever arose and the majority in the Six County area found themselves in a minority they would obviously be in an untenable position to maintain the union with the neighbouring island.  The Government of the United Kingdom would also find themselves in an untenable position.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is superfluous to the main thread of the comments I am making to make a case out of the fact that this is written into Article 1 as if it is in some way an abandonment of our constitutional position.  The writing in of British sovereignty over the Six Counties in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Article 1 amounts to a reiteration in treaty form of the veto held by the Unionist population over the Six Counties.  That veto which has been rightly condemned as fundamental and central to the maintenance of the artificial hegemony which has existed in that area is now enshrined in treaty form between two Governments and agreed to by our Government contrary to the Constitution from which the Irish Government derive their power to govern in this part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Not only is the Unionist veto guaranteed in Article 1, but further vetoes are written in.  The Irish State, for the first time, makes itself a co-guarantor with the British of the Unionist veto.  We now find ourselves supporting a veto which we rightly said over the years constituted the main and serious blockage to any talks which might being us along the way to peace, stability and reconciliation.  The Irish Government are now prevented from raising this matter in any international fora such as those which I have mentioned and have precluded and inhibited themselves from pursuing this matter with the United Kingdom also.</P>
    <P>There is a further veto in Article 1 which intensifies and cements the position as far as Irish Nationalist aspirations are concerned.  The United Kingdom, as well as the Irish Government, preclude themselves from interfering with the status of Northern Ireland even if the majority of the United Kingdom electorate wish to have a united Ireland.  We now have not just a veto, which was always there, but one enshrined in a treaty <Col N="3115" /> signed by the sovereign Irish and British Governments.  That veto is not alone guaranteed to the Unionists; it is also a veto exercised by the Republic guaranteeing the Unionist position.  There is also a veto on the part of Great Britain who now constitute themselves, along with the Republic, as joint or co-guarantors of the Unionist veto.  That is the enormity of what has happened.  It is not a mere legal term or even a constitutional matter; it has already been written in and agreed to by the Prime Ministers concerned and will remain in force forever unless that Article can be renegotiated.</P>
    <P>The British Government are not concerned about public relations paraphernalia designed for an imaginary run up to a general election.  They are concerned with the realities of an international treaty.  When one looks at the small print in Article 11, one sees the permanence of Article 1 because Article 11 states that at the end of three years, or earlier if requested by either Government, the working of the Conference shall be reviewed by the two Governments to see whether any changes in the scope and nature of its activities are desirable.  That article specifically excludes any reference to any other aspect of the agreement except the Inter-governmental Conference. The vital Article 1, which cements British sovereignty over the Six Counties, British union with the Six Counties, and guarantees that unity, is excluded specifically by Article 11 from any further investigation or review.  It is quite clear, when one reads Articles 1 and 11 together, that they are final and irrevocable unless we renogotiate them and there is no doubt from her remarks that they are very obviously regarded by the British Prime Minister as final and irrevocable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the basic and very serious national abnegation and abandonment involved in Article 1, especially taken in conjunction with Article 11, I wish to refer to the other Articles which are mainly concerned with the Conference. These Articles of themselves do not come into the same category of seriousness as <Col N="3116" /> Article 1, but in terms of practical impact in dealing with the problem they will cause substantial difficulties, more tension and further troubles in a problem being approached the wrong way around by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Conference does not derogate from British sovereignty in Northern Ireland.  Everybody agrees with that.  The British Prime Minister made that perfectly clear and I do not think the Minister for Foreign Affairs would argue otherwise. The Conference will be a hybrid which will be neither executive nor consultative. It will be a new form of animal, not being an executive and certainly not a consultative assembly.  It allows the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals, to make representations as we TDs do to the Ombudsman.  The Government's views and proposals will be on matters relating to Northern Ireland. Then there is the aspiration advising everyone in the most non-legal language, that determined efforts to resolve any differences will be made at the Conference.</P>
    <P>What in the name of God is the legal meaning of &ldquo;determined efforts to be made in the resolution of differences&rdquo;? That is all hyperbole and nonsense.  It defies any legal description or meaning and it should not be incorporated in a document as serious as this because it means sweet Fanny Adams all.  It is a pious aspiration.  I hope everybody there will make determined efforts to resolve differences but do we have to paint it up in language of that kind?</P>
    <P>It is very significant that a further devolved government in Northern Ireland, whenever that appears, will be outside the scope of any of the activities of the Conference.  The British Prime Minister made that quite clear.  In effect, she said that the Conference would have an automatic self-destruct device, that in effect it would be gradually replaced and disappear as soon as the devolved administration appeared.</P>
    <P>Article 11 provides for a three year period.  In conjunction with Article 2, dealing with the setting up of the conference, <Col N="3117" /> it indicates that the British Prime Minister hopes the Conference will have disappeared in three years on the emergence of some form of devolved administration in the Six Counties which, as far as Nationalists are concerned, means the return of some type of Stormont administration.</P>
    <P>That is the scenario.  Articles 7, 8 and 9 put security matters up front in the whole workings of the Conference, and here a very basic question arises of how an Irish Government can participate in the workings of a Conference concerned with security matters over which the Irish Government will have no control, direction or power.  What kind of decisions will we as a country become party to?  The Irish State will have responsibility for, but no power to direct, Diplock tribunals, supergrass trials and the various range of highly unsatisfactory security forces and methods of behaviour of which we are justly and rightly suspicious and in some cases know to be downright immoral.</P>
    <P>It must be faced honestly, and unfortunately events seem to be moving this way already, that this agreement will do nothing to promote peace, stability and reconciliation.  Unfortunately, there are ominous signs that this treaty already is tending to exacerbate discord.</P>
    <P>I will summarise the case we have put forward in the debate and explain clearly the reasons for our voting position at the end of it.  The key to our position is contained in the penultimate paragraph of our amendment:</P>
    <P>while recognising the urgent need that exists for substantial improvement in the situation and circumstances of the nationalist section of the community in the North of Ireland and approving any effective measures which may be undertaken for that purpose, refuses to accept any recognition of British sovereignty over any part of the national territory.</P>
    <P>I would point out, especially to our friends in the media, that the amendment was tabled not today or yesterday but before the debate even started.  Despite offensive press headlines to the contrary, <Col N="3118" /> we have not found it necessary to change our attitude, which from the very beginning was approving and supportive of any measures designed to ameliorate or improve the situation of Northern Nationalists.  It would never be our desire to hinder any developments that would be of genuine benefit to the Northern Nationalists.  We realise only too well the unacceptable situation which they have been part of for so many years, and indeed the sufferings of the whole community in Northern Ireland, and we would be the first to support any measures that would genuinely lead to peace, stability and reconciliation.  We have consistently supported such measures, for instance, the disbandment of the UDR, the ending of supergrass trials, the banning of plastic bullets and an end to strip searches.</P>
    <P>However, we are deeply concerned about some aspects of the proposed Conference and secretariat and about the difficulties of reconciling responsibility without power which the Irish Government are going to find themselves in. That is the basic practical reality that emerges.  We have no wish to make that situation more tense or difficult.  Neither would it be helpful or of any value if we ran away from realities in discussing the matter here in the National Parliament.</P>
    <P>We have never seen any inconsistency in our seeking immediate reforms in Northern society and institutions while maintaining our basic commitment to the unity of our country.  If any fundamental radical reforms in Northern society were to emerge and if action were taken to establish genuine equality between the different communities, such would have our wholehearted support.  However, we cannot accept that unity must be put in second place or sacrificed in any way and I repeat that we see no incompatibility in pursuing the twin objectives of remedial improvements in the way of life in Northern Ireland and the Irish Nationalist goal which alone, as the Forum report concluded, can guarantee the peace and stability that we all wish for in this island.</P>
    <P>British sovereignty is not to be put in second place in order to achieve reforms <Col N="3119" /> in Northern society.  On the contrary, the British insist at all times that maintenance of the union is the context of everything that will happen.  The pursuit of British sovereignty is paramount in the inviolate and protected way that Article 1 of the agreement guarantees.</P>
    <P>What we cannot accept, as the guarantors of Irish unity, is the legitimisation of Partition, of British sovereignty in part of our island and of the British presence in Ireland.  That is something totally new not only in terms of Fianna Fáil policies but in terms of the policies of all the major parties in the House.  It is new to the policies subscribed to both in the New Ireland Forum and in the declaration proposed by the late John A. Costello in 1949 and seconded by the late Eamon de Valera.  The legitimisation of Partition is new in terms of the entire lifetime of this State.  In Article 1 of the agreement the Government are abandoning the position adhered to by all Governments in this State despite differences in regard to detail.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the agreement represents a clear abandonment of the principles of democratic nationalism, principles to which I should hope that to some extent Fine Gael and Labour would subscribe. My faith, revived somewhat during the Forum discussions, is now shattered in that respect.  The Irish people will see the agreement as an abandonment of basic principles on the part of the Government parties for the purpose of immediate opportunistic political expediency.  Such formal recognition &mdash; and nobody has contested seriously that this is not a formal recognition of Partition and of the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland &mdash; must be opposed.  The fundamental principles involved in the whole constitutional Nationalist position must be upheld.  The benefits of the agreement have yet to be established but the sacrifice of the entire basis of constitutional nationalism is immediate, categoric and real since the signing of this treaty by the Prime Ministers.</P>
    <P>We will be voting for our amendment <Col N="3120" /> because it would not be consistent with our entire position to approve an agreement incorporating aspects that we find totally objectionable.  We will remain faithful to the position that has been held in common up to now by all parties in this House.  Our entire purpose as a political movement is the pursuit of the right to a united Ireland by political means.  It would be a grey day for the country and a dereliction of duty by responsible politicians for us to state that there is no longer any right to a united Ireland and that unification may not be pursued by political means.  The alternative to the pursuit of unity by political means is too horrendous to contemplate.  Our position as the upholders of constructive democratic nationalism is the basic ingredient in maintaining peace and stability particularly in this part of Ireland.  It would be beyond contemplation that there should be no voice in this democratic Parliament to express the point of view that is expressed by Fianna Fáil.  If we who are the representatives and the guarantors of democratic constitutional nationalism were to renege our political position, as the Government have reneged Ireland's national position, there would be a very serious kind of situation here in this part of the country as well as in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>But the party who, consistently and constructively, have followed the line of unity by way of political means were ignored and shut out from any of the discussions that led to this unilateral decision by the Government.  They ignored a party who have given far more in the way of attendance at and participation in the Forum discussions than all the other parties put together.  I invite any of the officials present to examine the work of the various committees of the Forum should they wish to verify what I am saying.  Fianna Fáil made a major contribution in drawing up the agreed Forum report in which it was stated categorically that a united Ireland was the only way of achieving peace, stability and reconciliation but we were shut out from the considerations adopted <Col N="3121" /> by the Government for purely political reasons subsequent to the findings of that Forum.</P>
    <P>It may be interesting to note that what has emerged now is far short of any of the options referred to in the report.  We adopted an honourable stance in support of a unitary state option which would provide for irrevocable guarantees so far as the Unionist population was concerned in the devising of a new Constitution for a new Ireland.  That was a stance which would guarantee protection at law and by the law for the Unionist minority in a united Ireland but we were accused at that time by advocates of federalism, of confederalism and of joint authority as pursuing something that was not practicable. The people who criticised our party Leader, Deputy Haughey, on that occasion are now here before this House with a treaty that falls far short of joint sovereignty, of a federal or confederal solution to our problems and short of any unitary State option.  The options in the Forum report are being jettisoned by the Government who decided to shut the door in our faces and then decided to deal secretly with the British Prime Minister. They now find themselves with a document which is innocuous in terminology but very dangerous in form.  The British are never innocous when it comes to the implementation of documents they sign with other governments.</P>
    <P>The basic thread running through this document is that of maintaining the present British position while giving it an international diplomatic credence and apart from our domestic position we are precluded from ever raising the issue of Partition again at any international forum.  The British have already started selling this document abroad.  Every British diplomatic mission throughout the world has been instructed to tell the governors of accredited countries that the Irish problem has been resolved and can be buried.  That is the way the British operate.  It makes me very sad that an Irish Government have enabled them to do what they are very good at, spreading subtle insidious propoganda through their multitude of contacts throughout <Col N="3122" /> the world.  No amount of smart talk from Iveagh House, which might influence local journalists, is going to beat the British in this area.  As far as the British are concerned, the Irish problem is settled and this document is not a start but an ending.  Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, will go back to what is for her the more congenial task of bringing the Unionist voters of Finchley under the rod before the next general election.</P>
    <P>As we say in our amendment the only way the Forum conclusions can be implemented in a spirit of generosity towards the Unionists and people of all faiths, in the spirit of Wolfe Tone, acknowledging Protestant rights and aspirations as well as Unionist rights and aspirations, is to bring together all parties to the conference table with a view to devising a new Constitution for a new Ireland.  Anything less than this type of approach is bound to fail.  That is the basic indictment of this agreement.  It is bound to fail because not alone is it inadequate but is is cementing a position to which we have all objected.</P>
    <P>We now find ourselves as a lone party with the Nationalist forces.  We are very proud of that because the Irish people support us, and this will be reflected in the results of the next general election. In voting against this motion we are opposing a fundamental change in the constitutional position which this agreement brings about.  We are not rejecting any measures or attempts to improve the position of those who live in the tortured North but we reiterate the basic position that is alive today and which will be as live in 1995 if it is not dealt with.  Our young people are as aware of this as we are and they want to live in an Ireland in which all traditions can be acknowledged and in which there can be peace, stability and justice.  The society we want will not be frustrated by a British presence and British interference.  As long as they remain, one will have to live with frustration, discord and violence.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is designed to put Ireland's national future into perspective so that it will be judged by the Irish <Col N="3123" /> people in the context not just of history but of the future of the Republic we have so dearly established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put on record my personal satisfaction that Dáil Éireann has discussed this difficult issue with great seriousness, with perfect decorum and without acrimony.  That this should have been achieved is a tribute to all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Throughout this whole business my conviction has never been shaken that the work of the Forum created a fundamental solidarity between constitutional Nationalists in Ireland which in several respects was deeper than the disagreements which have surfaced between us.  I have said that the Forum reshaped Irish politics.  I have said that it was a tragedy that our fathers and our grandfathers did not have a device such as the Forum.  I have found in the attitudes shown throughout this very important debate ample confirmation of this conviction of mine.</P>
      <P>Ireland has made remarkable strides in political and institutional growth since the foundation of the State.  I cannot recall in my years in the House a debate that gave such solid testimony to this as that which we are now concluding.  This is due, of course, in great measure to the extremely conciliatory and modest tone taken by the Taoiseach in his remarkable speech at the beginning of our discussion. The Taoiseach asked his own side to make no claims for his own achievement that were in the slightest way exaggerated, triumphalist or self-congratulatory. I will carefully observe his instruction, an instruction which is, of course, typical of the Taoiseach.  We on this side also owe a tribute to the Leader of the Opposition for the conciliatory tone of his remarks, even if we find ourselves in disagreement with much of what he said in terms of substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come directly to substance.  The Government side have replied to all the points put to us and we are grateful to the Opposition for raising these questions. <Col N="3124" /> The Opposition have an obligation to be vigilant on behalf of the people on all questions of public policy and particularly on matters which could influence the future of our island as a whole.  We acknowledge the importance and the value of opposition and many of the questions that have been put to us are questions based on genuine concern.  The record of this debate will give to students of the agreement a perceptive insight into the shared principles and hopes that lay behind it, as well as into its institutional complexities.  Some of these are, as has been said, of a high order of ingenuity and of a character such as will require to be for the common benefit and not merely for the benefit of one side or of the other.</P>
    <P>Having lived closely for many months with the negotiation of the agreement and the communique, I had come to underestimate the complexity of what has been agreed.  Having heard the reactions of those who did not have this experience, I can now readily understand how the agreement might have been either misconstrued or, as has happened particularly in the North, extensively misrepresented.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Thatcher is a &ldquo;Unionist and a Loyalist&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach is a &ldquo;Nationalist and a Republican&rdquo;.  Any agreement &mdash; and I emphasise that word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; in its full meaning &mdash; between these divided sets of convictions must, if one thinks about it, necessarily be complex, intricate and carefully balanced. These are the qualities of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, 1985.  It is clear that they will become fully apparent to Unionists and to Nationalists only through the process of implementation.  There are, however, a number of assurances and clarifications that I should emphasise as I am the last speaker on the Government side of the House in these closing moments of the debate.  Let me divide them into those addressed to Nationalist concerns and those addressed to Unionist concerns, both of which, I am glad to note, have been raised by Deputies.</P>
    <P>First, in relation to the Nationalist concerns, on Article 1, the Government in their negotiations were, it goes without <Col N="3125" /> saying, constrained to have the most meticulous regard to Bunreacht na hÉireann. The agreement is, as it must be, of course, totally consistent with the Constitution. The Opposition, in expressing concern about this matter, are both mistaken and confused.  Our conviction is based on the most detailed consideration by those authorised to advise us and we are confident of our position.  It does not seem logical, mature or responsible, that the Opposition, while on the one hand expressing criticism in strong terms of the agreement from the viewpoint of the Constitution, admit on the other that they do not intend to exercise their legal prerogatives on the matter.</P>
    <P>The concern voiced about this question is presumably directed to Article 1 of the agreement.  Article 1 relates, not to the present constitutional frameworks of the two countries which are of course different so far as Northern Ireland is concerned, but rather to the future, and specifically to the possibility of change in the future.  The point of departure of Article 1 is the desire of both Governments to reassure both Unionists and Nationalists about the future.</P>
    <P>Article 1 recognises by implication that the country is not now politically united. Article 3 of Bunreacht na hÉireann speaks of arrangements &ldquo;pending the reintegration of the national territory&rdquo; in other words, the same thing.  Nevertheless it was important that this reality be acknowledged at least by implication in the agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 1, moreover, recognises that a majority in Northern Ireland do not now desire a change in the present status of Northern Ireland.  Who could possibly disagree with that assertion?  This is also important, however, and has frequently been called for by Unionist critics of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, Article 1 provides that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  Deputy Haughey used these exact words in a formal joint statement with Mrs. Thatcher in May 1980, in which it was further stated that he agreed with <Col N="3126" /> Mrs. Thatcher in using those words. Article 1 also commits the two Governments to take the initiative to establish Irish unity if and when a majority in Northern Ireland so desire.  Article 1 thus makes it clear that the only criterion for the establishment of Irish unity, so far as both Governments are concerned, is the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>These agreed propositions, taken together, are of importance to Unionists because they make it crystal clear that Irish Unity will come about only if and when consent to unity should emerge. They are important to Nationalists because they make it crystal clear that Britain has no interest in staying in Ireland other than as a guarantor of consent: if consent to unity should emerge, Britain will leave.  Both Governments are committed under the agreement to establishing Irish unity if that principle &mdash; and that principle alone &mdash; is met.  That is, of course, the position we all share in this House and its incorporation in an Anglo-Irish agreement is an important development, as many have already recognised.</P>
    <P>In short, Article 1 marks no departure from the Irish constitutional framework or from the British constitutional framework. More significantly, in agreeing about what would happen in future circumstances, Article 1 provides a solid set of guarantees both to Nationalists and to Unionists, based rigorously on the principle of consent.  I am deeply convinced that both sides will come to see that this creates a solid and secure basis for themselves and for their children.</P>
    <P>The lack of certainty about the future of Northern Ireland has been at the heart of most of the conflict and instability since 1920.  Unionists have feared that Irish unity would be imposed on Northern Ireland against the wishes of a majority in Northern Ireland.  Their leaders have played on this fear to paralyse the politics of the North and as a result the Nationalist community have suffered discrimination, domination, political exclusion and the denial of their identity.  Every attempt by Britain to reassure Unionists by a one-sided guarantee has only reinforced Unionist paranoia and strengthened the <Col N="3127" /> division between Nationalist and Unionist. London failed to understand that measures such as Border polls, which were intended to comfort Unionists alone, only created greater uncertainty than ever.</P>
    <P>Similarly some misguided Nationalists had been led, perhaps inevitably, by the emphasis given to this guarantee to look on Britain as the only problem, the only wilful obstacle to Irish unity.  This has led to a failure to face up to the realities of division in Northern Ireland, the painfully difficult reality for Nationalists of the existence of a majority whose desire is to be part of the United Kingdom.  The Unionists, because of the same guarantee, feared irrationally the Nationalist community, their aspiration and their ethos to a point where they in turn failed to confront the Nationalist problem in their midst.  Both sides have, for generations, in different ways, been plagued by uncertainty about the future: the Nationalists in case there might be no change, the Unionists in case there might be any change.  Article 1 is a product of the shared desire of the two Governments to meet precisely this humanitarian problem and that is how it should be read; not by Unionists who see only the benefits for Nationalists; not by Nationalists who see only the benefits for Unionists; but by Nationalists and Unionists who are ready to see the benefit for both traditions.  Far from being a betrayal of Nationalists or of Unionists, Article 1 is in fact an exercise in ingenious and benign draftsmanship, which betrays no one and guarantees for the first time both sets of concerns.</P>
    <P>During this debate the Opposition have repeatedly expressed a worry about the references in the agreement to the possibility of arrangements for devolution in Northern Ireland and about the implications of this.  In particular, they are concerned lest this should mean in practice the elimination of the Irish Government from the Anglo-Irish framework which the agreement establishes to address the problems of the North.  I have <Col N="3128" /> already tried to clarify this but I believe it is important to summarise the position once again.</P>
    <P>First, both Governments strongly favour devolution on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance.  That means, as Mrs. Thatcher has said, involving the two communities in the system of devolution.</P>
    <P>Second, whether or not there is devolution, the Inter-Governmental Conference will continue to deal with human rights, justice, law and order, questions of identity and culture: in other words all the most difficult and sensitive issues in the North.</P>
    <P>Third, if there is devolution the Conference would cease to deal with the social and economic matters within the North which are now the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Civil Service Departments.  Those matters would be dealt with, not by the Conference or the British Government, but by devolved administration involving representatives of the two communities.</P>
    <P>Fourth, if that devolution broke down, then the Conference would once again have a role on the issues which had been the responsibility of the devolved administration.</P>
    <P>All of this provides incentives to Unionists and to Nationalists, in different ways, to become involved in efforts to achieve devolution.  It does not mean that the Irish Government would cease to be involved in the basic concerns of the two communities in the North if devolution were achieved and sustained.</P>
    <P>The agreement, in its provisions on devolution, if not envisaging a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; within the confines of Northern Ireland. The agreement, however, aims at providing every possible reassuring incentive to both sets of constitutional politicians to take a hand in real politics.  We earnestly hope that it will be possible for both sides to avail of the opportunity provided by the agreement to do this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, Deputy Collins, Deputy O'Kennedy, Deputy Lenihan and others have voiced concern about the role of the Irish Government.  They have found no reference to the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;. <Col N="3129" /> Let me reply by saying candidly that the two Governments were not able, either separately or jointly, to find a single word which would adequately describe the processes of the Conference. The text of the agreement is short but extraordinarily complex.  On no point is it more complex than in its description of the processes of the Conference.</P>
    <P>The role of the Conference will operate at four different levels, each of which is distinct.  For the most part the Conference will operate at three of those levels simultaneously and otherwise, when dealing with matters of North-South co-operation, at the fourth level.  Let me try to explain.</P>
    <P>I would first draw a general distinction between the work of the Conference in relation to matters concerning Northern Ireland on the one hand and its work on the promotion of North-South co-operation on the other.  This is implied in Article 2 (a) which lists the matters the Conference will deal with as: (i) political matters; (ii) security and related matters; (iii) legal matters, including the administration of justice and (iv) the promotion of cross-Border co-operation.  The first three headings concern Northern Ireland as such and they are dealt with in detail in the text of the agreement: political matters under Articles 5 and 6; security and related matters under Article 7 and legal matters under Article 8.  Cross-Border co-operation is also dealt with in a separate part of the legal text in Articles 9 and 10.</P>
    <P>Let me try to describe the process of the Conference as it concerns matters arising in Northern Ireland as such.  Here there are three levels to the process.  The first of the three levels is that which we normally understand by the word &ldquo;consultative&rdquo;. What does this mean?  This means that the responsible Government, that is the British Government, undertake an obligation to consult the interested party, in this case the Irish Government, about a range of matters. This is made quite clear in the text of Article 5 (a), Article 5 (c), Article 6, Article 7 and Article 8.  Article 5 (a), for example, provides that the &ldquo;Conference <Col N="3130" /> shall concern itself with measures to recognise and accommodate the rights and identities of the two traditions&rdquo;, giving examples of some areas that would arise.  Article 7 states that &ldquo;the Conference shall consider the security situation at its regular meetings and thus provide an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events&rdquo;.  Again Article 8 says that &ldquo;The Conference shall seek, with the help of advice from experts as appropriate, measures which would give substantial expression to this aim&rdquo;, the aim being public confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The second level goes beyond what we normally understand by the word &ldquo;consultative&rdquo;. In this case the interested party, the Irish Government, have under Article 2 (b) a formal right to put forward of their own initiative views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland within the field of activity of the Conference.  The third level, which governs the first two, is also established in Article 2 (b) and provides that &ldquo;in the interest of promoting peace and stability, determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences&rdquo;. Now this also involves a separate process, a process which is mandatory, and which goes beyond that which is understood by &ldquo;consultative&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; would be inappropriate as a description of the working of the process simultaneously at these three levels, as the agreement provides.  That is the reason why the word is not used.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fourth area, the promotion of cross-Border co-operation, the two Governments meet in the normal co-operative framework of two sovereign Governments seeking to make joint decisions in the common interest, each starting from a free and independent base.  Again the word, &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, does not apply.</P>
    <P>In seeking to put all of this into perspective, I should add two points.  The first is that the agreement provides, again in Article 2 (b), that: &ldquo;There is no derogation from the sovereignty of either the <Col N="3131" /> Irish Government or the United Kingdom Government, and each retains responsibility for the decisions and administration of government within its own jurisdiction.&rdquo;  I mention this, both because of the concern which has been expressed about the responsibility that might attach to the Irish Government because of certain possible developments in Northern Ireland, and because it is, as the Taoiseach said, essential that we be clear that the agreement does not confer a formal role of executive decision-making on the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The agreement does, however, create a substantial role and this is my second point.  There is now under the agreement, in relation to Northern Ireland, an obligation on Britain to consult us, an obligation on Britain to accommodate our right to put both views and proposals and an obligation on both Governments to make determined efforts to resolve any difficulties.  I think that this creates a significantly different situation from 1969 and 1972 when our right even to consultation was formally denied, a denial that was repeated with emphasis, as the Tánaiste reminded us yesterday, on 30 July 1982, three days after this had been conveyed directly to our Ambassador, when Mrs. Thatcher stated in the House of Commons:</P>
    <P>My right honourable friend, the Minister of State at the Foreign Office, made it perfectly clear to the Irish Ambassador that no commitment exists for Her Majesty's Government to consult the Irish Government on matters affecting Northern Ireland. That has always been our position.  We reiterated and emphasised that position.</P>
    <P>The two Governments are committed to making the agreement work.  Both Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. King have emphasised their determination in this regard.  The Irish Government are similarly determined.  We all know that it will be difficult &mdash; indeed, even in ideal circumstances it would be impossible &mdash; to satisfy everyone all the time.  We will <Col N="3132" /> expect the British to be understanding of our position as we will have to be of theirs.  Both Governments &mdash; not just the British Government, not just the Irish Government &mdash; must make determined efforts to resolve our differences.</P>
    <P>I can reassure Deputy O'Kennedy, however, that there will be no question of either Government hiding behind the Conference to evade difficulties, whether in the fields of human rights, justice or security, whether those difficulties arise in the Nationalist or Unionist sides or in the field of co-operation.  I believe that in my period as a Minister for Foreign Affairs I have pursued the concerns of the Northern Nationalist people energetically both publicly and privately with the British Government.  I shall not now lessen my efforts on their behalf; on the contrary. On the other hand, I am deeply convinced that there now exists a mechanism for making real progress, progress which will produce far more satisfactory results than public or private protests.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have expressed concern about the possible application in this jurisdiction of measures taken in Northern Ireland.  There has been a major misunderstanding here.  The agreement merits close reading over and over again. What does it say?  Article 2 says:</P>
    <P>Some of the proposals considered in respect of Northern Ireland may also be found to have application by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Article 5 says:</P>
    <P>The discussion of these matters shall be mainly concerned with Northern Ireland, but the possible application of any measures pursuant to this Article by the Irish Government in their jurisdiction shall not be excluded.</P>
    <P>Article 7 says:</P>
    <P>Elements of the programme may be considered by the Irish Government suitable for application within their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no obligation on us to do anything, but it would be nothing short of a sheer insult to go into this <Col N="3133" /> enterprise as though we had nothing to learn from the experience.  I hope and believe that we will learn a lot and that we will find, as stability and consensus grow in the North, many aspects of policy which could with profit be applied by our own Government independently in this jurisdiction.  Surely everybody in this House shares the desire to see, wherever appropriate, the same policies being applied in the two parts of Ireland, especially if we have an input into those being applied in the North.</P>
    <P>There is one statement on the record which, in the interest of a distinguished political party outside this House, must be put straight.  It is not true that the Government sought at any point to put any pressure on the SDLP, whether about the agreement or about the SDLP's role in political affairs in Northern Ireland.  The SDLP is a remarkably resilient and independent political entity.  We are not fools.  We know that any attempt in any way to force or to seduce the SDLP in any direction would be rejected immediately by that party.  We have the utmost respect for the independence of the SDLP.  No such attempt was made. None will be.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, and the Deputy Leader, with considerable conviction said that Fianna Fáil are the moral barrier against a violent and abhorrent form of Nationalism.  It is for this reason among others, the Leader says, that Fianna Fáil adhere to their policy of British withdrawal and that his party are opposed to the agreement.  I respect the sincerity with which Deputy Haughey expounds this view but I would suggest, without the slightest rancorous intention, that it is a blinkered view.  Despite my own instinct that Fine Gael have the strongest title in this regard, I think that we should all admit that no party on the Nationalist side has a monopoly on Republicanism.  No party is the only true guardian of the precious heritage of Nationalism.  No party is the sole barrier against any danger whatsoever.  The people are the moral force of this land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Dáil Éireann, the assembly of the people, is the moral barrier against any dangers.  We are free men and women in this House.  Let us in our deliberations hear no talk of political mysticism, no holy grails and no unilateral claims on moral barriers.  Let us reason out together all of the issues in this and in other important questions, as rational beings, respecting as rational beings and free men and women those for whom we speak and act.  The Irish people are not the prisoners of immoral barriers or of any other malign forces. They are a free rational people, entitled to rely on us, and on whom we are perfectly entitled to rely.</P>
      <P>Only by taking this approach can we serve the people of the North, Nationalist and Unionist.  It is clear that many in the Unionist community are now reacting primarily in emotional terms.  I am very concerned to see this happening because it is a danger to reconciliation and an obstacle to the benefits of this agreement being appreciated by Unionists.  Those benefits are very substantial and it would be a tragedy if they were not clearly understood.</P>
      <P>The greatest possible benefits that could be brought to the Unionist people are peace and stability.  Those are the objectives, the fundamental objectives, of this agreement and I believe that the two Governments are committed to achieving them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say this quite clearly.  The Irish Government have no designs on the North.  We have no desire to have dominion over the Unionist people.  This agreement does not confer such a power on us, either directly or indirectly.  We recognise the identity of the Unionists: their Britishness, their ethos, their sense of being threatened by Irish unity.  Of course, for our part, we are committed to Irish unity: we are committed to Irish unity by consent and only by consent. Article 1 now makes that unambiguously clear.  Those Unionist leaders who say otherwise are misleading their people and they should in my opinion now pause carefully and make sure that they are not <Col N="3135" /> leading the Unionist people in a dangerous direction on the basis of an honest misunderstanding or on the basis of opportunist misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland is a divided community. Two-fifths of the population in one degree or another wish things otherwise and in one degree or another look to us.  Three-fifths of the population in one degree or another wish things to continue the same if possible and look to Britain.  In their hearts they must know that it is not possible that things should stay the same; they must know that &ldquo;no change&rdquo; would only mean &ldquo;more of the same&rdquo; and that would only make matters worse for everyone.  The only system that has any remote possibility of bringing some degree of general acceptance and stability is one which gives guarantees to both sides, a system with which both sides can identify.  That is precisely what this agreement attempts to do; no more and no less.  What does it take from the substance of the position of Unionists? Nothing.  We say that the Irish identity of Nationalists is now catered for, for the first time.  Is the British identity of Unionists not catered for under present arrangements?  Of course it is.  Northern Ireland is governed by the British Government, not by Dublin.  Both Governments are committed to the fullest possible accommodation of the two identities compatible with the law, without any diminution of either.  Can there be any tenable moral or political objection to that?  Are Nationalists' rights to be completely ignored?  Is total Unionist domination to be the only course acceptable to the Unionist leadership?  I cannot believe that to be the position of decent men and women of the Unionist tradition. I cannot believe that they would wish to refuse the light of day to the Nationalist side.  I am constrained to believe that in many cases Unionists have completely and tragically misunderstood the intentions of the two Governments.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Mr. Molyneaux and I appeal to Mr. Paisley to accept that Dublin has no desire whatever to undermine their rights or their position.  I <Col N="3136" /> appeal to them to read this agreement for what it is: it is not a take-over by Dublin. It is no more and no less than an Irish input into the processes of Government on a basis intended only to ease the divisions in the community in the North, an input designed only to bring peace and stability.</P>
    <P>Are Unionists humiliated or any less British because this agreement creates some measures to accommodate the Irish identity of their neighbours?  The answer from Dublin is a resounding &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and that answer is the truth.</P>
    <P>I fully understand and support the concern of Unionists about security and I believe that it will be possible under the agreement for our implacable commitment to confront and resist violence to be more apparent to Unionists and for co-operation in this area to develop in a strong and healthy way.  We are in this together, Nationalist and Unionist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has referred to &ldquo;a violent and abhorrent from of Nationalism&rdquo;. His description aptly fits those who murder and destroy and who instil a dumb despair in the lives of thousands of Irish people.  These are the enemies not just of the British people, the Unionist people and the people of this State: they are the enemies of the Nationalist people of the North.  It is my passionate hope that, as this agreement works, it will create a deep and irreversible rejection of the gun and the bomb on the part of young Nationalists.  I hope too, that those who have corrupted the minds of young people and led them into acts of violence, diminishing and shaming the name of Irish nationalism, may have left in their hearts some shred of humanity, some residual concern for ordinary people.  Let them now put away the bomb and the gun.  The people do not want another 50 years of horror, shame and despair, whatever Mr. Adams and his lieutenants say.  The people want peace, stability and some measure of prosperity.</P>
    <P>Article 4 of the agreement sets out the objectives of the Conference in detail.</P>
    <P>In relation to matters coming within its field of activity, the Conference <Col N="3137" /> shall be a framework within which the Irish Government and the United Kingdom work together</P>
    <P>(i)  for the accommodation of the rights and identities of the two traditions which exist in Northern Ireland; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  for peace, stability and prosperity throughout the island of Ireland by promoting reconciliation, respect for human rights, co-operation against terrorism and the development of economic, social and cultural co-operation.</P>
    <P>This is what all of the people of this island want above all today and for the future. I believe that nobody has a right to withold it from them.</P>
    <P>I intend to do my best to promote these objectives.  I thank the Taoiseach for placing his confidence in me and for giving me this opportunity to make a contribution to peace and the welfare of the people of the North.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I would like to add a brief word of congratulation to the Taoiseach himself.  After the Chequers Summit he faced a major personal choice.  He could have retreated into an anti-British attitude and many would have supported him.  Or he could have faced the far more unpopular task of pushing ahead with the negotiations.  He took the hard road because he knew that it was necessary.  Having seen the reality at Chequers, that the British Government were willing to work for measures to accommodate the two identities.  I never doubted that he was right.  His decision and commitment to ensure that a package emerged that would help to end the alienation of Nationalists while protecting the rights of Unionists, is the outstanding achievement of an outstanding Irish leader.</P>

      <P>Anglo-Irish relations have often been marked by confusion and contradiction. I would now, however, like to say that the Irish people appreciate the courage, determination and imagination shown on this occasion by Mrs. Thatcher, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Tom King and his predecessor, Douglas Hurd.  I have come to know Tom King and to appreciate his qualities in recent months.  He is a straight-talking, sensible man and I hope that, in the Irish Permanent Ministerial Representative in the Inter-Governmental Conference, he will find another. I am confident that our work together will contribute to peace and stability, to the reassurance of both Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland, to reconciliation and to prosperity and to the greater friendship between the British and Irish peoples.</P>
      <P>Two and a half years ago we, the constitutional Nationalists, embarked on the Forum.  Many said it was a hopeless exercise. The Forum, however, created a positive focus for constitutional Nationalism for the first time and it gave hope for the first time to those Nationalists in the North &mdash; the vast majority of them &mdash; who desperately longed for peace, who rejected violence and who demanded equality of treatment.  When the Forum reported many &mdash; although now fewer &mdash; scoffed.  The Forum had, in fact, come to terms with the difficult realities, hitherto unacknowledged, of Unionism.  While controversy attended the publication of the report, the report exists and it has done its work in the North, in the South, in Britain and around the world.  <i>The Financial Times</i>, in an editorial reviewing the background to the events at Hillsborough, said as many others have said: &ldquo;The Forum was the turning point.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solidarity of the Forum provides the only possible basis for negotiations with the British.  The Forum report provided a basis for understanding with the Unionists which it will now be the priority of this Government to pursue.  The Forum provided hope for the first time for years to the Northern Nationalists. <Col N="3139" /> hope that has been given a firm focus and solid content by this agreement.  I believe that an acknowledgment of this was in part reflected in Deputy Haughey's speech last night.  I hope that the solidarity achieved by the Forum will be to the fore in the minds of Deputies as they vote on this important motion.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, this has been an historic episode in the affairs of the Dáil. Whatever the differences, we have done ourselves and the nation credit.  I would <Col N="3140" /> make one simple appeal to my fellow Deputies.  While we in the South have suffered, we are relatively lucky.  The people of the North, Nationalist and Unionist, have been devastated.  Let us in our vote today put their desperate needs before our own desires or our own interests. It is for that reason above all others that I hope that all Deputies will support the motion before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will examine the discriminatory working of means testing in rural areas in relation to the single woman's allowance for caring for the elderly which is based on the value of the property in which such persons live regardless of whether they have any right to it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation governing the assessment of means under the single woman's allowance scheme provides that the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by her must be taken into account.  Accordingly, the value of board and lodgings to the applicant must be taken into account in assessing her means.  In assessing the value of board and lodgings in the case of an applicant who is living on a farm, it is the income derived from the holding, and not the value of the farm itself, which is taken into account.  The value of the property in which the applicant is living is not relevant in the assessment of means. What is done is such cases, is to estimate the net yearly profit of the farm and to attribute a certain proportion of that profit to the applicant as means by reference to the number of persons in the household.  The requirement to take account of the value of board and lodgings is designed so as to achieve a degree of equity between applicants living in good circumstances and those in poor circumstances.</P>

      <P>The survey in question was carried out in 1984 and is at present being considered by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The statement made by the Deputy does not, however, correctly interpret the results of the survey.  The survey in fact indicated that 81 per cent of the households surveyed would be willing to approach the local community welfare officer for assistance.  Those who were reluctant to seek assistance gave a number of reasons and 19.5 per cent such families that is 3.7 per cent of the total number surveyed, expressed the view that it would be degrading to do so.  While I would be concerned that any person would consider it degrading to have to resort to the supplementary welfare allowances scheme I consider that the attitude evinced would have been far more common some years ago.</P>
      <P>Community welfare officers are under considerable pressure in the administration of the scheme but I know that they are anxious to provide a caring service and that persons in genuine need are treated by them with sympathy and understanding.</P>

      <P>The benefits to which the Deputy refers are intended to provide additional assistance, subject to certain qualifying conditions, to persons aged 66 years and over and to persons under that age who are permanently incapacitated. Persons aged 66 years or over who are receiving a widow's pension from my Department can qualify for these allowances. The grant of these allowances to all widows irrespective of age would have wide ranging cost implications and there are no proposals for such a change at this time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will increase the <Col N="3079" /> farm income allowance for a person claiming unemployment benefit or assistance from the meagre £2 per day at the moment to a realistic figure; the reasons that this figure has not been increased heretofore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking where a person is at work there is no entitlement to unemployment benefit.  An exception to this is where a person is engaged in a subsidiary occupation.  A subsidiary occupation is one which can ordinarily be followed in addition to the usual employment outside the ordinary working hours of that employment.  Under the regulations a person engaged in a subsidiary occupation can be entitled to unemployment benefit provided that the remuneration from that occupation does not exceed £2 a day.  An alternative test is that the person has had not less than 78 contributions paid in respect of the previous three years.</P>
      <P>The £2 a day limit applies to all applicants for unemployment benefit who may find themselves in that situation and is not restricted to farm income.  It does not apply to unemployment assistance.  The £2 limit is not a means test.  Its purpose, and that of the alternative test, is to ensure that the claimant has been engaged in, and is available for, full time employment.  I will, however, have the operation of the limit examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which was enacted last July, provides for the implementation of EC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. Section 24 of the Act states that it will come into operation on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
      <P>It is generally known that the delay in implementing the Act is due to the fact that one of the trade unions which has the highest number of staff membership in the Department has taken the view that the implementation of the Act cannot go ahead until such time as certain staffing issues have been resolved.  Discussions are actively under way on this matter at the present time and it is the intention to begin implementing the Act as soon as the difficulties have been resolved.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the course of the debate on the Bill in the Dáil alleviating measures to prevent or mitigate income losses for certain families which would otherwise arise from implementing the directive will be provided by regulation.  One regulation will enable claimants' spouses who are earning £50 a week or less to continue to be regarded as adult dependants. A second regulation will enable a special transitional payment of £10 a week to families where, on the commencement of the Act, both spouses are independently entitled to social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>Under the different schemes <Col N="3081" /> administered by my Department which are the subject of a means test income from farming is assessed as the yearly value of the advantage accruing from the farm.  Where the normal pattern of farming has been distorted by unusual factors for example crop failure, account would be taken of this as the aim of the means assessment is to calculate the net income generated by the farm.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations an applicant who wishes to have his assessment revised must apply for a reinvestigation of his means.  It is open to any applicant who feels that his means have changed to apply for a review and where it is considered that the normal pattern of farming no longer applies in his case the revised means assessment would reflect this.  When a degree of normality was restored to the farm operation the case would generally be reviewed again so that the means assessment would reflect the normal situation.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the existing scheme of free travel administered by my Department whereby a person other than a spouse may travel free when accompanying the pass holder. It would in my opinion be invidious to extend the free travel facility to the spouses of one type of welfare beneficiary while ignoring the position of other beneficiaries in a similar situation.  Extension of the scheme to provide free travel for persons who are not spouses of pass holders would have considerable administrative and financial implications which require detailed examination.  This is being done at present but it is not yet possible to say what the outcome will be.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 17 June 1983 and all benefit payable has been issued to 23 November 1985 in accordance with medical certificates received.  Payments are issued weekly at £38.05, the rate of benefit appropriate to a single woman who has 47 credited contributions in the 1983-84 year which governs her claim. An application for an increase of benefit in respect of dependents has not been made by the claimant.  She has indicated that she was employed in the 1983-84 year and since there are no paid contributions recorded on her behalf for that year, the matter has been referred to an inspector of my Department for investigation.  The rate of payment of disability benefit from 7 January 1985 will be reviewed on receipt of the inspector's report.  Delays in payment of benefit occurred in June 1985 because of an administrative error. The matter has since been rectified and payment of disability benefit is issuing at regular weekly intervals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is concerned about persons whose entitlements to contributory old age pensions were affected through having breaks in their insurance records because of the operation of the remuneration limit which applied in the case of non-manual workers until the limit was abolished in 1974.  No statistics are available of the numbers affected but it was estimated by an analyst that about 11,500 were in the age group that were likely to be involved and about 1,700 of these would have lost all entitlement to contributory pensions. In the vast majority of cases the breaks would have been caused by the operation of the remuneration limit but there could have been breaks for other reasons also, for example periods of self-employment or employment outside the State.</P>

      <P>The safety of the public and the staff at employment exchanges is a matter which receives constant attention at my Department.  New measures to improve security continue to be introduced and these include the erection of security fittings at existing offices and the building-in of modern security features in newly fitted out employment exchanges.  In addition the use of security cash delivery services are being availed of where feasible and in many employment exchanges there is a Garda presence during pay out times.</P>
      <P>When introducing improvements in security at employment exchanges my Department have availed of the advice of Garda crime prevention units and will continue to do so.  Although I am particularly concerned at the increase in the number of recent armed raids I would like to assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that every effort is being made to ensure the safety of the public and staff alike in the measures being taken.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Question Nos. 31 and 67 together.  The national fuel scheme, which was introduced in 1980, was designed to provide on a uniform basis for all persons throughout the State who are unable to supply their heating needs from their own resources. The urban fuel schemes, which were introduced in 1942 and operated in seventeen cities and towns, did not, however, cease on the establishment of the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>The schemes will continue in their present form for the 1985-86 season and proposals are being considered in the meantime for rationalisation with a view to having only one scheme for the whole country.  The weekly value of the fuel allowance was increased from £4 to £5 with effect from the beginning of the current heating season in accordance with the provisions of this year's Budget. The estimated cost of allowances under both schemes at present is £25.8 million yearly.</P>

Payment of unemployment assistance is made to those who are in genuine need and is directly related to financial circumstances in each individual case.  I am satisfied that the means test as at present operated is a fair and reasonable method of determining entitlement and allocating scarce resources to those in need and changes in the method of assessment are not at present contemplated. However, the general question of means assessment for the various social welfare schemes, including the unemployment assistance scheme, is one of the areas which is being addressed by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The prescribed relative allowance is an increase in pension payable to old age and invalidity pensioners under certain very specific conditions.  To qualify for the allowance the pensioner must be so incapacitated as to require full time care and attention and he must have living with him a prescribed relative who is providing that care and attention. Apart from the prescribed relative, the pensioner must be living alone or only with a child or an incapacitated person. In keeping with the objective of providing a measure of income maintenance where <Col N="3088" /> it is needed in those circumstances the conditions limit payment of the allowance to cases where the relative providing the care effectively has no independent means of support.  The allowance is not payable if the relative is a married person who is maintained by his or her spouse. There are no plans at present to change the conditions of entitlement to prescribed relative allowance.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement was introduced to provide support for families whose income from employment was no higher or only marginally higher than what they would receive in social welfare benefit if the wage-earners were unemployed and a primary objective of the scheme was the maintenance of the incentive to work.  It is an essential feature of the scheme that one parent be in full time employment, which is defined as employment of not less than 30 hours per week.  It is not, therefore, proposed to alter this condition.  A person employed for less than 30 hours a week is not regarded as in full time employment and may therefore be eligible for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

The position now is that the means of smallholder applicants for unemployment assistance must, in accordance with the Social Welfare Acts, be determined on a factual basis in the same manner as other applicants for unemployment assistance.  Applicants who are dissatisfied with their assessments may, of course, appeal.  Special arrangements were made in June last for reinvestigation of the entitlements of smallholders on factual assessment who apply for a review and for the hearing of any appeals arising under the revised arrangements.</P>

Employers will be exempt from paying their portion of the PRSI contribution for such employees for each week in the income tax year 1986-1987 in which the increase in the employer's workforce is maintained.  The employee's portion of the PRSI contribution for 1986-87 will continue to be payable in the normal way.</P>

      <P>When VAT at point of entry was introduced generally in 1982 it was decided for Exchequer reasons that it should apply, in so far as warehousing was concerned, to goods on their entry into warehouse. Relief from the imposition of VAT at point of entry in respect of the temporary importation of goods in commercial quantities for subsequent re-export is confined to categories such as goods in transit or for transhipment.  In these cases the period during which the goods in question may remain in the State is strictly limited.  The storage of imported goods in bonded warehouses for re-export does not qualify for relief under these provisions.</P>

Any repayment which may be due will be made to the taxpayer on completion of the review.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a Council Directive on the freedom of establishment and the free supply of services in the field of mortgage credit, (COM (84) 730 Final) was transmitted to the Council by the Commission on 1 February 1985.  I understand that it has been referred to the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee in accordance with normal procedure.  It will be considered in Council when the views of those bodies are received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal would liberalise the market in mortgage credit by enabling mortgage credit institutions of individual member states to operate throughout the Community under a system of mutual recognition of the relevant nationally authorised financial techniques (rather than through the harmonisation of the relevant legal provision).  Responsibility for supervision of foreign branches would rest primarily with the home country authorities, in consultation with those of the host country.  If implemented, the directive would allow mortgage credit institutions from other member states to provide here those services which they are permitted to offer in their home country. It would also enable Irish building <Col N="3096" /> societies to extend their activities to other member states.</P>
    <P>The system of mutual recognition proposed by the Commission in this instance will require careful consideration by the Council in the light of the views of the Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.  I am not in a position to say what our attitude will be in Council but we will have full regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, the interests of savers and house purchasers and the longer term development of the mortgage credit sector.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment benefit payable is reduced after 156 days of benefit, where an applicant does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in a seven year period.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 12 June 1985 and this claim forms one period of interruption of employment with a previous claim from 20 February 1982 to 5 May 1982, as he had been in continuous receipt of disability benefit for the period between the two claims.  The person concerned did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in the seven year period.  Accordingly, the rate of unemployment benefit payable to him was reduced from £85 weekly, which is the maximum rate applicable to a claimant with an adult dependant and two dependent children, to £73.85 weekly from 30 September 1985, the 157th day of his claim to unemployment benefit.  Further weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>
      <P>He is not entitled to pay-related benefit as entitlement to that benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings of the claimant, since the beginning of the income tax year in which the claim is made.  The present claim is linked with the claim to unemployment benefit made in 1982 and the 85 per cent limit, calculated at £59.79 in 1982, still applies.  The flat rate unemployment benefit payable to the person concerned exceeds the 85 per cent limit applicable in his case and accordingly pay-related benefit is not payable.</P>

      <P>Existing regulations provide for the payment of voluntary contributions by an insured person who ceases to be covered by compulsory insurance provided he is under 66 years of age and had at least 156 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions were paid while he was compulsorily insured.  Application must be made before the end of the contribution year following that in which compulsory insurance ceased.  A voluntary contributor who had been compulsorily insured for benefits which included old age contributory pension pays a contribution which provides cover for that pension.</P>
      <P>To qualify for old age contributory pension a claimant must have had at least 156 reckonable contributions paid and must have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions paid or credited per contribution year from 1953 or from the commencement of the contribution year in which he entered insurance, if later than 1953, up to the end of the last complete contribution year before age 66.  In relation to the details quoted by the Deputy, it is possible that a person who ceased paying contributions at about the age of 55 could still satisfy the contribution conditions for an old age contributory pension.

Following protracted inquiries it has recently been established that his employment during this period was insurable at a class which provided cover against unemployment. Arrangements have been made for the payment next week of unemployment benefit arrears due from 3 June 1985 less the amount of unemployment assistance paid to him pending the outcome of his claim to benefit.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It would not be appropriate for me to comment on what at this stage is an opinion of one committee of the European Parliament on a report being prepared by another committee of that Parliament.  If and when the matter forms the basis of a Community proposal it will be considered in accordance with normal procedures.  I would point out that acts of sexual violence against women are, of course, prosecuted under the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that it is the practice, as far as possible, to assign ban-ghardaí to the investigation of serious crimes against women and that ban-ghardaí are available in all Garda divisions to deal with such offences.  An extra 38 ban-ghardaí have been recruited in the current year and it is proposed to appoint more ban-ghardaí early in 1986.  The authorities have also informed me that the particular needs of women who are victims of sexual offences <Col N="3108" /> are being given special emphasis in training courses and that the Garda maintain close contact with welfare groups and women's organisations.</P>
