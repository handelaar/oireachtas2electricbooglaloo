      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the total evasiveness, perhaps deliberate, of the Taoiseach's reply I want to ask him if, in view of the fact that the present Law Reform Commission have not, effectively, been operating since 1 October, the Taoiseach <Col N="1568" /> and the Government have any intention of reappointing the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to listen to me.  The Chair has no control over the answering of questions as to how they are answered, but the Chair has made a firm rule which has been accepted by the House that once a statement is made by way of a tabular statement no supplementary questions are allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in relation to a matter of such importance to this House as the Law Reform Commission and the very valuable work which has been undertaken by that commission, the least the Taoiseach could do is give the House an undertaking that it is his intention to reappoint them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  The Deputy will have to raise this matter in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, did you say &ldquo;tabular statement&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You said &ldquo;tabular statement&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 cannot be answered by tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has no control over the answering of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making a ruling that the Taoiseach has given a tabular statement and therefore there can be no supplementary questions.  Let me put it to you, Sir, that the Taoiseach has not given a tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a ruling, Deputy Haughey, and I ask you to accept it, that once the Minister <Col N="1569" /> answering a question says that he is making the answer by way of a written statement which will be circulated, there is nothing the Chair can do about it.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest that you said that the Taoiseach has a tabular statement, therefore you could not allow supplementaries.  I want to submit to you that tabular statements are used by Ministers when a number of figures are involved.  This is a question about working papers and reports.  I submit to you that it is perfectly in order for us to ask what the position is about the Law Reform Commission.  There are now no members of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the principle of it now and if Deputy Haughey would listen to the Chair&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am answering a point of order that has been raised. Standing Order No. 35 (2) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Where a Question put down for oral answer is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply or a reply in the form of a tabular statement, the Ceann Comhairle shall, at the request of the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed, direct that the answer be furnished in the Official Report of the Debates. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That has absolutely nothing to do with this series of questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the name of Deputy Taylor.  I will give way to Deputy Taylor in a moment.  This is a totally new interpretation of a tabular statement. There is now no member of the Law Reform Commission.  All the members have gone out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy <Col N="1570" /> Haughey is now going into the merits of question&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ruling now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am challenging your ruling because this is going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will challenge it in an orderly way.  There is a method laid down in Standing Orders for challenging it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Chair rules on this matter I should like to raise a question in regard to it.  As the person who put down the question I should like to point out that if the Standing Order so provides how is it that on 6 November 1984 the Taoiseach gave an appropriate full and lengthy reply to virtually an identical question.  If that was the Standing Order then it is the Standing Order now. By giving that reply surely a precedent has been established under which a reply giving the information sought is given in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that the Taoiseach is ashamed of the position that has developed over the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Taylor, and other Members, listen to the Standing Order in question.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where a Question put down for oral answer is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am satisfied in this case that the reply is lengthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a lengthy reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that the Chair knows it is a lengthy reply?  He does not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should keep cool.  As a matter of courtesy the Chair is supplied with copies of all replies and I have the reply in question before me.  That is how I am aware that it is a lengthy reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very short reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is contained in a statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  That is precisely the answer I gave to a similar type of question on 6 November 1984 as reported at column 1091 of the Official Report in reply to Deputy Taylor.</P>

      <P>I am not terribly concerned whether you are sorry or not.  I am going to insist on my rights here.  I <Col N="1572" /> submit, on a point of order, that the Taoiseach has given a dismissive reply to three questions and you are availing of that to stop us asking supplementary questions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, before you decided to adjourn the House, you gave your interpretation of Standing Order 35 (2). With all respect, I again question your interpretation of that Standing Order which says:</P>
      <P>Where a Question put down for oral answer is of such a nature as to require a lengthy reply or a reply in the form of a tabular statement, the Ceann Comhairle shall, at the request of the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed, direct that the answer be furnished in the Official Report of the Debates. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that that Standing Order in the first instance relates to a question.  In this instance we are dealing with three questions which have been tabled by Deputy Taylor.  There is nothing in that Standing Order which would prevent the asking of supplementary questions and I have read the entire section.  There is nothing in it which would prevent any Member of this <Col N="1577" /> House, including Deputy Taylor who tabled the question, from asking supplementary questions in relation to it. Therefore I submit with respect, and having no desire for conflict with the Chair, that your interpretation of that Standing Order was not correct and that we should have been allowed to ask supplementary questions in relation to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I ask the House to co-operate with the Chair and to accept his rulings, or to act under his rulings.  If they are dissatisfied with those rulings to such an extent that the Members want to question them, they may do so by putting down a formal resolution and bringing it before the House. In regard to my rulings, before I was very reluctantly compelled to adjourn the House.  I was relying on Standing Order 35 (2) which Deputy Hyland has just read.  I was also relying on Standing Order 37 which confers upon me absolute discretion as to supplementary questions and I was relying on rulings made by my predecessors over the years, the relevant one of which reads:</P>
      <P>When reply is to be printed in the Official Report and not given orally, Member should await reply rather than pursue the matter by supplementary question. </P>
      <P>I am not saying for one moment that that ruling has not been breached, but since I took this Chair I was of the opinion that if a question is answered by way of a written statement, it is inappropriate for the Member who put down the question, or any Member, to put supplementary questions which are meant to elicit further information, when the Member had not the reply before him or her.  That would seem to correspond with the ruling of my predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed as I was requested to do in a general way to bring order back into the House, I took a stand that there should not be supplementary questions when the question had been answered by <Col N="1578" /> way of written statement.  It took me a good while to get that ruling accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that it had been fully accepted since we came back to this session, after a long and somewhat heated discussion about it.  It is my ruling now, but I am not infallible. I request the House to obey it and if they want to challenge it, they can challenge it in an orderly way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, I am at a loss to understand your statement that a ruling about supplementary questions in regard to a statement was accepted.  May I suggest to you that the tradition, precedent, or whatever you like to call it, is that where a Minister gives a reply by way of a tabular statement containing statistical information, supplementary questions are not normally asked in regard to that statement, though I know and you know that that has frequently been breached also, and that Members have been given by way of supplementary answer the total of a column or something of that nature.</P>
      <P>My understanding &mdash; and I suggest that your understanding and memory should be the same &mdash; is that it is only on the question of tabular statements containing statistical information that there has been general agreement that supplementary questions are not asked.  I also submit to you, Sir, that if this ruling that you are now laying down for us becomes a precedent and accepted and binding then we might as well forget about the whole matter of supplementary questions.  All a Minister has to do is prepare an answer of indeterminate length and no supplementary questions can be asked.  I cannot accept that this is what you have in mind.  I cannot accept that you would be prepared to let that sort of situation develop, but that would be the ultimate outcome of the ruling you are now purporting to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my interpretation of Standing Order 35.  I am <Col N="1579" /> satisfied that it was not the interpretation put on it by my predecessor when he made this ruling.  When a reply is to be printed in the Official Report and not given orally, Members should await reply rather than pursue the matter by supplementary questions.  I cannot allow this matter to be discussed any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a final point of order, it has been suggested that if we want to challenge this there is a procedure open to us.  I am suggesting that we have no alternative but to challenge it.  I want to ask you how we may go about having this ruling changed through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges without in any way reflecting on your competence or confidence.  We do not wish to have a vote of no confidence in the Chair but this matter is of such importance to us, affecting as it does our right to ask supplementary questions, that we must raise it in some fashion.  I want your guidance as to how it can be brought before the Committee on Procedures and Privileges without going to the lengths, which none of us at this stage wants, of expressing any decision of confidence or no confidence in your good self.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three parts to that question.  Firstly, my ruling cannot be questioned.  My ruling is final and absolute.  If it is sought to pass a vote of no confidence in the Chair &mdash; that has been done already here today, if what has been said about the Chair is correct one could not have confidence in him.  If a vote of no confidence is sought, a formal resolution must be put before the House. If it is sought to change Standing Orders &mdash; apparently that is what the Deputy has in mind &mdash; the practice is that a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, usually the Whip of the party concerned, brings the matter before the committee where it is considered carefully and if an advice is given that Standing Orders should be changed, then a resolution must be put down before the House to change Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I intervene in order to be helpful.  I can understand the fear of abuse that the Leader of the Opposition has expressed. The point at issue here is that when a question is asked or questions are asked on a series of matters which involve lists or tabular statements, then the formal reply I have given can be seen as appropriate. Of course, if that were abused and a question were asked which did not take that form, that would be undesirable.  If the Leader of the Opposition has any fear of that, I suggest that he could pursue it in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the question of the form of the Standing Order.</P>

      <P>Tenders for the disposal of the assets of VCD in various lots, with a closing date of 24 September 1985, were invited by the receiver.

In the light of these discussions it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the matter at this stage, except to express the hope that the parties involved will be able to resolve any <Col N="1582" /> problems that may exist in order to facilitate an early resumption of activity and employment.</P>

      <P>There is a certain belief around Cobh that one of the groups who have tendered is being stymied.  They wonder if it is because the Minister does not want this group to get hold of the dockyard.  The group is made up of local men who are putting their own money into it and who would be of great benefit to the region.  It is important that the Minister should look into this as it should not be left completely in the hands of the receiver.  This has been going on for too long now, and in an area which has been decimated by unemployment it is necessary for the yard to be reopened at the earliest opportunity.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the further proposals, if any, the Government has for reform of Dáil procedures; if he has any plans to make it easier for Private Members' Bills to be tabled and debated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Items of Dáil reform, having been considered by Government, are processed in the normal course through the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Following approval by this committee, the proposals are brought before the Dáil in the form of a motion to amend Standing Orders where this is required.  Where an item is under consideration by this committee, it would be inappropriate for me to give exact details of the proposals to the House in advance of a decision by CPP and subsequent notification to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the first part of the Deputy's question is concerned, I can tell the Deputy that the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges have agreed in principle with proposals which will make it easier for individual Deputies to have Bills printed and discussed.  Given the number of Deputies in the House and the limited amount of time available, there will have to be built-in restrictions in the proposal.  Nevertheless, there should be <Col N="1584" /> an improvement in the present situation in so far as individual Deputies are concerned. It is expected that the necessary motion amending Standing Orders to implement the proposal will be circulated in the near future and, of course, discussed in the House.</P>
    <P>In so far as other items of Dáil reform are concerned, proposals are before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in relation to a new format for debates on departmental Estimates, explanatory and financial memoranda on Bills and a method of simplifying the Order Paper. Proposals that certain committees be automatically appointed after a new Dáil has been convened by writing their Orders of Reference into Standing Orders are also awaiting final clearance by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and will be brought before the House in the New Year.  In addition, proposals to establish the Joint Committee on Socio-Economic Affairs as mentioned in <i>Building on Reality</i>, will shortly go before Government.</P>
    <P>A motion is on the Dáil Order Paper at present, which will have the effect of expanding the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies to give the committee power to examine the common issues of commercial State-sponsored bodies relating to board responsibility, structure and organisation, accountability and financing together with the relationship with central Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This motion which is due to be discussed here this evening, will allow this committee to take an overall look at the commercial State-sponsored sector rather than at individual bodies, as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Proposals to improve the level to which reports laid before the Dáil are subjected to debate in the House are being considered by Government at the moment.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in each of the proposals, I have attempted to incorporate new rules of debate where such an improvement would be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In relation to the introduction of new technology in Leinster House, a consultancy assignment is being undertaken for <Col N="1585" /> the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This consultancy is aimed at examining the implementation realities in terms of costs, procedures etc. for the first phase of the introduction of new technology in identified key areas in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is expected that the recommendations of the consultant will be available early in the new year.</P>

      <P>That is not a great reform and I am surprised at the tardiness of the Minister in coming forward with reforms for Dáil procedure.  I am sure that the Ceann Comhairle will agree that this is an appropriate time to discuss the question especially as we have wasted 50 minutes arguing about whether a ruling was in order in regard to a very simple Standing Order.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the action he proposes to take to help the tourist industry reach its full potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's policy for the development of the tourist industry is set out in the White Paper on Tourism Policy which was published at the end of September.  The White Paper details the measures proposed by the Government to develop and expand tourism and includes new initiatives in relation to marketing and promotion, access transport and environmental matters. Among these measures is the developmental role to be exercised by the National Development Corporation which will be empowered to make investments in suitable tourism projects.</P>
      <P>More recently the Government have introduced a new grant scheme to stimulate capital investment in export tourism hotels and guesthouses in order to improve overall standards and to assist the provision of all-weather facilities. This scheme is designed to encourage additional marketing in overseas markets and complements the promotional and marketing strategies outlined in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be out of order for me to ask if the Minister of State believes that his tourism policy <Col N="1588" /> announced in September 1985 is a realistic answer to our tourism industry? I suggest it is not.  The Minister made reference to a scheme of providing some capital resources for the provision of sporting facilities for certain types of hotels and guesthouses.  Is he aware of the way the application forms being sent to would-be applicants are framed?  I put it to him that the scope of the scheme as suggested in the application form sent out by Bord Fáilte is that the scheme is available only to hotels and guesthouses in primary tourist areas and to hotels or guesthouses that have realistic plans to engage in marketing and promotional activities for the export market.  I ask the Minister in all sincerity if he thinks a small hotel in the west of Ireland is capable of putting together a marketing strategy for export development over a three-year period to enable it to qualify for this 20 per cent capital cost?  Is he aware of the kind of forms being sent out to implement that package he announced in September? Further, is he aware it is suggested in the Bord Fáilte application forms that the individuals applying for such assistance must have tax clearance certificates to be submitted with their applications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister of State three questions.  Has he seen the application forms being sent out by Bord Fáilte to people who wish to apply for this aid?  Is he aware a tax clearance certificate is necessary before applying? Finally, does he think that confining this scheme to primary tourist areas is a suitable way to act in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the <Col N="1589" /> nature of the application forms for registered guesthouses and hotels, this scheme is generally applicable where the concern engages in promotional and marketing work.  Bord Fáilte and the Department are conscious of the position of the smaller registered hotels and they have offered a grouping and brand selling and brand marketing to ensure that these hotels and guesthouses can come within the scope of this new initiative.  It is necessary that hoteliers seeking grant aid and taxpayers' money should have their tax affairs in order.  If they ensure that their approach to the tax people with regard to payment of VAT and tax is realistic and correct they will get help.  I do not believe taxpayers' money should be used in the disbursement of grants to hoteliers who in some cases have refused to co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners in making adequate and proper returns in regard to their takings.</P>
      <P>The condition regarding the submission of tax clearance certificates is necessary in the national interest and it will be in the best interests of hoteliers and guesthouse owners.  With regard to the provision of amenities, substantial grant aid will be provided during 1986, including the provision of all-weather amenities.  If we wish to realise the full potential of the industry we will have to provide all the necessary amenities.  It is with that purpose in mind, as well as for the purpose of job generation, that the grant initiative has been introduced.  In this way hotels and guesthouses are being helped in their efforts to improve their amenities and standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister is not aware that more than half the hotels in Ireland lost money last year.  I suggest to him that providing 20 per cent of the capital cost of a swimming pool in a small hotel in the west is a load of nonsense when hotels like this are not even in a break-even situation.  The Minister of State either should scrap this measure or else build it up into something more useful.  Chapters 4 and 8 of his tourism policy document deal with tourism performance and targets for growth.  I refer <Col N="1590" /> the Minister to page 16 of that document and I ask him if he regards the table in that chapter as being suitable for what should be the third largest export earning industry?  I will quote one of the statistics. The document stated that the British market returned £192 million in 1980 and that was reduced in 1984 to £154 million. What does the Minister propose doing in respect of this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has directed his attention specifically at the British market.  That market is of major importance for us and it has been the foundation of our tourist industry.  Since coming into office this Government have taken steps in relation to a reduction in inflation rates and the development of a competitive market so far as tourists are concerned.  These factors have been of the utmost importance in the expansion and growth of the British market which had been adversely affected because of our price structures and inflation.</P>
      <P>Another factor of major importance is the situation in the North of Ireland. Since 1969 we have had problems due to bombings and attacks on British buses and cars in this part of the country.  We hope that the new summit talks in which the two Governments are engaged will have a beneficial effect so far as tourism is concerned and that tourists will be assured of a welcoming holiday here.  I look forward to a growth in the British market.  We require it, we want it and we are taking the necessary steps so far as inflation and price competitiveness are concerned.  I hope that the improved access by sea and air and the improved standards and amenities here will make that growth a real possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a load of nonsense. According to the Minister's statistics, in 1969 the figure in constant terms was £221 million from the British market.  In 1973 it was £161 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 it was £192 million <Col N="1591" /> and now it is £154 million.  The truth is we are losing market share in the British market but the Minister is doing nothing about it.  I should like to ask him what are his projections for market growth in the tourist industry in the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make any accurate projection in regard to the tourist market over a number of years.  We had a record growth in 1985, the greatest ever, and the highest overseas earnings.  In spite of what Deputy Flynn said about a drop in the British market, we had the highest revenue from Britain in a number of years despite a drop in the numbers.  Our predìction is that we will succeed in having growth from all markets provided we do a number of things.  First, we must market and promote everywhere.  This means joint marketing and promoting by Bord Fáilte and the different sectors engaged in the industry.  Two, we must have adequate access by air and sea to Ireland and we must arrange to have prices as competitive as possible.  Three, we must give value for money to the tourists, and good standards.  In 1986 two of the most prestigious airlines in America, Pan-Am and Delta, will bring daily flights to Shannon from various parts of the US.  It is a major vote of confidence in the growth of the Irish tourist industry when we see two major airlines from the biggest market in the world developing new lines on a daily basis next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister is not aware of the growth targets outlined in chapter 8 of his own forecast.  The forecast is a 3 per cent to 6 per cent growth to the end of the century.  The document sets down minimum targets for the tourist industry.  It is stated that there will be no further capital investment by the Government in the industry and that the private sector must take up any worthwhile investment in the industry. That means the Minister is reneging&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under the Transport Acts, matters such as employment and conditions of employment are the responsibility of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  As I explained to the House in the course of the Adjournment debate on 4 December, 1985, it is not my policy to intervene in functions of CIE which are by statute day-to-day matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of Government policy outlined in the White Paper, to the effect that the Government would take control over the pay and statutory conditions and terms of employment of the staffs of semi-State bodies, and in view of the indications of people who attended yesterday's Labour Court hearing that the hands of CIE management were tied, obviously by officials of the Department of Communications and by the Minister, I am annoyed by the reply of the Minister. The reason for the difficulties is that the Department of Communications are pulling the strings and clearly are not allowing the management of CIE to take action that could avoid a serious situation. Surely the Minister for Communications has an obligation to provide transport for the people of Dublin, particularly at this time of the year when traders have millions of pounds worth of stock in their city centre premises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret to see Deputy Ahern, every time there is a dispute, instituting himself as a substitute Labour Court.  There is ample machinery laid down and I have no intention of intervening in any way.  I will draw the attention of the House to my policy since I became <Col N="1595" /> Minister, three years ago this week, as a result of which industrial relations in CIE have been improved greatly.  So far, 1985 has been the first year since 1972 when there has not been one man day lost in CIE due to industrial action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the present round of talks clearly has failed and seeing that the dispute is at a time when greatest hardship will be caused to ordinary people in the city, can the Minister not see his way to intervene?  Can the Minister indicate whether reports in the newspapers last week are true that provision for an emergency service has been made? Will this go into operation if the dispute continues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has commended CIE for the absence of strikes in the past year, but is he aware that the problem on this occasion has arisen as a result of the management's highhanded action in their attempts to introduce a feeder bus service for the DART system?  Is the Minister aware also that the first people to be left without a bus service are the Tallaght-Clondalkin-Ballyfermot commuters who use the 76 bus and also those who use the 17A service to Finglas and Ballymun, neither of which services is associated in any way with the DART system?  These people have been without a bus service since Sunday last.  What steps does the Minister intend taking to ensure that they will have a bus service through the Christmas period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware also of the distress being caused to the travelling public especially in the Ballyfermot and Clondalkin areas but I must act in the overall and long term interest of the public.  My policies to date have achieved <Col N="1596" /> the required results, not only in terms of the reduction in man days lost because of industrial disputes within the company, but also in terms of financial returns from CIE in the past three years after 15 years of escalating losses.  I should be most surprised if Deputy Mac Giolla, of all people, did not support the Labour Court in their recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of not supporting the Labour Court.  The position is that one in ten of the city buses is out of action.  Before the dispute escalates further, would the Minister consider dealing directly with the representatives of the bus workers so as to explain his policy to them?  This should be done as a matter of urgency so as to avoid the kind of confrontation that is likely to occur within the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy before, I have no intention of intervening in this dispute.  I consider that to be the right policy.  For too long down through the years Ministers interferred in the day to day affairs of semi-State companies with disastrous results.  Deputies on all sides should recognise the turn around that has been effected throughout the State sector in the past three years. As I said in a speech the other day, this is one of the great unheralded achievements of this Government.  A policy which clearly is working should be continued and I intend to continue it.</P>

      <P>I have a responsibility to ensure that there is the maximum peace possible and also that the best service possible is available.  All the evidence of the years is that constant intervention <Col N="1597" /> by Ministers is inappropriate and instead of bettering a situation only worsens it.  I trust that this dispute can be settle very quickly and settled on a basis that will be satisfactory to the taxpayer, to the travelling public and to those who work in CIE as well as those who run the company.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes great play of not intervening in semi-State companies but that is nonsense since Ministers intervene regularly in this area.  Is it not the responsibility of the Minister to provide transport for working class people, people who do not have cars?  How are they expected, for instance, to visit their parents or any family members who may be in hospital during the Christmas period?  Does the Minister not recognise that this dispute is not a question of money but a question of security and working conditions?  He should endeavour to bring the management of CIE to an understanding of these factors so that the matter may be resolved quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that I should seek to subvert Labour Court recommendations?  What would the position be if the opposite were the case, if management were not accepting a Labour Court recommendation?  Would the Deputy be urging me then to force the unions to accept the management line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister appreciates that the people who will be affected most directly by this dispute are working class people who depend on public transport to go into the <Col N="1598" /> city, whether to work or for any of the reasons associated with Christmas. Would the Minister consider facilitating an immediate resumption of talks between the two sides so as to bring them to the table quickly with a view to arriving at a decision and then in the event of a solution not being found, to make provision for the introduction of the Government emergency services?  I am not suggesting that the Minister should interfere in regard to any of the recommendations, but he might act through his own office as I suggest.  The Minister for Labour to whom my question is addressed also might be able to facilitate in bringing the two sides together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputies in this matter but I must warn against being pressured into interference which can have bad effects both in the long term and in the short term.  There has been a significant improvement in the past 18 months in terms of industrial relations as they affect Dublin city transport services.  I suggest that this has been due to our policy of not intervening and not second guessing the procedures provided for the resolution of those disputes.  I repeat that it is because of my concern for the long term welfare of those who must use public transport that I will not intervene in this dispute.</P>

The men are now out fishing and will arrive back with loads of mackerel which will be treated, so far as the Minister is concerned, as having been caught illegally.

This is happening particularly to Priority Questions.  Transfers are being made when it is too late for us to submit alternative Priority Questions.  This is happening almost every sitting day and is causing a lot of problems for us on this side of the House.  I would ask the Ceann Comhairle to do something about this, and perhaps the Taoiseach might comment, as it is obviously disrupting and destroying the whole process of the new Question Time and taking away its real meaning.

Obviously there is a problem.  Deputies on the Opposition side do not always choose the right Minister to whom to put questions and there is a need to transfer them from time to time.  In Opposition we often had the problem as well.  There is a timing constraint problem here which should be discussed between the Whips. I had hoped that this would have been taken up by the Fianna Fáil Whip with our Whip who is happy to discuss it.</P>

    <Title>Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The effectiveness of this Bill will depend on how it is enforced. Over the last 20 years or so the Companies Registration Office have been unable to deal with the annual returns that have been sent in.  The annual returns not being sent in are far greater than those that are being sent in.  The reason for this is that there is a grave staff shortage in the Companies Registration Office.  For this Bill to be implemented effectively that shortage will have to be remedied.  The Companies Registration Office is being computerised at the moment and this will help in keeping <Col N="1703" /> records up to date and in enabling people to find relevant information quickly. However, computers do not work by themselves and the required staff must be employed in the office.</P>
      <P>The Bill lists new formats for the presentation of accounts.  So that the Bill will get off on the right footing the operative date should not be as soon as June 1986 but it should be in January 1987.  This will allow accountancy firms and accountants to re-educate their staff, to change software where necessary and will generally allow for effective compliance with the Bill.  If the operative date for the Bill is too soon the conditions will not be established to allow smaller firms to comply with the Bill.  It is important to give a year so that the accountants and their staffs can be educated and so that they can get the message across to their clients so that they will submit their books and records in time for them to be dealt with effectively.</P>
      <P>This will have far-reaching effects for medium and small firms and will not greatly benefit the economy.  This Bill has been introduced so as to comply with Directive No. 4; we are being forced to introduce this legislation.  This shows that not only do the people involved not consider it necessary but that the Government do not consider it necessary for the majority of companies that operate here.</P>
      <P>I will have some detailed questions on Committee Stage and I will pursue them at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's opening remarks where he said that he was very anxious to upgrade our domestic Companies Acts.  This is very essential. The Minister has been dedicated in trying to correct many of the anomalies and difficulties that exist in this area at the moment.  It is interesting to note that the fourth report of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, report No. 19 of 3 September 1985, at chapter 4, spells out that the joint committee have been informed that this country has not at present any general domestic legislative framework establishing employees' rights <Col N="1704" /> to information and consultation on decisions affecting them.  That is an indictment in that perhaps there are areas of our company law which do not protect employees or people dealing with companies. However, that report does highlight the fact that some legislation has moved towards improving the situation for employees.  I refer to the EC Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, 1980 and the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, both of which implemented the terms of two previous EC directives.</P>
      <P>It has been necessary to introduce this Bill because we are a member of the EC. At times we may like to ignore or reject certain rules attached to that membership but we did enter the Community with our eyes open, a large percentage of our people agreeing to do so.  Therefore we must take our membership seriously and recognise that there will be times when some directives or instructions to member countries will not always be welcomed by us with open arms.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, in the whole area of company law, we are only too well aware of the unsatisfactory position obtaining here in which a company can be operating one day, close its doors the next, leaving many debts, unprotected creditors, and people who may have paid deposits absolutely without redress.  The most devastating aspect is that, in many cases, the very next day, not three days later &mdash; as Deputy Prendergast said on the last occasion on which we debated this Bill &mdash; the same people will have opened their doors under a different name, trading, with the big car still outside and the fine house still available to them.  Yet the unfortunate customer who may have spent his life savings on a deposit is left without any redress whatsoever. I hope the Minister will deal with that most unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill has been occasioned by the fourth directive, issued in July 1978 and which should have been passed into law in member states by the first half of 1982.  It is no reflection on us that we are introducing this Bill only now. It would be unfair not to recognise that <Col N="1705" /> part of the delay in doing so was the fact that we had three general elections in very quick succession, with changes of Ministers and the difficulties that entailed in getting back into the nitty gritty, complex work involved in the drafting of this Bill and implementing the terms of this fourth directive.</P>
    <P>However, I suppose there is validity in the criticism of some unions that it has taken so long to introduce this Bill.  I accept the Minister's statement in his opening remarks that the servicing of meetings on EC directives and the implementation of directives demand considerable resources.  He also said that the complexity of the company law area renders it important that we examine whatever changes we make thoroughly. It should be remembered that EC directives can be implemented in a number of ways.  It is the task of the Minister to implement legislation with the least damaging effect on our companies while still fulfilling the underlying principle of the directive.</P>
    <P>I hope the introduction of this Bill will rid us of the obligation to face European Court proceedings which I gather are listed for end January 1986.  I trust the fact that we have shown ourselves willing to introduce this legislation will prevent us being subjected to the indignity of being taken before the European Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an extremely complex one. I could not help realising that more fully while listening to Deputy Prendergast on Thursday week when he condemned its provisions for being too lenient and not covering banks.  I think the Minister did interject at that point to say that that was not a fair comment.  Perhaps that comment showed that Deputy Prendergast had been bogged down by the complexity of the Bill.  I hope that was the reason rather than his seeking a cheap headline, perhaps something to the effect: Deputy condemns Bill because banks get off scot free &mdash; the sort of headline we are used to seeing &mdash; when people are not perhaps fully informed about the complexities of the matter under consideration.  It is my understanding that the banks will still be covered by <Col N="1706" /> the 1963 Act and by certain sections of this Bill.  I have no doubt the Minister will clarify that matter in his closing remarks lest there be any misunderstanding amongst the public that we are letting the banks off scot free from disclosing their true financial position.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended for his efforts and those of his Department to implement the terms of the directive in such a way as to ameliorate as far as possible their effect on small and medium sized companies.  The vast majority of companies operating here would fall into the category of &ldquo;small&rdquo;.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister has used this Bill as a vehicle to introduce two new classifications of companies, small and medium, without diminishing the overriding principle of the directive, which is that a true and fair view of a company's operations be given.  He has managed to introduce a Bill whose provisions will be least damaging to small and medium sized companies.</P>
    <P>I hope that companies which will be affected by these provisions will have commenced already to get their houses in order.  The implementation of these provisions will involve the hiring of additional staff, or the training of existing staff, whose job it will be to assess how they will affect the running of their company. There will also be involved the revision of accountancy practices and, in more recent times, the changing of accounting soft ware.  It may also be the opinion of management that there should be some corporate restructuring so that their companies may benefit from the various reliefs available.</P>
    <P>All of this work should have been commenced already because companies cannot claim that they were unaware that this legislation was pending, though I suspect many will have hoped that the will to introduce this Bill was diminishing.  As I have said, we cannot ignore those parts of EC law or directives we do not like. Therefore, there was an inevitability about the introduction of this Bill and I know that many companies are already preparing for the implementation of its provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> The provisions of the Bill create two new categories, small and medium sized private companies.  The Bill spells out clearly how you qualify to be one of this type of company.  The categories are defined in the terms of their balance sheets totals, their annual turnover and their average number of employees in a year, and, provided they qualify in two out of three of those rules, they can call themselves a small or medium company depending on their annual turnover and balance sheet total.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of this legislation companies will have assessed into which category they fall.  The small companies will be obliged only to publish a balance sheet with certain notes attached.  This should not be a hardship to small companies because already they are obliged to prepare and distribute to their shareholders as a minimum the abridged balance sheet with notes relating to items about them and directors' and auditors' reports.  The small companies must publish, subject to the EC parent guarantee concession, an abridged balance sheet which must give a true and fair view with a few notes, a statement by directors that they have relied on and are entitled to exemptions, a report from the auditors confirming that the company is entitled to the relief availed of and that the accounts are properly prepared, and auditors' report on accounts presented to shareholders.  Already shareholders get a great deal of information from their companies, so the extra burden that this legislation is bringing in is not too great and should not cause any companies to close their doors.</P>
    <P>The reliefs to the medium companies are not as generous as to the small companies, but the Bill limits the kind of information that the medium companies have to disclose.  I heard one Deputy who contributed on this debate talk about disappointment that EC subsidiaries did not have to publish the accounts of the companies here in Ireland.  That Deputy failed to go on to say that very strict regulations are attached to that exemption of EC subsidiaries and where they <Col N="1708" /> wish to publish the accounts of their parent company the Minister will decide to grant this concession only after he is satisfied that the following conditions are or will be fulfilled: that all shareholders consent to the concession for the financial year, that the parent declares to every shareholder that it guarantees the debts, that the subsidiary's accounts are consolidated in the parent's group accounts and the subsidiary's concession is noted therein, that the subsidiary's annual return notes the concession for that year and that the group accounts of the parent are drawn up in conformity with the Fourth Directive.  Therefore, it is not just a blanket clearance for EC subsidiaries in this country, that they can hide behind the parent company.</P>
    <P>The rules as to kind of account the parent company must distribute and disclose are very strict.  Therefore, the fears expressed by some that this was a back door for hiding here companies that have EC parents are unfounded.  I welcome the rules that the Minister is implementing here.  Obviously, employees of EC subsidiaries here would prefer to have the local company's accounts published, but with the restrictions here they will still be able to assess the health of the company, and the fact that their debts will be guaranteed should be a protection to them.  The Bill also provides that dormant companies will have to publish accounts.  Of course, they will automatically fulfil two of the three rules for small or medium companies and will be obliged to publish accounts with certain notes attached.</P>
    <P>Regarding the formats that the Minister has laid down in the Bill, a great deal of fear has been expressed especially by some of the people in companies that would be affected by this legislation. They feared that a change in their accounting practices would involve them in enormous expense, a great deal of retraining and complex understanding. However, the Minister has chosen in this legislation to be as flexible as possible by giving a choice of two balance sheet formats and four profit and loss account formats.  This flexibility will benefit many <Col N="1709" /> companies who are preparing accounts and they will be able to continue and maintain their present accounting practices and the format layouts they are using already.  Deputy Ahern last week raised an area covered under section 2 and I would like to raise it also.  It is the exemption for religious and charitable organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;many of whom I know.  It covers religious and charitable organisations.  The Minister indicated that there are good reasons why we should not put very severe restrictions on charitable and religious organisations and oblige them to prepare accounts that are extremely complex.  However, I would like to hear the Minister comment and indicate how he will determine the list of companies so exempted under section 2. Will there be a list that I or any other member of the public can see in the Companies Registration Office and find out from it who is exempt from having to publish accounts?  In other words, where does a charity begin and end?  The majority of our charities and our religious bodies are reputable, but concern has been expressed from time to time about the workings of some of them.  The public who donate so generously to these bodies are entitled to know how these bodies use their hard earned tax money to the benefit of the group or organisation for which the money is raised.  Many charities already publish clear documentation of where their money goes each year which they circulate to all their donors.  This is a source of comfort to people who continue to donate to them because at least they know that the money is being used properly.  However, the Minister should keep a very close watch on this <Col N="1710" /> exemption that he has built into this Bill in section 2.  The time has come for some firmer legislation generally dealing with the whole area of charities both in our tax laws and in the setting up of the charities.  It seems there in no control here.  Anybody seems to be able do decide that he is a charity, to get flags or tickets printed and is away off to raise money for some worthy cause or other without much control on him and without answerability to anybody as to what percentage of that income goes on administration, paying collectors etc.  We must be careful here.</P>
      <P>As one totally untrained in economics I welcome sections 13 and 15.  The Minister rightly in his speech pointed out that many people who want to get a sort of pen picture or bird's eye view of a company pick up the glossy presentation from the company that has the chairman's report on the front of it and in which he can read lovely, glowing accounts of the company, the marvelous profits they made, the new openings they had in the year and so on.  That is as much as most of us can understand about many of these published accounts.  Section 13 has the effect of supplementing the requirements of section 158 of the principal Act by requiring that the report of the directors of a company contain additional information concerning the company's and subsidiary's affairs and in particular a review of past and future developments, important events since the balance sheet date, and activities in research and development. The directors' report and the annual accounts must be consistent with each other; in other words, the written glossy work must correspond with the hard figures listed in the accounts which most of us find difficult to wade through.  Those directors' reports must be confirmed and signed.  Such a procedure is welcome, particularly for those who cannot put a trained eye, like the Minister and others, on the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of two EC directives have been implemented already and the Bill before us will give more protection to employees by making more information available in relation to companies.  There <Col N="1711" /> are those who contend that the provisions do not go far enough and that the Minister has chosen to take out the desirable elements of the directive.  Some hold that less information will be available to employees following the passing of the Bill.  How much information will be given in the accounts of large companies about the amount that may be due in PRSI, PAYE and pensions?  I accept that that is covered in the Schedule but I would like to be able to say to employees that as soon as the legislation is passed they will know if the company they are working for is in default in regard to such payments.  Employees putting their backs to the grindstone for the betterment of a company are entitled to know if the tax and levies being deducted each week are being sent to the Revenue Commissioners and not being used as a soft temporary loan to keep a company going. If a company that has not made a return collapses employees will be left without protection if the Revenue Commissioners seek their share first.  As a result the employees would lose pension rights.</P>
    <P>In November the Taoiseach announced in the House that it was hoped, in consultation with the NESC, to introduce into the workplace committees consisting of management and employees to act as a watchdog in regard to the payment of PAYE and PRSI.  That commitment, and the provisions in the Bill, should convince employees that their rights are being protected.  In my view the provisions will prove an advantage to companies in that they will be obliged to have a stricter discipline on their undertakings. They will now be aware that if they run into cash flow problems they cannot hold on to their PAYE, PRSI or VAT payments and coast along for a few months to keep the sheriff away from the door.  They will have to be able to stand over their accounts.  I welcome the fact that the Legislature is, somewhat tardily, accepting its responsibility in regard to implementing the Fourth Directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, <Col N="1712" /> the Bill is before the House pursuant to a directive of the European Community made quite a number of years ago.  There has been no great enthusiasm on the part of successive Governments who were so anxious for us to join and participate in the EC to carry out Community directives. It has been quite the reverse.  It appears that the Minister has been dragged, protesting all the way, into implementing provisions which should have been brought in five years ago.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Flynn, complained about the Bill and suggested that its provisions would be an imposition on large private limited companies that operate here.  He remarked at how terrible it was for the EC to visit such an atrocity upon us.  He, and his party, were more than anxious to bring us into the EC, but when we are in there appears to be a reluctance to bring in measures required by that institution. Some modest &mdash; it is very modest &mdash; protection may be given to workers in companies and members of the public by this measure.  It appears that there has been a change of heart about the EC by Deputy Flynn and his party.  Deputy Haughey, in a recent contribution, did some sabre rattling about our association with the EC.  I say to him that it is a little late in the day to be thinking along those lines.  We acted to become members of the Community and we have to live with that.  But, if we are in, we ought to carry out requirements in EC directives without bringing the country to the embarrassing position of being hauled before the European Court of Justice for being in default of requirements we were so anxious to take upon ourselves in our early years of membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the protest by Deputy Flynn one would think that the Bill represented a major intrusion into the activities of the business community.  That is far from the truth.  In fact, the Bill opts for the minimum requirements on disclosure suggested by the EC.  It would have been better and more appropriate if the Minister had gone for a wider disclosure provision on companies.  The maximum possible disclosure should be made by <Col N="1713" /> companies.  The definition of &ldquo;small&rdquo; is, perhaps, a misnomer.  It sounds to me that they are fairly substantial companies in the Irish context and most of them will be excluded under the minimal requirements in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the vast majority of the 75,000 Irish companies, and the subsidiaries of EC based companies, are excluded from the main provisions.  In most European countries there is a full disclosure requirement of the profits, losses, assets and liabilities of companies. In my view only very small companies, employing no more than a handful of workers, ought to be excluded from the disclosure provisions.  Workers have a right to know what is going on.  Many of the companies concerned were set up and operate through public funds.</P>
    <P>For example, there are more than 2,600 small companies, so called, grant-aided and one-third of the total new jobs in manufacturing industry provided in 1984 were in small firms.  Eighteen million pounds of public money has been channelled into small industries in 1984 by the IDA alone.  The public have a right to know what is going on there, having regard to the fact that it is public money that has set up so many of these.</P>
    <P>The question of confidentiality and secrecy of operation referred to by the Fianna Fáil spokesman is entirely inappropriate in this issue.  Any member of the public, let alone workers, should be entitled to go to the Companies Office and see to what use or misuse, as the case may be, the public funds have been put. Likewise, workers must have an interest in the affairs of the company, even if public funds have not been involved.  The record of very many of these companies, I am sorry to say, has been unhappy. There have been and continue to be very serious abuses.  As Deputies we come across many cases in our personal experience from time to time when, for example, pension fund contributions have been deducted by arrangement from the workers' wages and that money has not been passed to the trustees of the pension fund, but retained as part of the capital of the company.  I would not go <Col N="1714" /> so far as to say that it is a common practice, but one comes across it far more often than one should.</P>
    <P>There are cases where by arrangement with some companies union contributions that the workers make are deducted from their wages and are supposed to be paid over to the unions concerned.  Again in many cases those funds are retained. What happens when one of these companies go into receivership or liquidation? The receiver or liquidator puts his hands on the funds deducted from the workers' wages and in very many cases there is a very substantial and real loss, of great consequence for the workers involved.  They find themselves deprived of the pension rights and union rights to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The nature of the protection to be provided by this Bill is minimalist in the extreme, which I find disappointing.  I find it disappointing that it is this Companies Bill which is now before the House rather than the Bill, for which we have been waiting with some impatience for quite a long time, which deals with the much more relevant and important question of making directors personally liable in certain circumstances.  Legislation is overdue with regard to an EC directive on that matter also and will we have to be brought before the Court of the European Commission before that is brought in?  That is the reform of company law that I and many of us here would have wished brought before the House in preference to the present one which, quite frankly, will not provide a great deal of protection for very many, either workers or members of the public.</P>
    <P>Members of the public do need protection from the operation of many of these companies.  People dealing with companies, ordinary members of the public, all too often do not realise the hazards of what they are doing.  A very favourite method of setting up a business is that an individual, who may well have had a number of defunct companies to his record before, sets up a trading company perhaps, puts whatever capital he wishes into it and immediately takes out a debenture to secure himself from the day on <Col N="1715" /> which the company is incorporated.  He has first call on anything because of that debenture.  The ordinary members of the public coming to deal with that company do not know that.  They will pay deposits to have work done, goods supplied, a house built &mdash; all the myriad of things across the commercial and financial spectrum &mdash; not knowing that if anything goes amiss with that company such deposits will be very much at risk.  The man who set up the company will have first call on whatever assets are there, through his debenture.</P>
    <P>Members of the public could find out, one must concede, whether a company have a debenture or not.  One can find out where the Companies Office is located in Dublin Castle, go into the intricacies of it, wait an hour or two for the file to come up and, if one has the expertise to examine it, one could find out if there is a debenture.  That is undeniably true, but that is not for real so far as the members of the public are concerned.  They have no protection by the fact that the debenture would be recorded in the Companies Office.  If the Minister has the wish to provide some protection for these people, some consideration should be given as to how the status of a company from the debenture point of view could be brought to the attention of the public other than by having it recorded in the Companies Office files and other than by requiring a very small number of Irish public companies to register their accounts, as this Bill does.  It might be appropriate to insist that all documentation, invoices, advertising material and so on, put out by the company should be required to note on letterheads and notepaper if the company have a debenture.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there should be a short note warning of the dangers that might well apply to persons paying deposits, in particular, to such a company.  These deposits on occasion might be relatively small amounts to purchase a consumer item of no great cost, but it could be a very considerable amount &mdash; for example, a substantial deposit on a <Col N="1716" /> house, which could run to a couple of thousand pounds or more.  There are very few builders around who will undertake this business in their own name alone. An examination would show that they use limited companies for that purpose. Likewise an examination whould show that they have taken out a debenture in their own favour in case anything goes wrong.  I am not even talking here about those directors who might be milking the company or withdrawing funds on a fraudulent basis.  That is a factor.  But leaving that aspect aside, it is interesting that when one goes to buy a new house and pay a deposit on it, one is not allowed to pay a deposit to a solicitor to be held as stakeholder so that one could get it back in the event of anything going wrong in the meantime.  In these cases it is insisted that the deposit money be paid over direct into the hands of the builder; and when one looks at the record in recent times of problems in the building industry, with building firms going into receivership and liquidation, that interim period is a terifying prospect until you get your house title, and a serious situation is faced by many.</P>
    <P>At the very least, consideration should be given to the possibility of requiring that kind of information about a dealing company that take deposits, in particular that there is a debenture in existence and a risk involved there.  Some care would have to be taken to make sure that such a law, if brought in, would be enforced.  Most of the company regulations applying at present are not being enforced, even the requirements regarding registered offices, names of directors and so on, except in respect of a minor number of companies.  The Companies Registration Office do not have the resources to check up these matters because they are as affected by the cutbacks in the public service as all the other branches of Government.  The Companies Registration Office do not ensure that the company returns giving the names of directors are up to date.  Presumably this is because of lack of staff <Col N="1717" /> and facilities.  There is little point in bringing in new regulations unless arrangements can be made to operate them. Adequate back up staff must be provided.</P>
    <P>We would have an additional advantage if rather more detail was required in the accounts of these companies and if the net was widened very considerably.  I do not know why the Minister went for the lowest common denominator in setting the parameters of what would be required.  I am not happy about that decision.  Does he share the views of Deputy Flynn about preserving secrecy and confidentiality, even where workers and public funds are concerned?  I would think that it would serve the public much better if these things were open to view, clearly available for all to see.</P>
    <P>As far as subsidiaries of foreign firms are concerned, I am sure the arrangements will suit them very well because we suspect most strongly that they are happily engaged in repatriating substantial quantities of the profits they make in this country, taking advantage of the tax laws and so on.  It appears to be the position that they do this legally, but that should be known.  It should be open to us to see exactly what they are about.  If they are repatriating their profits in that way, cognisance should be taken of that fact and due attention should be given to companies of that description when they next come to the IDA with applications for more public funds.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the degree of protection being given here.  The unfortunate members of the public dealing with companies will not be helped to any worthwhile extent by this Bill.  People will continue to lose out, in many cases losing hard earned savings.</P>
    <P>I am very unhappy about the position regarding the activities of a receiver or liquidator put in by a debenture holder. When that happens it is as though a kind of iron curtain comes down around the company.  It is an excuse to cut off any information about the company.  It is impossible to get an answer to any question. The blanket response is that one can ask nothing and find out nothing because the liquidator or the receiver is <Col N="1718" /> in.  That is not good enough. There should be a procedure devised under which receivers and liquidators would be obligated on a regular basis, perhaps every three months, to make available information as to exactly what they are at in the company, exactly what they have received and exactly what they are doing with it.  The same should apply in the case of a receiver.  An unfortunate person may be trying to find out if he will get back his £2,000 deposit or whatever, but he may be left waiting for years.  Many of these receiverships go on for years.</P>

It will be a great relief to members of the public who have experienced such frustration in trying to find out what is going on inside those companies which have been subjected to the depredations of so many rogue directors and company promoters.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Bill does not expand the requirements of the directive, but without being too grudging about it we have to welcome it as some small step forward.  Perhaps at a later stage the EC will issue another directive insisting on a wider base being provided.  It is regrettable that we have to wait for the EC to put these reforms forward.  I do not know why we cannot put forward reforms on our own initiative without prompting from the Commission.  That appears to apply to a fair amount of our legislation, which would not be on the Statute Book but for promptings from the EC.  I have to note that fact with regret.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  This whole area of company legislation has long been in need of reform, but this reform is based on the EC fourth directive and it does not deal with the basic problems in company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal first with some aspects of the 1963 Act which I consider to be wholly inadequate and unfair, particularly as they pertain to small business and unsecured creditors in the event of insolvency.  Most small companies are privately owned and operated and are limited liability companies under the terms of the Companies Act, 1963.  In theory the benefits of forming a limited liability company allows someone to set up a corporate body, which gives limited financial protection instead of being totally liable.  However, the practice of limited liability is being circumvented by the banks and other financial institutions because they are insisting on personal guarantees from owners of small firms <Col N="1720" /> and their shareholders.  Therefore, limited liability <i>de facto</i>, only hold for trade and other creditors who tend to be other smaller companies and, as a result, a small company tends to suffer from a lack of equity and a high level of bank borrowing.  Ultimately, all the risks are borne by the company and their shareholders and the rewards favour the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is preparing the very detailed Bill which he outlined he should address the question of personal guarantees, because this is a facility used by powerful financial institutions to circumvent the whole concept of limited liability and ensures that the people who bear the brunt of the worst effects of limited liability are other small firms. Therefore, there is a domino effect: if one company closes many more will have heinous cash problems.</P>

      <P>This could be tackled in either of two ways.  Where the enterpreneur is financially committed to the project, if he sets up a business costing £40,000 and has already put in £20,000 of his own cash, borrowing a further £20,000 from the bank and where the injection of personal equity is such to show that he is not a fly by night but deeply committed for sums up to £20,000 there should be an insistence that the banks would not request personal guarantees in those instances.</P>

      <P>That is one way of dealing with it, through the tax code of section 84 loans.  The other way is to look at the way in which banks are becoming secured creditors and circumventing the concept of limited liability.  Of course, the Minister may say that it is freely given, but the reality is that you do not get the money otherwise.  It is Hobson's choice.</P>

      <P>The second area where I should like to see an attempt to deal with the inadequacy of the existing Companies Act is that of insolvency.  Delinquent directors have been abusing the concept of limited liability, and this should be tackled.  In such liquidations small companies bear the brunt of being unsecured creditors.  This deliberate abuse must be dealt with.  There must be a comprehensive review of the Companies Act in this regard.  It should specifically deal with the problem of delinquent directors who salvage the assets of one company and then start trading in another.  That is a flagrant abuse whereby it pays people who owe a large amount of tax to wind up their company and shift their assets so that the cupboard is bare when the receiver comes.  At present they can set up a new company with total immunity. There should not be a witchhunt in regard to all entrepreneurs in dealing with this problem, but directors should be responsible and debarred from managing companies for a period of five years after that. They should certainly be debarred from managing a company until the receivership or liquidation of the company they previously owned has been would up. In some companies, particularly in the building industry, people can salvage the assets and move them to a new company registered under the Companies Act. Before the liquidator has sold the previous company they are taking orders from the old company so that there is no prospect of retaining employment.  The Minister should deal with that point specifically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has recourse to greater expertise than I have.  The concept of an administrator should be made available to small companies who are creditors of any other company. Larger companies can have inordinate purchasing power over smaller companies. However, if a large company is insolvent or nearing insolvency there is nothing that a smaller company can do under the present insolvency law to ensure reorganisation.  In my own constituency a contractor did a huge amount of work for the Ross Company who were his sole client.  He saw the writing on the wall but could not collect his money before the receiver was called in because he was dependent on the company for his future.  He had to choose between continued trading with the company by giving them credit or being put out of business by not getting any orders. Unsecured small firms should have some kind of recourse in terms of obtaining meagre pence in the £ and they should have access to a court order in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of unsecured creditors generally also must be dealt with in any proposed company law changes because the present law is unfair in its distribution between creditors of different classes.  In liquidations unsecured creditors are usually left with nothing after preferential creditors &mdash; often the taxman followed by holders of floating charges &mdash; have been looked after.  I realise this is a thorny and contentious area but I urge the Minister to look at the question of restricting the rights of preferential creditors over and above those of unsecured creditors and setting aside part of the proceeds of <Col N="1723" /> a liquidation for unsecured creditors.  I am not saying that preferential creditors should be written off.  But when the receiver is selling all the assets, machinery, plant, premises and so on, he first pays the secured creditors, then the preferential creditors and there is nothing left.  Surely it would be fair to say that a minimum of 10 per cent should be put aside for unsecured creditors in certain circumstances?</P>
    <P>I should like to see some proposal on these lines rather than have the total inequality that exists at the moment.  The needs of a small electrical contractor and those of the bank are totally different and what a bank and what a small business can afford to write off as a bad debt are very different.  The small unsecured creditors are left at the end of a long queue and they get nothing.  Recently I was talking to a prominent receiver and he told me that gone are the days when unsecured creditors got 5p in the £.  Now they get nothing at all in most cases. There should be greater equality between creditors and this should be done at the expense of preferential creditors.  A specific percentage should be set aside to allow something to unsecured creditors. Fair play demands this.  If a policy were evolved dealing with matters such as personal guarantee, delinquent directors, the concept of an administrator and allowing fair play between preferential and unsecured creditors, this would show small businesses that we recognise that the entrepreneurial spirit is something that must be fostered in Ireland and that it involves taking risks, but not unacceptable risks.  If there is inequality, as is the case now, people will not put their money on the line and set up small businesses.</P>
    <P>I should like those points to be dealt with in the forthcoming Bill mentioned by the Minister.  I will turn now to the Bill at hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have received data from the CII and from the ICTU in relation to this matter.  As is the case in many instances, there is a polarisation of opinion when what is needed is the combined forces of workers, employers, shareholders and the State.  Co-operation between those sections is necessary if we are to hold on to the jobs now existing.</P>
      <P>There has been a problem in commercial life here in respect of the failure and hesitation of employers to disclose anything about their affairs.  I give a guarded welcome to the Bill but I ask that on Committee Stage there be a detailed examination of the measure to allay certain fears I hold.  If we are talking solely about information to shareholders and to employees, I have little objection.  However under the terms of this Bill information will have to be lodged in the Companies Registration Office and I am afraid that as a result of this there could be cases of industrial espionage.  There may be certain strategic market information in respect of turnover, product development and investment that may fall into the hands of international competitors and this could be to the detriment of Irish companies.  I do not believe that is the intent of the Fourth Directive.  This matter must be clarified on Committee Stage.  There should be a more specific definition of information disclosure and I suggest it should relate more to profitability and less to turnover.  If a competitor is in a position to obtain information in relation to turnover he will be able to draw certain deductions from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this as in other Bills I have grave reservations that it may be possible to proceed further with this measure by way of ministerial order.  This surreptitious, almost Trojan horse type of legislation could mean that a future Minister could take a completely new interpretation of the measure and change its content by way of ministerial order.  In such an event <Col N="1725" /> there could be disclosure of information that would be totally inappropriate to Irish circumstances and conditions.</P>

      <P>I would have no fears in respect of the Minister, but who knows what the future holds.  It could happen that the person who introduced the Bill would find to his horror that the subsequent use of ministerial orders had an effect totally contrary to the intention of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be critical of our public and our civil servants, who have served the country well.  However, there is an almost permanent power of interference in public life by civil servants.  To have such provisions on the Statute Book could lead to problems.  The rate of return on investments in Irish commercial life it is not good: we are talking about a 1 per cent rate of return for indigenous industries.  They are faced with many problems in trying to keep in business. They have to cope with the bank and the taxman and they do not want unnecessary interference also.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to comment on the general exemption given to small firms under this Bill.  Nowadays there is the attitude both here and in the EC that small is beautiful.  All of us are in favour of small industry but when it comes to sorting out the needs of small firms I hope that when we refer to exemptions for small firms we are talking about the IDA definition, a firm employing from one to 50 persons.  The AnCo definition is one to 80 persons employed.  The EC definition of a small to medium firm is one employing one to 500 people.  I hope the Minister will spell out clearly the definition of a small firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As always, we will follow your guidance in these matters.  There is a need to apply the rigours of this legislation to multinationals.  In the Bill we must draw a line between indigenous Irish companies and foreign companies. I am not against EC subsidiary companies setting up here: they are more than welcome and we appreciate their investment and the employment they give.  However, we have seen through the evolution of the black hole and decisions made by remote control, companies pulling out of Ireland overnight.  The difference in loyalty and commitment to the Irish economy between foreign subsidiaries here and indigenous companies is vast. The only way an indigenous company operating, say, in Birr can repatriate their profits is back up the road &mdash; there is no question of a black hole.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the commitment and loyalty of such companies is much greater than those repatriating money quite legitimately out of the country, and the scrutiny must be different because the criteria are different.  Corporate board decisions to pull out of Ireland or to rationalise can be taken in such a way that, if employees had the information earlier, it would make for openness and awareness by the workers of problems in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will explain the implications of the ICTU document.  I am puzzled by the conflicting data in that document in regard to the polarised sections of Irish commercial life.  The document refers to the Bill as providing for the minimum disclosure of information. It states that the vast majority of the 75,000 Irish companies and the EC companies are excluded from the main provision of the Bill.  Will the vast majority <Col N="1727" /> of those 75,000 companies meet the criteria?</P>
    <P>In amending company law we must be very careful not to do anything that would minimise the incentives to take risks in this economy, or to do anything to stop people putting their money on the line, putting their money where their mouths are.  Our tax code, our financial institutions and a battery of legislation are presenting an armoury for the defence of small companies because we are not concerned about the risks they have to take.  Unless we have a positive public attitude to risk taking and do not saddle companies with a legal and administrative environment that will choke their existence, we will be defeating what we are trying to attain.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices when preparing major company law to deal with the question of unsecured creditors of small firms, with the right to appoint an administrator to deal with the process whereby a small proportion, say 10 per cent, of the proceeds of a liquidation can go to a small firm, so that deliberate delinquent directors would not be allowed to set up a new company until their previous company had been wound up.  I think I am speaking on behalf of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses when I make those points.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that on Committee Stage we will hear that excessive powers are not being given to the Minister by way of order and that strategic information on companies will not be given away to their competitors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make only a few short submissions on the Bill.  I agree with what Deputy Yates said in relation to the opportunities that exist, unfortunately, for directors under present law to close a business today and open one tomorrow. I hope that all loopholes in that direction will be filled quickly because that sort of thing destroys the confidence that exists in the limited liability company law.  I subscribe to the view that information about companies' activities, especially in relation to PRSI and tax commitments to <Col N="1728" /> workers and the future welfare of employees, should be available because that would lead to better understanding of company problems and better general industrial relations.  Any company management that do not have a two-way flow of information in relation to company operations are very foolish.  Many good ideas come up from the floor.  Managements have not all the answers and I would not agree that managements are always right.  In critical times in the past, if they had listened to what their employees said, perhaps many companies would not have gone to the wall.</P>
      <P>In Ireland in the past, and we still have far too much of it, we had the &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; attitude.  That attitude existed for far too long and led to many confrontations and strikes.  Many old fashioned managements seem to think that the best way to run a company is to keep all the information close to their chest.  I never subscribed to that view.  Any improvements that can be made to protect the rights of workers, particularly pension funds, will be very welcome.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, I cannot welcome the Bill.  First of all I ask myself who will want information and for what purpose will it be assimilated? I draw a distinct line between furnishing the type of information I spoke about earlier in relation to employees' welfare and cross-fertiliseration of ideas between management and employees, and closing the loopholes which permitted the existence of fly-by-night directors.  We have had too much of that.  However, when it comes to fundamental disclosures of strategic information in relation to companies I cannot go along with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw a distinct line between information relating to employees' welfare or to good cross fertilisation of ideas between employers and workers or to filling all the loopholes that will enable us to rid ourselves of the fly-by-night directors of whom we have had too many examples in the past and the disclosure by companies of strategic information which is an attack on the free enterprise system.  If I make a private investment, <Col N="1729" /> why should a conglomeration of bureaucrats in Brussels have to know all about my business, and for what purpose should they have that information? Many of those directives that appear from time to time are dreamed up by a bureaucracy in Brussels that is thriving on itself and which relates in no way to the real problems. My limited experience of Brussels bureaucracy led me to the conclusion that it is socialist orientated.  It is time that we told the people in Brussels to stop churning out directive after directive when these are directive that can only have the effect of stifling enterprise.</P>
    <P>The sort of nonsense that is contained in this directive should not be heeded. The rot has been allowed to develop down through the years.  I am not blaming any Government for this.  The French, for instance, will accept any directive while they are sitting around the table, though they may have no intention of ever implementing anything that would be to the detriment of the French economy. The great industrial nation of Germany was granted a derogation in relation to limited partnerships within the context of the fourth directive.  The Germans sought that derogation because 80 per cent of their business is comprised of limited partnerships but where is the out for industrial development and private investment in Ireland so far as this directive is concerned? I accept that the Minister has gone as far as he can go within the limits, but I disagree fundamentally with this kind of nonsense being foisted on us time and again from the EC.</P>
    <P>Of its definition, private investment is private.  The private investor puts his money on the line and takes the risks involved.  It is a serious indictment that at this very early stage of our industrial development we are providing for the kind of disclosures referred to in this legislation.  This will cause serious problems for the future.</P>
    <P>By today's standards a company with a turnover of £2,500,000 and a balance sheet of £1,500,000 is very small.  Anybody who is in the market place knows only too well that strategic information can be collated by multinationals for the <Col N="1730" /> purpose of ruining the small man who is trying to embark on some business venture.  There are plenty of examples of how multinationals ruined the chances of the smaller businessman before his business got off the ground.</P>
    <P>One such instance that comes to mind is of a small industry in Waterford.  The product concerned was being supplied by a multinational based in the UK.  They had almost a total monopoly in respect of certain medical services but when the Irish enterpreneurs began to eat into the big corporation's market place and were having a fair deal of success with what was an excellent product, the multinational sent representatives to all the hospitals offering special terms, something on the lines perhaps that because of some promotional activity, normal supplies during the following 12 months would be less 50 per cent, while supplies additional to normal requirements would be free of charge.  That is an example of the kind of opposition one encounters in the market place.</P>
    <P>The same kind of problems arise in other spheres of activity.  That is why I am totally opposed to the disclosure of the kind of information we are talking of in this legislation.  It is strategic information. Its disclosure would make it very easy for competitors to determine the gross profit margin of a small company. It would make it very easy for the bigger competitor to squeeze the smaller one out of the market place, because the disclosure of strategic information allows the big corporation to decide on what their strategy would have to be in order to ruin the chances of the smaller man. The bigger company would determine how much money they had to spend for, say, three, six or nine months in pursuit of that task.  Nobody should be fooled into thinking that anyone in the market place is a benevolent operator.  One must be as good as the next.</P>
    <P>I was not in politics when we joined the EC but I recall the Common Market being described by someone then as the big businessman's club.  The more documentation of the kind being discussed here that is poured into this Parliament, <Col N="1731" /> the more I am convinced of how accurate a description that was of the EC.  A multinational setting up here would not have to make the kind of disclosures that are being provided for in the Bill because they could set up as a subsidiary or as a branch.  There are ways out for all except the Irish entrepreneur who will have to disclose this strategic information to everyone in sight.</P>
    <P>I am not making any case for people who would abuse the Companies Act or the limited liabilities provisions because such persons would do only harm to any business and give everyone a bad name. What I am talking about is the future development of Irish industry and about the rough battles that will have to be fought on that road, but here we are handing the ace in the pack to our competitors to enable them to screw us down.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the debt that has been placed in our market place already by those people as a result of Irish industry not having being competitive for so many years, of its not responding to the market place in terms of the products that were needed, for instance.  One might ask how long a person would have to be in business to produce the figures I have given by way of defining a small business. The aim of all of us is that our small indigenous industries will develop into medium and large industries but we are not helping in that regard by this kind of legislation.  The small man of today can be the big man of tomorrow and we should not put obstacles in his way.</P>
    <P>How can people be expected to risk their money when we are handing so much ammunition to their competitors? We all know that money invested in industry today is high risk money.  People now are opting for secure investments. Much of the money that would otherwise be invested in property or industry is being invested in the Post Office which probably provides the best return possible. Presumably, if the property market picked up, there would be a renewal of investment in that area, but the fact remains that, despite all our efforts, badly needed moneys are not being <Col N="1732" /> invested on the industrial side.  By providing for more regulations and for further disclosure of a company's operations, we are putting matters into reverse.  There is far too much bureaucratic control without our adding to that load.  I accept that the consumer society is entitled to protection but I do not accept that Governments must go over-board and introduce one regulation after another.</P>
    <P>We are talking about young people setting up their own businesses and small firms trying to get one step further.  They already have to deal with a great deal of bureaucracy, and now they will have these European regulations.  This will stifle business.  By definition private enterprise needs freedom to operate. Which economies are working well? The United States of America and Japan, and why are they successful?  Because they have freedom to operate.  Where that freedom is abused, hit it as hard as possible, but do not stifle private enterprise. The people who invest money and take risks are using their own money and yet we are putting more bureaucracy in their way.</P>
    <P>We badly need deregulation, not more regulations.  Certain sections of the community always appear to be crying for protection for this and protection for that, but the consumer is not prepared to protect himself.  He has a choice when purchasing goods.  The consumer wants a regulation for this and a regulation for that, but it is time he realised that this leads to more spending of taxpayers' money to implement each regulation and he should be prepared to protect himself. As far as I am concerned, the customer has a free choice when buying goods.  In my view we have more than enough laws to protect the consumer, and sometimes these laws may be even too restrictive. We must remove shackles from private enterprise if we want them to do their job properly.</P>
    <P>I have heard a number of Deputies say that private enterprise has failed this nation.  If that is so it is because we made it impossible for them to succeed.  Ask any young person who starts a business. <Col N="1733" /> I saw an article in a recent business magazine about a man who had set up a small food industry in Deputy Yates' area.  He listed 78 agencies he had to go to before he was ready to set up business.  Admittedly, I could not name those 78 agencies although I could count a hell of a lot &mdash; planning permissions, county councils, the ESB, the IDA and so on &mdash; but he could because he put them down in black and white.</P>

      <P>Yes he is Irish.  This is another complaint we politicians hear about.  It is said by Irish would be entrepreneurs or industrialists that if you are Irish you do not, and cannot, get the same facilities foreigners get.  This is a nonsense, as I and the Minister know. People who do not have accountants, solicitors and all the personnel which multinationals have available do not know what to do.  The poor Irishman, who can produce the product and has spotted an opportunity in the marketplace, is not versed in these areas.  This is one reason Irish entrepreneurs believe they are being discriminated against.  It would be better if we provided these services for small entrepreneurs rather than putting a weight on their backs by presenting them with all these rules and regulations. It must be remembered that every regulation takes more taxpayers' money and more civil servants to implement it.  Yet people begin to wonder what all civil servants are doing.  It is society who is calling for more regulations and more personnel to implement those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same will happen with all the regulations being poured into this country from the European Community.  Will the EC give any money to Ireland to implement these regulations?  No, they <Col N="1734" /> will not; but they produce these regulations and directives and expect us to implement them.  We are going in the wrong direction.  The place to stop these regulations is at source, not at the Minister's desk in Dublin.  We realise that the present Minister and the previous Minister's stayed out of this as long as they could, but during that time we should have been doing what other member states were doing, that is, looking for ways out.  In 1982 I went to Brussels and complained about the French, Germans, Dutch and everybody else breaking or bending the rules.  The Commissioner admitted that he was not in a position to do anything about them, that this was what happened when we hit a deep recession.  He said everybody moved into their own trenches and protected their own.  Nobody admits that in public, but that is the reality.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister could give a number of examples proving conclusively that the French have abused various directives from time to time.  We all know they have abused certain directives in regard to how we can export goods to France.  They put up bureaucratic barriers at the customs posts, demanded that forms be filled in in triplicate or with four or five copies and if one item was not properly answered the drivers were turned back.  If that happens three or four times the Irish businessman will find that his charges begin to outweigh his profits and finally he will decide not to export to France.  That is precisely what the French want.  They have even gone so far as to dig up roads and knock out telecommunications to hypermarket chains which have continued to import goods which it was decided they should not import.  The French look after France first and the EC second.  I am not advocating protectionism but we should take the same type of action to give the Irish industrialists the same type of protection which other Governments give their nationals without breaking, or bending the rules, call it what you like.</P>
    <P>We are, and have been, very good Europeans.  But we are paying a very dear price for it and, unfortunately, so is our economy.  I would like the Minister <Col N="1735" /> to tell me who wants this information, for what purpose, and how he believes it will help industrial development in Ireland, because I believe it will have the opposite effect.  The kind of disclosure being requested here suits industrially developed nations because they already know the ways out.  I understand that Luxembourg brought in legislation which hardly complied with the regulation.  We know what the Germans and the French have done, but what are we doing?  The Minister has gone as far as he can within the rules laid down in the Fourth Directive, but how does what we have to accept endanger industrial development in Ireland? I believe it will seriously undermine it in years to come because we are only at the developing stage.  These directives should be stopped at source.  When these regulations are being discussed in the EC we should show quite clearly that we are not at the same stage of development as other EC industrialised nations. We are only starting to develop and they are fully developed.  We need derogation from many of these directives.  We need different limits than those that obtain within the EC so as to protect our people.</P>
    <P>The information which it is now obligatory on Irish companies to disclose will be and can be used in the marketplace.  Strategic information, such as the number of employees, how the business is going and so on, can be extracted from the information which companies are now compelled to give.  From a small company's turnover a large competitor will be able to produce the company's profit and loss account and balance sheet taking into consideration all the information that must be disclosed.  However, the small company cannot do that in relation to the large company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that group information is not the same as information from a small company.  I defy anybody to disentangle group information and relate it back to a specific operation.  The multinationals are not confined to any sector of industry.  At the end of the day what the multinationals disclose to the EC is the total amount of their group activities but not specific information in relation to one subsidiary. The multinationals have a definite advantage. That is why I ask: is the European Community becoming the big businessman's club?  If it is, the small company better look out.  This sort of thing can totally undermine small companies.  It has been agreed that, if we are to prosper, we have to eat into our big import bill. Import substitution and linkage has to be an arm of economic development.  We cannot get fruitfully involved in that if this sort of information must be disclosed to our competitors who are flooding the country with their goods We cannot compete on that basis.  Small and medium sized industry here is being put at a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone as far as he can within the limits of the directive, but over the last number of years we should have considered ways and means of protecting the development of our small industries. I am only concerned about disclosures in relation to the successful operation of a business and not about disclosures in relation to the welfare of employees or fly by night directors.  Will the Minister give some assurance that Irish industry will not be totally disadvantaged as a result of the implementation of this directive and that they will not have to give away strategic information which is private. A public company must have its books open to the public, but a private investor is entitled to the privacy of that investment and should not have to show up his strengths and weaknesses.  We must face that problem.  Both small and medium sized industries are being given <Col N="1737" /> a death warrant in this directive.  It may not show quickly but it will show over a period as the Europeans come into grab our market.</P>
    <P>Because of these EC directives a lot of the efforts of successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce will come to nought and much of the investment which might be made by Irish people will not be made because it will have become a riskier business.  The IDA will have to look more closely at investment in the future, knowing the unfair competition that will have to be met and about the unfair disclosures that will have to be made.  If we have to depend on the multinationals for the development of this country we will be in a sorry state.  They will be here as long as it suits them to be here.  We should look to a stronger native industrial base.  Recent closures and withdrawals of multinationals &mdash; for instance, by the people in Greystones &mdash; are a sign of the times.  The marketplace is constantly changing and the product life of high technology industries in many areas has become so short that we would be far better off in the long term looking to our own resources, encouraging Irish investors and ensuring that we do not strangle them with more and more regulations and disclosures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incumbent on me to make a short contribution, especially in view of Deputy Reynolds' important contribution. Deputy Reynolds' contribution showed his insight into business and its problems and was a warning to the Minister, to the IDA and to those trying to develop business along small business lines.  It is interesting to note the contributions by the three previous speakers who without having experience in business expressed a different concern at this Bill.  Their concerns are legitimate and as important as the concern expressed by Deputy Reynolds and those which I intend to express.  I would love to see a whole stream of short contributions by Deputies with business experience, particularly in the small business sector, so as to get their comments on the possible effects of this Bill.  It would not be a <Col N="1738" /> waste of time if the Minister issued a questionnaire to people in business to see how they feel about the disclosures and the effects of the disclosures on their businesses.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that this directive must be complied with, its effects should be minimised as far as possible.  In most cases the bank manager knows the extent of the company's liability and the strength of the company.  It is not necessary to publish that information for all the world. This Bill can be dealt with more effectively on Committee Stage and I will reserve most of my detailed comments until then.  However, it is necessary to point out now a few of the pitfalls to people who believe in disclosures and who believe that some things should be hidden from employees.  How will this Bill affect employment?  Will there be an increase or loss in employment as a result of this Bill?  It is easily demonstrated that there will be a considerable loss of employment as a result of the implementation of this directive.  It will lead to unfair competition if turnover figures are disclosed in small businesses.  It will result unfair competition if turnover figures are disclosed in small businesses.  It will result in a lot of people without ideas trying to copy successful small businesses.  This will lead to pressure in the marketplace.  The IDA have tried to restrict competition when grant aiding businesses.  In this respect I can foresee people queueing up at the Companies Registration Office to ascertain the state of affairs of many companies. As we know, business is ruthless; people have no qualms about undermining someone's livelihood if they can get away with it.  There are other ways of obtaining information than going to the Companies Registration Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed information, especially of a small company in a specialised field, is of enormous value and can affect small businesses not only from the point of view of giving information to the bank manager but also to creditors and competitors. This will put enormous pressure on existing small businesses.  I can foresee enormous queues at the Companies Registration Office.  I can foresee companies setting up and specialising in providing vital information &mdash; courtesy of <Col N="1739" /> the EC, through the Government &mdash; on businesses just as there were specialised firms established in the past decade to set up companies.  There will be consultancies established to give specialised information to people who want to ascertain whether they should go into a certain field, who want to get information about prospective competitors or whether a company is weak.</P>
    <P>The employer area will be most affected by this type of disclosure.  When people demand full information from a business it should be remembered that much is taken for granted because there is much &ldquo;gut&rdquo; feeling and a risk area in which many employees would not care to become involved, or have any experience of.  It should also be remembered that many people would not have the staying power to remain in business with the enormous financial pressures that hone in on them from different quarters: from banks, sales, creditors and suppliers. That is usually the state of affairs in a small business.  If we seek too much disclosure too soon, expecting small businesses to forecast six months ahead that they should close down, then why bother setting up at all?  I can foresee very few people getting off the ground if that is the type of criterion to be applied.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the terms of this directive may not have much of a short term effect but, in the long term, I foresee many businesses going to the wall, resulting in many employees losing their jobs.  There may be a crisis of confidence in the market.  As it is the banking sector is not the greatest supporter of business.  As I have said before, probably they were the only institutions in the State that did not make any contribution during the recent recession.  Indeed, six months ago the chairman of the Bank of Ireland announced that they were imposing a 3 per cent levy on small businesses wishing to borrow for expansion purposes. Because of the resultant outcry, the proposal was with drawn.  I said in the House then that if the banks were not prepared to enter into the risk area one of two things should happen: either they should <Col N="1740" /> be encouraged by subsidies to do so or else the Government should become involved.  In the intervening six to nine months that has happened in the form of the establishment of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>In his contribution, Deputy Yates mentioned personal guarantees, as I have done many times before.  Indeed, I was glad to see that the Minister paid particular attention to this matter because it is one of the weakest areas in the whole of the business sector.  As the Minister invited suggestions on how personal guarantees could be dealt with under the Companies Act I hope to be able to present some on Committee Stage.  As he said, it is not a question of personal guarantees being given voluntarily, they are extracted and loans will not be granted without the banks first seeking such personal guarantees.  I wonder how many people are aware of that practice of extracting personal guarantees, even when there is plenty of collateral.  It should be remembered that people setting up in business are in a spot, they have no choice and such guarantees are given under duress.  We would be doing the whole of the business community a great service were we to restrict personal guarantees to banks in the case of business. Perhaps the Minister cannot do so by law but there are other ways of discouraging personal guarantees.  I am not sure whether they could be forbidden.  It is an area in need of urgent examination. Banks will tell one that they do not move against people's assets in the case of personal guarantees but everybody in business knows that is not the case.  Above all other western countries of which I am aware, this country invariably insists on personal guarantees.  This places tremendous pressure on individuals, on business people, particularly on small business people, trying to expand because small businesses usually get off the ground without much help, without much capital. Usually they survive on their cash flows, the people involved working extended hours in order to keep going.</P>
    <P>There have been submissions made by <Col N="1741" /> the small industries sector of the Confederation of Irish Industry in the last year on the effect of personal guarantees.  There have been extensive surveys undertaken, If the Minister is not familiar with them &mdash; though I am sure he is &mdash; perhaps he would have his officials extract that information for him and examine it in the preparation of the further legislation he has in the pipeline in this area.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I will give the Minister copies if he wishes.  It is my view and that of many people that the only institutions that have not contributed to this State during the recession were the banks.  Yet the Government and the Minister left the banks sweating for only one short week before helping them out generously in their cirsis with the ICI.  Therefore, it is only right and fair that the matter of personal guarantees be examined thoroughly. Many people who are concerned about this form of legislation and the effects it will have on employees are employees and those people would thank the Minister and us if we were to ease the pressure on small businesses of that unnecessary, crippling burden in the case of lending and if we were to copy the form of lending that takes place in, for example, the North American market.  I do not see why we must be beholden all the time to banks.  We saw their attitude when the farmers had their backs to the wall and their attitude this year when they decided arbitrarily to put a 3 per cent levy on small businesses.  They are not helping small businesses to operate and this form of legislation does not help either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject of delinquent directors comes up frequently, and I reiterate Deputy Yates's remark that we should be careful not to turn this into a witch hunt because if we follow that line to its natural conclusion we will close down business altogether.  The incentives for the private sector are pathetic at the moment.  Yet more and more pressure is being exerted on that sector and they do not believe that they can withstand much <Col N="1742" /> more of it.  Nobody advocates that people should be let away with breaking the law or with collapsing companies and running off and setting up again, but there is a limit.  There is not enough understanding of the pressures that business people are under to go into business in the first place and then stay in it.  I ask the Minister to take account of those difficulties and hardships.  In the future legislation he intends to bring in it would be helpful if people had some indication of what is to come so that, considering the huge number of amendments he said were suggested in the case of Britain, we could all give it careful consideration.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account the pressures on business here caused by the peculiar hardships and difficulties that exist in Ireland.  For example, consider the &ldquo;cannot get paid&rdquo; syndrome.  Ireland is a notoriously bad place to be paid for services rendered.  The first airplane into Dublin from London every Monday morning is full of debt collectors.  In business it is almost impossible to survive because people do not pay without being hounded and chased and that makes it difficult to run a business and to have cut off points.  Some people here have a simplistic attitude towards business and seem to believe that every business takes in money and splits the profit, the wages, VAT, PAYE and even PRSI and puts them into separate compartments and that, at any given time, that business can close the door.  They do not seem to take into consideration the ongoing situation with business, the bank overdraft, depending on creditors to pay their bills in order that the business may survive, and all the complicated links that go into business.  It seems to them in many cases that directors and people running businesses are deliberately hoodwinking them, or closing down, or negligently letting their businesses go to the wall.</P>
    <P>A combination of factors and very often extreme pressures cause businesses to collapse.  Not many people here realise that in ten or 12 years 95 per cent of businesses fail, and not just in one sector. If we bring in directives which penalise businesses so much, and have taxes on <Col N="1743" /> businesses which penalise them also, and if we are to have a form of disclosure which enables creditors to stop giving credit and competitors to seek weak links, which enables banks &mdash; who would have certain information anyhow &mdash; and other individuals to take unfair advantage of a business, inevitably we will have many closures.  In the long term if we had a very strong, healthy, totally capitalistic economy, that could work, but in the kind of mixed society and mixed economy we have where the State is very fatherly towards its citizens, and we have a very large public sector as well as a small private sector, that kind of thing does not work.  Under those circumstances employers would be very nervous and, unless they were very robust, they would be quick to pull down the shutters.  I do not see too many businesses surviving if we have full disclosure.</P>
    <P>This is linked to the fact that we have not really got a work ethic, and that makes it doubly dangerous.  We should not be taking directives from the EC which, in the main has a work ethic in countries like Germany and France.  If we had a work ethic we could see ourselves getting out of the problems we are in, in the space of another generation.  At the moment this country needs a whole generation to work for Ireland, and that whole generation is out there in the form of young people and we need massive investment in order to achieve what I have said.  Here we are depending on small business to get us out of that dilemma.</P>
    <P>In the past couple of years in particular, the IDA have concentrated on the small business area.  They were remiss in not doing so a few years before that and in concentrating too much on multinationals and very big industries and trying to attract them to the country, whereas America and Britain were concentrating heavily on small business.  We know the effect of the collapse of multinationals and particularly the haemorrhaging effect it can have on rural or small urban areas.  In an area like Dublin the overall effect might not be seen when people <Col N="1744" /> come from all over the city to work in such plants and premises.  It would be seen in Deputy Collins's constituency. For instance, Ferenka caused a haemorrhaging effect in that part of the country. Latterly the IDA have woken up and, luckily, they can draw money down from the State and can cover up the cracks and their mistakes.  They flew to radio and television and spent a great deal of money advertising and marketing and every day we are hearing about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Irish people are very circuitous, to say the least, and like keeping things close to their chests.  The only thing one is not allowed in Ireland is success. If one links the general begrudging attitude of people towards success to disclosure of information, such as is proposed in the directive, then one has a very lethal weapon which will bring down a lot of companies.  This also militates against a good characteristic in the Irish make-up, flair.  The provisions will kill the flair.  It must be remembered that flair in business is an absolute necessity particularly in regard to sales, stamina, and surviving. Many people hold the view that a business is either profitable or not and that a business person should be able to see well ahead of time when to get out.  They feel that if a person in business sees any difficulty ahead he or she should jump out, pay everybody and not start again for at least five years.  It does not work like that.</P>
      <P>I have a number of reservations about the Bill which I will deal with on Committee Stage.  I do not like the ministerial order feature coming into Bills.  The Minister is reserving to himself the right to alter or add to the provisions of the Bill without having to obtain the approval of the House.  That is a dangerous road to be going down.  I asked if this Minister was responsible for this and his response was that it was introduced in a 1963 Act. I have noticed similar provisions in legislation in recent times and I consider that a dangerous departure.  If we had a Minister who was not in control of his Department, a weak Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Or if we had a Fianna Fáil Minister, or a Minister of any political persuasion in charge of the Department, who was not on top of his work we could have directives to introduce this and that order at the behest of civil servants.  In effect it would mean the handing over of the functions of the House to civil servants. I do not mean any disrespect to civil servants but they are not in business. <Col N="1746" /> The whole point about people who are pressing for change in the business area, who want total disclosure, directors put in jail and more employee participation is that they do not know what it is like to try to build and survive in business.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds described the directive as a bit of bureaucratic nonsense.  I believe there should be some disclosure because there are a lot of chancers, fly-by-nights, in the business world.  Such people are bad for the confidence in any community and there should be no room for them.  Such business would be stopped if we had a certain amount of legitimate dislosure.  I do not think people deliberately mean to be vindictive.  I do not think they realise the consequences of having witchhunts and introducing the regulations some Members have suggested. Most people in business are genuine and reasonable people who work extraordinarily hard.  Most of the population do not have the type of incentive needed to get on in business and prefer to work for somebody else but the small percentage who are prepared to go out on a limb and get involved in a business must be encouraged by the State and not hampered. Failure here is all right but success is not.  A person who fails in business should not be criminalised.  There should be room for second starts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but my comment is relevant in that we are introducing a provision to insist on the disclosure of information, something that has not occurred to date.  My point is that it does not suit the Irish business world, the Irish personality.  We have very restrictive and mean money lenders here.  The banks are very shy about giving out money and want personal guarantees before they loan a penny.  As somebody said, they want one's blood in a bottle before they will loan money.  In that type of climate the disclosure of information will militate against the businessman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other ways of protecting <Col N="1747" /> employees and I accept that they should have as much protection as possible.  Protection can be given through insurance, savings and so on.  I shall put suggestions in regard to that to the Minister when he introduces the other legislation.  However, certain pressures will come about when the directive is put into operation. Small businesses here generally are poor and survive because the people involved put an enormous amount of time and energy into them.  The provisions of the directive will militate in the area of reselling and in the area of building up some wealth.  A small business needs time to build up wealth because the profits are small.  It will not be easy to build up wealth if companies are liable to disclose certain information.  One learns many intangible things when one should not disclose information.  The directive will remove the opportunity to withhold information until the time is right.</P>
    <P>The free economies are doing well at present such as those in Japan and the US.  It is difficult for a small business to get off the ground and even more difficult to stay in business.  From now on it will be very difficult to sell.  What may happen as a result of this directive is that thousands of small businesses, and their owners, will be sentenced to a life of drudgery and disadvantage.  We could unwittingly be locking them into a situation from which they could never get out.  Most people go into business for a given number of years, five or ten or perhaps 15 years; but this is a retrograde step.  People may have to work up to their seventies and die in the business, through not being able to sell out and move on. We are taking a leap in the dark.</P>

      <P>It is restrictive to ask for disclosures.  Much business operates in a secretive manner.  Those involved keep their cards close to their chests and do not disclose everything to the public, their <Col N="1748" /> competitors, their banks, or their employees.  Disclosure being restrictive, the chances of expansion are very limited, profitability is adversely affected and the chances of starting ancillary businesses will be small.  They will not have the same flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not take me up wrongly, but I understand why he does not follow.  If he were running multiple small businesses, he would understand.  In this country we did not have a tradition of industry or business and had to learn fast.  The opportunities at present are very restrictive.  We are going through a recession and because of the country's debts a huge burden has been placed on businesses.  It is being made very difficult to survive and often people are surviving in business by their wits.  One cannot take that into account in a Bill, which is why a Bill can be restrictive.  I do not know if it was the intention of the Government to delay this Bill for five years and wonder why it is being put into operation now.  If this country wants to invest heavily in small businesses, it will have to give these businesses the maximum flexibility.  That is the point I am trying to make.</P>

      <P>It is really a measure of the lack of understanding on the part of those who for the protection of employees will unwittingly destroy businesses.  It is a measure of the lack of understanding among people running small businesses that legislation is being brought in which will make it difficult for them to survive. It would give an unfair advantage to big companies over small companies.  They will have the financial muscle and be able to flatten and take advantage of small companies.  They can move into the areas which have been pioneered by small companies and run them out of business. They will see their weaknesses by disclosure, which is very important.  If one specialises in a certain area and has expertise, one can pick out those areas and destroy companies, go in temporarily, undercut them and run them out. We should be encouraging small businesses. We must get up off our knees. This country has suffered enough at the hands of uncaring multinationals who came in for the grants that they could get and because of the laxity of our laws in certain areas such as drugs and chemicals. This Bill restricts the room for flair.  It is using a sledge hammer on the small business area whose turnover, £1.5 million, is very small and the number of employees is limited to 50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no advantages for the small business registering under this type of directive.  On Committee Stage, I should like to go into this in great detail.  However, we should put down markers now. As Deputy Reynolds has said, we should not easily without putting up a fight accept EC directives which may damage our economy.  If they do not suit our economy, we should resist them, or seek concessions. I have no doubt that larger countries would resist.  For example, the United States always puts its economy first, no matter how small the country with which it is dealing.  It puts first the <Col N="1750" /> benefit of its entrepreneurs and businessmen. Germany and France have done so also and I draw attention to these matters. I do not welcome the Bill.  This directive is foisting it on us.  I ask the Minister to remove altogether the ministerial order from the Bill.  He should certainly remove the requirement of disclosure of the business turnover.  I do not know if it is possible at this stage, but he should have a look at the format before Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out by the Minister in introducing this Bill and as indicated in the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Fourth EC Company Law Directive and, in effect, to harmonise the laws in respect of disclosures, especially the manner of accounting, of both public and private companies.  In the first instance I want to acknowledge that the Minister in presenting the Bill in the present form has availed of all such facilities and exemptions as can be applied within the meaning of the Directive. However, let me say that harmonisation of laws as proposed in this directive is harmonising as if the companies throughout the European Community, be they small, medium or large, are all operating on the same base, with the same advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express now, as strongly as possible, a personal view based on experience within the European Community and also experience of the impact of harmonisation on the economies of the member states.  Quite frankly, there has been far too much harmonisation of laws and far too little harmonisation of the economic climate of the member states. The European Community, and in particular the Commission, which operates to a considerable extent in isolation from the reality of the commercial place, are now hell bent on giving the impression of progress towards the aims of the European Community by a series of directives and regulations that require the same legal obligations throughout the Community, without having regard to the commercial realities of the member <Col N="1751" /> states.  If we in the European Community were really interested in bringing about a healthier, fairer and better climate for the operations of our corporations, be they public or private, then the European Community, which now requires us to pass this law into domestic legislation, would be doing much more about the economic climate in respect of which this harmonisation is being imposed.</P>
    <P>Let me point to four or five simple facts which must be stated publicly as a strong criticism of the failure of the EC in this area.  Why is it that in the past five years the economic progress of countries outside the Community &mdash; countries such as Austria, Norway, Finland and Switzerland &mdash; has far outstripped that of the member states, measured either against the best, which is the Federal Republic of Germany, or any of the rest, let it be Ireland.  By any criteria one wants to apply in terms of employment, profitability of corporations or growth in the economy, the reality is that these countries outside the European Community who are not subject to harmonisation, regulation, control and direction of the Commission and the administrative machinery of the Community, have benefited much more than those of us who have apparently been subject to the benefits of the EC.  Far too much time and effort have been spent on administrative regulations, directives harmonisation proposals and far too little time has been spent on actually implementing the most basic document of all, the Treaty of Rome, together with all that it demands and requires of the member states and of the institutions of the Community, the Commission and the Council.  It is clear from even the most casual reading of the Treaty of Rome and subsequent treaties that the actions of member states and the institutions in recent times have gone quite the other way.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is forced to introduce this legislation because of the determination to harmonise within the Community.  These kinds of actions forced on member states will in the long run prove damaging to member states in <Col N="1752" /> our condition who have not the same degree of economic development as some of the other states.  Far from eliminating regional imbalances, these actions will do quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>Regulations of this kind seem to assume that we are all at the same stage of economic development.  We are not. There is a great difference between the circumstances of the small and medium-sized companies in Ireland and those in the Federal Republic of Germany, for example.  If we look at the trend in liquidations of companies in the past five years we will see a vast difference between the experience here and that of our partners in the EC and an even greater difference between our experience and that of non-EC members.</P>
    <P>The laws and company structures are different in many countries to those which obtain here.  The concept of partnership, for instance, is widely used in the Federal Republic in a way it is not used here.  The provisions of this directive may not be applied in many cases to enterprises in the Federal Republic which are very much greater in terms of shareholding, employment and profitability than the industries here.  Nevertheless, we are being asked to harmonise as if the base of our law was in every way the same, as if the nature of the enterprise and the legal structure of it were the same.</P>
    <P>This is an occasion when all of us, particularly the Government in the course of consultations in the European Community, should proclaim loud and clear that we will support harmonisation provided the European Community supports the most basic harmonisation of all, namely, the harmonisation of standards of living in member states, the elimination of regional imbalances and the utilisation of agencies and instruments of the EC at every opportunity to improve living and working conditions of people in the member states.</P>
    <P>We have in this city an institution of the Community concerned with living and working conditions of people within the EC but it has no teeth, no effect, because <Col N="1753" /> the actions of the Community, particularly the Commission and the Council of Ministers, show no concern for the most basic aspect of living &mdash; the right to work and the right to have constant secure employment.</P>
    <P>We should tell our Community partners that this kind of harmonisation without the rest is unacceptable not just to us but in terms of the obligations of membership of the European Community and of the Treaty of Rome.  I am sure the Minister will welcome the support of this side of the House in giving this message in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to an anomaly or a contradiction of the obligations of the European Community.  Certain branches of multinationals &mdash; namely, the subsidiaries here of multinationals in France or the Netherlands &mdash; will not be covered by the requirements of this legislation and the fourth Directive because they are branches of a parent company.  Some of these branches far exceed even in their subsidiary activity the scope of some of our major companies.  By excluding branches of multinationals from these requirements because the parent companies are based outside this country, we exempt them from the requirements of disclosure under this legislation, while imposing obligations on our own companies. The least we should be concerned about is to ensure that domestic indigenous companies should not be at a disadvantage against the branches of multinational companies operating here. The future is at least as much based on the health and vigour of our domestic enterprises as it is on the attraction of branches of foreign enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the primary purposes of this Bill is to end a very blatant piece of discrimination against women which exists at present.  It will also effect a general reform of the international aspects of Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, will update our law in this area and make it better, more simple and easy to understand. The provisions of this Bill conform in general with proposals made by the Law Reform <Col N="1755" /> Commission and the action it proposes has been called for by many organisations and private citizens.</P>
    <P>The general reform proposed is to abolish domicile as the basis for deciding which legal system will apply to an individual in cases where the individual may be subject to one or more different legal systems and to substitute in its place the test of habitual residence.</P>
    <P>The discrimination against women which this Bill will eliminate arises from the concept of the dependent domicile of married women.  As our law stands, a man is free to acquire a domicile of his own choice but the domicile of every married woman is automatically that of her husband.  A married woman cannot change her domicile of her own volition and if her husband changes his domicile then he will automatically effect a change in her domicile as well.  The married woman, in effect, has no say in the matter at all.</P>
    <P>In our view the time has come for positive action and accordingly we have prepared this legislation, The Conflict of Laws Reform Bill, 1985, which we are now proposing should be enacted by the Oireachtas.  After the Second Stage the Bill will be available for consideration by all interested parties and we will welcome comments on the proposals it contains.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; is an artificial legal concept but it is of considerable importance in a number of areas of law.  It constitutes a &ldquo;connecting factor&rdquo; or link between a person and legal system that will apply to him or her in a specific context.  It determines the &ldquo;personal law&rdquo; of the individual and determines which legal system is to be applied in his or her case as regards:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (1)  Validity of marriage;</P>
    <P>(2)  Matrimonial causes, including jurisdiction in and recognition of foreign divorces, legal separations, nullity decrees;</P>
    <P>(3)  Legitimacy, legitimation and adoption;</P>
    <P>(4)  Succession to moveable property, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> (5)  Taxation.  </P>
    <P>There are several types of domicile. First, there is the domicile of origin. Every person acquires at birth a domicile of origin.  If a person is legitimate, he or she acquires the domicile of the father and otherwise that of the mother.  Secondly, there is domicile of choice.  Every male and unmarried female of full age is free to acquire a new domicile of choice in substitution for their existing domicile.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is domicile of dependency. This form of domicile arises in a number of ways, the best known of which is the dependent domicile of the wife to which I already referred.  This means that when a women marries, she automatically loses her existing domicile and acquires a domicile of dependency which is that of her husband.  Even if both domiciles are the same and her domicile is, therefore, not changed by her marriage, she is henceforth treated as having a domicile by dependency on her husband rather than by reason of the basis, i.e., origin or choice, on which she previously had it.</P>
    <P>A domicile of dependency also exists in the cases of unmarried minors.  An unmarried minor cannot alter his or her domicile of origin of his or her own volition. However, if the parent from whom the minor acquired the domicile of origin changes his or her domicile then the minor's domicile also changes accordingly. Mentally disordered persons also have domiciles of dependency and are incapable of changing their domicile of their own volition.</P>
    <P>In basic terms, the domicile of a person is the country where that person intends to reside permanently or at least indefinitely. It is a highly artificial concept as it is determined exclusively by reference to the intentions of the person regardless of how unrealistic those intentions might be.  The factual aspects of the person's life are merely taken into account in order to establish the person's intentions.  Thus, family history, where he or she resides, <Col N="1757" /> career or business activities, social interests and history are not treated as significant in themselves but are merely regarded as an indication of intentions.</P>
    <P>Every person has at any given time one, and only one, domicile.  In litigation where domicile is at issue, there is presumption in favour of the continuance of an existing domicile and the onus of proof lies on the party alleging a change.  The standard of proof required to establish a change is higher if one is seeking to displace the domicile of origin than a domicile of choice.  If a person abandons his or her domicile of choice without acquiring another domicile, then his domicile of origin is revised.</P>
    <P>The present law has been criticised on many grounds.  Because of its artificial nature, domicile often involves expensive and protracted litigation to determine.  It is also a complicated concept not readily understood by lawyers, let alone the public.</P>
    <P>The dependent domicile of the married woman was once described by an English Judge as &ldquo;the last barbarous relic of a wife's servitude&rdquo;.  Apart from the blatant denial of equality involved, the present situation can result in serious practical problems for married women.  For example, a foreign divorce is only recognised here if it was obtained in the country of domicile of the husband.  This means that if an Irish husband deserts his wife, goes to live in England, where he can readily obtain a divorce, establishes an English domicile and then divorces his wife, that divorce will be recognised here whether or not the wife was even consulted.</P>
    <P>Such a wife would lose her right to maintenance and succession.  If, however, that husband retained his Irish domicile and obtained a divorce in England based on his residence there, then the divorce would not be recognised here even if the wife had consented.  In this latter case, the wife, under Irish law, would continue to retain the domicile of the husband, even if she never saw him again, and she would be regarded as incapable of acquiring a domicile of her own choice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> It should also be noted that, as a consequence of this basic discrimination, the domicile of the children of a married couple is always that of the father.  This is the case where a wife and child are deserted by the husband before the child is even born.  It remains the case even though a wife and children might never have visited, let alone resided in, the country of domicile of the husband.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the present law are also undesirable.  For example, there is no logical basis for the rule that the domicile of origin is revived upon losing domicile of choice without acquiring another one.  A person who had abandoned his or her domicile of choice without acquiring another domicile of choice might well intend never to return to the country of the domicile of origin and yet that domicile would revive in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, most western countries have abandoned domicile as a connecting factor and this is reflected in various international conventions.</P>
    <P>On 17 September 1981, the Law Reform Commission produced a working paper entitled &ldquo;Domicile and Habitual Residence as Connecting Factors in the Conflict of Laws&rdquo;.  In that paper, the commission produced a detailed examination of the basis for selecting the appropriate legal system to apply to any case where more than one such system could be applicable.  The commission suggested that domicile be replaced in Irish law by habitual residence.  Having invited submissions from interested parties, the commission repeated this view in their final report on the subject which was transmitted to the Government on 14 December 1983.</P>
    <P>In selecting &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo; as the test to replace &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; the commission had considered but decided against using &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; as the new test.  In doing so, we feel that the commission were correct.  It is true that a person's nationality is usually easy to establish but there are several arguments against nationality as the appropriate test.  Specifically, a person will always have a real connection with the place <Col N="1759" /> where he or she intends to reside indefinitely or reside habitually.  A person might not have any real connection with the country of his nationality.  Furthermore, a person can only have one domicile or, by definition, habitually reside in only one country but could have dual nationality.</P>
    <P>In addition, the concept of nationality does not take into account federal structures and would not be sufficiently particular to deal with the cases of nationals of political entities comprising several States with different laws, the United States of America being an obvious example.</P>
    <P>We also feel that the commission were correct in their decision to select habitual residence as the appropriate test.  It is the concept adopted by most international conventions.  To ascertain a person's habitual residence involves a much simpler inquiry than to establish domicile. The habitual residence of a person is a factual matter whereas his domicile is purely a legal concept.</P>
    <P>The test of habitual residence is also desirable as it does not involve any concept similar to domicile of dependency. The replacement of domicile by habitual residence as the appropriate test or, as lawyers say, &ldquo;connecting factor&rdquo;, would, therefore, end the discrimination against women to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that habitual residence has already been adopted as a connecting factor in Irish legislation, in a limited way, in Part 8 of the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main implications of the reform proposed in this Bill.  The most significant implication is that this reform will necessitate changes as regards the basis on which foreign divorces are recognised under Irish law.  As the domicile of dependency of the married woman, which this Bill will abolish, ensures that both spouses are always domiciled in the same country, and also that dual domicile is the only basis on which foreign divorces are now recognised, the fact that a wife is now to be capable of habitually residing in a country <Col N="1760" /> different from that in which her husband habitually resides means that new criteria for the recognition under Irish law of foreign divorces are required.  Most western countries subscribed to The Hague Convention on the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations and it is desirable that in so far as it is compatible with our own domestic law we subscribe to the principles laid down in that international convention.</P>
    <P>This whole area was also considered by the Law Reform Commission in their working paper entitled &ldquo;Recognition of Foreign Divorces and Legal Separations&rdquo; No. 11 of 1984.  A similarly entitled final report &mdash; No. 10 of 1985 &mdash; was transmitted by the commission to the Government on 17 April 1985.</P>
    <P>Here let me interject something I did not have the opportunity of saying today, namely, that the reports of the Law Reform Commission that we got in our post this morning may be the last of such reports if this Government do not mend their ways.  I am sure the Chair will be interested to know that the remit of the members of the commission expired in October and since then nobody has been appointed to the commission.  We have now an empty shell as a commission. We have a statutory entity called the Law Reform Commission but there is nobody on it.  That is indicative of the attitude of this Government towards law reform.  In effect, they are prepared to let the Law Reform Commission negative themselves in this way.</P>
    <P>Basically, the commission proposed that as regards persons who do not have close connections with this country, the basis of recognition of foreign divorces ought to be that laid down in The Hague convention.  Section 12 of this Bill gives effect to that proposal.</P>
    <P>In cases involving Irish citizens however, the commission recommended a different rule.  If both parties were habitually resident in the country which granted the divorce, then obviously it should be recognised and paragraph (a) of section 11(1) of this Bill so provides.</P>
    <P>If, however, only one of the parties was so resident, then the divorce should <Col N="1761" /> be recognised only if the other party submitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign court.  It can hardly be disputed that if one spouse is resident in Ireland and the other spouse is resident in some foreign country then two legal systems are involved with equal claims to pre-eminence. There is, however, a primary obligation on this House to ensure the welfare of everybody residing in Ireland and, therefore, nobody residing in Ireland should be obliged to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court unless they so wish.  If, on the other hand, they wish to accept the jurisdiction of that foreign court then there is no good reason in such circumstances why they should not be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that this House should not enact legislation which could be perceived as encouraging the evasion of our domestic law.  Accordingly, foreign divorces obtained for the purpose of evading Irish law should not be recognised and a proposal to this effect is also contained in section 11.  The section, however, also contains a presumption, until the contrary is shown, that a foreign decree is not obtained for the purpose of evading domestic law.  I emphasise this because it is important.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this Bill is intended to give effect to the proposals of the Law Reform Commission contained in the two reports to which I have already referred.  We have sought, however, to improve upon the recommendations of the commission and feel that this Bill represents such an improvement is a number of respects.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the commission suggested that a person's habitual residence be determined having regard to the &ldquo;centre of his personal, social and economic interests&rdquo;. We feel that the word &ldquo;centre&rdquo; is somewhat vague and the &ldquo;centre&rdquo; of such interests might be difficult to establish.  It is even arguable that a person's personal, social and economic interests might be &ldquo;centred&rdquo; in more than one State.</P>
    <P>In section 5 of this Bill we propose an alternative formula, namely that habitual residence be determined having regard to the &ldquo;primary location&rdquo; of a person's <Col N="1762" />&ldquo;personal, family, social and economic interests&rdquo;.  Basically, we are substituting &ldquo;primary location&rdquo; for &ldquo;centre&rdquo; in that context.  We feel that it is desirable that the family interests be taken into account as well as his personal, social and economic interests.</P>
    <P>In their final report on recognition of foreign divorces and legal separations, the commission recommended that the new basis for recognition of such foreign decrees should apply only to divorces obtained after the coming into force of the new law.  There are arguments on both sides of this question but having considered the issue we disagree with the commission.  The argument against the commission's view in this respect was most succinctly expressed by the English and Scottish Law Commissions, when considering the same question, as follows: &ldquo;It would be both capricious and anomalous for the law to say that it would recognise a decree if granted today but not if granted tomorrow.&rdquo;  Of course, where the question of the validity of a decree has already been decided by the courts the matter should so stand.  Section 14 of the Bill so provides.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also intended to end other anomalies contained in the present law. With regard to adopted children, the commission found that &ldquo;the general view is that the domicile of origin of the child is that of his or her natural father or mother.&rdquo;  This represents a most unsatisfactory state of affairs as it undermines and runs contrary to the general policy of adoption which is to create a new parent-child relationship.  Section 6 (3) of this Bill would place adoptive parents in precisely the same position as natural parents for the purpose of determining the habitual residence of children.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also intended to clarify the position as regards the rights to maintenance, succession and financial assistance by the State of a married person resident in this country whose spouse has obtained a foreign divorce not recognised in this country.  Section 16 protects the rights of such spouses resident in this country.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in this Bill are long overdue.  It is unacceptable that such <Col N="1763" /> blatant discrimination against women should still exist under our law in 1985. It is regrettable that we have failed to keep our international law apace with modern developments and reforms.  It is unfortunate that until now we have been unable to subscribe to many international conventions.</P>
    <P>The primary obligation to legislate rests on the Government of the day, but I believe that it is also open to the Opposition to take initiatives in this area.  In preparing and introducing this Bill we are taking such an initiative.  It is hoped that the Government will see fit to assist us in ensuring the passage of this Bill, and I assure them that we will consider fully any proposals they might wish to make as regards any of the specific proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is widespread support for this piece of legislation.  I believe also that there is a pressing need for much more law reform.  There is a great deal that can be and should be done.  I sincerely hope that as regards law reform this House, to the greatest extent possible, can go forward in an objective, constructive and progressive way without regard to any party political considerations.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil wish to see every vestige of discrimination against Irish women that still exists in the Irish legal system removed so that women will have full and complete equality with men before the law.  We will direct our efforts consistently towards achieving that objective.</P>
    <P>This piece of legislation deals only with one area of the law but it is a particularly blatant instance of discrimination and the Bill represents not a major step, but a significant step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I could have followed the Deputy more easily if I had a copy of his speech.  The main purpose of the proposal before the House, which is to get rid of the domicile of dependency of married women and treat men and women equally in regard to domicile, is perhaps easy to comprehend but the concepts and issues involved are complicated and I wish to deal with the matter in some detail.</P>
      <P>The proposal revolves around domicile. This is a legal concept, some would say a rather artificial legal concept in some ways.  In very broad terms a person's domicile is where his permanent home is but that description conceals as much as it reveals, and the complexities may be illustrated by the fact that it has been said that essentially domicile is a state of mind.  Everybody acquires a domicile of origin at birth and that domicile remains with him until he changes it by going to another country with the intention of residing there permanently or indefinitely.  Under the existing law a married woman takes the domicile of her husband and this produces some rather odd effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a married woman may find herself domiciled in the country in which her husband was originally domiciled, in which she and her husband are not living, which she has not visited and which she may never visit.  Despite that, situations may arise in which her legal affairs may fall to be regulated by the laws of that country.  I may add that minor children and mentally disturbed persons <Col N="1765" /> are others to whom the law attributes a domicile of dependency.  There are, of course, obvious reasons why children and mentally disturbed persons are made the subject of a dependent domicile, but very few people would argue nowadays that it is appropriate that a married woman should be treated similarly.</P>
    <P>The purpose of domicile is to connect a person with a specific legal system.  This generally means a specific country, but since there are composite States which embrace within them different territorial units in which different systems of law apply, the connection will be with such a territorial unit.  One obvious example of such a composite State is the USA, in which each State represents a separate legal jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Connection with a specific legal system becomes important when people find themselves in situations in which they or their affairs have links with different countries and different legal systems.  It may then become necessary to determine which country's courts and laws are the appropriate courts and laws to regulate their legal status.  This can happen in many areas of the law, for example, taxation, succession, marriage, recognition of foreign court orders, etc.</P>
    <P>In the common law systems, domicile is the test commonly used to connect a person with his appropriate legal system, but there are other possible tests. Nationality is used in many countries, particularly civil law countries, and habitual residence is coming into greater use in the laws of many jurisdictions as the connecting factor in relation to specific areas of the law.  A concept of domicile is used in some civil law systems, but as used in those systems the concept is totally different from the common law concept and generally equates more with residence or habitual residence.  I may say that the concept of habitual residence already appears in our law in the Succession Act, 1965 &mdash; validity of a will as regards form &mdash; and in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973, in which it is used as a connecting factor in regard to criminal offences under that legislation.</P>
    <P>The matters dealt with in the Bill are <Col N="1766" /> all matters which have been the subject of working papers and reports of the Law Reform Commission.  In a working paper published in 1981 the Law Reform commission discussed and considered the relative merits of the various connecting factors that are used for the purposes of conflict of laws, that is, nationality, domicile and habitual residence.  After an extensive analysis they came down provisionally in favour of the replacement of domicile by habitual residence as a general connecting factor over the whole area of law, whereas heretofore domicile is the connecting factor used.  In a final report on the subject, while they were of opinion that neither domicile nor habitual residence afforded totally satisfactory solutions in every case, they reiterated their provisional conclusions. In addition, they drew up the general scheme of a Bill on the basis of their detailed recommendations and that general scheme was such as would enable this country to ratify the Hague Convention on the recognition of foreign divorces and legal separations.</P>
    <P>Any reform of our law of domicile could not fail to take account of that aspect of our law which I have referred to and which has caused so much comment and given rise to so much criticism in recent times &mdash; her domicile is deemed to be that of her husband even if the couple are separated and even if the wife had never lived in the husband's country of domicile and had no intention of doing so.  It is common cause with us all that that rule, however much it may be claimed to have been appropriate in the circumstances of the times when it was first formulated, is wholly out of tune with modern ideas.  In the colourful phrase of Lord Denning, already quoted by Deputy Haughey, it is the last barbarous relic of a wife's servitude.</P>
    <P>I may say that the question was not always seen in this fashion.  In a report published as recently as the middle fifties by the English Private International Law Committee, the conclusion reached was that the disadvantages of abolishing the wife's domicile of dependency outweighted the advantages, and the committee <Col N="1767" /> did not recommend abolition.  A subsequent committee took the other view and the position of married women was equated to men in regard to domicile in England in 1973.</P>
    <P>For the majority of women, of course, the matter does not create practical problems and most women, I would imagine, like most men also, probably live their lives unaware of the fact that there is something called domicile attributed to them by the law which will come into play in certain legal circumstances to govern their legal status.  Indeed, I understand that many people think that domicile means merely the ability to choose a place of residence and do not appreciate that, as I have explained, it is a technical and legal concept the purpose of which is not to determine where a person lives but to determine what laws will apply to a person's affairs.</P>
    <P>However, as I have mentioned there are circumstances in which the question of domicile becomes of critical importance. It is probably the case that with the greater mobility between countries of persons nowadays situations in which domicile becomes of importance are increasingly more likely to arise.</P>
    <P>One crucial area in which domicile plays a part relates to the question of recognition of foreign divorces.  The present rule of Irish law is commonly stated to be that a divorce obtained in a foreign country will be recognised by the Irish courts if it was obtained in the country where both spouses were domiciled at the date of institution of the proceedings. Since the domicile of the wife is deemed to be that of the husband the rule as stated would mean in practice that an Irish court will recognise a foreign divorce if granted in the country where the husband was domiciled.  But that is not the end of the matter.  There is a doubt, and I would suggest a very subtantial doubt, as to the constitutionality of that rule.  In the case of Gaffney v. Gaffney, Judge Walsh pointed out that it was &ldquo;possible that some day (the rule) may be challenged on constitutional grounds in a case in which the wife had <Col N="1768" /> never physically left her domicile of origin while her deserting husband may have established a domicile in another jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I may mention that there is some doubt also as to whether the rule of recognition I have quoted is complemented by another rule which was part of the common law when the State was founded and could therefore be said to have been carried forward into our law as being a law not inconsistent with the Constitution.  That is a rule that was laid down in the English 1906 case of Armitage v A.G. and was to the effect that a divorce would also be recognised if while not granted in the country of domicile, it would be recognised in that country.  That rule was laid down at a time when a married women in England still had the domicile of her husband so that in effect the rule meant that a divorce would be recognised if it was entitled to recognition in the husband's domicile.  The reason I say there is a doubt as to whether this rule is part of our law is simply that the specific point has not been raised and decided upon by an Irish court.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission were of course alive to the implications for the recognition of foreign divorces of their recommendations in regard to domicile and habitual residence.  They mentioned in their report on domicile, two views of what the law would be in the new situation where the domicile of dependency of married women had disappeared as a result of substituting habitural residence for domicile.</P>
    <P>On one view a foreign divorce would be recognised here only where both spouses were habitually resident in the foreign country.  On another view a lacuna would be left in the law as to recognition of foreign divorces because the present rule is premised on the suggestion that the husband and wife will always have a common domicile so that it could not be regarded as still applying in a situation where this supposition could no longer be made.</P>
    <P>The implications of this are that, once the domicile of dependency of a married women is abolished, something must be <Col N="1769" /> done also about the rules of recognition of foreign divorces.  In the absence of specific legislative provisions there would be no way short of expensive and longdrawn out litigation of establishing how an existing rule linked to the concept of a single domicile for the two parties would be applied or adapted in circumstances where husband and wife had, as the case may be, separate domiciles or separate habitual residence.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission were, as I have indicated, conscious of the close relationship between their proposals and the recognition of foreign divorces and accordingly embarked on an examination of what rules or recognition should apply in the new situation which would obtain if their basic recommendation to substitute habitual residence for domicile were accepted.  The fruits of that examination were a comprehensive working paper on the recognition of foreign divorces and legal separations, published in 1984, and a final report on the matter which reiterated the recommendations in their working paper and which was published earlier this year.  That report contains a comprehensive set of rules to henceforth govern the recognition of foreign divorces and legal separations, which with some modifications were based on the provisions of the Hague Convention on the recognition of foreign divorces and legal separations and would have the incidental effect of enabling that convention to be ratified by Ireland.</P>
    <P>The working papers and reports of the Law Reform Commission which I have mentioned are extremely detailed and comprehensive.  I should like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Government for the work which the commission have done in elucidating the various issues that are involved.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the whole matter which was of special concern to the Law Reform Commission and which must be of concern to all who came to consider and deal with the question.  That arises from the fact that the Constitution contains a prohibition against the enactment of any law providing for the dissolution of marriage.  This basic rule of our <Col N="1770" /> internal law has obvious implications in regard to any proposals for the recogition of foreign divorce.  Because of it, the commission considered that it would be very difficult to justify very liberal rules of recognition which would allow divorces obtained abroad by persons with close connections with Ireland to be recognised. To have such rules might well be held to be an attempt to circumvent the constitutional provision.  Because of this the commission proposed that special rules should apply in the case of persons with close connections with Ireland.  I venture to say that that appears to me to be the proper approach to adopt within our constitutional context at the moment if we are engaged in a fundamental restructuring and extension of the rules of recognition of foreign divorces, but that does not mean that there is not room for argument as to what test of close connection should be adopted.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is, as acknowledged by the sponsor of the Bill, closely modelled on the Law Reform Commission reports on domicile and habitual residence as connecting factors in the conflict of laws and on the recognition of foreign divorces and legal separation.</P>
    <P>Since we are opposing the Bill for reasons which I will explain, I do not intend to discuss it in any considerable detail but there are some general remarks I think I should make.  While it is, as I have indicated, modelled on the Law Reform Commission reports there are some important differences and there are aspects which would have to be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>The Bill would apply to decrees of nullity of marriage in the same way as it would apply of decrees of divorce.  There are very great differences between the considerations that arise in regard to the recognition of decrees annulling a marriage as compared with decrees of divorce and the matter is complicated by the fact that in the area of nullity there are void marriages which were never marriages from the very beginning and voidable marriages which can be voided on the application of a party to the marriage <Col N="1771" /> but which, until that happens, are valid subsisting marriages.</P>
    <P>It is of interest that the Law Reform Commission have recently published a report on jurisdiction in proceedings for nullity of marriage, recognition of foreign nullity decrees and the 1978 Hague Convention on the Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriage.  They regard that question of the recognition of foreign decrees of nullity of marriage as a difficult subject and they made detailed recommendations on what the rules of recognition should be.  This shows clearly that the subject of the nullity is a subject that must be dealt with separately from divorce.</P>
    <P>The Bill is silent as to its effects on taxation law.  Domicile is a concept that has relevance in that area and any change from domicile to hibitul residence would have serious implications for taxation law which would have to be fully identified and considered carefully.  It is not without significance that when changes in the law of domicile were mooted some years ago in Britain, they could not be proceeded with because of opposition from people, chiefly foreign businessmen in London who feared that their tax situation would be drastically changed.  Various committees which looked at the problem had great difficulty in suggesting solutions.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is a matter which was of special concern to the Law Reform Commission. They took the view, and as I have indicated they seem to me to be correct in taking that view, that because of the constitutional prohibition on the enactment of any law to provide for the dissolution of marriage, special rules should apply in relation to divorces obtained by persons closely connected with Ireland.  If very liberal rules were applied in these cases, they could be held to be a circumvention of the constitutional provision.  The commission were concerned at the possibility of attempts to evade these rules.</P>
    <P>The commission proposed that for recognition purposes a person should be regarded as habitually resident in the <Col N="1772" /> State who having been habitually residence here, has temporarily ceased to reside here and has acquired a temporarily residence abroad for the primary purpose of obtaining a foreign divorce. The purpose of that recommendation is to refuse recognition where the residence abroad is only a temporary residence acquired with evasive intent in order to obtain a foreign divorce for which recognition would be sought here.  The proposal envisaged that in those particular cases, that is, cases of persons with close connections with Ireland, an Irish court's concept of habitual residence, as thus elaborated on for divorce recognition purposes would if necessary take precedence over the concept of habitual residence employed by the foreign court for the purpose of founding its own divorce jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses itself to the question of persons with close connections with Ireland in section 11 and to the problem of evasion.  I cannot say that I find the approach in the Bill very satisfactory.  It provides that a person seeking recognition would have to show that the decree was not obtained for the purpose of evading the laws in force in the state of habitual residence.  I feel there would be very real problems in the practical application of that provision.</P>
    <P>Linked to that is a later provision under which a foreign court's finding concerning the domicile or habitual residence of a party would be binding on an Irish court subject to the provision about evasion I have mentioned.  This would run into the difficulties which I see as arising from the practical application of the evasion provision.  There is a great fear here of a back-door introduction of divorce legislation by a combination of sections 15 and 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole question of persons with close connections with Ireland would have to be looked at very carefully.  There are some objections which I see to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations also and the matter would have to be examined thoroughly.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions of the Bill that would require to be looked <Col N="1773" /> at closely.  I think it is fair to say that the sponsors of the Bill, to judge from their statements as reported in the newspapers, see the principal purpose and justification of their Bill as the elimination of discrimination against women, specifically the elimination of the domicile of dependency of married women and the creation of a situation where a married woman will have the same powers as a man, married or single, or as a single woman to determine by her own acts and intentions her own domicile.  As I have indicated already, that is a purpose with which the Government fully and totally agree.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which that purpose can be achieved.  One approach is to confine attention simply to the change that is desired and any necessary consequential changes.  This means that the rule whereby the domicile of dependency exists is simply abolished within the general concept of domicile, as it has always applied and which would be retained, and make changes in the rules of recognition limited to what is necessary to ensure that no lacuna is created in the law by abolition of the rule of dependency.  Another approach, which is that which the Law Reform Commission proposed and the Bill follows, is to tackle the question in a much wider context and to make the changes in the course of a fundamental review of the nature and scope of domicile as a connecting factor and of a fundamental restructuring of the whole recognition of foreign divorces.</P>
    <P>The Government, which have had the whole question of domicile, and in particular the domicile of dependency of married women, under consideration for some time, have decided that the first of these approaches is the course they wish to follow at this moment and will be circulating a Bill very shortly to give effect to their decision.  This Bill will be published tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Government Bill will remove from our law the rule that a married woman takes the domicile of her husband.  It will deal with some necessary consequential changes affecting children in cases where the spouses are living apart and with the <Col N="1774" /> position of a married woman who at the passing of the act is deemed to have the domicile of her husband.  It will also clarify the position in relation to the recognition of foreign divorces in the new situation but it will not include a wide extension of the rules of recognition.</P>
    <P>In effect, the Government measure will meet the demand for the removal of the discriminatory domicile of dependence rule and in doing that they will achieve what I have suggested is the principal purpose behind the Bill which is now before the House.</P>
    <P>The reason why the Government have chosen this course is simply that we do not regard the present time as opportune or appropriate to undertake a wide ranging review of the rules of recognition of foreign divorces.  As Deputies will be very much aware, the whole policy of the law in regard to divorce is undergoing debate at the moment and we as parliamentarians are in the course of settling the more fundamental question of what the attitude of our law should be in this important area in the light of increasing demands being made for change.  No one can say at the moment, because fundamentally the decision is one for the people to make, what the outcome of that debate will be or what will be the nature of the change, if change there must be.</P>
    <P>In that context it seems to the Government that it is inappropriate to consider making far-reaching changes in the rules of recognition of foreign divorces, which because of the constitutional provision must be regarded as a matter ultimately tied up with internal policy on divorce, and whether we should have more liberal rules of recognition is a matter with obvious implications for the basic attitude of the law towards divorce.  It seems to us that until final decisions are come in regard to our internal law we should not concern ourselves with changes in the rules of recognition of foreign divorces beyond those changes which I have already pointed out must follow as a consequence of the abolition of the domicile of dependency.</P>
    <P>Any more fundamental and extensive <Col N="1775" /> changes made now would have to be such as to reflect the present constitutional context within which they would operate and would almost certainly have to be looked at afresh if the constitutional context came to be changed.  In these circumstances the Government think that the wisest course is to limit the changes to be made in the rules or recognition of foreign divorces to those changes which, as I have already explained, must unavoidably be made once the domicile of dependency is abolished.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that this does not mean that the Government have rejected the recommendations in the two reports of the Law Reform Commission which largely form the basis of the Bill before the House.  For the reason I have given, the general question of replacing domicile by habitual residence as a general connecting factor in our rules of private international law, and of rewriting our rules of recognition of foreign divorces and legal separation on a wider and extensive basis and in a way which would permit ratification of The Hague Convention on the subject, is being left for another day and will be taken up when we have settled, one way or another, the policy on whether divorce should be made available here.  The principal purpose of the Government Bill is to eliminate the domicile of dependency of married women and will not enable The Hague Convention to be ratified.  We will look at that later.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear already, we are opposing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout his speech the Minister said he would be bringing in the Government's Bill tomorrow and he told us the line it would take. Why spend six hours debating this Bill when we will be having the same debate on the Government's Bill tomorrow?  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this because there appears to be a more natural way to go about ordering business than the contrived way the Government have set about taking this debate.  I understand that the word has <Col N="1776" /> gone out from the Government parties that we moved on this Bill only in the last six weeks when we heard the Government were introducing their Bill.  We do not want to say this is our Bill and that that is the Government's Bill, because that is very childish, but we brought forward our Bill because this very necessary legislation needed to be introduced.  We wanted the areas of inequality in law as they affect women to be tackled first, and others would follow.  I want to put on the record an extract from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 29 July 1985.  This extract came from a speech I made.  I am not quoting from my own speech to get notice but to explain that Fianna Fáil, and in particular the women's committee, have had this measure in mind for quite some time.  The quotation reads:</P>
      <P>In conjunction with these conferences, a study research group has been set to examine areas in which the committee has identified legal discrimination against women.  These include the legal domicile of wives, still regarded as that of their husbands; the Married Property Act and the provision of preschool facilities for children.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear to the media and to the public that we took this initiative as far back as 1981.  Fianna Fáil in office then were conscious of this legal discrimination and were already making important moves to offset it.</P>
      <P>On Monday 7 October last <i>The Irish Press</i> reported on a national Fianna Fáil women's conference held in Cork on Saturday 5 October and said: under the headline &ldquo;Haughey Critical of Law on Domicile:&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A reform of the law on domicile should receive urgent priority, the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Haughey, told the party's women's conference in Cork on Saturday night.</P>
      <P>The current law of domicile &ldquo;obviously and blatantly discriminates against women.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both reports show that we were not Johnny come latelies in exploring this <Col N="1777" /> legislation.  I understand the Government indicated to the press today that we decided on this Bill when we heard their statement of five weeks ago.  That is not true.  We were very conscious that 1985 ends the UN declared decade to end discrimination against women.  This law of domicile for wives is one of the unresolved areas here.  Some weeks ago Deputy Taylor put a question to the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, asking her when this area of discrimination would be ended.  As we were concluding our research and getting our Bill ready for publication naturally I was interested and asked a supplementary and in reply was told that it would be some time before a Government Bill would be brought in.</P>
    <P>This law on domicile for wives was one of the reasons why Ireland could not sign the UN declared decade to end discrimination against women.  If we are to sign this declaration soon it will be because of the initiative taken by this party which has galvanised the Government to produce a Bill.  It should be a matter of agreement. The Government of the day should not say that we have snaffled their Bill because we have not.  The Minister gave tacit recognition to this tonight in the House when he said that the Government Bill is different from ours.</P>
    <P>In passing, I wish good health and recovery to the Minister of State and would ask the Minister for Justice to convey our good wishes to her, as we have heard that she has not been well.</P>
    <P>In the agenda for practical action which the Minister of State published some 12 months ago, she identified this as being an area of urgent priority.  I noticed that both Deputy Haughey and the Minister for Justice quoted Lord Denning in their speeches &mdash; a vivid and strong quotation, with which every woman would identify. In the words of Lord Denning, our law is the last barbarous relic of a wife's servitude. The very word &ldquo;dependency&rdquo; has connotations of servitude or of being property unable to express anything without the approval of the person deemed to be superior.</P>
    <P>When we set out our committee's objectives last July I received interesting <Col N="1778" /> correspondence from the Women's Political Association, various other groupings and other individuals who identified with this issue not because it would immediately affect them but because they identified with the psychological impact of the fact that one could be a dependent of one's spouse because of the nature of our domicile law.  Our law includes a concept of domicile which, as well as being complicated and based on an artificial legal concept often involving expensive and protracted litigation, discriminates against women in that when a woman marries she automatically loses her own domicile and acquires the domicile of dependency, that of her husband. Domicile determines which legal system is to be used in relation to taxation, succession to moveable property, legitimacy and adoption.</P>
    <P>The provisions made in our Bill in relation to adoption are very important. The absurdity of linking adopted children to their natural parents is obvious, when the thrust of adoption is to include the child in the new family and domicile him with that family.  I am glad we saw fit to put that provision in our Bill.  We also include provisions relating to validity of marriage, matrimonial causes including jurisdiction in the recognition of foreign divorces, legal separations, nullity decrees and so on.  Our Bill proposes to abolish the concept of domicile and replace it with habitual residence which will be determined by having regard to the primary location of one's personal family, social and economic interests.</P>
    <P>Habitual residence is the concept adopted by most international conventions and is much more simple to ascertain then domicile.  Most importantly, a married woman will have an habitual residence of her own which may or may not be the same as that of her husband.  Among other things our Bill will change the basis on which foreign divorces are recognised.  Under the present law if a husband deserts his wife and goes to reside in Britain and obtains an English divorce based on his new domicile, his wife has no choice but to accept <Col N="1779" /> the divorce even if she was never informed of the proceedings.  There is something very degrading about that set of circumstances.  Whilst the Minister's Bill purports to be simpler and to leave out any discussion of wider issues in relation to the recognition of foreign divorces&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and whilst the main thrust of the Bill is to remove the implied psychological discrimination against women, under our proposed legislation in such a case, as the wife will have her habitual residence in Ireland, she can if she wishes submit to the jurisdiction of the British court and accept that decree of divorce or she may refuse to do so and will then continue to be treated as a married woman under Irish law.  The most important thing is that the choice will be hers as to whether or not to agree.  The Minister said that this Bill will be circulated in the House tomorrow. Perhaps before the next speaker begins the Minister would let us know what he proposes.  If he is bringing his Bill in to the House tomorrow then what is to be the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> tomorrow evening's debate on our Bill and next week's debate on our Bill?  I understand there will be two evenings devoted to it again. We will be very pleased if we can continue debating our Bill, but only on the clear understanding that our Bill will then be put to a vote and will assume priority over the Minister's Bill.  Certainly, we would need to know that.  Otherwise, we are placed in the ridiculous position that we will have approximately six hours debate on our Bill, and presumably, either simultaneously or at another time, there will be perhaps a further six hours debate on the Minister's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage our Bill lends itself to discussion of various amendments. Before we ever knew the Minister was proposing to introduce his Bill, Deputy Haughey, on the Order of Business today and later when this debate <Col N="1780" /> commenced, asked if our Bill could be treated in this fashion.  We were not told exactly what was our position or what would happen.  In the light of the fact that the Government parties have decided to bring forward their Bill, perhaps the Minister would give us a clear answer, because it is a matter of great importance.</P>
    <P>I view the present legislative position on domicile as discriminatory against women.  There are so many areas of discrimination against women.  It is indeed sad if we, or any political party, cannot see fit to address these inequities.  If we do so we then move on to attack other inequities in law as they pertain to women.  There is much reporting of what is wrong with the status of women, of what is wrong in people's perceptions of their concern about women, about how people perceive women.  When one views the law of domicile at present in this country there is implicit in it a clear recognition that women are dependent on their husbands.  That element of dependency is one we seek to remove by way of the provisions of this Bill.  I recommend the Bill and hope it will receive favourable welcome from all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I might first welcome the fact that we are given an opportunity to discuss this issue.  I say that as someone who for many years is on record as seeking change in the law in this area.  I welcome the fact that we have some form of Bill before the House, albeit one I see as being grossly defective, one that is philosophically hide-bound into a supposition that the prohibition on divorce currently contained in the Constitution will remain forever more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the specifics of the Bill, like everyone in this House I recognise the need to get rid of the concept of the domicile of dependency of a married woman.  It never ceased to astound me for many years before my involvement in political life that previous Governments, going back to the 1960s and 1970s, never had the foresight, interest or commitment to tackle this area.  I welcome the newly discovered interest in this area on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party, who <Col N="1781" /> during their years in office never displayed the remotest commitment or desire to tackle this outdated legal concept. The concept of domicile and its anomalies have been well discussed by the Leader of the Opposition in his opening remarks, by the Minister for Justice, and Deputy O'Rourke also referred to some of them.  There are other anomalies that arise of a legally technical nature and into which I do not think there is any need to go at present.  My view would be that there is a need to reform this area. There is a need to abolish the concept of a wife's domicile of dependency.  I recognise also that there is a need to tackle the anomalies in the law as they relate to a child's dependent domicile <i>vis-à-vis</i> the father.  Apparently, when a marriage breaks down, a child, though residing with the mother, may under Irish law still retain a domicile dependent on a father with whom he may not be living and who may be living in a country that the child in its entire life has not visited.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there is a need to reform this area.  The Minister referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Gaffney and Gaffney, the 1975 Irish Reports, in which Mr. Justice Walsh indicated that, in his view, in an appropriate case the whole concept of a wife's domicile of dependency was open to constitutional objection.  It is interesting to note that in the ten years since that case and those remarks of Mr. Justice Walsh &mdash; who made an outstanding contribution to the development of constitutional jurisprudence in this country &mdash; there have been further cases dealing with this area that have come before our courts and in which the courts still adhered to the view that a wife's domicile of dependency remained.</P>
    <P>I am on record and have supported for many years the need for reform in this area.  I believe there is a need for reform in this area.  The Law Reform Commission in their report &mdash; circulated only yesterday &mdash; dealing both with domicile and recognition of foreign divorces and other related maters, have done us a service in reporting comprehensively on a very technical area of law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1782" /> As a general view I would also support the idea that we move from the concept of domicile as we have known it.  I do not care whether we call it habitual residence or simply call it domicile and redefine the meaning of the term &ldquo;domicile&rdquo;.  I do not think that matters greatly.  The Law Reform Commission talked about the need to adopt the concept of habitual residence.  I believe that is adoptable.  But if we adhere to using the term &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; and simply remove the anomalous nature of some of the rules relating to domicile, that would be equally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Where I take profound objection to this Bill, where the major problem with this Bill arises, is in the curious approach that is to be found in sections 11 and 12, an approach to Irish law that is not to be found in the jurisprudence of this country in any other legislation enacted by the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  It has been the practice of the Dáil and Seanad, acting as the two Houses of the Legislature, to enact laws that apply to people living in this country irrespective of the nationality except in the very particular area in relation to our electoral laws where we were constitutionally hide-bound but where we made a change recently to extend the possibility of the vote to British nationals and others residing in Ireland.  But, as a general proposition of our domestic law, we have always passed laws, be they laws relating to agriculture, industry, a wide variety of areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This legislation in so far as it applies to the area of divorce is seeking to provide a system of dual recognition of divorces and a liberal regime of recognition for any non-Irish citizen who has resided in this country no matter whether he has resided here for six months, six years or 60 years.  If I am a British national who has resided in Ireland for 30 years and I am married to an Irish citizen, because my wife as an Irish citizen can at any stage take up British nationality I will be party to a marriage that is potentially dissolvable, that can be dissolved by the English courts and the dissolution of which will be validly recognised in this country.  If as an Irish citizen I marry another Irish citizen I will not have the same freedom in the context of dissolving my marriage if is breaks down.</P>
      <P>I am not favouring one approach or the other at this moment, but I do not understand why in our domestic legislation we should provide a set of nationalistically discriminatory laws which seek to provide a wide freedom &mdash; maybe it is right that we provide that freedom &mdash; to all non-Irish citizens who are married.  It is a freedom that you could extend where an Irish citizen is married to an non-Irish citizen, a wide freedom to obtain foreign decrees of divorce which will be recognised domestically, and then you seek to provide a restrictive law which curtails extending a similar entitlement to people who are seeking a divorce in the context of Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very curious approach to adopt and the rationale behind it is related &mdash;<Col N="1784" /> and was related in the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; to the existence within our Constitution of the prohibition on the enactment of legislation to provide for divorce, but that prohibition in our Constitution currently applies domestically to anybody living in Ireland be he an Irish citizen or not.  That prohibition and the entire family provisions of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution have been interpreted by our courts as applying to both Irish nationals and non-nationals.</P>
    <P>If we look at this law in detail in the context of the constitutional protection as currently we have it extended to the family, it is arguable that providing a differing set of legal tests to determine the validity of foreign divorces to people residing within this jurisdiction, depending on nationality, this application of the law could in itself be unconstitutional. That issue was not even considered by the Law Reform Commission when they produced this type of approach, considering Article 41.32º which provides for the prohibition on dissolution of marriage. This provides discriminatory sets of laws to provide a different type of law to apply to different types of families depending on the national mix of those families.  We might have one set of laws applying to a couple who are British citizens who are married and may have lived in Ireland for 30 years, we might have a different set of laws applying to a couple, one British, one Irish, and a third applying to the couple both of whom are Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>I find it a very curious and odd approach.  It seems to be saying that we are willing to allow a freedom of a nature to non-Irish nationals living in Ireland that we will not extend to Irish nationals. It seems to suggest that we do not trust our own people not to run abroad to seek to obtain decrees of divorce.  It is what I would describe as a nod and wink method of gesturing towards Europe to say: &ldquo;We really recognise that marriages break down and we do not want to prevent French, German, Dutch and English couples whose marriages collapse and who are living in Ireland from getting some legal recognition of the collapse of <Col N="1785" /> their marriage.  We do not want to prevent them having the entitlement to remarry and enter into a new relationship. We are merely confining our own Irish nationals; we will keep them down; we will continue to ensure that they have not the same freedom when their marriages break down.  We will continue to refuse to recognise the reality of thousands of broken marriages within this State when both parties to those marriages are Irish citizens, but we will recognise where they are not both Irish citizens that their marriages have collapsed and will allow them freely to obtain foreign decrees of divorce&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The major objection I have to this Bill is the whole philosophical basis behind it.  Some years ago I wrote an article called, &ldquo;The mixed blessing of a wife's independent domicile&rdquo; which appeared in one of our daily papers before I was a member of any political party or involved in political life.  I am referring to it now because I would not like any Member of this House to think my attitude to this Bill is based on any party political motive. If this Bill were put together properly and dealt with this issue in the correct way and faced up to the issues properly, I would support it, but it does not.  &ldquo;The mixed blessing of a wife's independent domicile&rdquo; made the point that if you abolish a domicile of dependency without fully facing up to the consequences of that in the area of divorce recognition, then in the context of couples domiciled in Ireland you could curtail even further the situation in which we recognise foreign decrees of divorce than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the area relating to the effect this could have in the context of non-Irish citizens, I want to look at exactly what section 11 of this Bill imports in the context of Irish citizens. On its face it seems to provide &mdash; and does provide &mdash; a different recognition regime for divorces obtained by Irish nationals outside Ireland.  Much has been said about the current discriminatory practice that arises by virtue of a wife's domicile of dependency, and the illustration continually presented is that the <Col N="1786" /> wife who is a victim of the tyranny of the concept of domicile of dependence is always a wife who is left alone in Ireland, deserted by her husband, and that it is always the husband who wants to divorce the reluctant wife.  That is the picture that is painted, and we have the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; who, unfortunately, has now vacated his seat and I will not fill it for him as I did a couple of weeks ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was trying to make &mdash; I will make it for the third time because it is the nub of the Bill &mdash; is that the image that is most often presented in the context of a wife's domicile of dependency is that of a deserted wife <Col N="1788" /> whose husband obtains a divorce in England or elsewhere and leaves a wife in Ireland who does not wish to be divorced. I do not disagree that on occasions when that happens it should not happen and that a wife in that position needs protection. However, what is not fully appreciated is the reality of marital breakdown here.  The fact that our laws prohibit divorce has meant that the rules relating to a wife's domicile of dependency have in many cases where marriages have broken down, extended to the wife who has that dependent domicile the facility to obtain a firm decree of divorce in a foreign jurisdiction by relying on the fact that her domicile is dependent on that of her husband.  It has extended to her the possibility that many wives here wish to have, of getting a foreign decree of divorce which is recognised under our law.</P>
      <P>The domicile of dependency, which in many ways is outdated and in need of reform, has in a curious way provided assistance in some instances &mdash; I am not going to exaggerate this because in other instances it has presented a problem &mdash; to a wife to seek a legal remedy when her marriage in reality has ceased to exist.  It seems to me that the type of approach adopted in section 11 will have the effect of withholding recognition of many divorces that are currently recognised within our law.  It will have the effect of withholding recognition of divorces that are currently recognised and where both parties wish those divorces to be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most curious provision of the Bill is in section 11 &mdash; Deputy Haughey in his opening remarks referred to it and it may be what Deputy O'Rourke referred to as the Fianna Fáil stamp on the Bill &mdash; which effectively says that a foreign decree of divorce will not be recognised if obtained by a couple who are Irish citizens if it was obtained for the purpose of evading the laws in force at the material time in the State of the habitual residence of one of the spouses.  The effect of that is that the current law whereby a deserted wife whose husband goes to live permanently in England and who can herself petition <Col N="1789" /> the English courts and obtain a decree of divorce that would be recognised here will be overthrown.  The facility of obtaining a divorce that is currently available to that wife, one which is availed of by many wives who have found themselves in this position, will be removed from her.</P>
    <P>It is curious that this provision about the evading of the laws in force in this jurisdiction only applies to Irish citizens. We have now a dual system of recognition. We are providing a discriminatory code of law that applies different standards and practices to individuals depending on whether or not they are Irish citizens.  It is a system that I do not think can be supported or is supportable. It is one that will not resolve the problems created in the area of recognition of foreign divorces.  The major problem in this area which anybody who comes into contact with it will recognise is that of limping marriages, a problem created when a spouse permanently living in another country obtains a divorce, remains living in the country that recognises that divorce while another spouse &mdash; for example, a wife &mdash; remains living in a country in which the divorce is not recognised.</P>
    <P>The problem of limping marriages will not be resolved by this legislation.  The wife whose husband obtains an English divorce and who remains living in England and marries under English law may find herself in a legal position whereby Irish law will say to her that she is still married to her husband while English law will say that the husband is no longer husband to that wife but is married to a new one.  Irish law will hang in with the legal fiction that the woman living in Ireland is still married to a husband who has long since divorced her and is married to somebody else.  It affords a wife in that position no advantage if Irish law continues to refuse to recognise the divorce.  Where a husband is a national of another state Irish law will recognise the marriage because we have a dual system.</P>
    <P>The protection a wife in that position needs relates to the area of finance and <Col N="1790" /> support.  She needs to ensure that, if a divorce decree is granted to a husband who will never again live with her and may permanently remain living outside Ireland, she will be able to get decrees through the Irish courts if she is dependent for her support or the support of her children and to have the facility of enforcing them within the jurisdiction of the foreign courts.  The artificial approach of maintaining the fiction that her marriage continues to exist when it does not will not be of any assistance to her.</P>
    <P>Section 11 could not have another effect.  The Leader of the Opposition said it will be presumed, if a foreign decree is obtained where an Irish national is habitually resident in a foreign jurisdiction while the other spouse remains in Ireland, that it was not obtained for the purpose of evading the laws within this jurisdication.  Two problems are created by that.  Either we are serious about trying to prevent people evading laws, in which case what I said earlier applies, or we are not serious.  If we are not serious, why is this provision included?  If we are not serious, is section 11 designed to provide a facility for those who are wealthy enough to live in another country for a year or two in order to obtain a divorce that will be recognised?  What about those who cannot afford to go on foreign trips and take up employment abroad for a couple of years?  Are they to be deprived of the right to have their marriages dissolved here?  If we are not serious about this provision, is this the Irish solution to the Irish problem?  The provision of a recognisable foreign divorce is for those who are wealthy enough to be able to afford to go abroad to obtain a decree and deprive those whose marriages have collapsed and do not have that sort of funding of the possibility of having their marriages dissolved.  This provision builds into it an uncertainty as to the validity of marriages and foreign divorces that does not exist at present.  It will exacerbate what is a difficult and confusing area of the law for many people, an area which has a very profound and important impact on the lives of many people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> This also gives rise to another problem. If a couple do not wish to challenge the validity of a divorce under this provision it will be open to any other third person to challenge it.  It would create the possibility for the Revenue Comissioners to decide, if they objected to a particular foreign divorce being recognised, to rely on section 11 and, in the context of seeking to claim in the income tax area income tax payments, go to the courts to seek to upset the validity of a decree of divorce obtained outside Ireland where both spouses wished it to continue to exist.</P>

      <P>move:</P>
      <P>That paragraph 1 of the Orders of Reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, constituted pursuant to the Order of Dáil Éireann of 21st June, 1983, and the Order of Seanad Éireann of 29th June, 1983, be amended by the deletion of all words after &lsquo;Bodies&rsquo;) where it first occurs and the substitution therefor of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;to examine&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results, and</P>
      <P>(b) in the light of the reports published pursuant to sub-paragraph (a), the common issues relating to Board responsibility, structure and organisation, accountability and financing, together with the relationship with central Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>of State-Sponsored Bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities referred to in the Schedule hereto and to report thereon to both Houses of <Col N="1792" /> the Oireachtas and to make recommendations where appropriate.'. </P>
    <P>This motion broadens the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  At the moment essentially the committee look at each individual State body and make individual recommendations about these State bodies.  This is, of course, a very useful and practical activity.  It is an activity which has been conducted for quite some time now by the present and previous committees.  In the course of that work they have accumulated, in the view of the Government, a number of useful ideas about the general management of State bodies as a whole, as distinct from the particular recommendations that they made about the individual bodies on which they produced special reports.  That is why we are proposing in this motion to expand their terms of reference to allow them to examine the reports and accounts and overall operation results of bodies and, in the light of these reports, to examine also issues common to a variety of or more than one State body, relating to board responsibility, structure and organisation, accountability and financing, together with the relationship with central Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House follows on a commitment by the Government in the White Paper on Industrial Policy published last year to expand the orders of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies. This, in turn, is part of an overall desire by the Government that the commercial State bodies, which have been subject to growing criticism in recent years for a variety of reasons, should once again reestablish themselves as a source of commercial and entrepreneurial innovation in our industrial and economic development.</P>
    <P>In view of the diversity of their activities and the varying reasons for their incorporation into the State sector, in the first place, there is a need to devote serious attention to the development of a properly structured relationship between <Col N="1793" /> the State bodies and central Government.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the overall poor financial position of the commercial State bodies.  While these bodies have, like other sectors, felt the effects of recession and adverse cost movements, other factors, sometimes unique to State enterprises, have led to the present situation. Such factors, which are unique to State enterprise, identified in the White Paper, include:</P>
    <P> (1)  lack of clarity in objectives and confusion between commercial, social or strategic roles, particularly where questions of closures or cessation of operations arise;</P>
    <P>(2)  the imposition of non-commercial obligations or arbitary tax and price adjustments on products or services provided by State bodies;</P>
    <P>(3)  inadequate surveillance and control in relation to matters such as major capital projects and refinancing;</P>
    <P>(4)  an expectation by boards, management and employees that the Government would be obliged in practice to bail out various enterprises and honour their debts, and that market disciplines which apply to non-State owned companies would not apply;</P>
    <P>(5)  under-capitalisation and excessive reliance on guaranteed borrowing rather than equity; and</P>
    <P>(6)  lack of capacity to adapt quickly enough away from wrong product or market situations.  </P>
    <P>The White Paper detailed a number of measures, which have now been introduced, aimed at improving the commercial performance of the State bodies. Corporate planning has been introduced to ensure that the bodies become commercially oriented.  They have been directed to draw up five year rolling corporate plans in respect of their activities. These plans are designed to provide an outline of corporate objectives, the strategies which are being adopted and the <Col N="1794" /> detailed programmes to achieve these objectives.  In addition, projected profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, cash flow statements, production targets and cost reduction programmes will be required on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Central Government have improved the monitoring of the State bodies.  New reporting arrangements have been devised whereby the relevant Minister will regularly review the performance of each body with emphasis on financial and trading particulars, production levels and actual performance as against targets.</P>
    <P>Measures have been introduced to prevent a repeat of the cost overruns of recent years by more intensive monitoring and control of investments and a more systematic approach is being adopted in appraising capital projects.  In addition, improved project management techniques are being applied.  Appointments to boards of State companies will reflect the type of skills and expertise required by each body, and board members will also have their role and responsibilities more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>Essentially, we must achieve a balance between the legitimate freedom of the bodies to pursue their operations within a commercial framework and the control necessary to safeguard the interests of the public to whom they are ultimately responsible.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas has a legislative role relating to the formal establishment of nearly all of the commercial State-sponsored bodies and the Minister responsible are answerable to the Oireachtas for the overall policies and operations of the bodies.  The establishment of the first Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies in 1976 was one of the most significant developments in recent years as far as increased control and review of the commercial State-sponsored bodies by the Oireachtas were concerned. It heralded an increasing awareness on the part of the Houses of the Oireachtas of the activities of the State bodies.</P>
    <P>The original committee, which produced 18 reports on individual bodies before lapsing in 1981, played a very <Col N="1795" /> useful role in provoking both public and parliamentary interest and debate on the State-sponsored sector.  However, the terms of reference of that committee, as in the case of the present committee on commercial State-sponsored bodies, restricted the role of the committee to an examination of the past performance of State bodies.  Moreover, the committee had to concentrate on specific bodies, essentially on their activities and financial results.  Because of the terms of reference, very little attention was given to broader areas affecting the role of these bodies as a whole.</P>
    <P>As part of their general review of the commercial State bodies, the Government decided that the committee's mandate should be extended to enable the committee to bring their experience to bear in a more constructive manner.  The extended terms of reference as proposed by this motion, will empower the committee to examine the common issues relating to board responsibility, the structure and organisation, accountability and financing and relationship with central Government and the Oireachtas of the commercial State bodies.  While I would not like to pre-empt the committee in their new task, the fact that the Oireachtas establishes these bodies places on it the responsibility for ensuring that the founding legislation for these bodies is clear, concise and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for their work to date which, I believe, will be even more valuable and constructive with this extension to the committee's terms of reference. Accordingly, I commend these changes to the House.</P>

      <P>In so far as it goes, I do not think that anybody could object to the implementation of what the Minister is suggesting in the extension of the powers of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  In effect, his introductory speech is really a paraphrasing of section 11 of the industrial policy as published in July 1984.  The aims set out there as regards getting good <Col N="1796" /> value for funds invested in this type of operation are, of course, to be welcomed. It is justifiable that every effort should be made on the part of the Minister and his Department to get full value in difficult circumstances for the taxpayers' money which is invested in these State bodies. However, it would not be remiss at this time to make some comment as to how the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies have been functioning to date, and if the Minister's good wishes for the committee are fully justified in the outcome since the committee began to meet in 1983 and, indeed, since the original committee started making their reports back in 1976.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee since 1983 have been examining reports and accounts and operational results of some of the State-sponsored bodies named in the schedules.  I would have to ask the Minister if he is satisfied at this time that the published recommendations of that committee have had any real worthwhile bearing either on Government policy or on thinking in so far as investment is concerned.  The extraordinary thing is that even up to 1981 some 18 carefully compiled reports on various State-sponsored bodies were placed in the Library of the House, but I cannot remember any of these having been debated here.  That is a sad reflection on a committee of such standing as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  We are dealing with an enormous arm of Government expending enormous volumes of public finance in selected areas, yet the reports and recommendations are gathering dust in some Minister's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While one can express a wish that the committee should continue to look in depth at what is being done on our behalf, at the same time I wonder what the end result has been over the past few years. The Minister does not sound convincing. He could have insisted that these reports be placed on the agenda of the House but he has not chosen as yet to do anything about that.  Since he is changing the orders of reference to accommodate, as I understand it, section 11 (5) of his White <Col N="1797" /> Paper on Industrial Policy, the committee will be enabled to carry out a general review of commercial State-Sponsored bodies and will be empowered to deal with the common problems of commercial semi-State bodies in a global way. That is to be welcomed but I would suggest that these difficulties and problems encountered by these bodies have already been identified in his own document in section 11 (2) and they are reiterated in the Minister's contribution.  If he has already identified the problems, I fail to see why we are to have fresh orders to enable the committee to deal with them at great length.</P>
    <P>The Minister identifies the problem as lack of clarity of objectives, non-commercial obligations of commercial State companies, inadequate surveillance and the expection that Government will bail out the lame ducks who are not matching up to what would be regarded as normal market forces, as well as the under-capitalisation of these semi-State companies. These factors have all been identified in the past and I do not know whether it is necessary at this time to give fresh orders to the committee to carry out an in-depth investigation into common problems which bedevil them all.  The Minister's paper on industrial policy and his speech have outlined all these problems in a general way.  I cannot see that the work of the committee in the past few years has done anything to tackle any of the problems mentioned in the White Paper and reiterated in the Minister's speech.  The whole thing would seem to be some kind of charade.  The Minister talks about Dáil reform and one would have expected him to follow through on his own recommendations by giving the House on opportunity to discuss the recommendations which are already in a pigeon hole in his Department.</P>
    <P>I have been taking note of some of the reports emanating from this committee. A lot of newspaper headlines have been made by certain individuals to their own benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They were certainly out of context in criticising certain individuals for doing their best and for very small money &mdash; I refer now to some of the directors who are getting less than £800. They have come in for severe pasting by some of the more vocal members of the committee.  If they keep up that attitude towards people who have made their services available at virtually no cost and at much risk to their own reputations, we might end up not having such numbers of suitable people to go on State boards.</P>
      <P>I took particular note of reports recently which indicated the knocking of some civil servants who have attended and given evidence at the investigations. I take exception to civil servants and some of the people involved in semi-State bodies being ridiculed by the committee for policy decisions with which they had nothing to do.  It is not fair that this committee should continue on its way unchecked in making criticisms of individuals who are not responsible for enunciating the policy under which they operate.  Ministers take responsibility in that area and Ministers should answer for it.  I know the Minister present is not afraid to answer for anything but a certain amount of latitude has been given to this committee in making hard, knocking attacks on civil servants and directors who are not responsible for the difficulties which have arisen in some of these companies.  They cannot answer for the policies set down by Government and Ministers.  The Minister should monitor it and if he is satisfied, then he is the one who should have to answer for it. Certainly he should not leave the onus of responsibility on these defenceless individuals who, under their terms of appointment, cannot answer on policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fine indication of that point was the refusal of the Department of Energy to appear before this committee.  They threw down the gauntlet to the Minister and he did not pick it up.  Many other Departments and some Ministers did turn up and took whatever medicine was meted out to them.  The Department of Energy refused to send anybody to answer because they said they were not <Col N="1799" /> responsible for policy as enunciated by their Minister.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism did not insist on the Department of Energy sending in their troops and they turned their noses up at the committee.  I believe it was an answer to the sensational headline seekers that live on that committee, who have been making some little headway in enhancing their own reputations.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers in his speech to the future policies to be adopted by commercial semi-State bodies.  He lays great emphasis on adequate corporate planning by these entities.  They are to set down guidelines and budgets, give a better view of their objectives and production targets.  All of this is to be incorporated in a nice five-year corporate plan. What is the point in having a corporate plan if that plan is not available to the committee?  How can the committee make a proper assessment of what a semi-State body is about or going to be about if they have not access to the corporate plan?  What yardstick are they to use?  It is nonsense to ask the committee to carry out in-depth investigations into the common ailments of all these bodies when they are not being given an opportunity to look at these five-year corporate plans.</P>
    <P>We understand there has been an improvement in the monitoring by central Government of the effectiveness of some of these semi-State bodies.  The objectives were to be published and judgments made on the efficiency of these bodies.  I cannot remember the Minister ever publishing his objectives in regard to these bodies, what he thought of the efficiency of the objectives and how they were being maintained or attained.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to strengthening the boards of semi-State organisations. I understand that a Cabinet subcommittee were dealing with that, including the Minister's colleagues in Finance, Energy, Communications and Labour.  If that high powered Cabinet sub-committee have been dealing with the question of strengthening the boards of semi-State commercial enterprises, why then is there <Col N="1800" /> a need for all this waffle about ongoing monitoring?  The Government decide policy and they have been examining the appointments to make sure that only the finest and best &ldquo;Fine Gaelers&rdquo; will be appointed to these boards.  Since the Government took office on 14 December 1982, no Fianna Fáil man has been appointed to a board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not separate as I know well.  When people on a committee talk about appointments they also talk about the health of the organisations to which they are making the appointments.  With regard to the appraisal of capital projects, <Col N="1801" /> the Minister has certainly done something in that regard, he has made sure that they do not get any extra capital for anything they want to do.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that the Minister should publish the annual accounts of commercial State bodies within six months of the accounting period.  Could the Minister say how that is being complied with?  I heard the Minister and some of his colleagues promoting that line over a number of years and surely the one way in which politicians and others can have an in-depth look at the workings and efficiency of any commercial State body is to see their annual report and accounts? If the Minister could have the element of industrial policy as outlined in a document in July 1984 implemented he would be going down the road towards reform. Following that, if he arranged in his programme for Dáil reform to have those reports and the monitoring from both his Department and the Cabinet sub-committee discussed in the House we would all have an idea of how efficient commercial State bodies are.  However, that is not happening and while I obviously cannot oppose the change in the orders of references simply because it makes it possible for the committee to have a general look at the ailments affecting our commercial State bodies, at the same time I must remind the Minister that he already has that power.  He has isolated the ailments which affect them but he has done nothing about it in the last two years.  I am not satisfied that the committee have been doing anything apart from some individuals making hay in the publicity stakes.  Nothing has happened to the reports or the recommendations and I await the next step in the Dail reform process in regard to that matter.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Flynn on a very good speech.  It was up to his very best standards and I will try to deal with the points he made.  He probably thought that this motion would do much more than was intended and when it did not provide an answer to all the problems he <Col N="1802" /> was able to feign disappointment in a very eloquent fashion.  However, I will try to deal with the rather overblown pretensions which he has set for the committee.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the committee's terms of reference are simply being extended to facilitate them in making a general observation on State bodies as a whole if they want to.  We are not giving the committee this power because we insist that they must use it or because we insist that if they do not there will be dire consequences for the State sector.  It is simply a facility given to the committee which was omitted when the terms of reference were originally drawn up.  At that stage they were confined to making individual reports and prevented from making general observations.  That gap has been filled by this motion; it is nothing more grandiose than that.  While there is much validity in what Deputy Flynn said in general terms, the motion is not the place in which he should expect to find an answer to all the points he raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn made a valid point when he said that the reports of this committee have not, generally speaking, been debated in the House.  I admit that I am disappointed that we have not made more progress in providing time each week or every two weeks for debating reports. This does not apply only to committees of the House, if you look down the Order Paper any day you will see that 15 to 30 documents have been laid before the House under some statute or other.  They are supposed to be for our information and there is no procedure whereby these may be debated.  Obviously, 90 per cent of them are not worth debating because they are repetitive documents containing information which was presented last year or the year before that.  However, there is a case for providing an hour or two each week whereby Members could select some of these reports and debate them.  It could include reports of some of the committees of the House although not every report of every committee needs to be debated.  The report probably speaks for itself and an additional debate would not add all that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1803" /> The problem &mdash; I might as well admit it &mdash; is that the Government's legislative programme is fairly full at present and it is difficult to find time between the traditional sitting hours of 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays to 5 p.m. on Thursdays.  To provide additional time for debating reports we would have to extend the sitting week.  We have proposals in hand to extend the sitting week, at least on six Fridays, to include Private Members' Bills.  We could also extend the time to deal with some of these reports.  Of course, if the Government extend the time they are obliged to provide a quorum and we have seen the problems which have arisen in that regard in the recent debate, a subject of great interest. Even then there was difficulty in providing a quorum and the attendance on Deputy Flynn's side of the House was not exceptional.  I am not trying to make a party point.  There is a difficulty in getting quorums on Fridays.  Thus, we are faced with having the House sit at 12 o'clock on Tuesdays or earlier than it normally sits.  I know that Deputy Flynn would then complain he would not be able to get here in time from Castlebar.  There are problems of time in having these debates.  However, I must acknowledge that Deputy Flynn has made a valid point and it is a matter we shall have to consider.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said the committee were not able to get corporate plans.  That arose in the case of Irish Shipping but there has not been a general Government decision to deny corporate plans to the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be difficulty in doing that.  On the other hand, there are aspects of the efficiency of a board that one could assess.  I accept it may not be possible to do a complete job but it is possible to make as much assessment as is relevant in many cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn made a valid point about a grand-stand type of criticism of directors by members of committees.  It is true that we are getting extremely good value from part-time directors.  The fee is £800 a year.  The people concerned are providing high quality services and it is not fair to criticise them too severely.  It would be desirable if we paid them a good deal more.  If fees had kept in line with inflation the part-time directors would now receive five times as much as they are getting.  I am glad to tell the House that the Minister for the Public Service has instituted an in-depth review of the remumeration of part time directors to State companies.  I am not in a position to say what decision will be taken but the matter has been considered and the study is now completed.  There is a recognition of the point made by Deputy Flynn.  This is a matter that has been allowed to drag on by successive Governments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.  We must wait and see what decision has been taken.  This matter was allowed to drag on for years by successive Governments.  Fees were kept at their original cash value and were not adjusted in line with inflation.  At least this Government have undertaken a serious study of the matter, something that was not done before.  I dispute with Deputy Flynn the inference &mdash; I do not think he meant it &mdash; that all appointments to State boards by this Government have been of people of one particular political persuasion. That has not been the case as far as I am aware.  I have tried to appoint people on the basis of ability&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One could have an argument about that.  To the extent that State board representatives represent the Government, a certain understanding of the Government's political objectives is not something that is a disqualifying factor.  There is a legitimate argument for it.  I never criticised the party opposite when they were in Government for appointing people who were able.  If the Government of the day want to see a particular line followed by the board, just as any shareholder would wish it is not unreasonable to appoint a person who shares their perspective.  I have had the experience of reappointing people who were appointed by a Fianna Fáil Government and I reappointed them on the basis of their ability regardless of their political persuasion.  In some cases I do not know what their political persuasion is.  I accept that the people may not have been appointed originally because of political reasons.  The question of political patronage is sometimes exaggerated.  A sum of £800 a year is not much of a plum to give to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn made a reasonable point that there is a responsibility on the <Col N="1806" /> Government to publish what they think State bodies should be doing.  It must be admitted that Governments have been rather coy in not doing this because it could expose them to criticism.  Whenever a body has had to come back to the Oireachtas for money, as in the case of Irish Steel, we have been put under the microscope to see if the objectives set were achieved.  On the other hand, other bodies have not had to come back to the Dáil and in a sense by not having to come back to this House it is reasonable to assume they are doing relatively better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1985</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations was laid before Dáil Éireann on 29 November, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the regulations is to deal with a problem that has arisen in relation to the insurability under the Social Welfare Acts of the employments of certain ministers of religion.  By virtue of the provisions of paragraph 7 of Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, where a person is a minister of religion any employment which he may have is excluded from insurability under the <Col N="1807" /> Social Welfare Acts.  Recently, representations have been made to me by the Representative Body of the Church of Ireland about a difficulty with which that body is faced arising from the exclusion provision I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland has introduced a new auxiliary ministry as part of its pastoral ministry.  Auxiliary ministers are persons who are ordained in Holy Orders but continue in full time secular employment. In their leisure time, voluntarily and on an unpaid basis, they help the pastoral ministry of the Church.  Because the auxiliary ministers are ministers of religion who are ordained in Holy Orders, they are excluded from insurance under the Social Welfare Acts in their secular employment by virtue of the existing legal provision which I have mentioned. Not many persons are involved &mdash; about ten, I understand &mdash; but some have been paying social insurance contributions for a long time and the Church of Ireland has represented to me that it would be inequitable that they should be deprived of continuing social insurance cover in their normal day-to-day secular occupations because of their ordination as auxiliary ministers.  I am satisfied the existing statutory provision would constitute an inequity in so far as the auxiliary ministers are concerned.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the regulations, therefore, is to remedy the position by amending paragraph 7 of Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  For constitutional reasons it is necessary to draft the regulations in such a way that it may be applied to all religious denominations and not to one denomination only.  A provision of a somewhat similar nature was made in 1974 to bring into social insurance ministers of religion who are engaged full time on pastoral work for which they receive remuneration.</P>
    <P>In practice, what will happen is that an appropriate body or authority for a religious class will represent to me that it is unreasonable that their secular employment should not be insurable employment under the Social Welfare Acts and <Col N="1808" /> this will enable me to have the employments in question treated as insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The Church of Ireland is the body immediately concerned but, by virtue of the way in which the regulations have been drafted, it can apply equally to any religious denomination.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6) of section 5 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, the regulations may not be made until a resolution approving the draft regulations has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am happy to recommend the draft regulations to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Opposition spokesman on Social Welfare, I support the Minister's introduction of regulations to amend the statutory position under the 1981 Act.  It is obvious that the existing regulations clearly are inequitable and anomalous.  It is important that any person who is ordained and who, without remuneration for his or her religious duties should be debarred from insurability in secular employment.  I am pleased that we are about to rectify this anomalous position in regard to ministers in the Church of Ireland.  We recognise that the anomalies would affect only auxiliary ministers of the Church of Ireland who work on a voluntary basis.  It is obviously discriminative that the social welfare inclusion and exclusions would act unfairly against such people.</P>
      <P>Of course, these regulations could apply to individuals of other religious persuasions and it is our duty as legislators to respond to the genuine and sincere representations of the hierarchy of any religious body.  These regulations could affect the security of auxiliary ministers in the Church of Ireland and their families, and I am glad we will be able to dispose of such anomalies so that no minister will be debarred from insurable security in the future.  It is a matter of ensuring that the dedication of those people to their calling will not in any way militate against them in regard to insurability.</P>

      <P>It is a great disappointment in the Bantry region that the Government have allowed Chevron, who took over from Gulf, to sail out of Bantry Bay and discharge their liability to the State for a sum of $44 million which in our money is in the region of £36 million to £37 million. When one has regard to the value of the oil in the storage tanks there and which they will take with them, we are talking of a deal that is worth about £30 million net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 December 1984 the Minister for Energy in a statement to the House said that $60 million would be spent on restoring the Whiddy oil terminal in Bantry Bay.  On foot of that statement and of the agreement that had been reached between the Government and Chevron, a number of people in Bantry, the workforce particularly, decided to remain in the area, in some cases getting second <Col N="1810" /> mortgages on their houses, and to educate their families there.  Business premises in the town were refurbished and prepared generally for the activity that would result from the restoration work.</P>
    <P>However, within 12 months the Minister had returned to the House to tell us that he had allowed Chevron to dispose of their liability and that for a sum of $44 million they were being released from their obligation to rebuild the terminal. This news is a tremendous disappointment to the people of west Cork.  In Cork generally we were already dazed by the number of closures in the past year or two, but this latest announcement has knocked us out.  In this House 12 months ago the Minister gave a commitment that 250 people would be employed on the construction work on Whiddy and that the permanent workforce at the terminal would reach 100.</P>
    <P>The details of the package as announced then by the Minister were that approximately $60 million would be spent on restoring the jetty so that it would handle tankers from between 23,000 tons to 275,000 tons.  In addition, the terminal was to be upgraded so that oil products as well as crude oil could be handled there and strategic stocks were to be at a minimum of 160,000 barrels.  The Minister went on to tell us that any additional oil owned by Gulf at the terminal would be available in an emergency for the State's strategic reserves.</P>
    <P>The Minister welcomed the company's guarantees of this agreement but we now have the stunning news that the agreement is to be terminated.  That means there will be no construction work and consequently no jobs, either temporary or permanent, at the terminal.  Many of the workers concerned had been employed continuously by Gulf, and subsequently by Chevron, for up to 18 years. The average length of time of the workforce there is 16 to 17 years.  Is that permanent workforce to be abandoned now and allowed to join the redundancy line just as the remainder of their unfortunate colleagues in Cork city and surrounding areas have had to do?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us, <Col N="1811" /> too, whether the planning application which has been granted by the local authority but which is the subject of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, will be followed through so as to ensure that final planning is granted for the reconstruction of the terminal.  This is important not only for the Bantry area but for the economy generally because there are 12 tanks at Whiddy which are used to store our strategic reserves but that tank farm is useless in the absence of a jetty.  One cannot visualise how the oil could be extracted from Whiddy while no jetty is available there.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister told us that currently and for the foreseeable future there is likely to be a ready availability of crude oil storage capacity at more attractive locations in other parts of Europe.  Having attractive locations in other parts of Europe is of little use to this country and it is of no use to west Cork.  It may be attractive from the Minister's point of view but that is not the case either from my point of view or so far as the people generally are concerned. We should have our own storage facility. With the involvement of the Department of Energy in the Celtic Sea and with the news that Chevron have had some encouraging shows in block 50/6 recently, it is ironic that that parent company should be allowed out of the country.</P>
    <P>It is tragic and lamentable that, at a time when it seems as if we are about to make a breakthrough regarding an oil find, one of the major operators who were regarded, at least in the southern part of the country, not alone in terms of providing jobs at the terminal but in terms also of the refinement and processing of oil, should be let off the hook so easily &mdash; for a net sum of £30 million, an amount which undoubtedly will be swallowed up in no time in the bottomless pit of the national Exchequer.  This is not a great deal of money.  It would not shift the decimal point very far in national terms but it is very important in local terms.  According to a commitment given by the Minister in his speech to the House last week, the money will be used to <Col N="1812" /> promote additional investment in the Bantry region.</P>
    <P>Promoting additional investment in that region as well as in every other region and town and village in the country is of little use to the people in west Cork who were looking forward to the implementation of the agreement for the expenditure of $60 million in their area.  That money has been grabbed from them.  It was earmarked for spending in Bantry and I submit that the money we are getting now from Chevron should be allocated to specific industrial undertakings there.  Consequently, I am seeking two commitments from the Minister.  I want a commitment for the outstandingly committed and highly skilled workforce who have been working there continuously for 17 to 18 years and I want that money earmarked to be spent on Bantry as it was to be spent in Bantry in the first instance.  It could not be used better than for restructuring the terminal.  All the experts concede that a functional terminal could be provided for far less than that sum.  If the storage capacity there is to be of any value that is the minimum required.</P>
    <P>The House was told that the jetty will now be the responsibility of the INPC. When will discussions take place with the INPC and the local workforce in relation to the transfer of the workforce from their present employers to the INPC so that they can continue with the full maintenance of the asset there?  The interest on the money for one year could keep the workforce in continuous employment in that region.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on behalf of the people of west Cork, Bantry and throughout the country.  This is a tremendously valuable resource being allowed to go out of the country without a commitment to replace it.  I want a commitment to the workforce and a commitment that specific projects will be introduced in that area.  The people of Bantry feel that this money should have been spent in the area and they deserve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As <Col N="1813" /> the Deputy is aware I announced the agreement with Chevron in the House last Thursday &mdash; lest there might be any confusion or accusation that I informed other parties outside this House.  The $44 million to be paid by Chevron in consideration of release of Chevron's obligation placed on them by the February 1985 agreement to rebuild the damaged jetty of the Whiddy oil terminal will be paid over as an Exchequer receipt and the manner in which this money is to be utilised is accordingly a matter for the Government.  As I indicated in my statement of Thursday last, as far as industrial investment is concerned the IDA are negotiating with respective promoters regarding their 24,000 square foot advance factory and their two smaller factories of 3,700 square feet each in Bantry.  The IDA will continue to vigorously promote their 7,500 acre development site in the town.</P>
      <P>I would welcome discussions with local groups with a view to an exchange of ideas whereby measures could be adopted to offset the loss of the rebuild project.  In that regard meetings have taken place in Bantry with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Keeffe, who has met a number of groups in the locality.  I had a meeting with Deputy O'Keeffe today at which he reported back to me as to the concerns and priorities of local groups for projects in that area.  I also stated both here and in Cork last Friday week that the Government realise that money will have to be spent in the Bantry area.  I understand the Deputy's concern in relation to the disappointment at local level at the loss of jobs and projected jobs if the terminal had been brought into operation.  As regards the present work force at the Whiddy terminal, discussions are under way between the company and their representatives on the terms of financial settlement for those who are to be released.  The company have always recognised their responsibilities to the workers, and I am confident that this will be reflected in the discussions now in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement with Chevron which I <Col N="1814" /> announced last Thursday is of primarily national economic benefit.  The Government in considering the revised proposals which from the basis for the package now agreed could have insisted that up to $60 million be spent on rebuilding the jetty notwithstanding the very bleak outlook for use of the terminal and on the basis of a hope that at some indeterminate time in the future commercial possibilities might arise which would enable it to operate. This would have amounted to a gamble against uncertain odds that any real national economic gain could accrue in the foreseeable future.  On the other hand the Government could have elected, as they have, to resolve the matter of Chevron's obligations to the State in a manner which would yield certain substantial and early economic gain and which recognised the realities and outlook for international oil markets and trading.  It is also worth noting that the lesser and short term gain which would have accrued in the course of a jetty rebuild would by and large have been confined to particular sectors of the economy while the agreement now agreed provides the Government with more options as regards putting the national benefits of the deal to the good use of the nation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy talks about the quality of the agreement and whether we should have insisted upon Chevron rebuilding as was their obligation under the agreement. I would remind the Deputy particularly in the presence of the Fianna Fáil spokesman for Energy, Deputy Reynolds, that during the course of previous discussions on this topic in relation to previous agreements and settlements Deputy Reynolds said when Gulf, as it was then, was trying to negotiate with the State to buy the terminal, that if a sum of money in the region of $15 million and $20 million had been put on the table he would have considered it &mdash; and Deputy Reynolds is no mean businessman.  In that respect one cannot question the value of the agreement that has been achieved over the last number of weeks.</P>

I would have no objections to the planning being clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any difficulties in that happening.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the question of excess capacity abroad.  I am sure the Deputy is well aware that, irrespective of what value we place on Whiddy as the transnational storage point or otherwise, there are many forces outside the State which have far more impact on the international oil scene.  The facts are that excess capacity does exist at more attractive locations at present.  In that light, regrettably, it seems there is no propect of Whiddy having a commercial future at this point in time in international oil thinking and we must be influenced by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Bantry Bay is the finest natural harbour in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the absolute attractions of Bantry Bay as a transnational shipping point.  Unfortunately, the position that now exists is that there are more attractive locations from the point of view of the oil industry generally. The Deputy makes the point about oil being stored in Bantry.  He will appreciate that there is a cost factor involved in storage.  In relation to this agreement, our strategic stocks are reduced by 1.5 days of the 90 days we are required to <Col N="1816" /> hold.  It would not be either in the taxpayers' or the national interest were we to insist at present on that terminal containing one million barrels of crude storage oil because of the obvious cost factor involved.  On the other hand, in relation to offshore development considerations, I might reiterate what I have already said on that point, that is, that the terminal will be maintained.  But I would emphasise that it will be maintained at minimal cost by the INPC.  The fact that there will not be any oil in the terminal obviously means that they can maintain it at far less cost than the present operation.</P>
      <P>The other factor to be taken into account is that the lead-in time from a declaration of a commercial oil find to actual extraction of hydrocarbons would be a sufficient time in which to consider options for the utilisation of Whiddy, if that was deemed to be desirable, if it would seem appropriate in the overall strategy for development of an oilfield. That would then allow time for appropriate technical action, whether that meant the recommissioning of the tank farm installation, loading or unloading facilities or otherwise.</P>
      <P>In the context of the people of west Cork, I should say that this agreement with Chevron does not diminish the potential of Whiddy in the long term.  We must accept the fact that there are many outside influences in the international oil scene which mean that, whether we like it or not, we are not the masters of our destiny in that respect.  But the situation does not diminish the long term potential. If at a future point in time it appears that Whiddy has a role to play in strategy for the development or exploration of oilfield potential, then that can be done without any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The understandable sense of loss by the local community in Bantry extends perhaps to a much wider area and does not affect just the town of Bantry itself. I am aware that the hinterland of west Cork has been affected since the inception of the whole Whiddy project.  I have said and given a commitment that the Government will be responding &mdash; I hope in an effective manner &mdash; not merely <Col N="1817" /> trying to assuage public feelings in the area by putting money into projects which are nonsensical or meaningless. Projects which emanate from local interest groups who have behaved very sensibily in relation to this whole matter, which can be looked at by the IDA, by the Departments concerned, will be examined by the Government, and the Government will not fail Bantry on this issue.  I am firmly convinced that projects which withstand the tests, which look like projects that can survive, that can withstand the marketing and other economic evalutions they will have to undergo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is my intention to continue, with the assistance of the Minister of State in the constituency, to examine any projects that come forward.</P>

For example, at the end of 1973 there were less than 33,000 companies on the register and at the moment the figure is approximately 100,000.

      <P>The Council of Ministers on 25 July 1985 adopted the directive concerning liability for defective products, as agreed by all member states.  The directive must be implemented by member states within three years of that date.  The purpose of the directive is to impose responsibility by law on producers of products and their components for injury or loss occasioned to any person due to a defect in that product, if it is shown that the defect existed when the product was put into circulation.</P>
      <P>This regime of strict liability will impose liability irrespective of the negligence of the defendant, though unlike absolute liability certain defences will be open.  Product liability will be an additional legal redress to liability in tort and contract law.  Our position during the discussions on the directive was taken in the light of consultations with all interested parties.  The question of implementation of the directive is being examined at present and consultations with all interested parties will take place in due course.</P>
      <P>The draft directive on doorstep selling has been accepted by nine member states including Ireland and is now only subject to a general reservation by Germany. This reservation is based on Germany's attitude to deregulation in the economy. The purpose of the draft directive is to protect the contractual rights of consumers who conclude contracts for goods and services away from the business premises of the trader.  Under the proposal, persons who purchased goods or services following an unsolicited visit would be given a seven day period of reflection during which they could cancel the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption of the directive will not pose any major problems for us.  I already have <Col N="1603" /> power under section 50 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, to make an Order introducing a cooling off period in the case of doorstep sales.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers in May 1985 discussed a proposal for a Council decision introducing a system of information on accidents in which consumer products are involved and agreed in principle on setting up a Community system of information on these products.  The aim of the proposed Community system of information is the collection of data on all accidents involving consumer products (excluding road accidents and accidents at places of work) with a view to promoting accident prevention, improving the safety of consumer products and informing and educating consumers.</P>
    <P>Further discussions on this proposal, which Ireland is supporting, will take place at a meeting of Internal Market-Consumer Affairs Ministers later this week.</P>

      <P>Total trade between Ireland and China (People's Republic) has risen in recent years.  It was £11.4 million in 1982, £14.5 million in 1983, £22.8 million in 1984 and is estimated at £30 million this year. Ireland's exports for the same period were £3.1 million, £3.5 million, £6.6 million and are estimated at £12 million in 1985.  The trade balance has thus consistently favoured China.  The Deputy will be aware that a detailed breakdown of the figures up to October 1985 is available from the CSO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the foregoing that our trade relations with China have been developing rapidly and I believe this trend is set to continue.  Minister of State Collins has just returned from the People's Republic of China where he led a very successful trade mission.  During this mission orders worth £8.8 million were secured and a further £9.5 million are under serious negotiation.  While Minister of State Collins expressed unease to his Chinese counterparts at the imbalance in our trade he stressed that he wanted to achieve a more even balance through a substantial growth in two way trade.  His Chinese counterparts shared this view.  It is proposed to conclude a co-operation agreement at an early date which will provide a formal structure <Col N="1605" /> within which the increased trade can be sought.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe that the prospects for extending trade are considerable.  China has embarked on a policy with the aim of increasing GNP through the acquisition of foreign technology and expertise, improving their infrastructure and upgrading their manufacturing capacity. This will give rise to a significant import requirement of essential goods and services. There is no reason why Ireland should not participate in this process to our mutual advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 28 together.  The problems of the building and quarrying materials supply industry in the Border area arise because of the recession in the construction industry and the increase of imports of concrete and quarry products from Northern Ireland. These problems are well known to me, and my Department in consultation with the other Departments concerned are taking all possible steps, within the rules and regulations of the EC, to alleviate the difficulties of these sectors.</P>
      <P>The grant aid for the concrete and quarrying sectors in Northern Ireland which was highlighted in the Grogan report has been terminated.  Consequently the question of introducing some form of a counter-balancing grant does not arise.  Indeed it would be counter-productive to consider such a move for a sector in which there is severe overcapacity at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of bills of quantities for public work, any requirement that only Irish manufactured materials be used in public construction contracts would be in breach of EC Regulations which prohibit public authorities discriminating against products manufactured in other member states.</P>

      <P>Total trade between Ireland and Canada <Col N="1608" /> has been growing steadily over the past ten years, rising from £34.3 million in 1975 to £126 million in 1980; it was £152.4 million in 1982, £172.3 million in 1983, and £250.4 million in 1984.  It is expected to rise again in 1985.  Ireland's exports for the same period have been £69.2 million, £80.6 million, £150.2 million and are estimated at £170 million in 1985.  Prior to 1984 the trade balance had consistently favoured Canada but in 1984 we recorded a surplus of £50 million.  We expect this surplus to rise to about £80-£90 million this year.  The Deputy will be aware that details of these figures up to October 1985 are available in the CSO.</P>
      <P>Our exports to Canada have grown fairly spectacularly in the past two years. CTT have been active in the Canadian market in identifying new opportunities. They expect to see solid, if less spectacular, progress in the next year or two.  In 1986 they intend to provide services for, and to organise, 120 exporter visits. There have been some difficulties in the past year in relation to beef exports and these have had my particular attention.</P>

      <P>In October 1984 at my request, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards made a voluntary Irish standard for car tyres.  The standard was drafted with the co-operation of the major tyre manufacturers and distributors in Ireland and is designed to discourage the sale of substandard and inadequately marked tyres on the Irish market.  It is my intention to introduce mandatory requirements for car tyres as soon as possible; this would make it an offence to market car tyres which do not meet the required specifications.</P>

      <P>Official figures from the Central Statistics Office do not show Irish and overseas companies imported material inputs separately. However, a recent Industrial Development Authority survey finds that overseas firms imported an average of 64 per cent of their material inputs in 1983; in electronics, including computers, and chemicals, such imports were 83 per cent and 80 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>Electronics and chemicals are fast growing sectors so there is clearly a need to ensure that more of their inputs come from Irish sources.  The national linkage programme for which IDA are responsible addresses this need.  Electronics which uses a wide variety of inputs will be their initial area of emphasis.  There, the programme aims to raise the level of raw materials from Irish sources to 33 per cent of the industry's requirement.  It will be extended to other sectors such as chemicals when results have been reviewed.</P>

      <P>Since the Adjournment Debate on 20 February last, I have written to the <Col N="1610" /> Deputy on four occasions, responding to the points raised by him or seeking further information in respect of the cases referred to by him.</P>
      <P>Of the four cases referred to my Department by the Deputy, insurance cover has been provided in one instance. As indicated in three separate letters to the Deputy, attempts to contact two of the three remaining individuals to get further details which are necessary for investigation have so far been unsuccessful. Attempts to obtain insurance cover for the fourth individual have, so far, been unsuccessful.  A letter is being issued to the Deputy outlining the reasons for this.  The position generally on the availability of household insurance for flats is as set out in reply to similar questions in October 1984 and in reply on the Adjournment Debate of 20 February 1985.</P>
      <P>I must also point out to the Deputy as I did in my letter to him last June that my primary responsibility as the supervisory authority for insurance is to see whether companies meet their statutory solvency and reserving requirements.  In this regard I must respect the right of any insurer to refuse to accept a particular risk if it does not meet underwriting criteria. I cannot compel a company to provide a person with insurance cover and while cases will be investigated to see what can be done I cannot, naturally, undertake the role of insurance broker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will give details of food imports into this country in 1984; if he will give a breakdown of these; and the steps he proposes to take to reduce these imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Central Statistics Office, the value of food imports into this country in 1984 was £933 million.  I shall arrange to send a breakdown of these figures to the Deputy.  However, some of the more significant imports are (i) cereal <Col N="1611" /> and cereal preparations (£174 million), (ii) vegetables and fruit (£173 million), and (iii) animal feedstuffs (£141 million).</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any interpretation of these figures would need to be tempered with the realisation that some of our food imports represent &ldquo;paper transactions&rdquo;, e.g., in the case of live animals for trans-shipment to other countries, or cattle for slaughter and re-export as beef.  Also, a considerable volume of other goods is imported for further processing and re-export.</P>
      <P>On the issue of import substitution, studies in the past would suggest that approximately 25 per cent of food imports are substitutable.  I hope that the Deputy will appreciate that Ireland is now operating in an international free trade environment and that a certain level of imports is inevitable having regard to the multiplicity of consumer needs and wants in the marketplace.  Irish industry can best perform, not by any outmoded protectionist measures, but by increasing exports and identifying and satisfying niches on the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The Government's White Paper on industrial policy highlights the vital importance of the food sector and it indicates a number of ways in which the above objectives can be achieved by industry.  It is important, for instance, that food exports be increasingly based on needs of the marketplace and on branded consumer-ready products, rather than on commodities.  The White Paper also urges a much heavier emphasis on product and brand development.</P>
      <P>Long term supply contracts are particularly necessary because seasonality of production can be a serious problem in the major food processing sectors.  The Government proposes that the National Development Corporation will be empowered to assist in the promotion of ways in which to tackle this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's White Paper indicates also that the large supermarket groups can assist the processing sector by engaging in development-type contracts with local producers and processors, and that they can also help Irish firms to <Col N="1612" /> develop export markets through the links between the Irish branches and the head offices of foreign based multiple groups. The importance of this has been urged by the Minister on the supermarket groups through a series of high level meetings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested to learn of some other measures which have been taken recently to place the domestic industry on a more competitive footing <i>vis-à-vis</i> imports.  One such measure is the granting of aid to firms involved in the grading, packing and storage of potatoes, which should result in a better quality product.  The Government is anxious that links between vegetable growers and market outlets be improved and, to this end, following discussions with representatives of the farming community, a recently formed company, whose main objective is to effect improvements in this area, has been launched.</P>
    <P>The Government will be providing financial assistance to this company over a limited period.  On the processing side the IDA have approved grant aid for a number of value added projects which should result in import substitution.  The Deputy will appreciate that everything possible is being done to help domestic industry compete with imports but, in the final analysis, the opportunities in the marketplace will have to be availed of by the industry itself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During 1984 the council discussed and <Col N="1613" /> gave their views to the relevant authorities on several items of consumer interest. These included:</P>
    <P>&mdash;IIRS standards and other IIRS proposals</P>
    <P>&mdash;various proposals under discussion at EC level.</P>
    <P>&mdash;certification and guarantee schemes operated by certain industrial sectors</P>
    <P>&mdash;problems relating to motor insurance and vehicle tax evasion. </P>
    <P>The council was dissolved in July last.  At that time items which it had on hands included a draft IIRS standard for laminated safety glass for motor vehicle windscreens, a Restrictive Practices Commission report on conveyancing and advertising by solicitors and questions relating to environmental pollution and door-to-door selling.</P>
    <P>The decision to terminate the operation of the council was taken after very full consideration of the matter.  The council played a major role in the development of legislation in the consumer area in the past and I would hope that bodies which were represented on the council will continue to play an active role in that regard in the future.  Budgetary constraints was one reason for deciding to dissolve the council but the decision should also be seen in the context of the proposal to strengthen the institutions involved in consumer and competition matters by rationalising the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the National Prices Commission, the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is preparing any new initiative to prevent the dumping of nuclear waste in the Atlantic, in view of the recent disclosures in the European Parliament that the canisters containing nuclear waste may disintegrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the reply given in the European Parliament on 23 October 1985 to a question by Mr. Maher, MEP on dumping of radioactive waste in the north east Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Dumping of radioactive waste at sea is governed by the London Dumping Convention (LDC).  Since its entry into force in 1975 the LDC has prohibited outright the dumping at sea of high level radioactive waste.  In addition, the dumping of low and intermediate level radioactive waste requires a prior special permit. However, no dumping of low or intermediate level radioactive waste has been carried out in the north east Atlantic dumping site since 1983 when the LDC imposed a moratorium on such dumping pending completion of scientific studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is opposed to the dumping of all radioactive waste at sea and has consistently advocated, and will continue to advocate, this course at the appropriate international fora.  At the meeting of the LDC in September 1985, the Irish delegate stated, on my behalf, that although the results of the scientific studies would <Col N="1618" /> appear to indicate that there are no scientific and technical reasons for prohibiting dumping at sea, there are other considerations which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>For this reason Ireland supported a resolution, subsequently adopted by the LDC, calling for a continuation of the moratorium on dumping while further studies are carried out.  These studies will include an examination of whether it can be proven that dumping of radioactive materials at sea will not harm human life or cause significant damage to the marine environment and will look at the wider political, legal, economic and social implications of such dumping.  In addition the resolution of the LDC requests the International Atomic Energy Agency to advise on certain outstanding scientific and technical issues concerning sea dumping of radioactive waste.</P>
    <P>A research cruise which will assess levels of radioactivity in the area bounded by Ireland, Spain and the north east Atlantic dumpsite is scheduled for May 1986 as part of a series of studies being carried out jointly by UCD and the Autonomous University of Barcelona on radioactivity in the marine environment. The research cruise will be funded by my Department and the Nuclear Energy Board as well as by the Spanish authorities. Preliminary results are expected in Autumn 1986.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Begley</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of the need to provide financial assistance for Irish citizens in Britain; if so, if he will arrange to increase the amount made available; and if he will ensure that the funds so provided are distributed to the best advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foriegn Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increasing problems being faced especially by young Irish citizens who go to Britain to seek work and of the plight in which many of <Col N="1619" /> them find themselves.  Many go unprepared and with no pre-arranged employment or lodgings.  In addition to the various reports on this subject I have, myself, visited Irish community groups in Britain on several occasions since I came to office and intend to continue to do so at regular intervals.</P>
      <P>In addition to the normal consular services our Embassy in London has a community liaison officer who maintains contact with all Irish organisations in Britain. An officer from the Department of Labour is also attached to the embassy. He maintains contact with Irish bodies which provide welfare services for emigrants in Britain.  He is also chairman of an advisory group, called DION, which advises the Minister for Labour on questions relating to the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.  The Minister for Labour has a fund to help the Irish welfare groups.  This fund was increased from £38,000 in 1983 to IR £68,000 in 1984 and to IR£104,000 in 1985.  This was allocated to 12 welfare and advisory groups following the advice of the DION committee.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the reason Ireland abstained on the recent vote at the United Nations on the resolution referred to in the press on November 30 which purported to describe apartheid as a crime against humanity; if he will make <Col N="1620" /> the text of the resolution available to Members of the House; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The resolution in question was concerned with the report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which was established under the terms of the International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination.  Contrary to the impression given by some reports Ireland voted in favour of this resolution, a copy of which has been made available in the Library of the House.  Along with all of our European Community partners, Ireland, without in any way detracting from our abhorrence and rejection of the entire apartheid system, abstained in a separate vote on the particular paragraph of the resolution to which the Deputy's question refers on the ground that it implied obligations going beyond the terms of this particular resolution and employed formulations which have wider implications than those relating specifically to apartheid.  Ireland has a record of consistent opposition to the apartheid policies of the South African Government. At the United Nations Ireland will this week co-sponsor resolutions on concerted international action against apartheid and the United Nations trust fund for South Africa.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foregin Affairs whether the minister at the Embassy of the South African regime in London informed or sought the permission of the Irish Government prior to his visit here to address a student society in Dublin in November; his response to any such request; and if, in view of the fact that there is no visa requirements for South Africans entering the State, he will introduce a visa requirement for South African diplomats who intend to visit this country.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals, at this <Col N="1621" /> time, to introduce a visa requirement for South Africans intending to visit this country.</P>
      <P>The minister of the South African Embassy in London did not inform the Government of his intention to visit Dublin; it would not be normal practice for him to do so.  In his capacity as a private citizen he would not need to seek Government permission to visit Ireland.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not maintain diplomatic relations with the Republic of South Africa.  South African officals who are accredited as diplomats in another country do not, therefore, enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities in Ireland and are regarded as private citizens while in this country.</P>

      <P>My Department, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the Industrial Development Authority have been examining ways in which the best economic benefits can be obtained from the increasingly available supplies of timber arising in our forests.</P>
      <P>The north-west region has been identified as an area offering stategic advantages to a pulpwood-processing project and the IDA has been attempting to attract such a project to Ireland in order to exploit this natural resource.  However, some pulpwood industries require greater volumes of raw material than are likely to be available and this represents a limiting factor.</P>
      <P>The choice of location for any industry setting up in Ireland is, of course, a matter for the promoters of the project but the Deputy can be assured that the advantages of Sligo-Leitrim as a location for an additional timber-processing plant are being brought to the attention of the promoters of any proposals which arise.</P>

The scheme which was introduced in its present form in 1979 applies only to farmhouses, town and country homes and single self-catering units.  Premises located within three miles of the centre of towns having a population of 3,000 or more are at present ineligible for assistance. This particular condition was designed to encourage tourism development in rural areas and was in line with a policy of generally weighting grant assistance in favour of rural and less developed areas of the country.</P>

      <P>Given the expanded scope of the new scheme and the extent of the grants available, I am satisfied that it was in the interest of the persons involved that they should have the opportunity to avail themselves of the revised scheme, provided the work involved was not started before 1 December, and the house involved was inspected on or after that date.</P>

      <P>The modes of despatch of mail to Ireland from other countries, including the means of transport and the route employed, are matters for the foreign postal administrations concerned, in this case the postal administration of India. Letters addressed to persons in this country from India remain, under the terms <Col N="1641" /> of the Universal Postal Convention, the property of the sender until delivered in Ireland.  Freedom of transit for letter post is guaranteed under Article 1 of the Constitution of the Universal Postal Union and under Article 1 of the convention. The principle of freedom of transit implies the inviolability of correspondence in the country of transit.  An Post have advised that mail for this country, from some parts of India such as Calcutta, arrives, via Britain, in the form of <i>closed</i> despatches which are addressed direct to An Post and treated as transit mail by the UK Post Office.  However, some individual items of mail from India are sent, <i>à dècouvert</i> (that is amalgamated with other mail) to the British post office for onward despatch to Dublin. Such items would be included in direct closed despatches from India to Britain where they would be rehandled and included in direct despatches from Britain to Ireland.  The label attached to the correspondence supplied by the Deputy acknowledges that the correspondence mentioned was opened by the British Post Office for the purpose of customs and currency examination.  An Post have had no complaints that mail in transit to this country via Britain is being interfered with and the violation which occurred in the present case would appear to have arisen accidentally.  In view of this and of the position, already mentioned, about ownership of the letter, it would be for the sender and the Indian postal authorities in the first instance to pursue the question of any irregularity with the British post office.</P>

      <P>An ambulance service has been provided for this person in the past but the Eastern Health Board has no request from the person at present for transport facilities. In the Eastern Health Board area non-emergency transport is not normally provided for persons attending hospital for physiotherapy but if there is medical evidence of hardship the board will investigate the possibility of providing a service.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a married man with two dependant children who is entitled to a weekly payment of unemployment assistance of £10.95 being the maximum amount appropriate in his case of £76.55 less means of £66. In accordance with regulations which provide for payment of the amount due in respect of an applicant's wife and dependant children to be made to <Col N="1653" /> another person, where the circumstances so warrant, a separate weekly payment of £6.14 is being made to his wife and he is in receipt of the balance of £4.81.</P>
      <P>He has appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and the case has been forwarded to a social welfare officer for further inquiries.

Accordingly, it was decided by a deciding officer on 28 November 1985 that he is entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £26 from 15 November 1985.  This is the rate to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means comprising half the weekly value of an occupational pension from the South Eastern Health Board and a small amount of capital.</P>

The assessment of her means is calculated on the basis of the value of her board and lodging in her parents home, by reference to the net incomes of her father and mother.

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means, of £40 weekly, exceeded the statutory limit in his case.  His means are derived from the profit from his holding and from the value of capital.  He made a supplementary claim on 27 November 1985 and arrangements are being made to refer his case to the social welfare officer for the investigation of his means.  When these inquiries are completed his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the amount of means assessed against him.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  According to the Department's records, the person concerned has no contributions paid or credited during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, which governed her entitlement to payment of unemployment benefit on her claim of 19 March 1985.  An inquiry was issued to the Department of Health and Social Security to establish what the UK insurance record of the person concerned was during the governing contribution year. That Department requested additional information to enable them to trace her insurance record, and this was supplied to them.</P>
      <P>When the Department of Health and Social Security supply the necessary information, the entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment benefit will be determined.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 6 January 1983 and has subsequently been in continuous receipt of either unemployment benefit or disability benefit.  When she made her current claim to unemployment benefit on 11 November 1985, she had exhausted 282 days entitlement to unemployment benefit, as her previous claims to unemployment benefit since 6 January 1983 were linked, through disability benefit claims.  The person concerned will have drawn the maximum entitlement of 312 days benefit on 14 December 1985.</P>

However my expectation is that, provided recent progress in the eradication programme is maintained, we will be in a position next spring, after the end of the current round of testing, to consider acceding to OBF status nationwide.</P>
      <P>It would not be practicable or desirable to declare part of the national herd OBF at this stage, when the brucellosis eradication programme is reaching its final stages, as this would necessitate the introduction of severe restrictions on movement between herds and regions.</P>

Before I put any specific proposals to Government I will give careful consideration to the arguments for and against each proposal.  A Supreme Court decision announced on 19 <Col N="1678" /> November 1985, upheld the constitutionality of section 14 of the Gaming and Lotteries, Act, 1956, which provides for the stake and prize limits for gaming in licensed amusements halls and funfairs. Following that decision representations have been made to me about the urgency of an amendment to the stake and prize limits for gaming because of the threat to employment in the gaming industry.  Accordingly, I am considering the question of introducing amending legislation in this session.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware that there is currently a delay of approximately 18 months in processing applications before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. This delay is partly due to the increase in recent years in the number of applications for compensation being received by the tribunal and also, the necessity to keep the amount of money which the tribunal may pay out in any one year within the allocation for that year.</P>
      <P>In 1980 the number of applications received by the tribunal was 509 compared with 1,750 in 1984.  In 1985, to the end of November, 1,811 applications had been lodged with the tribunal.  The amount paid out in 1980 in respect of awards totalled £1,096,123 as compared with an expected outturn of £3,990,000 in 1985.  In accordance with a decision in the national plan - <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>&mdash; I am reviewing the conditions of the scheme with a view to reducing its impact on the Exchequer.  In relation to the staffing of the offices of the tribunal, no exception can be made from the staffing restrictions on recruitment which apply throughout the public service.  This is a matter of Government policy and, while I accept that it must have inevitable consequences in terms of some delays in the offices of the tribunal, there is no question at present of changing the situation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I indicated in my replies to Question No. 729 on 2 May 1984 and Question No. 82 on 10 July 1985, it is not the practice to allocate a specific proportion of Garda resources in any area to the neighbourhood watch scheme, which is essentially a network of public-spirited people who observe what is going on in their own neighbourhood and report suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to individual stations is a matter for the Garda authorities, who review the strength assigned to the various stations from time to time to take account of changing needs and circumstances.  Prior to the introduction of the pilot neighbourhood watch scheme in the Finglas area on 18 April 1984, the overall Garda strength at Finglas station was 61.  Extra gardai were allocated to the station in August 1984 and since then, the strength has varied between 63 and 67.  The current strength is 65 and I am informed by the Garda authorities that, having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services, they consider that this strength is adequate to meet the needs of the area, including the need to maintain good Garda-community relations.  The Garda authorities have no proposals at present for allocating additional manpower to Finglas station but they are <Col N="1682" /> keeping the police needs of the area under review.</P>

      <P>It is intended to make physical education facilities available for all post primary schools.  However, the timing of the provision of the facilities for any particular school must have regard to capital availability as against other school building commitments and priorities.</P>
      <P>The Department is at present faced with a large number of building projects involving the provision of much needed teaching accommodation, as well as a large backlog of applications for physical education halls.  In view of this, it is not possible to give a date for the provision of a physical education hall at the vocational school, Bandon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has no immediate plans for additional post-primary schools in either of the areas to which the Deputy refers.  The school accommodation needs of pupils in these areas will be reviewed annually.  Such reviews will, however, have to take account of the enrolment outlook for the many new and older schools already established not alone in <Col N="1688" /> Tallaght but in Clondalkin, Drimnagh, Walkinstown and Templeogue.  There is adequate accommodation in other schools in the neighbourhood for pupils unable to be accommodated at St. Mark's community school.</P>

      <P>The training and placement of handicapped persons is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Health under whose aegis the National Rehabilitation Board operates.  The services provided by the board are complemented by the manpower service agencies including the Youth Employment Agency, National Manpower Service, AnCO and CERT who have worked closely with the National Rehabilitation Board over the years.</P>
      <P>The manpower and training schemes for which my Department is responsible endeavour to enhance the prospects of all categories of unemployed persons in obtaining open employment.</P>
      <P>The manpower agencies give specific attention to the needs of handicapped persons suitable for placement in open employment and take positive steps to integrate such persons on to their programmes as an aid to eventual placement in open employment.  Such measures, however, are undertaken in consultation with the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency has assisted a number of programmes for <Col N="1689" /> mentally handicapped persons under its community enterprise programme.</P>
    <P>Sponsors of projects under my Department's teamwork programme are encouraged to include a number of disabled persons among their participants. The provision of a scheme confined to handicapped persons would be a matter for the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>I understand that an appeal by the person concerned, as regards entitlement to a redundancy lump sum under the Redundancy Payments Acts, was listed for hearing by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in August 1984, but that the hearing did not go ahead as the parties involved notified the tribunal that a settlement had been reached.  The tribunal did not, therefore, issue a decision in the case.</P>
      <P>In view of the withdrawal of the appeal from the tribunal, it is not clear what further action, if any, can be taken, but I will arrange to have the matter investigated further by my Department and I will write to the Deputy in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the considerations in establishing the social employment scheme was to limit the additional cost to the Exchequer.  In the circumstances, the eligibility criteria limited participation to those (i) over 25 years of age, (ii) unemployed for at least one year and; (iii) in receipt of unemployment assistance payments at the time of entry into the scheme.</P>
      <P>Allowing persons not in receipt of unemployment assistance to participate in the social employment scheme would not achieve the savings to the Exchequer necessary to make the scheme financially attractive.</P>
