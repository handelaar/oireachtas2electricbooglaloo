      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome a number of features of this imaginative budget, one that has set us on the road to reform of the tax code and which generally has inspired confidence in the economy which undoubtedly has been in serious difficulty in the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The changes in the tax code are very imaginative.  They remove the difficulties of administering one of the most complicated tax codes in Europe.  Another important aspect of this budget is that it is the first in many years not to add anything significant to the cost of living.  The fact that social welfare increases are somewhat higher than the rate of inflation and are significantly higher than the increases likely to be awarded to earners this year is an indication of the commitment of the Government to protecting the livelihoods of the least well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has recognised the need to consider seriously the whole area of tax collection and enforcement.  He has established a committee to follow up that problem and it is a significant problem. As I have outlined in the House before, there is a chronic problem in terms of the administration of our tax system as it applies to the self-employed.  Of the tax to be paid by the self-employed, 40 per cent is paid late, the average delay being about 18 months.  Obviously the State is out of money to a considerable extent because of this.  The system designed to prevent those delays occurring, namely, interest penalties in respect of late payment, is not being applied.  I estimate that about only one-eighth of the money that should be collected in respect of late payments is collected.  In addition, the whole area of enforcement whereby demands <Col N="1698" /> go before the courts has been slowly grinding to a halt.  As recently as 1979, 15 per cent of the nominal yield that was sought by way of enforcement was collected.  The figure in that respect today is about 5 per cent.  In other words, the system is becoming progressively worse and that is why I consider the Minister to be correct in appointing a committee to investigate this area.  Some people may simply yawn when they hear of yet another committee being established but the problem in question is not a simple administrative one of changing a rule here or there, the approach that has been adopted down through a series of budgets in respects of the whole question of evasion and enforcement.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the whole system of tax collection from the self-employed is deficient in all its aspects, from the beginning where assessments are levied, assessments which in many cases are totally out of line with the real situation, right through the system of appealing, levying demands and through to enforcement. At every stage the system is fraught with enormous difficulties and is obviously not working.  I would ask that the enforcement committee would not concentrate simply on the problem of enforcement through the courts or through solicitors but that they would focus on the whole problem of the system as it applies to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I have advocated here on many occasions that we should move towards a system of self-assessment for the self-employed. Some may say that that would be an easy way out for them but it is far from that.  The main purpose of a self-assessment system would be, first, that the money would be paid by the date appointed and, secondly, that the Revenue Commissioners would be free, on the basis of random checks, to explore areas where they think there is tax revenue not being properly reported. Because of the present system the commissioners are engaged to a large extent with ordinary taxpayers' returns, 99 per cent of which are probably legitimate returns and consequently do not warrant the attention of the commissioners.  If <Col N="1699" /> we were to introduce a self-assessment system for the self-employed with strong penalties for breaches of the code, we would succeed in bringing the money in much faster as well as making the system much easier for the self-employed to operate &mdash; those who are making accurate returns while the few who are evading their taxes would be more likely to be caught by the commissioners and, having caught up with them, they would have adequate powers to pursue them.</P>
    <P>I stress again that the problem in the area of tax collection is not a problem of an inadequate number of officials in the revenue collection section and neither is it a matter of an inadequate number of people in the courts.  The problem is a system that cannot be operated.  About one quarter of our civil servants are engaged in revenue collection so we do not need an increase in the number in that respect.  We do not need more rules but we need a change in the system.  I hope this will be the sort of proposal that will come from the committee being set up by the Minister.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of progress has been made in the matter of tax reform, particularly in the areas of VAT and indirect taxation, but there remains much to be done in this whole area.  I point in particular to the area of savings and investment in the context of the tax code. I cannot see the justification for the position in which people who put money aside by way of saving should have to pay tax on the entire nominal value of their savings. That is an obvious disincentive to saving. If at a time of a 10 per cent rate of inflation, one is paid interest on savings at that level, at the end of the year one is no better off in terms of his savings but in addition the Exchequer takes 35 per cent at least of the 10 per cent interest. In effect, then, people who are saving through the normal channels, the banks and so on, are being taxed on their capital. The taxation commission report estimated that the effect in terms of taxation in that regard was about £150 million. The most disturbing feature of this is that <Col N="1700" /> it is indicating to people that saving is bad policy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there are those who are cute enough to ferret out other vehicles for saving, such as bonds of various kinds that have been available for some years now, or who can succeed in converting their savings into capital gains and who can avail of allowances for inflation. These people are getting generous concessions from the tax code.  It is not logical to suggest to people that they should channel their money into various funds such as pension and insurance funds that by and large finance property investments, Government gilts and other safe channels of investment.  We are telling savers that they should put their money into these channels rather than into employment creating channels.  It is time we seriously addressed both the offer of incentives to saving and to the type of saving that we are encouraging in the tax code.  A similar related problem arises with investment where there is an unfair encouragement to investment that takes the shape of property and Government paper of one sort or another rather than investment that goes into employment creating projects.  We have to reexamine the treatment of savings and the treatment of capital gains in order that employment creating investments should get priority.</P>
    <P>The second thing that remains to be tackled in the income tax code area is the enormous number of reliefs and exemptions that we have built into the code.  The report of the Commission on Taxation estimates that the effective leakages from the tax base come to about 28 per cent of the income tax base and 40 per cent of the capital gains tax base. In other words, by giving concessions we have narrowed the base of our tax and that has forced us to push up the rates. None of us would welcome a tax system that gets very low income earners into the high margin of tax rates.  It has been pointed out on numerous occasions that Ireland is unique in the fact that about 40 per cent of the population are paying marginal tax rates over the standard rate. They are in the rates above 35 per cent. <Col N="1701" /> The reason for that is that we have over the years conceded on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis reliefs and exemptions many of them seeming desirable in themselves and which can be justified individually but their combination has been to push up the rates of very moderate income earners.</P>
    <P>The other related problem with these reliefs is that they are inequitable.  They are granted in the form of allowances, therefore people on top rate taxes get the best benefit from them.  People on the standard rate tax get much less benefit and people who are not in the tax code at all because of low incomes get no benefit from them.  It also means that tax managers of one sort or another waste the time and energy of the Revenue Commissioners and their own time by devising new schemes to ferret out new reliefs and new ways of reducing the tax burden for the better off taxpayers who can afford the services of such tax managers.  We must start on the problem of winding back the extent to which we have high tax rates and high reliefs and exemptions. No one says that that can be done overnight. It would be impossible to say to someone who becomes redundant that we are now going to be taxing redundancy payments or to say to people with mortgages that we are now going to withdraw our interest relief on mortgages.  But what we can do is start the process of removing these reliefs on a phased basis perhaps by curtailing the ceiling at which one could claim reliefs so that instead of being able to claim them up to the 60 per cent rate one could only do so up to the 48 per cent rate, or we could say that from a certain date we will start adopting a different approach to mortgages.  However, I favour the proposal that over a period we bring down the top tax rate at which people can claim these reliefs.  In time we would come to a situation where those reliefs would be given as effective tax credits, something that the Taxation Commission and indeed most parties in this House see as the ideal system to move towards.</P>
    <P>We still have enormous complexity in the number of tax system we are operating. For example, in the income tax <Col N="1702" /> code we are effectively operating five income tax systems with different thresholds and ceilings and different rates.  That is an unreasonable obligation on personnel departments throughout the country who have to estimate tax liability.  The five systems I refer to are the PRSI, the youth levy, the income levy, the health levy and our ordinary income tax code. There is a great need to consolidate this into a single code which would be simpler to operate.</P>
    <P>In the same way we should move further along that road in relation to VAT. Our objective over the long term should be to come from 3 per cent to 2 per cent and perhaps even to a 1 per cent VAT rate.  Too much is made of the argument that luxuries should be taxed at a high rate and necessities at a low rate.  For many people buying luxury goods is discretionary.  In economic terms demand is very sensitive to prices, and what happens if there is a high rate is that nine times out of ten the people who suffer are the producers of these luxuries who very often are not well off.  Very often the effect of high tax on luxuries is not on the people with high incomes but on the people in the job of producing luxuries.  That is not a sensible approach and if what we are trying to do at the end of the day is to redistribute income we should do it through our income tax code and social welfare code.  Trying to do it through VAT structures that create difficulties for traders is counter-productive. It is welcomed that the Minister has made a start in this direction and he should be encouraged to continue.</P>
    <P>I will turn from the tax issue to the question of employment.  It is the most important issue facing our community and it is important that spokesmen from both sides of the House bend their minds to thinking how we can better tackle the problems of employment.  It is not good enough just to say that this Government are not doing enough.  We need suggestions to come from both sides of the House.  This Government have been remarkably innovative in their approach to employment.  They have established the Youth Employment Agency and such <Col N="1703" /> schemes as the enterprise allowance scheme, the new social employment scheme, employment incentive schemes, NDC and AnCO schemes and so on, and Fianna Fáil must take credit for the work experience programme.  This Government and this State have many schemes available to support either the individual trying to set up in enterprise or the community trying to establish enterprise or the unemployed, be they young or old, who need special State assistance in getting back into the workforce.  I do not claim that all of those schemes have been as successful as we would like, but they are in operation.  We are experimenting with the various approaches to enterprise and with helping solve the acute problems facing the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed who will now be helped by the new training programme and the new social employment scheme giving two and a half days work to people and leaving them free for the remainder of the week.  These are commendable schemes.  We have a structure established between our industrial strategy and our employment strategy.  We have very wide range of supports which are being used, and the Government must take credit for this imaginative approach.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead we will have to be far more concerned about the way in which these schemes are administered than we have been heretofore.  Bodies such an AnCO, the IDA, SFADCo and so on have not been sufficiently closely monitored in what they are achieving for the money they are getting.  We have been too willing to say that employment is the key problem &mdash; therefore let us throw a lot of money at it &mdash; and not sufficiently discerning to see where the best results are coming from.  I know that the likes of AnCO produce figures showing the percentage placement, but I suggest that that is by no means an adequate test of the success of a training programme.  One could get 100 per cent placement by putting on a course for which one knew in advance that there would be vacancies.  We must be much <Col N="1704" /> more discerning about AnCO's activities in ensuring that the training given is reaching an adequate standard and can be certified.  We must make sure where people are placed that these jobs are genuine, long term jobs rather than perhaps having those people shunted into a work experience programme being run by some other section of the Government system.</P>
    <P>We must go back after six to eight months to clarify whether the people who have been trained are still in employment and to make sure that their training does not fall by the wayside and become lost. It is important that Government Departments, in monitoring these promotional agencies, should do the monitoring themselves and not be content with receiving reports from AnCO or the IDA on the number of approvals, job placements and so on.  It is important that the qualitative aspect, also, be investigated.  The same applies to the IDA and other promotional bodies as to AnCO in the labour area.  As recently as yesterday, the public spending committee were speaking to SFADCo.  It was a cause for concern that it did not seem to be common practice in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and in SFADCo to report on a regular basis as to how a grant approved a number of years ago had actually performed in relation to the number of jobs that were created, the amount of output that was created relative to what was expected.</P>
    <P>It was again a cause of concern that SFADCo can decide on an allocation of funds to building and then discover that, due to changes in plan by companies, the cost escalates.  That is not acceptable, either.  If we decide that we are willing to give grants to a certain level for a certain project, it should not be possible, due to bad planning by a company, for the State to be caught for a larger bill than was originally intended.  In short, Government Departments must take a much tighter control of the various agencies and various programmes being set up, to make sure that we are managing our scarce funds for results.</P>
    <P>I would also put a few suggestions as <Col N="1705" /> to how we could improve the existing aids to employment creation.  It is commonly said that PRSI is a 20 per cent tax on employment and this is true.  It is a wrong incentive to have in our system.  However, I cannot see that we can quickly dismantle a system which is bringing into the Exchequer of the order of £1,000 million a year.  To shift that sort of money into some other section of tax code would cause fearful adjustment problems, in the short term at any rate.  What we need to do now is to go for a vigorous extension of the marginal employment subsidies &mdash; what is known as the employment incentive scheme.  This scheme gives employers expanding their workforce concessions by way of subsidy.  That would amount to a short term, selective reduction in PRSI for such companies. There are problems that one may favour one company which happens to be on the crest of the wave over others.  That is a difficulty.</P>
    <P>We must take our courage in our hands and say that if we are going to provide labour subsidy, we will provide them to the companies able to expand, that we will give that money on a selective basis to those who are expanding.  I would ask the Government to look at the possibilities of vigorously extending that scheme. At present it is payable on a relatively small sum, I think about £30 normal payment and that is for the long term unemployed. It is also only payable for a relatively short period and only for two employees at a maximum.  They are restrictions which could usefully be relaxed.  This scheme could become an important way of expanding employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>A second area where we should consider a new initiative involves the National Development Corporation. That corporation will be looking at new schemes on a green field basis.  We should also be aware that we have tremendous expertise in our existing commercial semi-State companies.  Aer Lingus have shown the way.  They have developed new enterprise out of their main stream, which is the air business.  They have moved into other ancillary activities, like <Col N="1706" /> providing computer services to other airlines and so forth.  Their approach is commendable. We should tell the semi-State bodies that new enterprise is something that we would like to see them developing. That is not currently part of their mandate.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that the Government are going to clarify the mandate of semi-State bodies.  It would be well worth while saying to these companies which have well trained staff that they too, like Aer Lingus, should be thinking of satellite activities which would provide good employment opportunities.  We should not rely exclusively on the National Development Corporation, which will be operating in a green field situation and might not have the skills and knowledge of particular areas that some of the other semi-State bodies have.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point on employment that I see as a gap and that involves the whole area for new people setting up, particularly in the service area, not the manufacturing one.  Under the Youth Employment Agency there is a £3,000 guaranteed loan available for people under 25.  That is a useful approach to helping people who might want to establish a service which would not require a lot of money to get going, but who do not have the security to ask funding of a bank.  It would be very useful to look at the possibility of similar guaranteed loan schemes where the Government would be a guarantor, not necessarily paying interest subsidies.  It would give people the opportunity to establish in service areas.  The service sector has been the Cinderella of State aid for a long time and we must bear in mind that the outlook at present, internationally, is that agriculture and industry are not going to be the generators of employment that we would like them to be.  We must now develop a strategy for services, as well as for the output producing sectors.  A start in that direction would be the possibility of guaranteed loans for establishing in business.</P>
    <P>I should like to move on to the question of public spending.  It is a serious cause of concern that after four or five <Col N="1707" /> years of successive Government trying to tackle the problem of growing public spending, public spending is still creeping up, admittedly at a slower rate, both in absolute, real terms and as a proportion of GNP.  That is of much more serious concern than the question of deficits that tends to be the centre of attention in discussing public finances.  The progressive growth of spending means both borrowing and taxation in the long run.  It is my belief that it is now far more important to tackle the continuing growth of public spending.  Current spending, as a proportion of GNP, is approximately 56 per cent recorded, capital spending approximately 11 per cent.  In addition we must add £1,000 million on social insurance contributions paid out in social welfare that do not normally come into Government spending figures.  Therefore one is talking about another 5 per cent there.</P>
    <P>I should point out that there are understatements in the true liability on current spending sides.  These understatements emanate from the fact that we do not fund pensions of public servants.  If we were, we would need to have a fund now of £6,000 million, the annual servicing of which would be of the order of £9 million. That is something we do not count currently as part of the true liability in Government spending.  Nor do we fund depreciation on past investment.  If those adjustments were effected the true level of State spending, as a proportion of GNP &mdash; instead of the commonly quoted 50 per cent figure &mdash; would be about 77 per cent or 80 per cent liability by the Exchequer.  That is a very serious cause of concern in this economy, that the level of public spending is now effectively .75 per cent of all output produced in the country.  We must begin to turn back that tide.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to ascertain from where the growth in public spending in real terms has emanated over the last five years.  The large sources of growth are not pay and employment in the public sector.  They have been successfully controlled over the years.  The large sources <Col N="1708" /> of growth are in the other areas, particularly interest payments, social welfare payments and other areas of public spending.  In themselves those features of the growth point to what we must do.  We must examine how we can control the growth of the interest.  We must look also at the way we administer our various spending programmes on health, education, social welfare, through to the economic side of the balance.</P>
    <P>I have been privileged to be a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure of this House.  I would say honestly that the level of grasp of how one controls public spending in many of our Government Departments is way below what is needed.  I mentioned already the inadequacies in control of Departments, say in the Departments of Labour and in Industry, over various agencies operating within their responsibility.  The same is true of the Department of Fisheries, the Office of Public Works and other Departments in the way in which they control operations carried out under their responsibility.  I am convinced that if we are to begin, not just to turn back the level of public spending as a proportion of GNP but to get some real value from public spending, to generate economic growth therefrom, in each and every one of our Departments we must tackle the lack of appreciation of what they are endeavouring to achieve and how they set about it.  I do not intend to go into those details.</P>
    <P>In the Committee on Public Expenditure, over the years we shall be afforded an opportunity to pinpoint deficiencies.  I see enormous difficulties in efficient administration in all our Departments. While none of us would support much of the economic policy pursued in the USA and Great Britain we do have something to learn from them in the commissions they have established to investigate efficiency in specific areas of public spending. That approach, adopted by the Grace Commission in the USA and the Rayner scrutinies in the United Kingdom have much to commend themselves to a country like ours with very high public spending and, very often, not sufficient <Col N="1709" /> expertise with in our Government Departments to tackle the problems of managing the resources placed at their disposal.</P>
    <P>We also have a problem in the Department of Finance itself in their approach to the economy on the spending side.  It seems that whenever there is discussion on spending economies the types of proposals put up to Governments by that Department always are in the nature of extra charges for existing services or cuts in various subsidies, such as home improvement grants or whatever, going across the counter to the public.  Never do economies seem to focus on the main body of public service activity.  In our present accounting system the mere fact that increases in charges are shown up, not as taxation but as reducing spending, is wrong.  In other words, if one just looked at the aggregate figures, every time there is an increase in charges it looks as if we are cutting spending.  That should not be.  We should not allow that to continue within our system of accounting because it encourages Departments to look on increases in charges as a way of cutting spending when it is quite blatant that they are not.  Increases in charges are much more akin to taxation than to cuts in spending.  It would be well worth our while amending that provision, in accounting terms, in Government Departments.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it would be well worth our while imposing interest on various Departments that undertake capital projects. For example, in the health area, the Department of Health do not fund the interest component on the construction of their hospitals.  Then we have the situation in which the Department do not look on such things as delays in opening as a real charge on their budget because it is swallowed up in the general body of the Exchequer.  That is a wrong incentive to be giving Government Departments because interest does constitute a real cost, delays constitute real costs and interest should be strictly imposed or any Government Department undertaking any capital project.  If delays occur, if <Col N="1710" /> they fail to plan adequately or whatever, then they should carry the can in their budget.  It should mean also that, when the preparation of Estimates takes place and there is jockeying for position for spending, they should have, if you like, that albatross around their necks for past mistakes with regard to efficiency in the way they planned and executed their investment ideas.</P>
    <P>Public spending control constitutes one of the key areas.  It is not merely what Governments are often accused of when they talk about spending controls: it is not a question of That cherism, monetarism, or whatever.  If public spending is to be a source of generation of growth in the economy, if it is to contribute to improving the possibility of employment in the economy it must be rigorously controlled and scrutinised and we must reap the best results from it.  That is an area to which a very high degree of the public's and the politicians' attention must be devoted in ensuing years because without that approach to public spending we shall have the continuing, creeping growth of spending as a proportion of income that is not diminishing adequately.  In turn this means that in the medium to long term we will face very high interest rates and borrowing levels.  We must knuckle down to getting better value for the State throughout our public spending programmes.</P>

      <P>The Government could not have been in any doubt about what the majority of people wished this budget to do.  Practically everybody outside that small cabal of right-wing Ministers and monetarist economists who are slowly destroying our country clearly see what is needed and what should be done. There is almost universal agreement outside that blinkered circle that the policies which have been implemented over the <Col N="1711" /> past two years have failed and that evidence of that failure becomes more manifest every day and that a radical change in direction is essential.</P>
      <P>The three problems this budget should have confronted are first, the ominous rising tide of mass unemployment with all the social misery and degradation that entails, second, the crushing burden of taxation which is making life impossible for countless thousands of individuals and families and, third, the serious poverty and hardship that exist across the entire community.  Once again we are presented with a budget that fails to confront these three central crucial problems or initiate any worthwhile or significant action in regard to them.</P>
      <P>A few key figures show clearly and starkly how completely present Government policies have failed.  The current budget deficit, the amount which has to be borrowed to run the country, will be £200 million more in 1985 than it was in 1984, going up from £1,039 million to £1,234 million.  Our national debt rose from £12.7 billion to £18.5 billion in the past two years and will go to £21 billion by the end of this year.  Our foreign debt two years ago was £5.29 billion.  It is now practically £8 billion.  Unemployment has climbed to a catastrophic 234,000.  One person in every six in the labour force is now out of work.  It is estimated that up to 35,000 people emigrated in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past two years have been the two most disastrous years in the economic life of the nation since the depression of the 1930s.  The high-tax policies of this Government have contributed greatly to accelerating a deflationary spiral in the economy.  Factory and business closures have followed each other in a dismal procession; as demand has slumped dole queues have lengthened and taxation has reached intolerable levels.  Whatever about the artificial world of economists and Government Ministers the public see clearly that all the unemployment, hardship and cutbacks inflicited on them have been for nothing and the public <Col N="1712" /> finances are worse now than they were two long hard years ago.</P>
    <P>Surely the lesson from these figures should have been clear and should have dictated a totally different type of budget this year.  The policies being pursued have failed to achieve even their own limited monetarist objectives and unless they are reversed and reversed quickly, the damage done to our economy and to the fabric of our society will be irretrievable. In this situation it is cynically dishonest for the Taoiseach in particular to talk about &ldquo;restoring national solvency&rdquo;, &ldquo;turning around the economy&rdquo;, or &ldquo;light at the end of the tunnel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, this Government could retrieve some shared of credibility and honour if they had availed of this budget to frankly and honestly admit that their policies have been totally wrong in Irish circumstances and that they now propose to scrap them and make an entirely new beginning.</P>
    <P>While the official figures show unemployment at its highest recorded level of 234,000 persons unemployed in Ireland today the Chairman of the Youth Employment Agency for one believes that it is a great deal higher still.  The closures and the bankruptcies continue unabated and redundancies at 31,290 in 1984 were the highest ever recorded.  Will the Taoiseach and Government Ministers even now stop political posturing and acknowledge that a rise of 17,000 in two months on an unemployment figure which is already well over 200,000 signals the danger of a total economic collapse?</P>
    <P>The Government, we are told, held a two day meeting recently to try to find their bearings but, whatever from that meeting took, the truth of the matter is that the Government do not know where they are or what they are at.  They have lost any sense of direction they ever had, and are reduced to the pathetic position of producing an economic policy and a budget whose sole objective is political survival</P>
    <P>The document <i>Building on Reality</i>, is already discredited, the unemployment figures at 234,000 are considerably higher than the 220,000 which that document <Col N="1713" /> projected for the end of last year.  The stipulations in the document in regard to public service pay have been made meaningless and irrelevant.  Interest rates have gone up and are staying up, not going down.  Sterling has disimproved significantly relative to the dollar and continues to disimprove.</P>
    <P>There is still apparently no agreement on the basis for the establishment of a National Development Corporation.  We recently had the ridiculous spectacle of an unreal ideological debate about an irrelevant body disposing of assets which no one can be sure it will ever create.</P>
    <P>Public capital investment instead of being increased by the £100 million promised in the Programme for Government has been ruthlessly cut back by far more than that amount.</P>
    <P>The youth employment levy has not been used to create new employment, but largely to replace previous exchequer funding of AnCO and other agencies.  We learned recently that the fund has been illegally raided again in this budget. Where is the social employment scheme promised in <i>Building on Reality?</i></P>
    <P>Government Ministers and their spokesmen have preached about fiscal rectitude and getting the public finances in order.  The Minister for the Public Service in an incredible piece in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last Friday indicated that this had been achieved.  In fact, the results have been truly dismal, despite the harsh policies pursued, policies which have had a disastrous impact on every sector of the economy, on employment and on the living standards of individuals and families.  For this year 1985 the current budget deficit will be £1,234 million or 7.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>According to the Government's document <i>Building on Reality</i> the deficit will be brought down to 5 per cent of GNP in 1987.  Does anyone now really believe that it will be?  To do so would mean coming down a full 3 per cent of GNP in two years.  After this budget there is now no possibility of its doing so and in regard to that crucial aspect also <i>Building on Reality</i> is way off target and totally discredited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1714" /> In <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government set their own figure for the current budget deficit for 1985, a figure not related to any particular criteria or economic standards. They set a very large figure for the deficit around £1,200 million.  That is an enormous deficit which they now claim credit for achieving.  This is a new form of economic achievement.  You set your own targets and then praise yourself for having achieved them.  Coalition spokesmen are going around saying: &ldquo;Well at least the Government balanced the books&rdquo;.  They have not.  The annual accounts will be unbalanced in 1985 by the staggering sum of £1,234 million; the biggest deficit ever. Let us be clear about that: £1,234 million is the biggest deficit ever in amount and also one of the biggest deficits ever in the amount of GNP, 7.9 per cent of GNP.  In 1981, for instance; the current budget deficit was 7.7 per cent of GNP.  In 1985 it will be 7.9 per cent.  Where is the improvement in the public finances? Where is fiscal rectitude today?  As I have already said, it is a dead political duck.</P>
    <P>Despite the savage cutbacks in capital expenditure and investment, the national debt has soared.  During the last two years of Coalition the foreign debt has increased by nearly £3 billion, an amount almost equal to the entire foreign debt incurred up to mid-1981, while the total national debt went from £12.7 billion to £18.5 billion.</P>
    <P>The indirect devaluation against the floating sterling pound in 1983 was a serious mistake by the Minister for Finance which was the principal cause of adding £1,700 million that year to our foreign indebtedness.  It was then compounded by the decision to halt borrowing in the EMS currencies, and to switch our foreign borrowing to dollars and yens.  This was done in the unwarranted belief by the Minister and his advisers that the dollar was going to fall in value. That disastrous error has added hugely to the size of the debt we have to repay. The whole point surely of belonging to a fixed exchange rate system like the EMS was to avoid that sort of thing happening. What the Minister and his officials did <Col N="1715" /> was to gamble irresponsibly with the nation's finances, and lose.</P>
    <P>But the real losers, of course, are those who depend for their income maintenance on the State.  The halving of the food subsidies in 1984 can be recorded as a matter of history as being directly due to the mistake made by Deputy Alan Dukes, Minister for Finance, and his advisers in handling the national borrowing programme.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the Minister for Finance decided to switch most of his borrowing to the domestic market.  I believe this was done for no better reason than because they had for party political purposes preached so much about foreign borrowing. The result was a 2 per cent rise in domestic interest rates at the beginning of December, as a result of which we now have a real rate of interest of 8 per cent to 9 per cent which is unprecedented and seriously damaging to the economy.  Why should people risk investing in productive activity, when they are assured of a growth in the real value of their assets by simply depositing their money in the bank?  No amount of special schemes, grants, or tax incentives will overcome this massive deterrent to risk investment and there is no sign of the much promised early fall in interest rates.  Indeed the latest news in that regard is that not alone will interest rates remain at the present penal level for industry, commerce and trade but, in addition to what the Minister foolishly did in his budget, the Government will be responsible for pushing up mortgage rates for unfortunate hard pressed homeowners.</P>
    <P>By a unique combination of devaluation, badly timed switching of currencies, and excessive domestic borrowing this Government have imposed a great unnecessary burden of disadvantage on the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Before we come to this year's budget, I think we ought to look at what happened to some of the special features of the last budget so that with benefit of that experience we can assess and evaluate some of the propaganda elements in this budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> There was much trumpeting on budget day 1984 about an extra £18 million which in fact amounted to a mere 1 per cent increase in capital expenditure.  What happened to that increase ? Not one extra penny was spent in 1984.  In fact the outturn was even £5 million less than the pre-budget forecast, never mind the £18 million.</P>
    <P>Then there was much made in the 1984 budget also of the income tax relief for long term risk capital.  The impact of that scheme has been absolutely minimal, involving no more than a handful of modest investments.  There were fairly widespread expectations that the scheme would be reviewed and improved this year but it has not been.  It was not even mentioned.  Why not?  Was it never more than a piece of window dressing never seriously intended?</P>
    <P>On the welfare front we had a great outpouring of propaganda about the Government's intention to introduce a family income supplement scheme.  It was announced in the Coalition's 1982, 1983 and 1984 budgets, and was supposed to represent convincing proof of the Government's social conscience.  That no doubt was why it was not introduced till November 1984, and by that time the Government had already made it clear it was going to abolish it again, by 1986. Only 3,000 out of 35,000 eligible persons have applied.</P>
    <P>In so far as the 1984 budget therefore is concerned the track record is not good, with two major flops, the risk capital relief scheme and the family income supplement scheme and a cutback effected even on the lower level of capital investment promised in the budget.</P>
    <P>I would now like to look at some specific aspects of the present budget.  It is nonsense to talk, as one of the more exuberant pro-Government leader writers has actually done, about this budget being mildly reflationary.  It is nothing of the sort.  It is deflationary, the full extent of which only time will show.</P>
    <P>The principal deflationary element in the budget is the reduction in the Capital Budget which follows the pattern set in the two previous budgets.  Before we left <Col N="1717" /> office, we published our capital investment programme for 1983 which totalled £2,135 million.  This was reduced by the Coalition to well under £1,800 million in both 1983 and 1984, which amounts in real terms to a cutback of at least one third.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure, both programme and non-programme, will be actually reduced from £1,916 million in 1984 to £1,851 million in 1985, that is, by £65 million and, of course, by even more in real terms.  This policy carried through to 1987 is in fact the key element of Coalition fiscal policy and is counter, of course, to the international advice the Government are receiving.  Borrowing is to be reduced by the device of squeezing investment, which in effect means even more unemployment.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure, capital and current, will rise by 6½ per cent in 1985 and a significant portion of the rise, perhaps 3 per cent to 4 per cent, will go abroad in interest payments.  The take in receipts on the other hand will rise by 7½ per cent. The Minister is in fact taking £400 million out of the economy in increased taxes, while the increase in supply service and capital expenditure is only £256 million. So up to £140 million or £150 million net is being taken out of the economy or close on 1 per cent of GNP which will have quite a significant deflationary impact in the economy.</P>
    <P>Another important deflationary consequence of Government economic policy is the recent rise in interest rates of 2 per cent.  This has resulted directly from Government borrowing policies.</P>
    <P>It is therefore silly to suggest that the budget is some kind of response to Fianna Fáil's demand for selective reflation. There is no element of reflation in this budget.  The budget continues the deflationary process that commenced with the 1983 budget and has been maintained with such disastrous consequences since.</P>
    <P>The budget did not reduce taxation; it did not even restrict the growth in taxation to the rise in inflation.  Despite specific undertakings given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry, <Col N="1718" /> Trade, Commerce and Tourism indexation has not been introduced.  At this stage most people have done their own calculations, or read the calculations done for them in the newspaper columns. With any sort of a pay rise the vast majority of taxpayers will be paying more tax. There are no real tax reductions for the lower paid.  Indeed, there is no gain for the working family or for those on social welfare in the budget.  It simply means more hardship in the year ahead and for the future.</P>
    <P>The only measurable relief is at the top end of the scale, although even after the budget personal taxation in the upper middle ranges remains much heavier in Ireland than in other countries.  This situation is the product of the 1983 and 1984 Coalition budgets.  This 1985 budget does not, in fact, undo the effects of failing to provide any tax relief in those two years. The Coalition imposed the 65 per cent tax rate two years ago.  Now they want to claim credit for removing it, thereby admitting that it was a mistake in the first place.  The other changes were only cosmetic and of no real benefit to anyone.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the number of VAT rates is welcome, but it should be remembered that it was this Minister for Finance who introduced the ludicrous rate of 35 per cent and only last year added two extra rates, 8 per cent and 18 per cent, to the system.  Does the Minister really deserve our thanks for correcting his own mistakes?  Does he want us to applaud him for undoing the damage he has done over the last two years?  If the VAT rates are simplified now it is because he made them complicated in his two previous budgets.</P>
    <P>If we look at what has happened to VAT in the three and a half years since the disastrous Coalition budget of July 1981 we see that the 10 per cent VAT rate has become 23 per cent the 25 per cent rate thrown in, and the 3 per cent VAT has become 10 per cent with the addition of clothing, footwear and fuel.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day what matters is that VAT will take £122 million more from consumers in 1985 than it did in 1984.  Despite all the propaganda inside <Col N="1719" /> and outside the Government that is the reality.  What is needed is an actual reduction in the weight of taxation.  A reduction in personal taxation must be the priority, but there is also scope for reduction in indirect taxation which would be largely self-financing.  We accept that the Government have accepted some of the economic arguments we have been making over the past two years.  They have accepted that the 35 per cent VAT was disastrous and was leading to severe job losses.  They have accepted the case we made for reducing VAT on newspapers. They have accepted that the limits have been reached as far as excise duties were concerned, and in the case of spirits they even made some reduction. But there is much that they have not accepted and which could have been done with considerable economic benefit.</P>
    <P>I am told that in the case of some theatres they would prefer that the 5 per cent VAT rate would be maintained because the change made will be to their disadvantage.  This arises from the decision of the Minister for Finance to exempt their activities rather than zero rate them.  Can they get nothing right? Can the Minister for Finance, even when he means well, get nothing right?</P>
    <P>The pensioners, the unemployed and families generally have been badly treated by this Government since they came into office and their general circumstances allowed to deteriorate greatly. The substantial real increases given by Fianna Fáil in each of the years 1980 to 1982 have been used as an excuse for a clawback in social welfare increases from 1983 to 1985.  The miniscule increases given this year, 6 per cent and 6½ per cent have been deferred to 11 July, which is a way of defrauding people of part of that increase.  The double payment to the unemployed at Christmas has stopped, and short term welfare benefits have been reduced.  There is no increase in children's allowances.  Pay-related unemployment benefit is being reduced. We in Fianna Fáil had made considerable progress in steadily improving the position of the poorer and weaker sections of the community and we are proud of that, <Col N="1720" /> but the Government have cruelly and heartlessly reversed that progress.</P>
    <P>In many ways the greatest single detrimental aspect of this budget, the most serious and far reaching for the economy, is its treatment of the building and construction industry.  This vital area of this economy has been one of the principal victims of the Minister's misguided budgetary policies.  In budget after budget the Coalition have hammered this key sector of the economy.  Indeed, at times it seems that somewhere in the Government establishment there is an inexplicable malevolence towards building and construction as an industry. Every week that passes sees another few building and construction firms closing down so that the capacity of the industry is being savagely decimated and its reservoir of skills and experience seriously depleted.</P>
    <P>Today employment in the building industry is less than 60 per cent of what it was in the summer of 1981.  Public capital investment in building and construction has been drastically reduced. Private investment has almost dried up. The section 23 incentive has been abolished. This year the budget has increased the tax on the building societies which is now leading to a crucifying rise of 1½ per cent to 2 per cent in house mortgage interest rates.</P>
    <P>This budget provides, unbelievably, that young couples attempting to buy their first home now have to face an increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  The average price of a new house in the Dublin area for instance is £38,500.  A purchaser will therefore have an extra amount of £1,925 in tax on such a house.  Even if the purchaser is eligible for the additional £750 grant there will still be an additional £1,175 to be paid by the average purchaser.  This has caused consternation in the building industry and represents a body blow to this house-building sector of the industry in particular. In the case of thousands of young couples it will put a house of their own entirely out of reach for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Many firms throughout the country <Col N="1721" /> which have been barely hanging on see this as the last straw, the final finishing blow.  This catastrophic decision to place this exhorbitant new tax on houses, in particular, should not be proceeded with. It is both economically unsound and socially unjust.</P>
    <P>It has already been pointed out that the budget makes no contribution whatever toward the improvement or development of the agricultural industry.  There is a great anxiety today in all sections of agriculture about the future and uncertainty about Government policy and intentions. The dairying industry in particular is in a state of chaos and confusion and dairy farmers literally do not know where to turn.  The disease eradication situation is a cause of serious worry and the level of compensation for reactors is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The super levy has been grossly incompetently and inefficiently handled from the start.  Wrong figures were submitted to Brussels, then the case to the European Court was wrongly presented. There is widespread confusion and all Members should realise it, about how the levy is going to be implemented and how the quota system is going to work.  Farmers cannot get reliable information from anyone about exactly what will happen.  The situation is also becoming very divisive between farmer and farmer. It is our intention to seek a Dáil dabate on the present state of the dairying industry in order to try to ascertain the facts and have them clarified for a very worried and uncertain farming community.</P>
    <P>Capital spending for the development of agriculture has been cut by nearly a half in real terms since 1980-82.  The whole situation regarding farmer taxation is once again uncertain, back in the melting pot, following the announcement of the land tax proposals.  It would now seem that the farming organisations are opposing the introduction of the land tax on the one hand, while on the other no arrangements are being made by the Government to actually bring it into operation.</P>
    <P>The motor trade has been experiencing <Col N="1722" /> a very difficult period over the last two years.  They might have expected some measure of assistance in this budget but instead the industry has been put at a further disadvantage and its capacity to provide employment seriously impeded by the increase in VAT on repairs, no reduction in excise duty and the increases in petrol and car tax.</P>
    <P>The Government have in this budget maintained their record of bungling every important issue.  They provided for an additional grant for house purchasers.  At the same time they made sure it would mean nothing by greatly increasing the tax payable on the same house.  They purported to give some tax relief to home owners but at the same time more than cancelled out any benefit from such relief by acting to push up mortgage interests rates.  They abolished VAT on theatre and live performances, but have done it the wrong way so that theatre managers are actually screaming to have their 5 per cent VAT rate back.  They extended optical and dental benefits to married pregnant women, whose husbands are insured, even though, as a leading gynaecologist has pointed out, pregnant women do not tend to have active dental treatment and the cost of visiting a doctor to get a certificate of pregnancy would cost almost as much as they would save.</P>
    <P>They reduced VAT to stop cross-Border shopping, but added a 10p incentive to the already huge gap in the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>These are only a few examples of the inability of this Government to do anything right but rather make a mess of anything they put their hands to.</P>
    <P>More and more Members of this House have noticed that when the present Taoiseach starts to protect his integrity, shout loudly about honesty and hurl abuse at others, it is time to look carefully at the small print and to examine the figures in detail.</P>
    <P>I think we should all look carefully at the makeup of the budget figures and the arithmetic of the budget.  I want to direct the attention of the House, the general public and especially the attention of financial editors and commentators to <Col N="1723" /> one very suspicious group of figures which are included in this budget.</P>
    <P>The Government had set aside £20 million in 1985 for public service pay.  For some time before the budget the strident message was given out again and again by the handlers that this amount was all the Exchequer could afford and that there could be no departure from that limit.  Some short time however before budget day, it was decided to abandon this posture and to accept the arbitrator's public service pay award even though this meant an additional amount of expenditure of £108 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>Let us put aside at this stage the fact that this represented a major turn around in Government policy and look only at the budgetary implications of this decision. The Government were forced at the last minute to find an extra £88 million, that is, the £108 million less the £20 million already provided for.  Now if we look at the budget we find a strange coincidence. There are two particular figures in the budget table which are not measured exactly but which have to be estimated. One of these is revenue buoyancy and the other is estimated savings on staff costs.  In the budget table revenue buoyancy is put in at £58 million and the savings on staff expenditure are put in at £30 million.  By an extraordinary coincidence these two estimated amounts give exactly the amount which is needed to make up the extra £88 million needed to pay the arbitrator's award.  What an extraordinary coincidence &mdash; or is it?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the budget table, and the arithmetic set out in the table, to which I believe it is also necessary to direct attention.  For the first time ever as far as I can recall there is included in the budgetary arithmetic in order to make the figures balance a sizeable sum of £28.6 million for extra cuts in expenditure which are not outlined anywhere. This is a very dubious procedure.  Until this one, the budget speech and the budget tables every year disclosed the full picture &mdash; everything was revealed on budget day in the budgetary documentation. This year however this is not the case.  We have not been given the details <Col N="1724" /> of cuts in the public expenditure which amount to the sizeable sum of £28.6 million. A week after budget day these details are still not being disclosed even though we have frequently pressed for them.  If this information and the details of this amount of cuts is available, why were they not set out on budget day or since?  We must conclude either that they have not been made and that there is no list of specific cuts, or alternatively that the Government are seeking to avoid the unpopularity involved in disclosing them. Either way it amounts to nothing more or less than trickery.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for in the budget for unemployment is based on a figure of 217,000 which has already proved to be inadequate.  I want to suggest that these three elements &mdash; the extraordinary coincidence of the £88 million, the nondisclosure of the details of the £28.6 million of cuts in expenditure and the under provision for unemployment &mdash; cast serious doubts on the authenticity of this budget, its arithmetic and its presentation. As I have said, the blustering of the Taoiseach in the House when we were debating the budgetary resolutions created the very distinct impression of a man trying very hard to cover up something because he had something to cover up.</P>
    <P>This budget is not a plan for economic recovery; it is not even a plan for the economy.  It is an attempt by clever manipulation of the different elements to create an impression which will moderate some of the rising criticisms in the Fine Gael and Labour backbenches and restore some political morale in both parties.  That is what it is all about.  This budget owes more to the little man who carries out the public opinion polls than it does to the economists in the Department of Finance, that is if there are any economists left in the Department; I believe they have all resigned.</P>
    <P>Most people hoped that the budget would do something major about unemployment and providing jobs, but there is nothing in the budget that will actually create one single job or provide a glimmer of hope to the countless thousands anxiously seeking them.  It should be <Col N="1725" /> clearly understood that outside the public sector the jobs we need must in practice be provided by business firms and commercial organisations.  Despite this the extraordinary fact is that in a variety of different ways businesses, large and small, are at present hindered and discouraged by Government policy and actions from employing more people.</P>
    <P>The most important determinant of business performance is the environment in which it has to operate.  The Government's own short-lived Planning Board had commented: &ldquo;A favourable climate for economic activity is far more important in determining the level and pattern of industrial output and employment than the set of measures that are included in industrial policy&rdquo;&mdash;page 205.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation in their &ldquo;incentives&rdquo; report notes that the level of economic activity is affected much more by the general economic policy of the Government than by any set of specific measures labelled &ldquo;incentives&rdquo;. Government decisions about public expenditure, the overall level of taxation money supply and interest rates in particular, have more fundamental effects on economic growth than any incentives which may be provided.  The report states that, if general economic policies create a climate that is unfavourable to economic expansion, incentives to compensate cannot provide a long-term solution.  In that quotation we have the whole ethos of the mistaken economic policies of this Government.</P>
    <P>Despite these clear-cut pronouncements this Government have created the most hostile environment for economic expansion in the past 30 years.  Government policies in countless ways are actually adding to the difficulties of business and impeding firms from expanding employment.  Their contribution to that environment has been to decrease demand by reducing expenditure and increasing taxation while at the same time stifling enterprise through high rates of income tax.  At present the overall business environment is much worse than it need be because of the overall economic recession or the state of the public <Col N="1726" /> finances.  This unfavourable environment positively militates against natural growth and the normal developments of business opportunities and the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>No effort is being made to eliminate or even mitigate the factors which act as a disincentive to employers to actually employ people.  The manner in which PRSI is operated, for instance, has been frequently indentified as one such disincentive.</P>
    <P>A good industrial relations situation is another essential element for business growth, but despite promises and lip service absolutely nothing is done in this area.  The relationship between this Government and the trade union movement is one of confrontation rather than consultation.  Furthermore, by their shameful and despicable treatment of a dedicated group of their own employees in Irish Shipping they have set an appalling example to private employers.</P>
    <P>Irish business and in particular manufacturing industry are being seriously affected also by high interest rates, but Government financial policies take no account of this aspect and in fact, as I have already pointed out, have actually pushed interest rates up.</P>
    <P>There are other negative features of the present environment some of which are not widely recognised.  The penalties they impose are no less serious.  The conference on small firms held as part of the European Year of Small and Medium Enterprises in September 1983 named, and I use the words advisedly, &ldquo;imposed paperwork&rdquo; as a business deterrent and called on Governments &ldquo;to implement a paperwork reduction programme for SMES within two years&rdquo;.  I would like to suggest the establishment of a task force drawn from the people involved in CII, CTT, Government Departments, and so on, to devise a simplified set of procedures and documentation to eliminate this major bureaucratic bottleneck.</P>
    <P>We would have made this budget into a national economic action plan, combining general economic policies favourable to growth with specific individual sectoral programmes and projects.  We see an <Col N="1727" /> urgent need for selective reflation.  The degree and the tempo of reflation is a valid subject for debate and I wish to totally reject suggestions that Fianna Fáil are interested only in recklessly raising the level of demand.  We are not.  Our reflationary efforts would be carefully anchored to sound viable expenditure proposals.  We are, in fact, simply acknowledging the desperate need there is to reverse the current appalling downward spiral into which present policies have pushed us further and further.</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil we remain convinced of the scope there is and the need that exists for selective reductions in indirect taxation, that there are areas in which the amount of revenue lost by the reduction would be substantially if not totally recouped by the increase in the level of activity generated by the reduction in tax. The situation in the Border areas where substantial revenue was being lost by the Exchequer because of the high VAT and excise rates in this part of the island is clearly a case for an intelligent application of this principle.  We cannot understand why the Minister having started the process and, as far as we can see, carried out an entirely successful experiment in regard to spirits, did not take his courage in his hands and go much further along that line in the budget.  There was in our view in this budget scope for substantially more cuts in indirect taxation in addition to spirits.  We must ask whether the Government have fully explored all the possibilities for such reductions and analysed the relevant data and not just the revenue implications in isolation but the economic considerations as well.  If they have then I believe this analysis and the conclusion should be given to the House, so that we could at least see that the Government had done their work and had some basis for deciding not to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is increasingly clear to us that the present level of personal taxation is seriously discouraging both enterprise and effort.  We are firmly convinced that with imagination, careful analysis and <Col N="1728" /> selection there is a scope for reductions in taxation which would have entirely beneficial economic results and which would reduce the tax take by less than the initial cost of the tax cuts.  To recognise this, however, requires the ability to transcend the present fixation with statistics and arithmetic and consider the dynamic consequences and possibilities of specific alternatives, particularly in the form of tax reductions.</P>
    <P>Careful reduction of indirect and direct taxation can certainly help to reverse the downward trend in demand and promote specific forms of worthwhile economic activity by encouraging enterprise and initiative.</P>
    <P>We have consistently argued that capital expenditure rigorously evaluated in terms of future returns is a vital necessity for a recovery strategy.  This view which again sets an emphasis on sensible policy evaluation and decision making rather than expertise in book balancing and arithmetic is broadly supported by the recent NESC comments on the Government plan.  The National Planning Board have also concluded that foreign borrowing is an appropriate means of financing productive investment by the public sector.  That is a very important conclusion. Such expenditure has the double merit of improving the efficiency of the economy in, for example, raising infrastructure quality and directly employing workers in construction projects with high domestic economic content.  Any construction activity has the crucial merit of immediate and direct employment creation. Carefully and prudently selected projects would also facilitate a rise in the long term economic growth rate.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency it is necessary to embark on a programme of capital investment as a shortrun measure to boost economic activity and raise employment but with the added criterion that it improves the long term potential of the economy.</P>
    <P>The extension of the natural gas grid to all major centres which should be undertaken immediately is an excellent example of what Fianna Fáil have in mind in regard to capital development and borrowing <Col N="1729" /> for productive capital purposes.  I do not know how any economist or official in the Government can possibly argue against the immediate all-out expansion of the natural gas grid.  All over the country, there are forms of industry and business enterprise which would benefit immediately from having natural gas available to them and the original capital expenditure would be adequately financed.  It is typical of the sort of mental block that the Government suffers from that they are not proceeding immediately with that important work of national development.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to consider seriously an accelerated programme of local community social facilities for young people. The returns from such projects are less direct but are real nonetheless.</P>
    <P>The nature and type of the specific projects can, of course, and indeed should be the subject of debate but what is beyond doubt is that such potential projects exist in the tourist area; in high technology; in the energy field, in food processing, engineering and in eliminating infrastructural bottlenecks and roadblocks. Once again we must ask if the Government have specifically considered fully and in the round an injection of about £200 million in carefully evaluated capital projects having full regard to the beneficial impact on employment and economic activity which would follow and the return from income tax and PRSI and savings in unemployment payments which would arise.</P>
    <P>We need a more positive approach to industrial policy.  Our present approach is passive.  The State provides various schemes of assistance, grants and incentives and then we hope that someone will come forward and take them up.  We must be more specific, selective and active.  We should, for instance, establish a product identification centre, a body whose task it is to investigate and identify particular products, especially products related to our national resources, or arising out of new technology.  A specific Government agency should then be responsible for seeking out individuals or <Col N="1730" /> companies to manufacture these products.</P>
    <P>The time has come for another major national effort to develop and expand the potential of the tourist industry.  An essential part of any such programme, of course, is a major revision of the entire taxation situation and not just the limited cuts made in the budget.  But, as in manufacturing industry, there should be a specific, selective approach.  It should be the responsibility of Bord Fáilte to identify specific tourist target groups and put together carefully designed packages for them and centres to cater for them.  Suitable areas should be identified and all the necessary amenities and facilities provided to cater for these special groups. What we must aim at is an active policy directed at specific targets and not merely an overall blanket, passive approach.</P>
    <P>There should be a new comprehensive look at the potential of our forestry industry with a view to formulating a clear-cut policy with specific economic and employment objectives.  There have been enough studies and investigations and papers.  What we need now is a policy and the implementation of that policy.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in Fianna Fáil, we developed the concept of a national hire agency.  I believe that this concept should be reviewed and that such a body could play an important role in the present mass unemployment situation.  There are many individuals, groups, companies and organisations who would be prepared to employ people for shorter or longer periods of time, but are not able or willing to undertake all the bureaucratic obligations involved.  If there were a body which was prepared to make employees available for particular periods in return for one simple straightforward payment, I believe this could have a significant effect.</P>
    <P>The whole position in regard to our labour exhanges, Manpower and AnCO is chaotic.  We cannot really suggest that we are serious about providing employment as long as the present structures remain.  What is needed is one body responsible for the whole area, which <Col N="1731" /> will co-ordinate all the work involved in bringing the people and the jobs that are available together immediately and directly.</P>
    <P>Each of our RTCs should establish an enterprise resource centre for local industry and I believe this could be achieved by a re-allocation of existing resources within the college.  In each of the RTCs there is a pool of technical knowledge and administrative expertise which should be brought together to bring forward ideas for starting new enterprises locally and supplying management, research and other high level services for local firms.</P>
    <P>I believe we should look back to the sort of broad agreement and consensus on national economic and social objectives which were secured in the national understandings of a few years ago and devise some similar kind of mechanism to deploy private sector management, trade union leadership, the scientific establishment, third level education institutions and all other relevant sectors fully behind clearly defined economic policy objectives.</P>
    <P>Because there is no coherent economic policy, no clear national economic objectives, nothing with which the entire economic community can identify, the pursuit of selfish sectional interests, at the expense of the economy and the community, has reached alarming proportions. This can, to a great extent, be attributed to the fact that in the right wing philosophy of this Fine Gael dominated Government, employees are not seen as having, through their trade unions, any part to play in economic planning or management. This is a basic and fundamental mistake which must be rectified.  If we are to mobilise all the resources of the community to overcome the present critical situation, the full co-operation of the trade union movement is vital.</P>
    <P>The national understandings achieved a great deal in their day in mobilising the economic community behind certain specific economic policy objectives. Whether we reconstitute them in the same or some different form today I <Col N="1732" /> believe something along those lines is necessary instead of the Government proceeding with their own monetarist economic policies and every day coming into confrontation with some group or other in the community.  We cannot achieve economic progress that way nor can we begin to tackle the unemployment problem so long as that position prevails and as long as sectional interests cannot see any overall national objective and are just driven back to pursuing their own narrow sectional group interests.</P>
    <P>I recently had the opportunity to visit the two exhibitions in the RDS in Ballsbridge.  One was the Aer Lingus sponsored Young Scientist of the Year exhibition and the other was the Craft Trade Fair.  Anybody visiting those two exhibitions and seeing the sheer brilliance, the competence and the initiative of our young scientists and seeing the quality, attractiveness and imagination of small firms and individuals engaged in the craft industry in every part of the country can only ask in amazement why a country which has such a wealth of natural ability is not one of the most prosperous in the world.  The talent is there, the ability and imagination are there, but the failure is at the level of national economic management. There have been enough studies, investigations, papers, analysis; a recent NESC report lists ten such projects which are ongoing.  What is needed now are decisions and action.  It is time for a Government, not this one because they no longer have the will or the capacity but the next one, to decide that our salvation lies in our own hands, that what we need is positive action and leadership.</P>
    <P>As a nation we can react in two different ways to the present economic difficulties. We can despairingly accept the worst, as this Government have done, keep our fingers crossed and hope that things might get better or at least that they will not get worse.  On the other hand we can direct our minds and our efforts towards finding solutions, towards overcoming rather than accepting the constraints and the difficulties.  This is the more difficult approach and, of course, one that involves taking risks.  It is much <Col N="1733" /> easier to persuade ourselves that nothing can be done or that we must wait for all the problems to ease before seriously aiming at the solutions.  That is essence the course of action being followed at present.</P>
    <P>We are in a self-defeating vicious circle of business closure, rising unemployment, under utilisation of productive resources all of which result in a diminishing tax base allied to a rising bill for social welfare causing further Exchequer difficulties.  What is needed is to break out of this trap by reversing the downward trend.</P>
    <P>There are many constraints on any strategy to revitalise the economy, the major ones, of course, being the size of the current budget deficit and the balance of payments.  But these constraints are not an insurmountable barrier to any attempt at progress as this Government believe.  The do not mean that we must wait possibly a long while for time to bring a change.  That is not acceptable, it is the worst kind of defeatism to say that nothing can be done and therefore nothing is done.  It is in times of difficulty and constraints that creative ideas and positive leadership are really needed.</P>
    <P>The right way forward is a combination of selective measures to revive demand and to initiate prudent expenditure programmes. The objective must be to make the economy more efficient and effective and to create the environment which fosters business growth rather than to penalise it.  The criterion for public expenditure and taxation decisions should be efficiency and return on investment and not the present totally counterproductive balancing of the books.  It is both rational and indeed desirable for Governments to borrow and invest in projects which produce a reasonable return.  A classic example is a toll bridge which is in effect self-financing and there are many others which given the right climate of encouragement will manifest themselves to groups and individuals in every part of the country.</P>
    <P>This Coalition have been very obviously copying the political and economic policies of the monetarist Government <Col N="1734" /> in Britain, though there is absolutely no comparison between the two economies.  Britain is a large country, with a long established industry, worldwide investments and above all the huge resource of North Sea oil, providing revenue for the Exchequer of £1,014 billion pounds sterling a year.</P>
    <P>Monetarist policies in Britain have devastated even that economy.  Because of our relatively underdeveloped economy monetarist policies are creating even more lasting and deeper havoc here.</P>
    <P>This Government's mistaken policies, lack of direction and incompetent performance have created a national emergency. Mass unemployment threatens the very fabric of our society and community life.  Law and order are no longer maintained over an increasingly wide area. People were crying out for a budget that would do something to restore morale and offer hope for the future.  Instead, they have got a dishonest, cynical exercise in political expediency which has already been exposed within a week. Unemployment will not come down. Taxes will not be lowered.  The position of the less well off, the handicapped and the underpriviledged and those on lower incomes will be greatly worsened. Benefits that appear to have been given in some directions will be cancelled out before they are even realised.</P>
    <P>This budget, with every day that passes, is disintegrating in front of our eyes.  The alleged benefits are melting away like snow on a ditch.  I doubt if there has ever been a budget which has died such a sudden death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government were responsible for the most extraordinary mismanagement of the economy and for them to suggest that the arithmetic in our budget is dubious is nothing short of impudent.  Let us look at some of the figures in detail.  The budget has been criticised by some Opposition spokesmen on the basis that not enough has been done in regard to the current budget deficit and the complaint has been made that what has been achieved is at variance with what was proposed initially by the Government.  That is true. I readily accept that in 1981 and for some time thereafter it seemed feasible to eliminate the current budget deficit by 1987. However, Deputies on all sides will recall the advice of the National Planning Board last year to the effect that the target should be the elimination of the structural component on the current budget deficit by 1987.  Adverse international developments since 1981 have made the achievement of the original target of eliminating the current budget deficit not only very difficult but undesirable because of the deflationary effect it would have on the economy.  For that reason the Government proposed in the national plan for the years 1985 to 1987 to reduce the current budget deficit to 5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this point because it has been suggested recently by the Leader of the Opposition that somehow the Government's efforts &mdash; and, more important, the people's efforts &mdash; since 1981 have not been worthwhile because the original target for 1987 will not be reached.  Nothing could be further from <Col N="1738" /> the truth.  Let us look at what has been achieved.  First, the public finances are under control.  Everyone can remember the chasm that opened up between budgetary projections and actual results in the years 1979 to 1982 when the Leader of the Opposition was Taoiseach, the person who now speaks of &ldquo;dubious&rdquo; arithmetic.  Let us look at the record during those years and see what right has that Deputy to talk in this House about dubious arithmetic.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the current deficit was projected in the budget at £289 million.  It turned out at £522 million, an incredible 81 per cent in excess of the projection. In 1980 the current deficit was 58 per cent in excess of the projection; in 1981 it was 62 per cent and by 1982 they were making progress because they were down to 48 per cent.  Dr. Whitaker made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The under estimation of current deficits and, consequently, of the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been so seriously disproportionate as to invalidate the whole budgetary exercise.</P>
    <P>And now they speak of dubious arithmetic. Departing from that horrific, unforgettable background, this Government were able in 1984 to have the budget deficit outturn within target &mdash; the first time that happened since 1978.  Public finances are firmly under control.</P>
    <P>Second, the Government's actions since 1981, but more particularly since resuming office in 1982 after the unfortunate few months of GUBU rule, have contained the explosive growth in Government borrowing that was inherent in our predecessors' actions.  The national plan points out:</P>
    <P>In the budgets since July 1981 the total corrective action for both raising taxation and reducing expenditure has, with the associated savings on debt service, reduced the potential deficit by almost £1,000 million.</P>
    <P>In other words, the current budget deficit at the end of 1984 would be almost £1,000 <Col N="1739" /> million higher than now expected if corrective action had not been taken from July 1981.</P>
    <P>Third, we have seen the Government bring stability to financial and economic policy with their national plan <i>Building on Reality</i>.  Never before in the history of the State have a Government planned economic and social policy, Department by Department, over a period of years and informed the public in detail of the resources available in each area until the end of this, their first term in office.</P>
    <P>Fourth, key indicators have begun to move in the right direction.  Last year real gross domestic product grew by almost 3½ per cent, a rate of growth appreciably faster than the average for the rest of the European Community.  Further, inflation has been curbed from the level of 17 per cent and higher that we experienced in 1982 and before.  Since last year we have been down to single figures.  In the 12 months to mid-November last, the year on year average increases in consumer prices slowed to 6¾ per cent and we can with confidence rely on having a rate of 6 per cent or lower, the lowest rate we have experienced since 1968.</P>
    <P>There has been an exceptionally good response to the budget and perhaps this explains some of the unease of the response of the Opposition.  Many have said this is because for most people disposable income will be higher in 1985 than previously and because taxation has been reformed radically for the better. While this is true, I think there is a deeper perception that the Government have skilfully and with little damage to the economy brought us to the point where we are well placed for the sustained economic expansion envisaged in the national plan.  They did this while supporting social welfare at levels above inflation.</P>
    <P>Of course the pessimists point to our undoubted problem of unemployment. However, they forget what the unemployment picture would have been if the Government had not stopped the slide to the status of a banana Republic under the populist policies of the Leader of the Opposition.  The enormous annual <Col N="1740" /> increases in unemployment occurred under the stewardship of the Opposition. The Opposition now have no constructive remedies to offer, apart from those curious animals that inhabit their jungle, of self-financing tax cuts and this new concept of pumping £200 million into our economy which, apparently will also be self-financing.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to youth policy.  This Government gave a commitment to adopt a national youth policy.  In September 1983 the Taoiseach established a committee chaired by Mr. Justice Declan Costello of the High Court.  He personally appointed the committee and received the report and thus he demonstrated at the highest level the priority the Government attach to identifying and meeting the needs of young people.  It was a clear indication the Government would not treat lightly those needs and would act on the recommendations of the report of the National Youth Policy Committee.  The fact that the Government ensured that the report was published within one month of its submission was clear evidence of the determination of the Government to introduce and implement a national youth policy.  Currently we are engaged in the formulation of the Government's response based on that report, taking into account the considered views of youth organisations, State bodies, Government Departments and other interested people which I requested as part of the necessary process of consultation.  I am particularly concerned that young people should have an adequate opportunity to participate in the whole process of policy review and formulation, so it was with some enthusiasm that I accepted the very last suggestion in the Costello report that a popular version of the report be published which would be aimed at promoting understanding and discussion of the issues raised among young people.  That popular version was produced and published in record time and it emerged on 10 December of last year under the title <i>Looking for Action</i>.  With the co-operation of the National Youth Council and the Institute of Public Adminstration, <Col N="1741" /> the effect of it has been that the work of the Costello Committee has been made available to every second level school in the country and to very many youth groups also.  In all, some 20,000 copies of <i>Looking for Action</i> have been distributed. Young people all over the country are being asked to respond to the report and make their views known on a whole range of issues which affect them.</P>
    <P>I see the report as a landmark in the development of services to young people. It is charting the way towards a national, but not nationalised, youth service, and providing an analysis of the position of young people in society and the trends and prospects that face them over the next decade.  Quite clearly that view is shared by all concerned with youth work and the evidence of that is that the report has been sold out and the Stationery Office are now engaged in a reprint.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government committed themselves to establishing a youth policy for International Youth Year.  It said that such a youth policy &ldquo;will have its own distinctive purposes&rdquo; but will interact with other policies and measures.  The policy will be aimed at assisting all young people to become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society.  It will include a clear philosophy of youth development and a statement of principle to guide Government policy, an objective assessment of the factual position of young people in contemporary Ireland and a detailed plan for the provision of services to young people generally and to disadvantaged young people in particular.</P>
    <P>In the context of their work on the national plan and even in advance of having had an opportunity to consider the report, the Government set aside an additional £1.5 million for youth services. That allocation allows for flexibility which facilitates planning on a response to the priorities outlined in the report. The national plan in this year's budget also responds to the need identified in the report for recreational facilities for young people by providing for an allocation of <Col N="1742" /> £3 million in capital support for community and youth facilities.</P>
    <P>The report recognises, rightly, and pays tribute to the work of voluntary youth organisations in providing services for young people.  I share the report's view that the future development of a comprehensive youth service should be firmly based on the promotion and development of voluntary and community involvement in the delivery of services. The Government have been subject to recent criticism which alleged that the Estimate provided for an increase of the order of only 3 per cent to youth organisations. Let us look at the facts.</P>
    <P>The subhead from which youth organisations are funded has been increased from £2.222 million in 1984 to £2.8 million in 1985, an increase not of 3 per cent, as some people have suggested, but of 26 per cent.  While there is always room for imaginative mathematics, anyone capable of doing mathematics which would produce an answer of 3 per cent for an increase from 2.2 to 2.8 would be an unusual mathematician indeed.  I assure youth organisations that the subhead includes provision for increases in grants in line with cost of living increases, provided that the organisation in question meet the criteria for effectiveness under the youth service grants scheme.  The subhead also includes £500,000 for the implementation of the youth policy, and that will be targeted particularly at areas of deprivation.  Of course, youth organisations will stand to benefit from those moneys to the extent that they can respond to the priorities for youth service as outlined in the Costello report.</P>
    <P>This year, 1985, holds the potential of being a very special year in the development of young people in communities in our country, because this year has been designated International Youth Year by the General Assembly of the UN.  The three central themes for the year are participation, development and peace.  In accordance with the wishes of the UN, the Government established a national committee to plan, stimulate, co-ordinate and assist activities for the year. This committee, known as the National <Col N="1743" /> Committee for International Youth Year, are representative of youth, Government, trade union, employer and vocational education interests.</P>
    <P>The task of the committee has been to generate general awareness of the very special nature of the year to encourage activities and initiatives in favour of young people by interests, voluntary and statutory, throughout the country, and to assist the exchange of information in relation to activities.  In establishing the National Committee for International Youth Year the Government made provision for a sum not exceeding £140,000 initially to facilitate their operation in developing a countrywide response to IYY.  Furthermore, in order to give a wide variety of interests and opportunity to participate in preparation for the year at national level, I established an advisory council representative of a large number of voluntary and statutory bodies to assist the committee in their work.  In their approach to and preparations for IYY, the committee have endeavoured to secure widespread action for and by young people at national and local level. The main thrust of preparation has been towards locally inspired planning and action.  The support of the country's VECs has been obtained in promoting and assisting activity for IYY throughout the country.  As I have suggested, it is potentially a very special year which can signal valuable changes in the development of our national community.  It is the common cause which can begin to restore the faith of young people in themselves and their community.</P>
    <P>Clearly, for the year to be meaningful and of real benefit it must reach young people in the communities where they live.  An essential element in the preparation of IYY is the participation of young people in deciding on the manner in which it should be observed.  Many thousands of young people will participate in activities and projects of various kinds throughout the year.  This signals their desire to accept a greater and more responsible role in the development of their communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> The adult community also must make an equally generous response if the year is to prove a significant initiative.  We must be clear that it will not just happen; it must be made to happen through participation by and co-operation between young people and adults.  Throughout the country youth, sport, community, statutory and other bodies have been working together to develop initiative which will give IYY a meaningful and lasting presence in our country.  This is the opportunity which the year presents.  It brings together a wide range of youth and community agencies to explore and develop ways of maximising participation by young people in their communities.</P>
    <P>This Government have proved themselves sensitive in a most practical way to the vital importance of local initiative and voluntary effort in the preparation and observance of IYY.  Their initial financial allocation enabled the national committee to provide £43,500 to VECs for the promotion of activities at local level, £37,500 or thereabouts to national governing bodies of organisations in support of specific initiatives of a national dimension, and £3,000 approximately in respect of activities by other bodies. However, recognising the popular desire to make 1985 a time of real progress through action by and on behalf of young people, the Government made provision in the budget for £150,000 to fund initiatives for young people during IYY.  This will enable further financial support to be given to activities planned throughout the country and, thereby, facilitate the continuing and growing momentum for the year, particularly at local level.</P>
    <P>This year will also see the launch of the President's award scheme.  Similar award schemes in many countries have proved their ability to encourage and stimulate the enthusiasm and energies of young people by presenting them with a challenging programme.  The President's award scheme will not be a youth organisation. It will be available to young people in any organisation or indeed, perhaps most important, in none.  It will be a programme of practical, cultural and adventurous activities which will help <Col N="1745" /> young people to acquire self-reliance and a sense of responsibility to others, two essential qualities in citizenship.  It will not be competitive, as the awards will be within the potential reach of all young people.  Dr. Tony O'Reilly has accepted the invitation of the Taoiseach to be chairman of the Committee for the promotion of this scheme and, I am pleased to say, he has convinced a wide range of leading business people that the awards scheme can be a potent force in developing the qualities of maturity and responsibility in young people.  I am confident and expect that the business community will see the obvious benefits of going in with the State in partnership in investing in this scheme.  International Youth Year will sow many seeds which will take firm root in the years ahead.  I am convinced that the foundation of the President's Award will be seen, in years to come, as one of the greatest fruits of this vital year.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House will be aware that in the past there was a system of support for temporary employment measures undertaken at community level by way of the grant scheme for youth employment.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been reviewed and henceforth will be known as Teamwork. The scope of projects has been changing since the Government decision to remove from the scheme projects involving works of a construction nature which will now be undertaken by AnCO under their community and training programme.  The type of projects which might be aided include youth services, sport activities &mdash; coaching &mdash; social services, community services, cultural, drama and artistic activities.  Any worthwhile proposal will be considered.</P>
    <P>The £6 million being made available under this heading will allow the employment of over 3,000 persons on a programme for an average of six months duration.  In addition to the grants of £70 and £105, supervisors sponsors may claim running costs to a maximum of 15 per cent of the total wages grant.  A new feature of the scheme is that larger projects will be considered, for example, sponsors who can provide employment <Col N="1746" /> for over 20 young people for a period of 12 months.  They can then become managing agents and instead of the 15 per cent running costs grant, a sum of £850 per annum can be paid for each Teamwork place, enabling such an organisation to employ a manager.  I am sure this will represent a substantial improvement on the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Government had anticipated the findings of the Costello Report and the recommendation that a system of support for community and recreational facilities be established.  My Department operate the community, youth, recreational and employment programme which provides financial assistance to community groups to enable them to employ contractors to undertake on their behalf works on the construction of community &mdash; recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to say that a sum of £1.93 million is provided in my Department's Vote for this programme in 1985 which is an increase in anticipated expenditure of 192.4 per cent.  We hear a lot about cutbacks but there cannot be many subheads in the Estimates that have recorded an increase of that dimension. Of this figure, £.93 million has been allocated to meet existing commitments to projects in the course of construction or just about to commence, having been approved earlier.  As indicated in <i>Building on Reality</i>, the Government have allocated a sum of £1 million in 1985 towards assisting new projects under the programme.  Application forms for participation in this scheme are available from my Department.  One other feature of importance I should mention is that a new face lift grant scheme will be introduced. This will provide capital grant assistance to youth organisations who wish to improve existing facilities.  From my travels throughout the country in the past two and a half years, I know that many organisation meet in halls that are unsuitable for their needs.  This new provision will enable such groups to come together with a proposal to improve their existing facilities.  This move has received an enthusiastic welcome from youth <Col N="1747" /> organisations and I trust that it will result in improving facilities in the next three years.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism, some of it from the Leader of the Opposition today, of a duplication and overlap of educational and training activities.  For that reason, about this time last year, I was asked by the Taoiseach to serve as Minister of State at both the Departments of Labour and Education with specific responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>In discharging my brief I have had detailed discussions with all the parties concerned including the educational, training and manpower agencies, teacher trade unions, employer bodies, the ICTU and other professional bodies.  On the basis of these exhaustive discussion I have formulated proposals which have been agreed between the Ministers for Education and Labour and which will be before the Government shortly for formal approval.</P>
    <P>Last year in the course of the debate on the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure on their proposal to establish a centralised State agency for persons registering for employment or training, I stated that following my examination I accepted, and had to accept, that the institutional arrangements could be improved but that it seemed to me that there was little evidence of waste of public funds due to duplication and overlap. I wish to repeat that because those criticisms have continued to be made.  It is worth making the point that the criticism is usually of a very generalised nature and that specifics are rarely if ever forthcoming.  Having said that, I recognise that institutional arrangements can be improved and the thrust of my report is designed to lead to greater co-operation between the various agencies which in turn will lead to a better delivery of services.</P>
    <P>With the present high levels of unemployment the transition from education to working life is an important stage in the lives of young people and all the agencies involved in this area must concentrate their efforts in helping these <Col N="1748" /> young people to make the transition successfully and not dissipate their energies in inter-agency demarcation disputes. One of the recommendations of my report proposes to develop the National Manpower Service as the single riser point of contact and as part of this role to have close liaison with the Department of Education in identifying young persons coming on to the labour market who may have problems in making the transition from education to working life.  This liaison with the Department of Education will be a key element in the implementation of the EC social guarantee commitment which is an important new development in the area of transition from education to working life.  The social guarantee involves a commitment by EC member states to do their utmost to ensure that all young people leaving compulsory education can benefit from a period of full time training and/or initial work experience of at least six months duration.  Responsibility for the co-ordination of measures to meet the social guarantee commitment was assigned to the Youth Employment Agency who, following consultation with all relevant bodies, including the education authorities have made the necessary arrangements.  These arrangements provide for the flow of information between the education system and the National Manpower Service and for full liaison between the manpower service and other manpower agencies to ensure that adequate programme places are available.  To be fully effective the social guarantee commitment will require close co-operation between the education and manpower authorities and I have no doubt but that this will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In the course of my review it was evident that there was considerable scope for making maximum use of resources within the public sector through increased contracting of AnCO programmes to the educational sector.  I have therefore recommended that the educational system should have a first option on all relevant AnCO programmes provided they meet requirements in regard to standards, quality and cost and I am happy <Col N="1749" /> to say that arrangements are in train to give effect to that proposal.  My review was mainly concerned with existing arrangements and to see how best they can be improved.  However, in the course of the review it was evident that a more fundamental examination of policies and institutions was necessary.  It seemed to me that much of the concern about duplication and overlap was due to a lack of clarity as to the respective roles of the various agencies and as to policy in general.  It is obvious to me that the resolution of some of those fundamental questions could be achieved only on the basis of a general review of manpower policy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In relation to the suggested &ldquo;illegal raiding&rdquo; which Deputy Ahern has been referring to over the last few days, from what I have said it will be clear that education and training must be very closely linked in order to provide the best possible services for young people.  That is why this whole area of co-operation between the manpower and educational authorities was assigned to me and why I was given a specific brief on that area. In line with the determination to ensure co-operation between the educational and manpower areas a number of relevant educational programmes are taken into account where the proceeds of the youth employment levy are being allocated. The final allocation for 1985 has now been agreed and has been fixed as follows &mdash; Youth Employment Agency, £8.7 million; AnCO, £40 million; National Manpower Service, £.75 million; CERT, £2 million; the work experience programme, £6.5 million; the enterprise allowance scheme, £2.5 million; the teamwork programmes to which I referred a few moments ago, £6 million; environmental improvement schemes, £2.25 million, making in all, £69 million for the manpower agencies.  In addition, £27 million of the youth employment levy will be spent within the educational world.  Those allocations provide for an increase of over 1,000 man years in the output from the combined manpower programmes.  Equally the output from <Col N="1750" /> the educational programmes will also be increased.</P>
    <P>In coming to these final allocations a number of provisional figures are annually tossed about and it is during this stage of the operation that the £7 million that Deputy Ahern keeps talking about seems to have arisen, but I am satisfied that in drawing up their programmes during 1985 the programme sponsors will do so in such a way as to maximise the number of places available to young people.  I assure the House that there will be no worthwhile activity on area of youth employment and training that cannot proceed because of shortage of funds.</P>
    <P>In the course of my examination of the area of co-ordinating education and training it seemed to me that a more fundamental exercise was called for and that it was appropriate and opportune that we address ourselves to the fundamentals of manpower policy, something that we have not done for two decades. The last White Paper on Manpower Policy was on ensuring the availability of a skilled workforce.  However, in the meantime, the situation has changed radically and manpower policy as an integral part of employment policy is no longer concerned solely with the quality and supply of labour but with the creation of employment opportunities.  While it is accepted that manpower policy must place increasing emphasis on job creation, it is also important that it does not lose sight of its original objectives and must continue to ensure the availability of a skilled and well-trained workforce.</P>
    <P>While mainstream job creation programmes supported by various special measures sponsored by the manpower agencies are expected to absorb the labour force growth it has to be acknowledged that these initiatives cannot be relied upon to accommodate fully the growing numbers who will be looking for work in the longer term.  It follows, therefore, that if manpower policy is to make a worthwhile contribution to reconciling labour supply and demand in the future, its role in influencing the factors <Col N="1751" /> affecting the demand side must be strengthened particularly in the area of local, community based employment initiatives; this includes active involvement in the development of national industrial, economic and budgetary policy and strategy and closer liaison with the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>In future, more and better information on population and demographic trends will be necessary if satisfactory policy responses are to be developed to cope with the needs and expectations of the labour force.  Continuous monitoring and analysis will be needed.</P>
    <P>In addition to employment expansion programmes the question of how, or to what extent, the existing amount of work available may be redistributed must be addressed.  In that context the scope for encouraging self-employment, local employment initiatives, co-operatives, as well as flexible working hours, work-sharing, job splitting, more part-time and temporary work and career breaks will have to be explored in conjunction with other measures such as shorter hours and so on.</P>
    <P>The question must also be posed as to whether the present level of unemployment is only a temporary phenomenon, due to exceptional circumstances, which will decline when industry and society adjust to the technological age, or whether it is a structural problem due to the fact that we are moving into a completely new era characterised by rapid changes in technology and the continuous transformation of the industrial base and work organisation practices which will render such ideas as job security and life time careers and occupations obsolete.  Despite much speculation, no general consensus has yet emerged as to the longer term implications of current developments in production and manufacturing processes and techniques, and the application of the micro-chip and robotics to a rapidly growing range of commercial, professional and clerical activities.  Historical evidence and economic theory would suggest, however, that it may be easier to generate job <Col N="1752" /> opportunities when technological advance is rapid rather than when it is slow.  Whatever evolves, all countries, including Ireland, will be obliged to come to terms with the new situation.  These considerations have clear implications for the roles and functions of the various manpower agencies in terms of delivery of services; their knowledge, analysis and classification of information on the dynamics of the labour market; identification of future trends in labour supply and demand, expressed in quantitative and qualitative terms; and the review and adjustment of training programmes to ensure greater adaptability and versatility among the workforce to respond more readily to shifts in the demand for skills. Even achieving these objectives will still mean difficulties in the labour market for a not insignificant minority of the labour force.  Manpower policy must assist these workers to cope with change and their existing situation; to develop their skills to the full; to produce a situation where as far as possible they compete on equal terms with other participants in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is at present engaged in the preparation of a White Paper on Manpower Policy which will address all these fundamental issues and outline the course manpower policy will take over the next decade.</P>
    <P>Another area of the Department's activities that is of concern to me is the whole area of the health and safety policy.  The work of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, known as the the Barrington Commission, is the most significant development for a considerable time in relation to safety and health at work in this country.  It was the first overall, systematic review of our legislative arrangements for safety and health at work and its recommendations represent a negotiated consensus amongst a wide range of relevant interests.  The commission's report calls for major changes at both national level and at workplace level.</P>
    <P>At national level the report recommends that legislative occupational safety and health protection should be extended <Col N="1753" /> to cover all employers, all employees, the self-employed and others who may be put at risk as a result of hazards arising from work activities.  Our present legislation gives protection to only about 20 per cent of the workforce.  The report also recommends  that major institutional changes be made in relation to the administration, supervision and enforcement of occupational  safety and health legislation. Specifically, the report calls for the establishment  of a national authority with overall responsibility for occupational safety and health.  While these are the central recommendations for change at the national level, some of the more significant ancillary proposals relate to the need to make better use of court procedures  and analogous mechanisms in the interest of the prevention of accidents and diseases.  Other recommendations refer to the need to change from detailed statutory and regulatory provisions for specific situations to more broadly based statutory and regulatory provisions, supplemented  by codes of good practice, guidelines and standards.</P>
    <P>The commission's recommendations relating to the workplace reflect current internationally accepted principles on how best to achieve and maintain safety and health at work.  The commission recognised the important contribution that appropriate legislative and other State support can play, but it also emphasised  the major contribution that those concerned at the workplace must make themselves.  This is based on the clear belief that those who are in a position to create a risk are also in the best position to eliminate it or, where this is not feasible,  at least to reduce the risk as far as practicable.  The commission recommend that statutory recognition should be given to the general duties that all at the workplace  are expected to meet in relation to safety and health.  It is recommended that each enterprise should be required to prepare  a written safety policy statement and to have suitable structures for consultation  in matters relating to safety and health at the workplace.</P>
    <P>Minister Quinn and I fully accept that there is an urgent need for radical <Col N="1754" /> changes at all levels in our system of occupational safety and health. Accordingly, our Department are, as a matter of priority, preparing proposals for legislative change based on the commission's  recommendations.</P>
    <P>Important developments relating to safety and health at work have also taken place in recent times at EC level.  Council directives have been adopted relating to the protection of workers from risks related to chemical, physical and biological  agents at work; from ionising radiation;  lead and asbestos.  Some of these are already due for implementation and the remainder are due for implementation  within the next two years.  These directives will apply to practically all persons  employed at national level as opposed  to the limited application of our existing domestic safety legislation. Among the key measures to be provided for as a result of the directives are the provision of information to workers on the hazards involved with dangerous agents and the provision of medical surveillance  during exposure to the agent. Again, my Department are working on proposals to give effect to those directives as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that I believe this budget sets the road for recovery.  My Department will be playing a very active role over the next 12 months.  Deputies will have an opportunity to debate a number of legislative proposals.  Again in the safety and health area, in the course of the next couple of months I shall be bringing before the Dáil a Bill dealing with off-shore safety.  For obvious reasons this is an area of importance and concern which has not to date received legislative attention.  I regard that measure  as being of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>Already the House has seen this Government's concern to build on the code of protection available to people in the workplace which was introduced by the Coalition Government of 1973 to 1977.  We have seen that extension with the passage by the House in the last session  of the insolvency legislation to protect  the rights of workers when their companies go into liquidation.  In the <Col N="1755" /> future we shall see legislation in the area of worker participation.  Up to now our whole industrial relations code has been unduly adversarial.  An extension of worker participation could do much to change the climate and to bring home to employers and employees alike the realisation that both have a stake in their jobs and in the enterprise and that the idea of &ldquo;us against them&rdquo; has no relevance  in 1985.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the whole area of industrial relations reform will be receiving substantial  attention in the space of the coming months, as it has been receiving in the last few months.  Members of the House will be aware that a process of consultation with the social partners has been undertaken by a co-ordinator established  by the Minister for Labour.  I anticipate  that following those consultations we shall be bringing proposals for reforms before the House.  I believe that an improved system of industrial relations can only improve our prospects of responding to the challenge of unemployment.   We have had some very unhappy experiences in recent times.  We had the bizarre spectacle in areas hard hit by unemployment of jobs being irresponsibly  put at risk.  It cannot be believed that that is in the best interest of the trade union movement or in the development of our industrial relations.  I regard the bringing forward of proposals to create and improve the climate in industrial relations  as being one of our priorities over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>This budget has lifted the national spirit.  It has enthused people.  It has given them hope.  It is up to all of us to see to it that these hopes are lived up to.  My Department and I will certainly be playing  our part in the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a budget to save the Government, but it certainly is not one to save the country.  A few sweeteners to selected interested groups to buy popularity  and to keep the Labour Party in line is, in essence, what the budget has been about.  Like anything that has been grudgingly given, this budget is more <Col N="1756" /> shadow than substance.  It is unimpressive on everything except the public relations exercise which was expensive, relentless and persistent.</P>
      <P>It was gross abuse of taxpayers' money to try to sell the unsellable by a telephone market.  This is unprecedented for political  cheek.  We had disturbing examples of the manipulation of Government Ministers by handlers overseeing their every move.  There was no justification for a hot line Government promotion exercise seeking to brain wash the electorate and using improperly the Civil Service as the selling agent for Government  mismanagement of the economy. We can see no reason or justification for the expense incurred last week by the Government using their agencies in trying to sell, in a political way, what we can only view now as a total mismanagement  of the economy and a total misjudgment  of the economic necessities of life.</P>
      <P>The Government had a unique political opportunity available.  They have missed that opportunity.  The public, long suffering  from discontent and frustration, were ready for a confidence boosting initiative and a guarantee of some hope for their futures and those of their children. Instead, they have to be satisfied with a politically expedient budget supported by a few borrowed Fianna Fáil policies, but smothered in a litany of tax increases which will further reduce the living standards  of the needy and, in particular, of the middle income group.  This is a real example of surrogate politics.  The Coalition  are devoid of any sustainable policies of their own.  They are incapable of producing  any worth while policies of their own and are using a public relations exercise  to hoodwink the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual budget is supposed to be the Government's yearly statement on the state of the nation.  It is supposed to be a vehicle used for corrective action or economic rejuvenation.  It has failed on both counts.  It has failed to address the major political difficulties of unemployment  levels.  These levels have been referred to in all good Government statements  in the past number of years.  It was mentioned in the national plan and stated <Col N="1757" /> on the unemployment motion debated in this House in the recent past that unemployment  was their first priority.  Yet they cannot point to one single sentence in this Budget Statement that will go any way towards relieving that problem.  The unemployment levels prevailing have not merely exceeded the targets laid down in their national plan but have already reached the levels they were supposed to reach at the end of a three year period of projection of <i>Building on Reality</i>.  We contend that it is not merely a figure of 234,000 unemployed.  It is our contention that that figure is understated and would be more correctly in the region of 270,000 to 280,000.  One must remember those currently in training &mdash; I refer to short term training projects under Government  agencies &mdash; who are not included on the live register, which figure is suggested  to be in the region of 20,000 to 25,000. It should be remembered also that in many families more than one member is unemployed and that it has proved useless  for all members unemployed in any one household to seek unemployment assistance.  There are many thousands of others maintained totally by their parents under the archaic system of means testing in so far as board and lodging estimates are concerned.  Consequently such people do not qualify for unemployment assistance.  Therefore they do not waste their time and energy signing on daily or weekly at the labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is no way that the figures obtaining  go any way near recognising the full extent of the present unemployment crisis.  Yet the Government fail to recognise  those facts.  If they did recognise such facts surely they would have devoted the major portion of the Budget Statement to producing initiatives, taking courage in their hands, providing the wherewithal necessary to reduce that unemployment figure.</P>
    <P>The construction industry, industrial development, motorists and, in particular,  the family have been penalised in this budget.  It has been labelled correctly an anti-family budget.  If ever there was a time in the history of this State when the family needed extra protection it must be <Col N="1758" /> now with catastrophic levels of disposable incomes and unemployment.  This was a time to do something really positive to reduce the impact on the family budget.</P>
    <P>We see the damaging effects on society every day and the return of mass emigration.   While this might not affect some areas to the same extent as it does the west, it is as well to put the Government on notice that the traditional areas which suffered the greatest haemorrhage of emigration in the past are the first to take the full brunt again.  Western areas are witnessing not just the emigration of children but also of parents: breadwinners  must leave their native country to seek employment in foreign lands.  Is it not a strange kind of philosophy being practised by the Coalition when they thought it more fit in this budget to give £250,000 to Dublin Zoo for the care of animals there than to the Irish centres in Great Britain who look after the 30,000 new emigrants who have gone there since this Government took office?  It is a strange kind of logic that provides money for commercial enterprise of that nature but could find only an extra £32,000 to help out the societies and centres in Great Britain who have taken on board the difficulties this Government should be addressing.  Those 30,000 unfortunate people have been banished into exile by the incompetence of the present Government.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a question of the difficulties  of those who have had to emigrate that must be considered.  We must also bear in mind the enormous expense to the state involved in the education of those 30,000 people who have left our shores in the past 12 months, the best educated, best trained generation since the foundation of the State.  Their skills, training and techniques gleaned at home are now being put to use helping other jurisdictions, those with whom we must compete in the market place.  It makes no sense.  Unfortunately, it would appear, not just from statements made by Government Ministers but from Government action as exemplified in their recent Budget Statement, that they have no care for those who must leave <Col N="1759" /> and less for those who must remain at home.</P>
    <P>There is now a recognition of the existence  of the black economy, its recognition  as a legitimate and desirable activity. Every single move so far as fiscal policy is concerned has sent more people into that black economy.  It is now being made fashionable here to say that one is making money without paying tax on it.  There are people leaving legitimate business, taking themselves off registers under the tax revenue system so that they can start afresh in businesses that will not be registered,  that will not have to meet the demands placed on them by Government taxation policies.</P>
    <P>This is a most undesirable situation. It is estimated that the black economy pervades every single sector of the community  now and is responsible for at least 18 per cent of GNP.  That loss of revenue to the State, it should be remembered, would help to create the thousands of new jobs necessary to bring about a situation  in which people would want to remain in legitimate employment.  The whole question of the black economy here has not been adequately tackled and will not be until such time as proper taxation policies of a personal and corporate nature are introduced in this House.  That should be the aim of the Government because that is an area that could provide the necessary revenue about which they cry every day to fund the schemes that would provide lasting, sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>We see also the other effect of unemployment  and disillusionment in the community  in the rising levels of violence on our streets which would indicate a breakdown of respect for authority.  Certain  sections of the community now seem to think that they have a licence to terrorise  citizens.  Unfortunately, there is a move towards rough justice entering the system in order to deal with that level of violence.  Increasingly we hear about new vigilante groups being established to handle their areas so far as law and order is concerned.  There is no doubt in my mind that if Saturday night specials were available here as readily as they are on <Col N="1760" /> the streets of New York, when an individual  for a very small amount of money can purchase a weapon to deal with his situation, we would then have a Wild West situation here.  People have to be driven to great lengths before they take measures which will create further violence  in the community.  The Garda have the power and they must get the backing of the public once and for all to rid the country of the thugs and the vandals who seem to think they are beyond the law and that they have the right to create nogo areas particularly in our cities.  It is a scandal and people are very distressed about it.  They are asking for Government action to ensure that they can live in decency and in dignity and that they can be sure that, when they leave their property  unattended, it will be in the same condition on their return as it was in when they left it.</P>
    <P>The youth employment levy was supposed  to create new job opportunities. That money is not being expended for the purpose for which it was intended.  It is going into the national Exchequer and it is being laundered by the Government for their own administrative purposes. It is being reckoned as new investment money, and it is not being utilised for the reasons stated here when it became part of the Finance Bill.  It was suggested to the people of Ireland that they were being asked to pay that levy to create the necessary  funding for the creation of new job opportunities.  Some day the Government  will have to answer to the irish people for what they have done with the large sums of money taken in by this levy. They will be asked if they used it to create job opportunities or for administrative purposes.</P>
    <P>Money was voted to this country from the European Social and Regional Funds for specific projects.  It was used for selective  projects on the east coast.  Many projects were put forward from the west of Ireland but the money went into the national maw.  The Government say the whole country is regarded as a region by the EC.  Sooner or later the Government will be taken to task because of the fact that money granted from European funds <Col N="1761" /> was not applied to the projects which were put forward at the time.</P>
    <P>The IDA are being used by the Government to smother the bad news about job losses as a direct result of Government inaction.  They have been using the IDA to spread sunshine news. A week later the statistics disprove that sunshine news.  The Government say the statements were not issued by them. They are using the agencies to spread the news they would like to hear.  This is known as a news management policy. Whatever the Coalition Government are good or bad at, they are good at the management of the news media.</P>
    <P>The brain drain and the investment drain have reached new limits.  The talent which was available and should be available  to the Irish economy is being exported for the benefit of our competitors.   Never before was there such confused  thinking in Government circles.  We have been told about emergency Government  meetings.  We are well used to emergency legislation being introduced by the Government.  They seem to be limping from crisis to crisis.  The Government  had to start to renegotiate their budget before the ink was dry on the paper.  They are renegotiating certain parts of it with the construction industry and the building societies.  Shortly they will be renegotiating it with the entertainment  groups and with certain sections concerning the VAT levels.</P>
    <P>In a desperate attempt to balance the books creative accountancy was used on a wide scale.  This has discredited the budget and must have serious repercussions  on Government credibility at home and on our creditworthiness abroad. Already international assessment of Government policy is unfavourable.  This can only damage our negotiating position in foreign money markets.  We well know how dependent on borrowing the Government are and that they will continue  their practice of negotiating funding abroad.  How can they create the proper climate for those negotiations when all international assessments of the Budget Statement last week were negative.</P>
    <P>The aftermath of the budget was the <Col N="1762" /> shortest lived example ever of political euphoria.  The dashed hopes of all sections  of the community have led to new depths of despair.  The TV trial of the budget in Tallaght last week was an experience which must have chilled even the most enthusiastic Government or backbencher.  Nobody believes the budget has tackled the problems of those in or out of work.  It can only add to the misery of a disenchanted population and increase the cynicism of people who feel that politicians and politics can do nothing  to protect their living standards.</P>
    <P>The all-important confidence boost has not materialised.  In fact, many now see the budget as a huge confidence trick making the unfortunate middle income group and the less well off the fall guys for Government inaction.  There is the controversial figure of £28.6 million of Government cuts which, we understand, will be outlined later today.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind that this was a political ploy to keep the Labour Party in line.  The idea was to get the Labour Party to vote the budget through the House and later on to tell them the bad news about the cuts.  How could they object to something they accepted the week before?</P>
    <P>This is not the first time this manoeuvre was used by the Labour leadership.  On this occasion it smacks of collusion between Fine Gael and the Labour leadership  to outmanoeuvre the normal political  process by hiding the facts not just from the politicians or the backbenchers of the Labour Party but also from the electorate at large.  That is shabby treatment  of the so-called socialists in the Labour Party.  It indicates that the Government will do anything to stay in office at least until they qualify for their pensions on May Day.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to creative accountancy.   The £28.6 million of cuts, the details of which will be announced later today, is a typical example of modern day creative accountancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>No details are available in my Department of the annual cost of the usage of aerosoll sprays.  I am aware that some countries enforce control on the use of these sprays. Ireland does not produce the chlorofluorocarbons  which are used for filling aerosol  cans and, by international standards, uses them only on a very limited scale. Negotiations are in progress, within the framework of the United Nations Environment Programme, on a draft international agreement on measures to control, limit and reduce the emissions of chlorofluorocarbons so as to protect the ozone layer.  Ireland is participating in these negotiations and it is envisaged that the control of the use of aerosol sprays will be considered in the light of the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the deleterious  effect it can have on the ozone layer in the atmosphere but my question was directly related to the dangerous use of aerosol sprays in the domestic market. Is the Minister aware of the indiscriminate  sale of aerosols either in paint form or, more dangerous, in the form of glue without health warnings being painted on them?  Will the Minister insist that warnings as to the dangers of such sprays, particularly in the hands of young people &mdash; we are all aware that glue sniffing is <Col N="1764" /> a big problem &mdash; are put on aerosol sprays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will.  We produce  less than 0.25 per cent of the EC total of aerosol production.  In 1981 the quantity used was approximately 30 per cent less than the 1976 level thus meeting the decision of 26 March 1980.  There is a definite decline in the use of them and there is more control of them.  The United Nations environmental group are looking into the matter and we are participating  in those negotiations.  Something will emerge from those negotiations to ensure that positive action is taken to eliminate any dangers whether it is in regard to those that affect the ozone layer or the health of citizens.  Our main concern  is in regard to their effect on the ozone layer because in the long term they could have detrimental effects from the health point of view.</P>

      <P>Directive 82/884/EEC <Col N="1765" /> of 3 December 1982 prescribes a limit value for lead in air of two microgrammes per cubic metre, expressed as an annual mean concentration.  Member states are required to take the necessary measures to ensure that by December 1987 this limit value is observed.</P>
      <P>Levels of lead in air are currently monitored  by Dublin Corporation at six stations  throughout the city.  Results which are within the limit set down in the directive  have been obtained except at one station, located in the vicinity of a possible  industrial source, where the levels were slightly in excess of the limit last year.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be issuing a circular letter to local authorities arising from the provisions of the 1982 directive and asking them to examine the necessity and scope for lead monitoring in their areas.  The legislation on air pollution which is being prepared in my Department  will, of course, take full account of the need to control lead emissions in the interests of human health.</P>

In spite of what the Minister has said about two microgrammes  per cubic metre, is he aware that the excessive levels of lead in the air in that area were hundreds of times &mdash; I am not exaggerating because, in fact, it has been calculated at thousands of times &mdash; in excess of accepted levels?

      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that in regard to monitoring <Col N="1766" /> that plant the corporation have encountered  practical problems concerning the location of a monitor.  To install a monitor the corporation must depend on the goodwill of local residents.  They have made efforts to monitor the air on a number of occasions but there were objections to the siting of the equipment because it involves the use of a pump which is somewhat noisy.  It is necessary to monitor the air over a period.  The corporation made a number of attempts to locate the monitor in different areas but came up against objections to the noise of the equipment involved.  The local authority is pursuing the matter in the courts against the firm.  Hopefully, they will be successful and in that event the corporation will be in a position to insist on stricter and higher standards than apply up to now.  I am acquainted with the area because it is close to where I reside.  I should like to assure the Deputy that we are doing all we can.  If we got co-operation on the sitting of the monitor it would be a big help.</P>

The residents  have been taking blood samples, with medical advice, from the children living in this locality.  If the Minister is aware of that, he must also be aware that irreversible brain damage is caused to young children residing in this area.  It is no use being told in this House that noise from a pump is the cause of delays in this regard.  I ask the Minister to make a decision to see that that plant is closed down immediately.

      <P>I cannot give the information for the period mentioned and I gave the reasons why.  If I were to get this information it would mean taking staff from the operation and implementation of the grant scheme.  The priority of the Department is to deal with applications as they come in.  The important thing is to ensure that grant applications are processed and when approved to see that the money is paid out as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Minister that the reason he will not give that information is because he does not want to draw attention to the fact that a considerable number of applications are being turned down for the reasons suggested in my question.  Is the Minister aware that many applications are being rejected because the inspectors say the floor area is in excess of the guidelines and that a different yardstick is being used when these applications are being processed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No different yardstick is being used.  On 30 November 1984 we advertised in the three main daily papers and <i>The Cork Examiner</i> drawing applicants' attention to what they should do and the precautions they should take. There is no question of any alteration in policy.  If a house is within the guidelines the applicant will get the grant, but if people build beyond a specific measurement they will not be paid.  We do not want to see this happen and that is why we advertised in the daily newspapers. We wanted to ensure that people would conform to the specifications but if people build a house larger than the measurements set down for grant purposes.  I regret they cannot be paid.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that approval for garage space, and the inclusion of space for garages in plans being submitted for grant aid purposes is at the discretion of the inspector?  Will. the Minister confirm that there has been a very large increase in the number of applications refused for that reason and that this is done simply to save money by reducing the number of allocations and thereby reducing the cost to the Exchequer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with that.  The Deputy is indulging in a little political play acting.  There is no question of inspectors having discretion as to whether grants should be paid.  If a house is built according to the specifications, the applicant will get the grant.  No inspector has the right to deprive anybody of that payment.  There is no policy to withhold grants.  As I said, last November we advertised in the papers setting out all the necessary details.  Surely the Deputy is not serious.</P>

      <P>I could give much more credence to the Minister's reply if he had been more forthcoming with the figures I asked for.  Is it not a fact that there is a big increase in representations being <Col N="1770" /> made to the Minister and his Department by Deputies from all sides of the House concerning the disallowance of grant applications for the reasons I stated, that is because they are over size?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will consider extending the recently announced private house purchase scheme to allow local authorities to buy from house owners who are unable to meet mortgage repayments and then allow them to continue as occupants under the differential rent scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme under which local authorities may purchase private houses to supplement their rented stock is intended to enable authorities to provide houses where it has been established that housing needs exist and where it would not be possible for the authorities to provide suitable accommodation more economically or within a reasonable period of time.</P>
      <P>I feel it would not be appropriate to extend this scheme in the manner suggested by the Deputy, particularly since it is understood that lending agencies adopt a sympathetic approach to mortgage holders who are in genuine difficulties and seek to come to a mutually acceptable arrangement to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been an ideal opportunity, given the serious difficulties which many people are encountering at present with mortgage repayments to various local authorities, for the Minister to take those people out of their difficulties by allowing them to remain in their houses as tenants under the differential rent scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be a good idea as it might lead to many problems and anomalies in that people could perhaps jump a queue to get into a house.  Many people, especially the lower income group, are availing of the Housing Finance Agency loan which takes unemployment into account and reduces the rent accordingly.  It would not be in the best interests of a good local authority housing programme to do as Deputy Kirk suggests although I accept that the suggestion was made in good faith.</P>

      <P>We allow local authorities to purchase one off or groups of houses when they require houses urgently or where they want to get a greater social mix.  They are not confined to new houses, they can buy secondhand ones, and they attempt to purchase vacant houses to accommodate as many people as possible.

      <P>Would the Minister consider extending the scheme into areas where semi-State organisations have provided houses?  For instance, Shannon Free Airport Development Company have provided a substantial number of houses at Shannon Airport new town for their employees on the industrial estate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether Road Traffic &ldquo;Insurance Disc&rdquo; Regulations, 1984 (SI No. 355 of 1984) will require the displaying of a current insurance disc covering all drivers of the vehicle carrying the disc; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Drivers entitled to drive a vehicle may include the insured, other persons named on the relevant insurance policy including the spouse and children of the insured and persons insured to drive under open driving policies of insurance held by either the insured or the drivers concerned.  The Deputy will appreciate that it would be impracticable, in the circumstances, for the disc to list all the insured drivers involved.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the disc is to ensure that every vehicle in the State is covered by a policy of insurance. If this objective is achieved, it will be an improvement on the existing situation where insurance company sources estimate that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of vehicles are not insured.  As regards the insurance of individual drivers, this can only be established by the Garda utilising their powers to demand production, by the driver, of his certificate of insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State may have missed the point of the question. While I agree that it would be totally impractical to put the names of those driving the vehicle on the disc, would the Minister of State agree that what could be put on the disc is that it would be an offence to carry passengers if the person's <Col N="1777" /> insurance did not cover that?  I am sure the Minister of State is aware that there are many different types of insurance policies available.  We appreciate that this is very necessary and welcome legislation but would the Minister of State not agree that it would be desirable to put down the cost of the insurance on the disc so that insurance companies would not be given a <i>carte blanche</i> to charge whatever they liked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not miss the point of the question.  The question dealt with the displaying of an insurance disc covering all drivers of the vehicle.  As regards costs it does not really matter all that much.  The particulars are the policy number, the commencement date, the expiry date and the registration number of the vehicle insured.  We want to make sure that every vehicle is insured.  I take the Deputy's point that someone who is not insured may be driving a car but the Garda still have power to ask drivers to produce their insurance certificate within ten days.  Insurance companies have informed us that between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of vehicles are not insured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference given to the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission relate mainly to the revision of electoral areas and representation so as to bring about a reasonable relationship between population and representation within each local authority concerned, where this does not already exist.</P>
      <P>The commission are also required to consult with the County and County Borough Councils of Cork and Limerick and with the County Council and Borough Council of Galway and, in the light of these consultations, to recommend whether and in what manner the boundaries of the cities in question should be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention is that the commission <Col N="1780" /> will explore the possibility of local agreement on the question of boundary adjustment so that any agreed changes might be made effective for the local elections to be held in June.</P>
    <P>Should the commission make recommendations for the extension of a boundary, they are required to recommend suitable provision for the representation of the area proposed to be added to the city, including, where appropriate, an increase in the membership of the city authority.  This applies to Galway as well as to the existing county boroughs concerned.</P>
    <P>It would be the aim that legislation would be enacted to give effect to any specific city boundary changes recommended by the commission so that the local elections to be held in June would take place within the expanded boundaries. Provision would be made for financial adjustments in appropriate respects between the city and county authorities in the event of boundary adjustment being effected on the recommendation of the commission.</P>

I will be bringing forward legislation in the near future to enable effect to be given to the Government's decision that Galway is to become a county borough, and to deal with all the appropriate consequential matters.</P>

      <P>That is not what local government is about.  The Deputy is aware that within the context of Dublin city are six other authority areas, district council areas, which will bring it down further.  As well as that there is a metropolitan authority with statutory powers to co-ordinate all the services.  That in itself is a major improvement, but it is only the start.  Beyond that we want to devolve down to local authorities real power, a real sense of responsibility and to divest central Government of a number of the things that should be done locally, and that will be done.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Minister of State's reply that it will not <Col N="1787" /> be possible to draw up the new boundaries for urban councils and town commissions. The Minister no doubt is aware that if one out of every three people in Ireland lives in Dublin, two out of every three do not live in Dublin and many of those will be living in built-up areas where the population merits a vote in UDC and town commission elections.  They will be denied the franchise, despite requests which have been before the Department of the Enviornment for many years to have new boundaries drawn up.  I compliment the Minister for trying to deal with this matter, even belatedly, but the whole thing should be tidied up so that people who have a right to vote will not be denied a vote in these elections in areas where they live and pay rates and other charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Enviornment if he will give details of regulations pertaining to the quality of water for domestic use; and if he is aware of complaints (details supplied) about a strong chlorine taste in certain areas in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Sanitary Authorities are obliged under section 65 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, to provide and keep in any water works provided by them a supply of pure and wholesome water.  It is a matter for each sanitary authority to comply with the terms of the EC Directive 80/778/EEC of 15 July 1980, which relates to the quality of water intended for human consumption.  The directive does not specify standards regarding chlorine.  The amount of chlorine used must vary depending on the quality of the water to be sterilised.  The use by sanitary authorities of chlorine to sterilise water for human consumption is done in accordance with standard international water supply practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the recent problem regarding the water supply serving some parts of Dublin city and county.  According to a report submitted by Dublin <Col N="1788" /> County Council there were no health risks arising from the water.  The local authority have indicated that the difficulty was caused by the recent cold spell which resulted in waters entering and discharging from the treatment works at Leixlip having a higher than normal concentration of ammonia.  The sudden changes in water temperatures at the water intake works allowed the ammonia-enriched waters at lower levels to rise to the top.  This ammonia reacted with the normal chlorine additive to give the taste and colour problem.  The supplies are now back to normal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that we are not talking about a health hazard here, surely the Minister would concede that to arrive at a point when domestic drinking water would be a health hazard would be all too serious?  The taste of the water in the Dublin supply is very bad indeed.  Would the Minister of State agree that much of this trouble is being caused by corroded pipes in the system? This information has come to me from officials.  Would he take steps to try to improve the quality of the piping servicing the water system in Dublin city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

      <P>If the Deputy has had information from officials I would like to know who the officials were and then I will take the matter up.  The information I have here has been supplied by the local authorities, as I would have expected it would be, but indicated a different matter.  Certainly I will take up the matter of corroded pipes with the authorities because we want to ensure a supply of good, clean water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding officials, this type of reply comes from the waterworks department.  When a person complains about the quality of the water that department write back to say that a matter of the piping is causing that problem.  I would like the Minister to treat this as a high priority.  The difference between water quality in rural and urbanised areas is quite stark.  Finally, I did not quite <Col N="1789" /> hear the date of the regulations that the Minister gave at the start of his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of achieving cost efficiency is one of the reasons for the various controls and procedures operated by my Department in relation to expenditure by local authorities on the implementation of the major works programme for which funds are allocated to them.  I am satisfied that these controls allied to the procedures operated by local authorities themselves are a reasonable approach towards ensuring cost efficiency, when account is taken of the statutory responsibilities of the local authorities and of their own accountability for their expenditure.  While formal studies of cost efficiency have not been carried out on individual local projects by the Department, cost trends are constantly appraised in order to ensure that the controls and procedures continue to fulfil their purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a slightly different approach.  Local authorities are given block grants to do that and are given additional grants for the strengthening of roads.  We give the grants and it is a matter for local authorities to carry out the work.  When local authorities get money the problem is that they complain that they are not getting enough.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before lunch I had drawn the attention of the House to the fact that the budget is a fine example of surrogate politics in that the Government were incapable of producing any worthwhile policies and had simply borrowed some Fianna Fáil initiatives and used a very extensive PR arrangement to sell their programme by utilising the telephone sales mechanism and also the Civil Service as their selling agency for Government mismanagement.</P>
      <P>The budget penalises the construction industry, industrial development programmes, the motorist and the entire family in terms of their family budget.  It will lead to increased levels of emigration, to increased participation in the black economy and to greater levels of violence on our streets.  I concluded at that time by saying that the budget aftermath was the shortest lived example of political euphoria ever witnessed and that it had led to new depths of despair in all sections of the community.  What should have been an opportunity for the Government for a confidence boosting initiative for the people has turned out to be a huge confidence trick.  The fall guys are the needy, the less well-off and the hard pressed middle income groups.  I had referred also to the question of the creative accounting which has now taken over the corridors of economic thinking in the Department of Finance.  It is well to bear in mind that the cuts amounting to £28.6 million, details of which I understand are to be announced today, are a typical example of giving the bad news in a lump sum figure so that certain Deputies, particularly the backbench Labour Deputies, will be persuaded to regard in good faith the measures to be brought in subsequently, because once those Deputies have marched through the division lobbies in support of the overall package they cannot subsequently opt out.</P>

Would anyone with an ounce of wit be prepared to suggest that it is possible to renegotiate downwards £30 million in terms of pay when a settlement of that amount has <Col N="1821" /> been agreed?  Would any responsible trade union accept such an attitude on behalf of their hard-pressed members?</P>
    <P>There is the question also of the tax buoyancy of £58 million which we are told will result from budgetary measures. How can one expect a buoyancy of £58 million when the total VAT changes, for example, are estimated at £9.2 million? We are talking about a budget of more than £7 billion.  I cannot imagine that extra consumer spending of any great quantity will result from a reduction of £9.2 million out of a total budget of £7 billion.  It is extraordinary that the budget would show these matters up in this light. However, it is only another example of the creative accounting of which the budget is full.  It contains dubious statistics and aspirations which the Government know well cannot be achieved.  But the same applies to the national plan. That document is now discredited and we understand that it has been virtually withdrawn from the economics of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Last year on the question of interest rates the Minister for Finance, by way of the sales of Government securities to banks and to the public, raised £830 million; but the raising of that money starved the money markets and during the period of deep recession kept interest rate at around 16 per cent when inflation was of the order of 8.6 per cent.  What entrepreneur will take risks at such high levels of interest rates?  the result is that we are not getting the investment and the job opportunities are not being provided. This is leading to further unemployment. We have not made the climate right for investment.  Consequently, businessmen are not prepared to take on any extra accommodation with the banks and so there is continuing unemployment.  The unemployment figures are now in excess of what we were told they would be at the end of the three years of the Government plan.  Obviously, the Minister does not understand how the creators of wealth work.  He will probably go for another £1,000 million from the home investment market this year.  That is not the way to <Col N="1822" /> create the climate that is necessary for further investment and for more jobs.</P>
    <P>The building societies know that the Minister will borrow again this year on the home market and that is why they have decided they must seek compensation to protect their interest and to maintain their cash flow.  If there was the slightest hope that the Minister, instead of satisfying the ideology of the Fine Gael practice of reducing foreign borrowing, would undertake borrowing where preferential rates are available to him and leave the native money in the economy so that Irish interest rates could be kept at lower levels thereby providing further investment opportunities for those willing to take up investment, he would be doing a good days work and would not be criticised for that policy by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the devaluation situation added £1,3000 million to our national debt.  This has been exacerbated by borrowing at home.  These increased mortgage interest rates of 2 per cent will make life intolerable for the many people living on marginal incomes.  The Minister has robbed the economy of the money which would make such a difference had he left it to those willing to invest here. The Minister borrowed in the dollar and in the yen.  The Minister should have borrowed in the EMS currencies where there is virtually no fluctuation and the Minister was told this by our spokesman on Finance and by all the economic commentators. We should benefit from the EMS rather than place our reliance on foreign currency borrowing which is not stable at this time.  All the international commentators have made it quite clear that they cannot guarantee stability in those two borrowing markets for the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have to take note of the change that is taking place in the rate of exchange with sterling, up to 11 per cent over the past six weeks.  There is no doubt that that change in the exchange rate has been aggravating the North of Ireland trading situation and has contributed to cross-Border smuggling.  The new reliefs that were announced in the VAT charges will <Col N="1823" /> not take up the slack in relation to cross-Border trading.  While the Minister reduced some articles by 12 or ten per cent because of VAT reductions the money is already swallowed up by the differential in the exchange rate and by the increase in the cost of petrol.  The measures taken will not give relief to the hard pressed businessman.  That and the exchange rate difficulties are murdering our exports to Britain.  The budget last week did not give any consideration to those hard pressed exporters.  the Government will have to change their borrowing policies and they will have to do something about reducing interest rates.  The Government must alter their borrowing tactics and do something about the essential service costs if we are to avoid a total collapse of manufacturing. We have seen the start of that collapse over the past few years but it seems that the Minister is either unmindful or uncaring as to the consequences and he is happy to allow the dole queue to extend itself until breaking point is reached and breaking point in so far as it has been expressed in violence on the streets has been virtually reached.</P>
    <P>There was a very big underestimation of unemployment levels and of the extent of transfers under the social welfare code that would be needed to deal with those levels.  From all the projections in the plan and from Government statements we had expected an average of 217,000 unemployed this year and we understood that there would be budgeting for that figure.  The plan has been totally discredited in that the figure has far outstripped the projections.  We have to bear in mind that every 1,000 extra unemployed costs an extra £5 million so that if the levels of unemployment persist at the end of this year £100 million extra will be required by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to satisfy the transfers necessary to deal with it.  If that kind of extra money is required we will also require a supplementary estimate.  The Minister should come clean now and say that the money required to satisfy the social welfare demand has not been <Col N="1824" /> adequately catered for in the budget I assume we can look forward to a supplementary estimate as soon as the June local elections are over.  We can be quite sure that it will not happen before June.</P>
    <P>It is a nonsense for people to say that the figures in the budget or in the national plan can be substantiated.  The plan according to all economic commentators was built on false assumptions and dubious statistics which have now been transferred into the budget arrangements. The current budget deficit is not in line with what was agreed in the Joint Programme for Government Action.  It is not in line with the programme laid out in the national plan.  It seems that the Government are quite satisfied to adjust their figures to suit their requirements whenever necessary.  We know that Government borrowing has been greater in the past 12 months than in any other year since the foundation of the State. We know that the national debt has increased from £12 billion and will more than likely be £20 billion at the end of this year.  We also know that every one billion extra on the national debt is the equivalent of £150 million extra on our backs.  It is extraordinary that while that is being preached here and while every body is talking about it, it somehow has not yet been taken up by the media.  But it will, because it is coming home to roost now that the Government, when they came into office, came in on falsehoods and they have not lived up to their commitments or to the Joint Programme for Action.</P>
    <P>The Budget has had a serious impact on the construction industry in more ways than one. Apart altogether from the reduced activity in the industry we must bear in mind that many skilled people are now emigrating.  These people were trained at considerable expense and would have been regarded as a national asset.  We are reaching a situation where there are no apprentices in training here. All our best skilled people are being spirited away to places like Australia and America and the Irish dream of building one's own home has been blown for ever and no matter what we do we will not <Col N="1825" /> be able to attract back the engineers, architects, tradesmen and skilled people who are leaving the country now in their thousands seeking work abroad.  We will not be able to attract these people back unless we take corrective action immediately. Our country will be left without the skilled workforce that was painstakingly built up over the years, a workforce that has been provided by the Government for our competitors.</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at some of the torpedoes that were shot into the building industry since 1977 by this regime.  The VAT rate for architects and engineers' fees was increased from 10 per cent to the present 23 per cent; planning permission charges were introduced and are about to be increased again this month; the duration of the mortgage subsidy payments was stretched from three to five years without any increase in the total amount being paid; income tax was levied by this Government on that mortgage subsidy; new VAT rates for builders increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. Planning appeal delays are still as long as ever despite the Minister's promise when he sacked the last board that the setting up of the new board would result in increased movement of applications. There has been increased tax on the sale of land; corporation tax has been increased, PRSI levels increased; there is a youth levy on builders' workers; tax relief on mortgages for the second house was abolished in last year's budget and there is a threat to withdraw the tax relief introduced by Fianna Fáil for apartment and flat development; removal of the tax relief on personal borrowings and so on. The whole package when it is put together is an assault on a vital traditional industry if the country is to undertake any worthwhile job creation projects. The Government responded in their budget simply by trying to pick holes in what can be regarded as a leaky bucket, or leaky budget.  The difference in so far as the building industry and new house purchase or building are concerned is that in the United Kingdom no VAT whatsoever is imposed on any individual who decides to build or buy his own first house <Col N="1826" /> or home.  Then we say that we are ahead of all European countries in our building programme.</P>
    <P>Motorists again suffered the blunt edge of the Minister's tax axe, with increases in the cost of petrol, road tax, maintenance and repairs.  The change in VAT which was supposed to have such a great advantage as regards tourism and car, van and boat hire is reduced virtually to nil by the Minister's insatiable appetite for taxing the old reliables, even when it is obvious to everybody in the street that diminishing returns have already overtaken the revenue source.</P>
    <P>In 1981, 106,000 new cars were purchased here; in 1983, 61,000; in 1984, 56,000.  The number of new cars in these three years halved.  Last year, 63,000 people stopped motoring completely. More people could not afford to stay in motoring than bought new cars last year. Then we hear talk about Ministers of the Coalition Government being proud of what they have done to maintain the standards of living of our people.</P>
    <P>The number of uninsured motorists on our roads today is one out of every five. Insufficient care is being taken by those using our roads.  Two out of three people currently driving here are breaking the law, if in only one simple aspect of road safety &mdash; that they are not wearing their safety belts.  As yet, we have seen no positive response to end the uninsured driving, bad driving techniques, and badly maintained &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; on the road.</P>
    <P>We do not hear any talk about better security with regard to our cars, or mention from the Minister of making it mandatory to have certain devices to protect our property.  Since the safety belt legislation came into operation in 1979, six times more people are likely to die in a collision because they are not wearing their safety belts.  This is of great consequence for insurers, the Garda force and the Government alike.  It is costing £1 million a day in claims for injuries suffered in car accidents.  There is carnage on the roads &mdash; 219 people died last year and 4,630 were injured.  Two thirds of these, according to statistics, were not wearing safety belts.  I am making the <Col N="1827" /> comment concerning safety belts here because a new campaign is being organised by the Road Safety Association.  It should have the full support of everybody in this House.  It is not just the costs involved to those who are paying their insurance and the claims that have to be met, but the level of human suffering and misery brought about to so many as a result of road accidents, not to mention the drain on the resources of the State so far as ambulance and medical services and the police force are concerned.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, nine out of every ten people wear their safety belts. There has been a reduction, since the legislation became operative there, of 25 per cent in the number of deaths and serious injuries suffered since 1983.  If it requires greater surveillance and greater effectiveness in law enforcement, that should be applied so as to reduce the need to meet those claims and also to reduce the pressure on the services of the Minister for Health &mdash; or those which are left when he has finished.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry is supposed to have got a shot in the arm from the provisions in this budget.  That industry, despite repeated requests from this side of the House, has not been given the recognition of its potential to play a worth while part in our economy and in the provision of jobs.  There has been a piecemeal response, both in the national plan and in the budget, towards the industry. There must be a complete revision of the total tax system as it applies to that industry.  We must organise ourselves to market specialised tourism.  Over and above that, why did the Minister not take the opportunity to refer to the amount of venture capital that could be applied to the tourist industry if he would only change his mind and see the industry for what it is &mdash; a major exporter and a revenue generator and creator in our economy?</P>
    <P>Why would he not indicate that he would alter the daft VAT system for purchases by out of State visitors introduced last year at this time?  This has not worked and is the laugh of international tourism. <Col N="1828" /> Why do we not hear about new arrangements about access transport?  Why do we have to be preaching all the time and trying to get the Minister to listen to the need for proper car ferry services, for proper air charter arrangements?  Why do the Government not recognise that, as an island economy, a second location tourist stop, we need an enlightened access transport policy by air and sea if we are going to get the market share that the industry can create for itself.  These are matters to which the Government must attend.</P>
    <P>We hear no talk about environmental control, or renewals, or refurbishing policies. We do not see the industry treated for the value it is to the economy and could be by way of generation of job opportunity.  For that reason, unfortunately, the small step forward taken, of the reduction of VAT on hire and hotel accommodation, while welcome, will not go the distance in bringing about the potential.  It is a shame that the Minister would not recognise his responsibilities in that area.</P>
    <P>Indigenous industries are battling for their lives on the home market, where consumer spending is so depressed at present.  The smallest adverse shift in the money market can close hundreds of native industries and may result in the loss of thousands of jobs.  This can be avoided by a relaxed Government interference in the money market, which would result in cheaper money and more of it available in the market place.</P>
    <P>They talk about growth in the gross national product.  That talk is misleading. It is basing revenue from buoyancy on growth figures, which is wishful thinking. Any growth will come from expanded export performance in the high technology, health care and pharmaceutical industries.  Most of their profits, as we well know from the debate last year, will be repatriated to their base companies. With the recent difficulties in the multinational sector, there is great danger of our over-dependence on such industries and new ground rules will have to be devised if we are to protect our market <Col N="1829" /> share and employment levels in these industries.</P>
    <P>The Travenol experience underlines the problem.  It shows that multinationals are vulnerable, that the IDA and the Government have no say whatever in boardroom decisions affecting their future.  Sentiment with regard to job creation in Ireland plays no part in the decision making process.  Consequently tighter controls will have to be built into start-up grant agreements if job losses are to be minimised.  For our part unit costs of production, productivity levels, wastage, energy costs, transport costs, industrial relations, absenteeism levels will have to be just right if our industries are to have a chance to compete.  The proper environment is essential if we are to continue to be a suitable location for the attraction of prestigious foreign investment.  Our essential costs are noncompetitive, our interests rates and personal taxation levels out of line with those of our competitors and constitute an active disincentive.  Not only are we failing to attract new investment but an increasing amount of money is being moved abroad helping to strengthen the economies of our competitors and, worse still, our finest executives, technical and administrative, are moving out to escape the tax trap that has flattened any incentive to work.  These are matters directly under Government control.  It is futile for the Government to preach competitiveness and stricter management controls to the private sector when they themselves will not respond by an enlightened, realistic basic cost policy.</P>
    <P>The marketing, research and development of many products produced by the multinationals is organised outside the State.  This means that these companies are simply shipping to order with no involvement by Irish production units in the protection of their market place. There needs to be a greater link-up between the marketing of products by multinationals and our national marketing agency, CTT.  It is totally unacceptable that the IDA are not aware of the financial well-being or otherwise of the <Col N="1830" /> multinationals that have been grantaided in the first instance and that CTT are not involved in the market place of multinational products.  One of the greatest disabilities of multinationals is when their product enters the mature bracket. It is essential that new products become available to take up the slack.  This means that more research and development facilities must become part of an ongoing industrial strategy.  Technology is a fickle thing.  We are over-dependent on outside technology.  Increasingly we should be developing indigenous technological research and development programmes. I suggest it would not be unreasonable that existing and future high technological industries should contribute just a little from their not inconsiderable profits to new home-developed technological programmes.</P>
    <P>Science and technology in Ireland have not received the attention and support they deserve.  With manufacturing industry the main generator of exports and employment opportunities so dependent on technological advance, we must recognise that increased resources should be made available now to guarantee our future market share and reduce our dependency on out-of-State research. There is concern that there is unfair play at present in the area of international competition.  We are always over concerned with keeping the rules while other EC countries please themselves and protect their interests irrespective of the consequences. There is the example in France that they will not allow to be used in their network, whether that be in the health care area, in telecommunications or electronics, any products not produced in their country.  We regard this as unfair competition.  It is against the spirit and letter of the Treaty of Rome.  The Competition Commissioner should be put on notice by the Government that treaty rules are being infringed and that consequently we are being disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>We must face up to the fact that nobody owes us a living, that multinationals will take commercial decisions based on computer analyses of the marketing of their products and will set up shop in <Col N="1831" /> preferential locations.  This can be to our mutual advantage, but to benefit we must get our industrial environment act together, rendering Ireland the soughtafter location.  We have the skills, educational institutions and willing workforce. The country is crying out for leadership, but all it is getting is rhetoric.  The reality of Fine Gael policy is that the so called disciplined financial management, which was to restore State solvency, improve our competitiveness and create jobs, has collapsed.  We have all witnessed the 700 closures and liquidations on average that have taken place over the past two years and the statistics must be put on the record &mdash; 50,000 people have lost their jobs in the last two years.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit, the reduction of which brought the Coalition into Government, has grown to over £1.2 billion. We owe foreign banks more now than at any time in the past &mdash; and all of this has taken place in just two years.  The hypocrisy of it all is that the Taoiseach and Government Ministers have the audacity to suggest that the bad times are over.  I put it to them that there has been unprecedented hardship over the past two years with no tangible results on the employment front.</P>
    <P>Prudent reflation was sneered at in this House, jibed at by Government Ministers right up to a week before the Budget Statement, when the Minister for Finance came into this House on the unemployment motion, jibed and jeered at the Fianna Fáil people for suggesting that there should be any kind of prudent reflation of the economy.  There must have been a road to Damascus conversion of the Minister for Finance, whose backbenchers avidly and loudly clapped him when he took his U-turn here last week. But the partial, eleventh hour conversion, with the great U-turn the Government have taken, at least proved one point: that financial rectitude is a failed formula for the solution of small, open economies.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation was mentioned in the Budget Statement, being advanced as a panacea for <Col N="1832" /> all our ills.  Would the Minister give the National Development corporation a rest because it has been overworked before it even begins, and the internal wrangling of Ministers over its funding and remit adds to the national cynicism that is all about.  There have been sufficient committees, consultancies and so on identifying our problems.  They have been well identified.  The investment areas have long since been identified as well, where the money is most needed.  Instead we need a little action now.  Unfortunately the only response we have had is that the Government in their Budget Statement last week quenched the last candle at the end of the tunnel.  Our people deserve a better response at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer first to social welfare matters and secondly to the health services.  I want to devote most of this part of my contribution to a number of current issues in the social welfare area which are relevant to the overall budget strategy.  I want to remind the House of some of the main features of social welfare expenditure which are often lost in the welter of detail and comment which normally surround such an emotive subject.</P>
      <P>Our social welfare budget is quite enormous. It is fast heading towards £2½ billion a year.  Over 96 per cent of that budget goes straight into the economy in the form of cash transfers or subsidies of one sort or another to individuals and caring organisations.  Less than 4 per cent is spent on staff and operating costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare expenditure programmes amount in total to the single largest bloc of Government expenditures &mdash; about 25 per cent of total gross current expenditure.  In 1984 total expenditure on social welfare amounted to over £2.1 billion of which the Exchequer met almost £1.3 billion or about 62.1 per cent. Almost all of the balance came from the PRSI contributions of employers and employees.  On a a post budget basis in 1985 the total provision for social welfare is over £2¼ billion of which the Exchequer will provide over £1.3 billion. <Col N="1833" /> It is not so long since the Department of Social Welfare were being criticised for the low level of their expenditure as a percentage of gross national product. Expenditure on social welfare has, however, been taking up an increasing share of GNP.  Ten years ago about 10 per cent of GNP was devoted to social welfare. By 1981 it had risen to 11.6 per cent and in 1984 it exceeded 14.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unemployment-related expenditure is the biggest element of overall social welfare expenditure and now accounts for 27 per cent of the total budget of the Department of Social Welfare.  In 1984 it amounted to £519 million excluding smallholders, an increase of 15 per cent over the 1983 figure.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Government have made provision for expenditure of £579 million, an increase of 11.5 per cent over 1984. This takes account of increased rates of payment as well as the anticipated increase in numbers of claimants.  It also takes account of the likely impact of the social employment scheme and the alternance scheme in 1985.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns is the rise in the numbers of the long term unemployed. There are now 94,600, including 17,000 small holders, in the long term unemployment assistance category. That is why, in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government to provide additional help over and above the standard increases for especially disadvantaged groups, special permanent increases for the long term unemployed were provided in October 1983, a premium of 5 per cent, and in July 1984, a premium of 1 per cent.  Again in July next the long term unemployed will receive a 6.5 per cent increase in their weekly payments as against 6 per cent for other unemployed persons.  By July next the long term unemployed will have received an overall increase of 33 per cent in the period June 1983 to July 1985.  The cost of payments to the 95,000 long term unemployed in 1985 will be over £200 million.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office they gave a firm commitment, despite the gravity of the recession and <Col N="1834" /> its impact on social welfare expenditure, to endeavour to maintain the living standards of all people who depend on social welfare for their needs.  The national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> reiterated the Government's commitment to &ldquo;keep long-term payments at least in line with inflation and short-term unemployment and disability payments in line with takehome pay&rdquo;.  Government action helped to reduce inflation to about 7 per cent in 1984 with a fall to below 6 per cent in prospect for 1985.</P>
    <P>Social welfare increases in the period June 1983 to July 1985, including this year's budget increases, represent a compound increase of 25 per cent for those in receipt of short term payments, 28 per cent for those in receipt of long term payments and, as I have said, 33 per cent for the long term unemployed.  The compound increase expected in the consumer price index for the period mid-1983 to mid-1986 is of the order of 20 per cent.  In the same period the increase in net take home pay is expected to average about 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>Thus, this budget has ensured that the living standards of social welfare recipients will not only continue to be protected until mid-1986, but it has also protected the real improvement in their living standards which has been brought about by this Government in office.  The House, and those groups who keep calling for more without having the responsibility of worrying about where the necessary resources can be found, should take due note of this achievement.  It is an achievement of which I am proud at a time when the budgetary constraints within which the Government have to operate have been far greater than at any time in this generation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fundamental objectives of protecting the living standards of social welfare recipients the Government have continued to look for ways of improving the level of services or extending them to high priority groups to the extent that very limited resources permit.</P>
    <P>Last week's budget saw several such innovations, in addition to the £1 increase in the free fuel voucher.  In the first place, <Col N="1835" /> there will be an important extension of the treatment benefit scheme next July. This scheme at present provides dental, optical and aural benefits for insured persons and will now be extended to all pregnant women whose husbands are fully insured.  This will increase the potential catchment of the treatment benefit scheme by up to 30,000 married women in any given year.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was disturbed when I read the observations made by the Leader of the Opposition.  He said women applying for benefit would finish up paying a doctor for a certificate to enable them to avail of the benefit.  As the Deputy well knows, under the maternity scheme a great many women do not have to pay for a pre-natal examination.  They will go to their doctor in the ordinary course of events and present him with an application form for dental, optical or aural benefit and the form will be signed. I do not expect that the medical profession will charge those women.  That observation shows yet again the chagrin of the Leader of the Opposition because of the fact that we have introduced such a scheme.  He said that the cost of visiting a doctor to get a certificate of pregnancy would be almost as much as the women would save.  That is absolute nonsense. The average dental benefit claim is around £40.  Surely the women of Ireland do not have to pay a doctor £40 to be informed that they are pregnant.  Pregnancy testing does not fall within that category of charge.  I do not know what the Leader of Opposition was talking about, unless he was trying to find some way to denigrate a valuable extension of benefit to a particular category of women.  As far as I am concerned, the next category should be children between the ages of 12 and 16 years.  These are obviously a group at risk who need particular benefit.  That is the kind of approach I think is possible and which a government would endeavour to introduce.</P>
    <P>On budget day I invited the relevant professional bodies for an early discussion on the practical arrangements for <Col N="1836" /> implementing the decision in relation to the extension of the treatment benefit scheme and I hope to have that meeting within the next week or so.</P>
    <P>The second innovation to which I wish to refer is the decision to protect the insurance position of Irish volunteer development workers who go to developing countries.  The Government were very concerned that a number of workers who had gone abroad for several years, who were, in Irish terms, being paid pocket money rather than a wage, were on their return not entitled to benefits such as unemployment benefit, disability benefit or treatment benefit for dental and optical care, because no PRSI contributions were payable nor could credited contributions be awarded while they were abroad.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the voluntary workers fall into two categories: those who have no history of employment before their departure, and consequently no social insurance entitlements; and those who have an employment history and social insurance entitlements prior to going abroad, but who at present lose those entitlements because they are not entitled to credited contributions while abroad.</P>
    <P>Different arrangements will have to be made to safeguard the position of each of those two groups, after consultation with the different bodies who have an interest in the problem.  I will make the necessary statutory provision in this year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this move has been welcomed as a practical demonstration of the Government's desire to encourage and facilitate as far as possible the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>On the question of social insurance financing, I am glad to say that for the third year in a row there has been no increase in the percentage rate of social insurance contribution for employers or employees.  In times of recession that is a considerable achievement.  However, the contribution ceiling will be raised from £13,000 to £13,800 next April.  This change is simply in line with expected earnings increases over the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1837" /> There will be a very small extra contribution of 0.1 per cent levied on employers following the establishment of the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund, in place of the previous redundancy fund. This fund is managed by the Department of Labour, but the contributions to it by employers are collected through the PRSI system for convenience.</P>
    <P>The composite PRSI rate for employees insured at Class A rates will remain at 8.5 per cent, while the corresponding employers' rate will increase by 0.1 per cent to 12.2 per cent.  These rates include the various health, youth employment and temporary income levies on the employees side, and redundancy, insolvency and occupational injuries funds contribution by employers.  The rates for social insurance alone remains the same &mdash; 5.5 per cent for employees and 11.3 per cent for employers &mdash; payable on employee earnings up to £13,800 in the 1985-86 contribution year.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the effects of unemployment.  Because contributions are pay-related and because the ceiling is indexed to pay, income to the social insurance fund should increase at the rate of growth in employee earnings.  However, a major pressure on social insurance financing is the still extremely high unemployment rate.  Apart from the individual hardship caused for people by unemployment, it has a double-edged impact on social insurance financing &mdash; reducing the contribution income and increasing the expenditure on unemployment and pay-related benefits.  The continuing Exchequer commitment to social insurance, now running at over a quarter of the income to the fund, is playing a vital role in absorbing this pressure.  The Exchequer subvention will largely cushion employees and employers from increased social insurance costs in 1985.</P>
    <P>The pay-related social insurance &mdash; or PRSI &mdash; contribution system has drawn considerable comment, and indeed criticism, in recent times.  A great deal of the comment is misinformed.  I think it essential to set out the basic purpose of PRSI and social insurance generally so <Col N="1838" /> that any debate can concentrate on real issues and not on sectional self interest.</P>
    <P>The purpose of social insurance is to protect workers and their families against loss of income due to risks such as illness, unemployment or death of a breadwinner. It also provides income support as of right in retirement and old age. Social insurance is the first level of a two-tier system of social security.  The second is social assistance, which acts as a safety net for those who have exhausted their social insurance entitlement or who otherwise have not the means to support themselves at a minimum living standard.</P>
    <P>Social insurance is a contractual bond between the insured person on the one hand, and the State as the provider of benefits on the other.  This is an insurance system, not simply another tax.  I want to reiterate that.  It is a social insurance system because it entails more horizontal and vertical redistribution among participants than would be the case in a commercial system where benefits are more strictly related to individual contributions and risks.  Insured persons' contributions are clearly earmarked for specific benefits and paid into a statutory fund for this purpose.  Furthermore, their entitlement to those benefits is related directly to the number of contributions paid.</P>
    <P>In addition to the insured person and the State, there is a third agent &mdash; the employer &mdash; in this social insurance arrangement.  Employers' contributions to social insurance through PRSI reflect two basic purposes.  The first is to ensure that employers, as one of the social partners in the community, contribute to the general welfare and protection of those who need support and those they employ. The second purpose is to ensure that employers make adequate provision for the protection of their workers.  This is in keeping with internationally accepted standards of occupational protection for contingencies such as occupational injury, sickness, maternity, unemployment and retirement.  A co-ordinated national system such as ours helps to spread the risks of these and other contingencies between all employers in direct relation to the size and wage structure <Col N="1839" /> of their workforce.  This is an accepted obligation on employers who produce and profit through the use of labour; there are comparable, though obviously different, overheads for capital&mdash;intensive enterprises.</P>
    <P>There have been repeated calls recently for some abatement of employers' PRSI contributions on the basis that they appear to act as a disincentive to job creation and job retention.  These calls have suggested, for example, that there should be differential rates for different sectors, or that there should be a greater obligation on capital-intensive firms to relieve some of the contribution made by labour-intensive enterprises.  It is sometimes difficult, when listening to these calls, to distinguish whether they reflect genuine interest in social and economic equity or narrow self-interest.</P>
    <P>The whole system of pay-related social insurance and health contributions and its effects on the provision of social security and employment is being examined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission are due to report to me later this year.  Their recommendations in this issue will give a major input to the debate on change.  There will be no restructuring of the PRSI system until I and the Minister for Finance have fully considered these recommendations and their implications.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in view of continuing high levels of job losses and slow pick-up in employment, the issue of the PRSI system as a labour market regulator has been examined by my Department.  Several clear factors were identified in this examination which strongly suggested that tampering with PRSI &mdash; and particularly the employer component &mdash; would be neither economically efficient nor lead to any significant job creation.  These conclusions tend to be borne out in a number of similar studies which have been carried out in other countries notably France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Any analysis of the employment effects of changing the basis for the employers' contribution must take account of the fact that statutory <Col N="1840" /> employer contributions in Ireland are low by comparison with most European and OECD countries.  As far as the PRSI element of wage costs is concerned, therefore, Irish firms do not suffer any loss of competitiveness because of this. If the aim is to reduce State-induced cost factors, then surely the first priority is to attack those which are out of line with those in other countries.  That is what the Government are doing, for instance, in the case of electricity prices.  Secondly, the Exchequer already provides significant support for all wage costs, including PRSI contribution, through corporate tax relief.  Third, the decision by employers to hire and retain workers is much more likely to be influenced by market demand in the first instance and by the prevailing redundancy, dismissal and equality legislation than by the relatively marginal effect of PRSI on their overall cost structure. Fourth, if employers' PRSI liability was to be modified in some way so as to reduce the overall contribution income yeild, then the increased social insurance deficit would have to be made good in some other way.  Assuming that nobody would advocate increased borrowing, what would be involved is either an increased Exchequer contribution to be financed through increased taxation or a higher PRSI levy on employees.  Since PAYE workers contribute very heavily already to Exchequer tax revenue, either alternative would reduce workers' disposable income.  The Government are committed to not increasing the burden of personal taxation; if it was to be increased as a result of PRSI changes, this would undoubtedly result in compensatory wage demands which would negate any possible employment gains which might result from the original reduction for employers.  Therefore, I have, admittedly circuitously, advanced an argument against a reduction.</P>
    <P>Finally any reduction in PRSI for employers would be made in the hope of additional employment or job retention, not just increased profits for employers. In practice, it would be futile to attempt to control the use to which employers put any increased cash flow from a cut in their <Col N="1841" /> PRSI.  Thus, from the point of view of targeting resouces precisely on increasing employment direct job-subsidy schemes such as the enhanced employment incentive scheme would be more efficient than a cut in employers' PRSI, the effects of which would be impossible to monitor.</P>
    <P>There has been some pressure recently, particularly from local authorities, to pay a subvention from the social insurance fund to employers to retain workers who would otherwise be let go, for example, from local authorities. Apart from the fact that every job could be considered marginal and in need of support, who is to judge what jobs are at risk?  Every employer in the country could argue for support in this way.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Commission on Social Welfare will be making recommendations on the future development of social insurance.  However, far from cutting back on social insurance in the way suggested by its critics with vested interests, I consider that the whole base of social insurance should be extended as widely as possible to include the only major group now left out &mdash; the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The self-employed at present rely on social assistance schemes paid for out of general taxation.  I think it is time they contributed to the social insurance system by making an appropriate level of contribution in return for which they will qualify for the various pensions of that system.</P>
    <P>Social insurance coverage for the self-employed would improve the equity of the financing of their pensions.  At present, social assistance pensions are financed through taxation mainly by the PAYE workers who are already contributing significantly to the cost of their own social insurance pensions through the PRSI system.  The inequity of the present situation in which insured persons and employers pay 70 per cent of the cost of their own benefits and most of the cost of non-contributory pensions from which they hardly benefit, is unquestionable.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the various social insurance pensions will cost about £620 million, <Col N="1842" /> while non-contributory pensions will cost half as much again at about £310 million. These non-contributory pensions benefit mainly the self-employed and others outside the work force, who have made very little contribution to this cost.</P>
    <P>As stated in the national plan the Government will publish a framework for a national pension plan extending social insurance pensions coverage to the self-employed as an essential starting point for the pensions plan and one which this framework will deal with.  This is a priority within overall pensions development for the community.  It will improve the quality of coverage for the self-employed as well as increasing the equity of pensions financing.  The funding of this scheme will be based on the social insurance contribution principle and it will cover for the first time self-employed workers as well as employed workers.</P>
    <P>A major issue in seeking contributions from the self-employed and farmers is the actual collection method.  This method has to be fair and comparable in incidence with that of other sectors, but it must also produce the required revenue.  I am concerned with this issue not only from the social insurance point of view but also because of the child benefit scheme I will be introducing next year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this major development in family support is to ensure significant extra assistance for parents and also a redistribution of resources from high to low income families.  Unless the self-employed generally, and farmers in particular, are involved in this redistribution, an undue share of the benefits will move to them.  I am considering the aspect of the child benefit proposal at present.  It is, of course, tied up with the broader issue of farmer taxation and contribution to health and youth employment levies. My aim will be to ensure that such groups gain fairly but not disproportionately from the new child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline the basis of the child benefit scheme, which will be introduced in 1986.  Pending the final design of the child benefit scheme, the Government have decided that children's allowances should be kept at their current <Col N="1843" /> level in 1985.  One of the main drawbacks of the present monthly children's allowances scheme is that it gives the same amount to rich and poor alike, while tax allowances for children are of more value to those paying high marginal tax rates.  The new child benefit scheme will subsume the existing monthly children's allowances scheme, the tax allowances for children, the family income supplement scheme and part of the weekly allowances paid for children under the various social welfare schemes.  Instead of all these schemes it will make available a single monthly cash payment to mothers in respect of their children.  This payment will be taxable as part of normal family income.  Existing social welfare payments to single parents such as widows, deserted wives, or unmarried mothers will, of course, continue, and they will receive child benefit as well in the same way as existing children's allowance.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of misunderstanding of the purpose of making the child benefit taxable.  One of the aims of the new scheme is to give more assistance to the less well off than to the better off.  This can best be achieved by making the payments taxable, but it is important to remember that the yield from taxing the benefit is being ploughed back into the scheme in the form of a higher basic level of payment than would otherwise be possible.  It is not my intention that the Exchequer should gain from this scheme at the expense of families. That is why we keep using the phrase &ldquo;a neutral cost basis&rdquo; and say that we will introduce the scheme on a neutral cost basis.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of analytical and preparatory work on this scheme will be done in the coming months, in the light of the income tax and social welfare changes announced in the budget.  It is vital if the scheme is to work as intended that a fair proportion of the child benefit payment is received back in tax from the self-employed sector as well as from the employee sector.</P>
    <P>Another question is that of employers <Col N="1844" /> paying for disability benefit when employees are out sick.  This has been put forward as a solution to this difficult problem.  At present nearly 300,000 disability benefit claims a year are handled by my Department, requiring a very extensive computer and clerical administrative structure to deal with the payment of benefit within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>At the moment, under social insurance arrangements, insured employees are entitled to disability benefit from my Department after three days of illness. This benefit is pay-related.  It removes any direct onus on employers to support their workers during illness.  However, many employers do maintain a pay during illness, in many cases &ldquo;topping-up&rdquo; disability benefit to the normal pay level for the worker concerned.  About 80 per cent of firms provide some such arrangement for their workers already.</P>
    <P>In view of the apparently considerable overlap between social insurance and occupational sick pay coverage, the question could be asked whether money is being paid out unnecessarily through social insurance for protection where employers already assume at least partial responsibility through sick pay.  Most EC countries have now an arrangement whereby employers support their workers fully for the initial period of illness, typically one to two months.  The State scheme would only then step in to give support.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind on this.  I am not making a formal proposal but it has been suggested that this system of involving an employer has some advantage.  First, it removes an unnecessary degree of administrative overlap between employers and the State.  Second, it means that sick pay is directly related to normal income in a way that is difficult to achieve with a State benefit which varies with family size and is non-taxable at present.</P>
    <P>Just as important, however, is the manner in which any new arrangement might be financed.  For instance, employers could be asked to bear the full cost of the liability for initial employee illness, with some compensation from existing <Col N="1845" /> social insurance funds by way of a general reduction in the rate of employers' PRSI.</P>
    <P>This would reduce administrative overlap considerably and reduce the workload of my Department.  It would, however, leave some employers better off and some worse off than under the existing arrangements.  The alternative of a system of individual refunds to employers of sickness payments made to employees for an initial period of illness would be much less attractive to me as it would entail continuing administrative involvement by my Department in each sickness pay claim.</P>
    <P>The matter has and will continue to receive careful consideration by my Department.  I expect that the Commission on Social Welfare will have some recommendations in this area also.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Opposition referred to the low level of take-up of the family income supplement scheme.  Some of the comment has been wide of the mark.  For instance, it has been said that the scheme was not adequately publicised.  That is just not so.  The scheme was advertised intensively over a period of weeks in five Sunday papers, three evening papers, provincial papers, Dublin local newspapers as well as on radio and television.</P>
    <P>My Department will be publicising the scheme again within the next few weeks and I will be reassessing the situation in the light of the response.</P>
    <P>Any family supplement scheme introduced in other countries had a very low take-up rate initially.  However that will not deter me from ensuring that as many families as possible will benefit in 1985. That will be subsumed into the new child benefit scheme in 1986.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the health area I should like to pay particular tribute to the staff in the Department of Social Welfare for their outstanding work in recent years servicing a large number of schemes and very often, particularly in employment exchanges, working in overcrowded conditions and under considerable pressure. There is a staff of about 3,500 people.  It galls me when I hear articulate and well heeled television personalities making global criticisms of the Civil Service and <Col N="1846" /> when I see such criticism made in newspaper columns.  That criticism has ranged from suggestions that civil servants are lazy, are a privileged class, are wasteful and have suffered from corruption.  That was suggested in the <i>Evening Herald.</i> They have made the accusation that civil servants work unnecessary overtime. That was in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  If I referred to some of the spurious criticism which daily comes from programmes such as &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, the Mr. Peelos and others who observe wasters all over the place in the public sector I might be tempted to indulge in expletives.  They are always giving the impression that every single person working anywhere in the public sector has high wages, massive pensions, all inflation proofed, which they are not, has absolute permanency of employment which they do not have and that, as a class, they are all a crowd of wasters.</P>
    <P>It is only right, particularly as the largest employer in the public service &mdash; I am responsible for 3,500 employees on the social welfare side and 60,000 in the health area &mdash; to put that kind of criticism in a proper context.  I accept that everyone in the public sector, politicians included, must be open to freely express criticisms by any citizen or taxpayer. That is their democratic right.  We are all servants of the public.  However, it is important that criticisms made are accurate and are supported by the facts. Unfortunately this cannot be said of some of the superficial comments which have been made, particularly in the media, in recent times.  It is a worrying feature of our present grave economic crisis that instead of uniting everyone and trying to find a way out of our difficulties it appears to exacerbate conflict and to create a kind of class division.  We have enough divisions between the PAYE sector and the farming community and between the self-employed and the PAYE sector.  We do not want to add to that a division as between public servants and society. That would be a serious deterioration in the quality of life.</P>
    <P>I get sick to death of self-professed and self-employed accountants and their <Col N="1847" /> alleged representatives on the media who call on the Minister for Health, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government to cut back on public expenditure. The daily cry goes out, why we are called upon to pay much in taxation, but if the gardaí are not on the streets, if the nurses are not in the hospitals, if the ambulances are not running, if the fire brigades are not available, if the Army is not on the Border and if civil servants are not in their offices to deal with income tax inquiries they go berserk.  We are great in this country at demanding the highest possible level of service, whether it be in regard to the local authorities, health, social services and education but very few of us are prepared to stand up and be counted and to say that such services must be paid for.  If we are a high tax country it is because we have a high level of social services.  If the people who make these superficial demands for a reduction in public expenditure had to face decisions of eliminating whole programmes of services which they demand they would be the last to demand such a reduction.</P>
    <P>I make this point in defence of those with whom I work in the Civil Service and because I have become increasingly concerned about these criticisms.  The public service is not perfect; it is true there are weaknesses in many areas and that there is potential for improvement. When I came into this House in 1969 we had the first Devlin review group on the organisation of the public service and I will quote from that report.  I agree with what it states in the following comment:</P>
    <P>For all the charges made against it, the Civil Service has worked with reasonable efficiency.  It has served different Governments loyally and with regard to the national interest.  In its long established traditions it operates impartially.  It has tried as best it could within the framework of its organisation and resources to promote the development of the nation.  It has given <Col N="1848" /> its advice to Ministers fairly and honestly and, when given the final decisions of the Government, it has implemented them without reservation. The Civil Service has contributed much to what is progressive in our national life.</P>
    <P>That was written in 1969 and admittedly it may be gilding the lily a little but on balance and on reflection I consider it a reasonable assessment of the contribution of public servants, and in particular of civil servants.</P>
    <P>If the Civil Service has had to suffer anything it is that it has had to suffer from a succession of indecisive Governments and of Ministers and Ministers of State who were more preoccupied with getting re-elected than with doing work in their Departments.  It has had to suffer from opportunistic party manifestos and has had to cope with all of that.  The Devlin report recognised the need for continuing reform in the public sector as conditions changed.  I am very pleased to be in the Department of Health who were among the first of the Departments to implement the Devlin idea of an aireacht responsible for policy formation and for general direction and control, separated from the day-to-day executive functions of the Department.  This was set up in 1979 in the Department of Health.  Despite the enormous pressures of the unemployment situation, in the Department of Social Welfare we have responded by introducing new technology and we are trying to computerise the working of the Department.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a considerable need for change.  I would be the first to criticise the excessive number of grades in the Civil Service.  I have yet to understand why we need clerical assistants, clerical officers, executive officers, staff officers, higher executive officers, assistant principals, principal officers and assistant secretaries. Files go up through that layer of bureaucracy and I have yet to understand the system.  I know what I would like to do with it, what I intend to suggest should <Col N="1849" /> be done and I will be making my suggestions to my colleagues.  I intend to seek reforms in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the health services, the non-capital budget provisions for 1985 will, taking income into account, support an overall expenditure level of approximately £1,195 million.  This represents an increase of £65,500,000 on the corresponding 1984 spending level and it represents 7.6 per cent of GNP.  To listen to the howls of anguish, particularly from some notorious health boards, one would imagine the money had been cut back. In 1985 another £65,500,000 is being pumped into the health services as compared with the money spent in 1984.  The budget allocation for health services includes provision for increases in health allowances in line with the 6½ per cent increase in long term social welfare benefits with effect from July.  Therefore I want to announce a number of increases in the health area and put them on the record because it is essential at this stage that we proceed with payments.</P>
    <P>There will be an extra £2.35 a week in the personal rate of the disabled person's maintenance allowance, bringing the maximum rate to £41.55 a week.  An extra £4 a week will be given in the maximum rate for a disabled person with an adult dependant, bringing the maximum rate up to £65.15 a week.  We will have increases in the allowances for child dependants of disabled persons ranging from 35p to 60p a week, bringing the range of these allowances from £5.90 to £9.55 a week.  We will have an increase in July of 85p per week in the rate of the supplementary allowance to pension, bringing the receipt of a blind pension, bringing the weekly rate to £14.25.  The rate for a blind married couple will be £28.50, an increase of £1.70 per week.  An increase of 15p per week will apply in respect of each child dependant.  Persons in receipt of the infectious disease maintenance allowance will receive an increase of £2.55 per week from July, giving a new weekly rate of £41.85.  The rate in respect of a person with a dependant spouse will be increased to £75.95 per week.  The new rates for child dependants will range <Col N="1850" /> from £8.45 to £10.30 per week for each child.</P>
    <P>Other health allowances are also being increased as follows.  The domiciliary care allowance in respect of mentally handicapped children will be increased from £66 to £70 per month from July. The mobility allowance will be increased by £20 to £320 annually.  The capitation rates for persons in special training centres will be increased from £785 to £835 per annum from July, while the rate in respect of community workshops will be increased by £45 to £755 per annum.  The pocket money allowance payable to persons in long stay institutions who have no means of their own will be increased by 50p to an average of £7 per week.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce a uniform schedule of rates nationwide in respect of children boarded out under the Health Act, 1953.  At present health boards pay 16 different rates depending on the age of the child and the length of stay.  It is proposed to have a uniform number of rates of four in all.  Long term rates for children up to five years vary from £24.15 to £27.30 per week.  The latter rate will become the standard from July.  Short term rates for older children currently vary from £28 to £31.80 per week.  The latter rate will be standard also from July. From July the driver training fee payable to the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disabled Drivers Association Centre in respect of disabled drivers is also being increased by £21 to £342.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health care services generally I emphasise that we enjoy an excellent level of health care in this country. We have succeeded in bringing our health services and health indicators broadly into line with those prevailing in other developed countries.  The scope of our health services is unusually wide, more so than in other European countries. It includes sophisticated medical equipment in hospitals, family medicine in the home and in the doctor's surgery, long term care for the elderly and handicapped and a wide range of services to assist people with physical, mental and social disabilities.  In recent decades the <Col N="1851" /> range and depth of our services has grown rapidly, embracing many technological advances as well as a considerable expansion into the area of personal social service.  Not unexpectedly, these improvements were achieved at considerable cost.  The numbers of persons employed in the health services showed quite a dramatic growth during the seventies, and the period up to 1982 saw a steady growth in the level of resources allocated to the health services, both in absolute and relative terms.  Net non-capital expenditure grew from £143 million or 5.2 per cent of GNP in 1973-74 to £948 million or 8 per cent of GNP in 1982.</P>
    <P>While the growth in health spending and the improvements in services thus brought about are a mark of the caring nature of our society, there has been a necessity to restore order to our public finances and, therefore, some curbs on spending in the health services had of necessity to be introduced.  The health services absorb about 20 per cent of total non-capital expenditure on public services. It is inevitable that the health services would have to bear some share, I might say a very small share, in the reductions in public expenditure in recent years.  Therefore, we have introduced a new strategy, broadly speaking, involving a shift in resources from institutional to the community care area as our resources permit.  While there may be a modest decline in real terms in the resources available for health services over the period of the national plan, I am confident that we will be able not only to preserve the essential fabric of our services but also to redeploy resources to develop some other essential services and at the same time deliver in each of the years 1985 to 1987 a more cost-effective service directly to the public.</P>
    <P>Some agencies experienced difficulty in managing within their budgets in 1984. Some of them are just playing pure party politics with their budgets.  For example, people in the Southern Health Board were saying that they were short £9.6 million.  Yesterday, having had another <Col N="1852" /> look at it, they said it was £8.4 million.  I have no doubt that it will keep dropping as the months go by and it will probably end up as £2 million or £3 million.  Last year they said it would be £5.6 million and at the end of the day it was £2.4 million.  Needless to remark, the local elections are coming up.  Politicians on health boards regard health as a good old bit of political horseplay for gaining votes and they put the fear of God into every patient in sight and, therefore, they want additional resources.</P>
    <P>The health boards for 1985 have sufficient resources to continue to deliver their services without in any way affecting their essential services.  The vast bulk of our voluntary hospitals lived within their budgets comfortably in 1983 and 1984 and this year they are also doing so, but they have not shafts of local politicians on their board who decide that the Minister of the day who is trying to achieve various changes is a choice target and, of course, it is good for newpaper publicity. The same applies in respect of some consultants. A consultant in the Western Health Board recently alleged that people were going to die.  This kind of outrageous nonsense is going on, but the more it is stated, the more it is exaggerated the more unhelpful it becomes in terms of delivering our services, and the more that kind of spurious criticism will appear to be what it is, namely very special pleading which has no basis in reality.  Therefore, I assure the House that I do not countenance any action which would imperil lives in any health board area.  I am heartened by the constructive approach of a number of health broads who have already drawn up detailed budgets.  They are quite capable and they will live within their approved expenditure limits in 1985.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the health services are changing from a very traditional, highly professionalised, institutionalised, tight structure into a community based, preventive medicine oriented structure, and that will continue during 1985.  I have no doubt that we will bring about those changes and that the services will be of major benefit in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> I want to thank the Members of the House for their patience in dealing with many of the difficulties that I have put before them in the health and social welfare areas in 1984 and 1985.  They have been most helpful, co-operative and understanding of the difficulties facing the Department.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Members of the House it is appropriate that I thank particularly the former Secretary of the Department of Health, Mr. Dermot Condon, who retired a few weeks ago after a lifetime of service in the health area.  He made an enormous contribution in that area.  On behalf of the Government and on behalf of those Members of the Oireachtas who served in the Department with Mr. Condon, I wish to put on record our formal appreciation of his outstanding contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know where to begin to comment on this trick-of-the-loop budget.  During my time in this House it has been understood that budget time gave to the Minister for Finance of the day the opportunity to come into the House and deliver his state of the nation address in terms of the finances of the country.  We accept that any Minister for Finance, being also a politician, would be likely to present his statement in as colourful and attractive a package as possible but the presentation of this year's budget is as fraudulent a presentation of the true account of our finances as I have ever heard.  In so far as the budget overlooks the many problems besetting the country, I must describe it again as a trick-of-the-loop budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there is a cosmetic used by the ladies and which is known as blusher, its purpose being to highlight certain features of the face.  Fortunately for the ladies they can remove the blusher at night but it is not possible for the Minister for Finance to remove the blusher he chose to put on his budget statement.  Within a week every member of the Government is embarking on some method of attempting to divert the interest of the people so that the extent of the fraudulence, of the hypocrisy and of the <Col N="1854" /> Government distancing themselves from what they have always referred to as financial rectitude is apparent to all.</P>
    <P>This morning we witnessed a perfect example of that attitude by no less a person than the Taoiseach.  During the time that I have had the honour to be a Member of this House, I do not recollect any other budget debate when the Taoiseach of the day failed to honour the Leader of the Opposition by not being present for his statement.  However, this morning we witnessed what I regard as a calculated insult by the Taoiseach, this Taoiseach who with his aides and with the slush money made available has had himself put on a pedestal as being the great exponent of good behaviour, of rectitude, propriety and everything that was right while we on this side of the House were regarded by him as the poor menial peasants who knew very little about anything, good manners included.  This is the Taoiseach who will accuse this side of the House of having no contribution to make or of being destructive or non co-operative but this morning during a statement that outlined our financial position more correctly and more honestly than did the statement either of the Minister for Finance or of the Taoiseach, he did not consider it worthwhile to be present.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, would the Deputy not take into account the fact that because one of his party colleagues did not show up to use the 57 minutes remaining to him, the Leader of the Opposition chose to speak an hour earlier than the time at which he was expected to speak?</P>

      <P>The young Minister of State has given me an opportunity to confirm to the House that it was well known that the Leader of the Opposition was speaking at that time.  I thought the Minister was about to make the excuse <Col N="1855" /> that his able Leader was at the specially convened meeting of the Government, a meeting called by himself, to deal apparently with a matter he considers much more important than the matter of the address on the budget of the Leader of the Opposition.  Was that meeting to deal with a subject that has been given new and wonderful top priority, the question of whether young people should have condoms, whether they should be made available to those still in subsidised shoe leather, whether they should be available to 16 or 18 years olds?  This is another example of the attempts by the Government to deflect interest from the budget. Apart from the calculated insult offered to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House, the Taoiseach obviously regarded the important issue to be the preparation of that legislation which to the parties in Government represents the all-pervading matter of family planning but which they reduce to the question of the provision of contraceptives at the age of 16, 18 or 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remind me of an unfortunate man who lived in the village in which I was reared and who because of a problem he had in the matter of alcohol neglected his wife and family. That man, on the way home to his wife and children, would throw out to the children of his neighbours whatever pennies he had in his pocket, leaving his own family to bear the brunt of his irresponsibility and carelessness.  Here we are looking at a Government who, we are given to understand, are the keepers of financial rectitude and who would remind us that a former Leader of this party said that when the unemployment figure exceeded 100,000, it should be a matter of &ldquo;out, out, out&rdquo; for any government. There has been a 60 per cent increase in unemployment since the Government came into office.  This brings the figure to 235,000, that is 11,000 in excess of the figure visualised by the Government by the time of the expiry of their national plan.  It is not my intention to follow the example of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and to attack <Col N="1856" /> the press.  Recently a very able presentation of the true financial state made by my colleague, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was referred to by a press commentator who implied that every time we are hard up for a case or hard up for lies we send in poor Albert.  The true position as stated specifically by Deputy Reynolds is that the budget deficit has risen from £900 million to £1.2 billion, that the national debt has risen by 50 per cent from £12 billion to £18 billion.  These people are still masquerading as people who are achieving and are moving towards the plan. They have destroyed our whole financial structure and I shudder to think when it will be put in order.  I do not oppose borrowing in accordance with a capacity to repay, such as the fashion in which my wife and family would indulge in a certain amount of HP that we knew we could contain but the finances of this country are in such a state that allowing myself a certain lifespan they will not be put in order in my time.</P>
    <P>In that statement which was supposed to give a global picture we have a drunken approach.  I am not suggesting that the Minister was inebriated when he delivered his budget speech but I am staying with the anology.  The alcoholic Minister for Finance throws out £10,000 to the junior jazz orchestra and throws £300,000 to the zoological gardens and he makes that a feature of his budget.  Those items should be contained under the subhead of miscellaneous items.  I acknowledge that due to the kicking of the junior Minister, Deputy Donal Creed, we are getting some recognition for youth and sport but it should not be a feature in a budget that illustrates the appalling economic state of this country although the main figures to which I referred are suitably covered up.</P>
    <P>People in Fine Gael branches throughout the country believed in the Government but their disbelief is mounting day by day.  When the next speaker for the Government speaks I hope they will address themselves to what I am saying and say &ldquo;Deputy Tunney was telling lies&rdquo;. I will not mind being accused of that if it is true.  I am inviting that challenge <Col N="1857" /> because I know it cannot be taken up.  I want the Government to take the Opposition into their confidence because the situation that has arisen is far too serious for trick acting or drunken behaviour by the Minister for Finance or bad manners by the Taoiseach.  Unless all sides of the House apply themselves to first of all giving leadership, which the Taoiseach is not capable of giving, and restoring the confidence of the people the receivers will step in.  Those receivers will not be qualified auditors or chartered accountants. They will be like the people who step in in other countries when the country reaches bankruptcy &mdash; instead of the Government or the manager or man or women of the house accepting his plight, he moves down to the local pub.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare, having delivered himself among other things of his attack on the press, on politicians and on anybody who dared criticise him or his Department, has left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give it to him and to you.  Before he left the Minister announced that it was possible for him to increase the disabled person's allowance to a maximum of £41.55 per week and that he was also happy to announce that he, the custodian of this great purse of £2,000 billion, was increasing the mobility allowance by £20 to £320 annually. When the amount is small one talks about what it represents annually.  The Minister reminded the House of his preparedness to listen to reason as presented to him here.  I would remind the Minister, in his absence, of a case I made to him a month ago about a young man in Finglas who was in receipt of mobility allowance and the disability allowance and who had the good fortune to fall in love and get married. The man was 29 years old living with his father, an old age pensioner, in a local authority house.  The Eastern Health Board representative representing the Minister called on him and said that because he was now married and <Col N="1858" /> because his wife was working he was not entitled to that allowance.  I raised that matter here in the House and the only defence the Minister could make was that Terry Boland and his new wife lived with Terry's father and that Terry's father was the tenant of the house and paid a very small rent.  I asked the Minister was he, the man who controls that budget of £2 billion, the man who was so critical of anybody who dares criticise him, telling me that out of £2 billion he expected Terry's wife Margaret to report into Downes factory every morning at 7 o'clock and work until 4 o'clock and keep Terry?</P>
      <P>Leave aside Terry's disappointment that he is now the responsibility of his young wife who has to go out to work. Leave aside how he will feel and how the great elation of being married is now being transformed into the depression which understandably he is experiencing. The Minister has told me that his circumstances are not so bad, that he is living with his father and does not have to pay any great rent.  What happened a fortnight ago?  Dublin Corporation raised the rent of the house from £1 to £16.  That rent is now being calculated on Margaret's earnings.  The girl did not marry him for any reasons of charity.  She was genuinely in love with and married this young man in a wheelchair who was living with his father who paid £1 rent.  The result of that true, non-contraceptive, non-condom love &mdash; and perhaps what the Minister wants is that Margaret would come and live with him so that everything would be all right &mdash; is that Terry loses about £42 a week and the father's rent is increased from £1 to £16.  That is not theory.  That is not a case about which the Minister does not know.  It has been brought to his notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is masquerading as the great Minister with the great social conscience and soft heart.  He has not told us how because of the cutbacks to the health board old aged pensioners who are institutionalised and who generally give up the book to the administrator of the institution, being handed back what is called &ldquo;comfort money&rdquo;, for the first time last <Col N="1859" /> year had no increase in that &ldquo;comfort money&rdquo;.  Because of the Minister's cutbacks the Eastern Health Board gobbled up the total increase of about £3 and will do the same this year.  Normally those people should have got perhaps £1 to try to make up for the increase in the cost of the commodities which they buy for themselves &mdash; the newspaper, the telephone call, the shave, the new shirt, the clothing.  They would certainly need more, but they got no increase at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister expects me to genuflect to the wonderful manner in which he and his civil servants are administering to the needs of the nation in respect of social welfare.  I have made repeated representations to him on behalf of married women, some of whom have been contributing to the fund for the last 15 years but are now unemployed.  They had a baby perhaps a year ago, opted out of employment, but when they go to the employment exchange they are told that they are not available for work.  Therefore, they are not getting their entitlements in the matter of unemployment assistance.  I have written to the Minister about countless cases of this kind.  I am not talking about the unfortunate category described as being on the dole and a terrible weight around our necks.  I am talking about someone who since she left school has been contributing to the social welfare fund.  She is now denied her entitlements because some civil servant or inspector, who is being lauded to the skies by the Minister, decides that, even though the baby is a year old and the mother is living with her mother, who would be happy to look after the baby, and living close to a sister, who would also be happy to look after the baby, she is not available for work.  Even though she can show that I have made representations to the Department of Labour recommending her to anybody who might be prepared or anxious or free to employ her and even though she can show 20 negative replies, the Minister decides that she should be looking after her baby. He cannot blame the civil servants.  He is responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> We move to another side, the professional side of things, where you have a much praised civil servant, or a teacher, who is married and has a baby.  She is obliged to return to work after seven or eight weeks.  There is nothing at all thought about her baby.  It is no excuse for her to say that in another section of this Department a woman who has a baby a year old will be denied her unemployment benefit because in the opinion of that Department and of that Minister she is not available for work.  They are asking the professional girl to return to work even though her baby is only seven weeks old.  The position is ludicrous in the extreme.  The Minister, who defends the civil servants who make those decisions, is not in tune with the needs of the people and has moved a long way from the days when he would preach to all his concern for the downtrodden, the weak and the poorer.</P>
    <P>I did not come into this House masquerading on the backs of people who have the misfortune to be poor, but I recognise injustice when I see it.  I recognise two-facedness when I see it.  The decisions are being made by those people on behalf of the Minister so that he will attain that great position he thinks the Lord has made him for, to keep cutting back money and manage his budget with the least money possible.  He is getting a repeat £2 billion, not of his money.  He pays as little to the fund as I do, and what we pay is very little.  This money belongs to the PAYE sector.  He does not want any disagreement brought in between those paying PAYE and the rural people, the farmers.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying that according to my assessment of the situation, the PAYE sector are very badly done by.  Perhaps over the years there has been an attitude here that somebody who went out working to earn his livelihood by the sweat of his brow, even though he was far more intelligent, far more enlightened than those who call themselves professionals, must lie down. Everyone of us is obliged to speak on injustice when we see it.  We are obliged to bring to the attention of this House <Col N="1861" /> injustice such as is being done to that unfortunate person in the wheelchair in Finglas.  I have made representations to the health board, the Department and the Minister, but they said that there must be a means test.  The board said they had not the money and that the Minister was telling them that they must work within certain limits.  They said they have not the money for Terry, or for the comfort of the old people.  I ask what are they using the money for?  Where is it going?  Let them show me some deserving area to which it is going and I shall believe them, but I do not see it.</P>
    <P>We had in this political alcoholic's budget another throw to the neighbour's child, the great day for the women of Ireland &mdash; the breakthrough in dental treatment.  The first condition was that one's husband be an insured worker, the second condition being that the wife be pregnant.  I am saying nothing new in this &mdash; leaving politicians aside, they might be accused of saying anything to suit their argument &mdash; it has been said by medical people that those of us who have the good fortune to be married and whose wives have had babies know little about it.  The recollection I have of my wife in that happy state was that she could not have X rays, she could not have her teeth attended to.  Perhaps something has occurred in the make-up of women in the last ten years which renders it possible for them to survive such examinations and have their teeth attended to.  If it has, well and good, I would accept that the Minister has done something.</P>
    <P>The same conditions apply to optical treatment which is confined to the wives of insured workers.  I have talked to opticians who tell me that ordinarily the need for glasses in the case of somebody who has not had a weakness attended to in the earlier part of their life, commences around the age of 37 or 38 onwards.  This is the age at which most married women have decided they may have had sufficient pregnancies and will not be looking for glasses.  But, if they do want glasses, they will have to become pregnant.  I am assuming that Deputy Avril Doyle will not accuse me of being sexist if I say that <Col N="1862" /> she would be better able to articulate the special position of the ladies in that regard, but I do not think she will be able to contradict the two points I have been making.</P>
    <P>Every married woman looks forward to the day she will have a baby.  Traditionally in this State &mdash; and I should say my late father was a Member of these two Houses &mdash; we have prided ourselves on the fact that we gave recognition to the contribution the woman made &mdash; however inadequate was that recognition &mdash; which she regarded as the State's recognition of her being as attentive as she was, acting as nurse, doctor, physician, psychologist, protector and teacher to that child, and she got children's allowance. Apart from the actual amount, which under any Government &mdash; including ours &mdash; was never adequate, there was its psychological effect on that woman in that to some extent she was correct in thinking that this was the recognition of the community, the State, of her role, of her importance in that it was she who made this exceptional, unique contribution to society.</P>
    <P>Has there been any increase in the children's allowances this year?  There has been none at all.  No, the money has been set aside for medical card holders, who probably will get condoms if they are over 18 years of age.  There is nothing at all; money is needed for something more urgent.  With a budget deficit now of £1.2 billion and national indebtedness of £18 billion it is too much to expect that the State would acknowledge the contribution of the stay-at-home wife, whatever that means.  We still live with the effrontery to married women, who used to be described as those who did not work.  Years ago one would hear people ask: &ldquo;Are you married?&rdquo; the answer would be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; then the question: &ldquo;Are you working?&rdquo; when the reply would be &ldquo;No, I am a housewife&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that tradition was carried on over many years not through any malice but because their role was not recognised.  This year there is money for the Zoo, for the jazz orchestra, but none for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> The Minister spoke earlier of the special income tax allowance for children &mdash; something in the region of £130 a year for a child, which would not get them into a disco or buy them ice cream. Apparently that is the reason they cannot be given any special children's allowance. We must be mindful of the times.</P>
    <P>The last comment I shall make in regard to social welfare in this budget concerns figures contained in the tables presented to me by the Minister for Finance, tables from which I was to gather there were great benefits accruing to people arising from this adjustment of the income tax bands.  I looked in one column and took what I thought to be a salary representative of those people I represent &mdash; a man and wife, married, earning £13,000 per annum where it shows an income tax saving of £124 per annum.  Then I moved across to the other column showing man, wife and one child earning £13,000 per annum, who will save £111 per annum under this budget £12 less for the man and wife with the child than for the man and wife who are childless.</P>
    <P>That man, woman and child, if they are the industrious and thrifty people I would like them to be, will have a mortgage on their house.  We know that as a result of the Minister's decision to raise the composite rate of tax on building societies the repayments on their £30,000 will be increased unless the Minister does what he should do and not be asking building societies to act as tax gatherers. That is what he is doing, he is taxing people through the building societies because he has not the courage to do it himself.  Anybody here who is as good at mathematics as I am will know that for that family with their £30,000 house it will mean an extra 2 per cent.  Deputy A. Doyle is good at mathematics.  She will know what that amounts to: it will amount to more than the reduction the husband will receive in his income tax.  In that respect the Minister for Finance is forcing the building societies to implement his new taxation.  That is another reason I contend this is a trick of the loop <Col N="1864" /> budget, a blusher budget which has been exposed inside of the week.</P>
    <P>Moving on to unemployment, that terrible blight that has hit this country, if we are to take the projections contained in the national plan, the unemployment figure will be 11,000 fewer in 1987. Having created interest in the document, with your permission, Sir, I will read from an article entitled &ldquo;Plans for everything except jobs&rdquo;.  I will leave aside for the moment the name of the person who wrote the article lest somebody might think he was a TD or a Senator or a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will provide the article for the Official Report later on, mindful of the requirements in the matter of reading from any article in this House.  The article says:</P>
    <P>There is now one-in-six of the workforce out of work.  One-in-twelve is drawing only the basic means tested unemployment assistance.  A total of 225,445&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That gives the House an idea of when the article was written, about three weeks ago.  The figure is now 235,000.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>A total of 225,445 people were signing on at the unemployment exchanges....</P>
    <P>The trouble is that the Government is offering no hope of any improvement over the next three years.  On the basis of the projections in its economic plan <i>Building On Reality</i> there will be 226,500 people out of work at the end of 1987....</P>
    <P>There are plans for trimming public spending; there are plans for reducing State borrowing; there are plans for cutting the number of civil servants. But there are no plans for reducing the number out of work.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Labour.  If you asked ten people who he is they would not know.  For reasons best known to himself he does not want to be identified with that Department.  In any of the many industrial problems I had in my constituency I could not encourage the Minister for Labour to intervene even though <Col N="1865" /> when he was in Opposition he pointed out their functions to Ministers.  The week the unemployment figure moved from 225,135 our Minister for Labour was in Massachusetts, or someplace like that, solving the Northern Ireland problem. I see the benefit of Members of this House going to any venue where they could take part in anything which would be beneficial to the people.  I have always spoken against people who accuse us of perks or junkets.  To me it is essential that politicians should move around and see what is happening elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The week when we had an unprecedented increase in unemployment I had occasion to ring up the Department of Labour and I was told the Minister was in America at some old jaded conference on the problems of Northern Ireland.  I said to myself that he was throwing in the towel and putting distance between himself and the problems.  I am not saying this on any personal level.  From the time I was on Dublin Corporation my relations with him have been good.  I am criticising the holder of an office, the Minister for Labour.  I am thinking in terms of the young people who are demented at the fact that they have nothing to do notwithstanding their education and academic qualifications.  A man who is supposed to give leadership regards it as highly important for him to represent this country at some old jaded spurious conference in America.  If it were not tragic it would be a joke.</P>
    <P>I will read an extract from the annual report of the FUE:</P>
    <P>The year ended without any sign of the proposals for industrial relations reform promised by the Minister for Labour.  There appears to be little appreciation of the extent to which our legislation and practices have fallen behind competing countries, and of the serious effect which a poor industrial relations environment can have on investment.</P>
    <P>We are in urgent need of a reassessment of our whole attitude to work and a need for everybody to jettison the old sacred slogans which had to be used by people <Col N="1866" /> like my late father and mother who were exploited when they worked in this city. However irrelevant today, those slogans are still being used.  I suppose it is characteristic of many Irish people, myself included perhaps, to be so spineless that we are prepared to see employment put at risk because one selfish person decides to stand outside an industrial unit into which State investment has been put and hold up some old placard because he is not getting what he wants.  We will never be able to supply full employment in the traditional industries.</P>
    <P>We will never have full employment and a five day week for everybody.  There is a mechanism through which we can provide gainful occupation for our people by introducing new flexibility and giving a new meaning to the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;. We all know that with the advances in technology it will be impossible to provide full employment.  The great virtue of technology is that it demonstrates that man can live and earn his living without physical exertion, although it will then be necessary to provide an opportunity for him to indulge in physical exercise for his own well-being.  It is possible for us to make every person in Ireland feel important because he or she is performing a duty but we still labour on in the same old ways.</P>
    <P>When people refuse to work and to make their contribution to industry we call it industrial action when everybody knows it is industrial inaction.  It is a refusal by people to perform certain duties but we give it the grandiose title of industrial action.  The investment of millions of pounds is put at risk.  I know the Irish worker is as good a worker as anybody else and that we are competing with all the other nations in the world. We cannot sit back and use old slogans and pay homage to slogans which were relevant 50 years ago.  They are not relevant today and they are not relevant to survival.  People say: &ldquo;Let somebody else do it.&rdquo; I will not be the one to say there are too many trade unionists.  I will not be the one to say you cannot give a salary or a wage beyond that which is possible. I will not be the one to allow for inflation <Col N="1867" /> and handing out paper money.  Shove it under the carpet.  &ldquo;Let somebody else do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any responsible Minister for Labour would be trying to remedy the present situation.  I would like to pay a tribute to AnCO because they do the job required of them.  We give them a lot of money so that they can provide opportunities for young people to acquire skills. When I was headmaster in Blanchardstown we were always happy to direct students into the motor trade to be trained as motor mechanics.  For the last two years the number of apprentices to this trade has dropped.  It was hoped that this year the budget might encourage garage owners to take on new apprentices but what did the Minister do?  He increased the cost of labour in garages by 5 per cent thus guaranteeing that no extra apprentices would be taken on.</P>
    <P>Traditionally we gave an impetus to the motor trade by giving allowances to representatives who had to travel throughout the country discharging their duties.  They had free cars to help them perform their duties more efficiently and this in turn created a need for new cars. What has the Minister done?  He has given an allowance of £3,500 but any amount over that is liable to tax.  I am not critical of those who ask me if the Minister, Deputy Dukes, could survive on that money even though he has a salary and the usual perks.  At one time we were told we were supplied with a car for security reasons because we might be taken as hostages, but that has changed now.  This Government are doing away with State cars, but they are giving an allowance to the people who use their own cars.  Why not allow the full price of a car to the company representative who must travel five or five and a half days a week doing his job?  Decisions like that increase cynicism among the people.</P>
    <P>I am trying to remember instructions I got when I was studying economics at college.  We were told about costs, opportunity costs, investments and prudence. <Col N="1868" /> I believe one should never invest in anything unless one can be guaranteed a very good profit.  We invest £240 million in the Garda.  I am not going to talk about investments in the courts and ancillary matters, nor will I discuss the amount we invest in the Army or how much they spend when co-operating with the Garda, because that is money well spent.  In spite of the prevailing fashion, I have never been critical of the Garda.  The force are as good a body of men and women as you will find anywhere but like all institutions run by humans they have their imperfections. We are investing a considerable amount in the Garda.  We should get the maximum benefit from our investment but we are not, because we delayed many years introducing the Criminal Justice Bill.  Then we spent weeks discussing it, but it is still not in force.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the establishment of a committee, sought by members of the Garda and Members of this House, to deal with the training and retraining of gardaí, because we were not maximising on our investment and, bearing in mind the demands made on them, there was a great need for definition training. This committee was set up two and a half years ago to study these matters, but excluding recruitment training.  That committee very wisely accepted a representative from the general body of the Garda and from the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  That committee is no longer in existence and a new committee has been set up.  The Minister may say the commissioner set up this committee but in the opinion of the Minister and the commissioner there is no room on that committee for a representative of the Garda or the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the Taoiseach's calculated insult to our leader, but was there ever anything more calculated to insult those 11,000 people than setting up a committee to look into their affairs but excluding any representative of the Garda, or the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors?  I am talking about getting value for money, getting value for the £250 million the people are happy to <Col N="1869" /> invest in our Garda.  Imagine that I am a teacher and the Government set up a committee to look into the training and retraining of teachers, but I am told the ASTI or the TUI will not be represented on that committee.  I am told the committee will consist of academics, personnel experts and a civil servant.  To some people that may seem relatively unimportant but to me it is the most dangerous decision ever made.  How can we expect this body of people to co-operate as the Garda have always done when we are not giving them a representative on the committee set up to look into the running of the Garda Síochána? Because my time is limited I must leave this point undeveloped.</P>
    <P>I hoped I could say a few words about education and the unfortunate PAYE workers who keep the ship moving but who get very little from it.  I note with regret that the Minister for Education has identified sexism in education as one of the pressing needs of the day.  To me that ranks at the very bottom of priorities especially when we have no remedial teachers.  The Minister is worried that the children will not receive any sex instruction. What about the thousands of young children whose parents cannot compensate for the lack of teaching in Irish, English, mathematics, history and geography? There is a ratio of one teacher to 45 students.  There is a need for remedial teachers but the Minister cannot make provision for those either.  This is another example of the double think and of the ineptitude of the Government and the Taoiseach.  Would the Taoiseach, in God's name, consider offering his position as leader to somebody else?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the direction of the budget delivered by the Minister last week.  I will refrain from taking up the invitation of Deputy Tunney, however graciously offered, to respond in detail to some of the points he made.  I can arrange at a later date, even later today, to have the difference between sex education and sexism explained to the Deputy.  It has no part in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the tax measures <Col N="1870" /> in the budget are designed to stimulate growth in economic activity and these, together with other Government strategy and action, will have a tremendous part to play in helping our appalling unemployment problem.  These tax measures, taken in tandem with the tremendous success of the enterprise allowance scheme over the last 12 months, have ensured that 5,000 people have already been helped to set up on their own. Applications are still coming in to the Department at the rate of 100 per week. These various tax measures combined, for example, with the social employment scheme announced in <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; I am delighted that Wexford is included and Wexford County Council are about to employ 200 people under this scheme with a further 300 being taken on in a matter of weeks &mdash; will insure that the target of 10,000 jobs is feasible under this scheme.  We also have the employment incentive scheme which subsidises newly hired workers.  In the last four months of 1984, the rate was running at about 50 per cent over the previous year and totalled about 7,000.  The Government are reviewing the possibilities of improvements under this scheme.</P>
    <P>When we take the budget in the context of the many other measures, including the few I have just mentioned, it is clear that a real effort is being made and that there is true recognition of the appalling problem of our unemployment figures.  We need a climate in which the risk taker is adequately rewarded, in which there is an incentive to work and in which the economic activity will have a natural momentum.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of VAT bands and the move towards more uniformity as recommended by the first report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses are most welcome to all sectors of business. Since 1980, VAT rates have been increased on an annual basis.  The low rate has gone up by as much as 130 per cent, thus exacerbating the problem of inflation and capital outflow.  With the reduction of VAT bands from six to three and the abolition of the 35 per cent rate, we hope to see a tremendous turnaround <Col N="1871" /> in the economy in specific areas.  The tax rate on many essential groceries will be reduced shortly which is of tremendous interest to the consumer generally who will also see an easing of the very difficult situation that has existed in cross-Border traffic.  The brown goods industry has at last got relief and a reprieve with a future in sight.  The VAT relief is also very good news for those businesses caught up in a cash flow crisis because of the bank guarantee aspect of VAT at the point of entry.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister could have gone some way down the road of removing the severe imposition on the commercial and industrial sector by exempting capital goods and components from the bank guarantee of the VAT at the point of entry and replacing it with a first warning system where any defaulters would have the guarantee replaced. Never having supported the introduction of VAT at the point of entry I understand, however, that to remove it in one year at the stroke of a pen would cost the Exchequer in the region of £190 million. We have made a small start along this road and I urge the Minister to continue in this direction.  What we are doing in this area is in accordance with an EC directive towards the day when VAT at the point of entry will be fully replaced.</P>
    <P>When one talks about the reduction in VAT levels, it must be remembered what a bonus it will be to certain sectors of the economy.  It is essential that we recognise that there are also problems as a result, particularly, of the removal of the 5 per cent VAT band.  On the one hand we have the problems of the construction industry.  The Minister had the option of exempting them altogether, which is not on because of the benefits of being rated for VAT, albeit at a low level, in terms of repayments and rebates, or increasing the rate to 10 per cent.  If he had exempted them, the construction industry would have fallen into what has been perceived as a problem, for example, for live theatre.  They were rated at 5 per cent and have now been exempted. Under EC legislation, the Minister <Col N="1872" /> cannot introduce any more zero rates for goods and services.  Indeed, the Government have been taken to court in Luxembourg because of the many items and services which are on zero rating.  Therefore, it is not an option any more.  It is out of our hands and the Government have no choice.  The construction industry, because exemption was not a consideration in view of the way that business operates, have had to go to the 10 per cent band.  This will cause difficulties and I applaud the announcement today by the Minister for Finance in his recognition of the difficulties that the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on new houses will cause.  He announced the deferral of the increase of 5 per cent on new houses to 1 May so that those who have already signed contracts or are committed to mortgages and who have applied for the first time grant of £1,000 will be able to see that the building is completed, that they can pay and are in their houses by 1 May.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister's recognition of the particular difficulty which this would have caused to new house buyers and I ask him to look at the possible extension of his announcement today to the subcontracting end of building.  Many other companies were VAT rated at 5 per cent and are now in the 10 per cent rate.  This includes window suppliers and various other suppliers to the building industry. They are not so much criticising the increase to 10 per cent but there is a very difficult interim period in changing over to the higher rate, especially for those who pay VAT on a cash receipt basis. Perhaps the work is already done and the contractors have contracted for a price inclusive of 5 per cent VAT.  Unless that money can be got in before 1 March, the companies will have to bear an increase of 5 per cent.  For many companies this could be intolerable.  I urge the Minister to look at this point and see if he can handle it in the same way as he has dealt with the question of new houses.  I fully recognise that there is little room for manoeuvre when it comes to budgetary decisions of this kind.  We are always inclined to take the goodies but when it <Col N="1873" /> comes to paying for them we all squeal. That is part of human nature.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the VAT bands and of the top rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent will have to paid for.  It appears that this will cause some difficulty for certain sectors.  However, we can trust the Minister to investigate any difficulties that will be caused, particularly interim difficulties in the changeover, and to come up with satisfactory solutions for the sectors involved.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry has benefitted tremendously from the reduction in the VAT bands.  The potential of this industry cannot be overestimated.  For far too long successive Governments have failed to get their teeth into the potential of this industry.  It is a job intensive industry and is price sensitive.  The VAT changes announced should immediately translate into jobs.  We will have to have a linkage programme between this industry and other sectors of the economy and deepen the penetration of the tourist industry into all aspects of the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to reduce VAT to 10 per cent on hotel accommodation, car hire and other aspects of the tourist industry which go to make up a successful holiday.  I regret that the Minister was unable to accommodate the cry for the reduction of VAT to 10 per cent for the catering and food end of the industry. Coming from an area which depends heavily on tourism I see the difficulty this is causing to restaurants and hotel owners.  On the other hand, when the cost of this is explained to us it is easy to understand why that option was not available in the budget.  If the Minister decided to reduce the VAT on food in restaurants and hotels to 10 per cent and even if take-aways which are exempt from VAT, were brought into the 10 per cent band, it would still have cost the Exchequer £50 million to give such a reduction.  That money was not available. I hope the industry will respond to the reduction of VAT on accommodation, car hire and so on and that more jobs will be created.  I have no doubt but that will be so.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced treatment <Col N="1874" /> benefits for the wives of insured workers during pregnancy.  There has been much criticism and political play made of this point.  There is no doubt but that the ideal and optimum solution would be for the wives of all insured workers, regardless of their position, to benefit from optical, dental and aural treatment.  However, it is a small beginning and what we can afford.  For far too long we have failed to recognise the contribution made to the economy by the wife and mother who stays at home to rear her children.  The most important role of any woman who chooses to marry and have children is to rear those children.  It is not her only role, and it never will be, but if she chooses to do so it will always be her most important role.  I applaud the Minister for recognising this and for recognising that it is their hard-earned right to have benefits under their husband's insurance.  I urge the Minister to keep in mind for next year's budget the extension of this treatment to all women who are married to insured workers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 25 per cent increase in the free fuel scheme.  An increase of £1 may not seem a lot on the face of it.  I accept it will only go part of the way in paying the fuel bills for those involved in the scheme.  At the same time it is a scheme which, if monitored carefully, will have tremendous benefit for people, particularly in urban areas where fuel and timber are not readily available.  Social welfare increases were in line with inflation and with the Government's commitment to give a helping hand to those who need it in this area.</P>
    <P>The continuing imposition of a bank levy will always be a vexed question. However, in arguing against it, it is often forgotten that bank services are not subject to VAT and so the levy can be construed as an alternative to that.  The banks do a bad public relations job in placing before the public the reasons &mdash; they are good reasons &mdash; why the levy might not be in the nation's best interests.  The banks do not wish to have the confidence of their shareholders eroded.  Being public companies it is in their interest to keep share prices up.  However, being <Col N="1875" /> Irish owned banks and servicing every sector of the economy, not least investors, it is in all our interests that the return on shareholders' investments is sufficiently buoyant to enable them to remain Irish owned.  The banks have felt the draught since deposit interest was taxed at over £50 per investor.  In the budget the Minister doubled that limit for people over 66 years of age, but the benefit should have been extended to all.</P>
    <P>I would encourage savings by increasing the ceiling for tax relief to £500 per individual.  The present situation is forcing money into areas of non-disclosure and into the black economy instead of being put to productive use.</P>
    <P>As regards the measures taken in relation to personal taxation, the broadening of the tax bands for PAYE workers and the reduction of the highest level to 60 per cent is most welcome in our penal taxation system.  The tragedy of the brain drain has continued for far too long. Highly educated young people, funded through third level education by the taxpayer, have gone abroad in their thousands to find reward elsewhere for their endeavours.  This outflow has served only to improve the economies of our competitors, as Deputy Flynn said this morning. It is to be hoped that the Minister's very welcome move will stem this flow.  As a result of broadening the tax bands and the general improvement in that area no one will be worse off and many groups will get a modest relief.</P>
    <P>I welcome and again applaud the tax concession in relation to the first £2,000 of lease income for farmers retiring from active farming.  Far too large a proportion of our land is in the hands of people who through age, infirmity or indolence are not in a position to maximise the return from it.  We have paid lip service to this problem for a long time.  The Minister has now introduced an incentive for this land to be leased to young productive farmers.  With the recent legislation and this budgetary provision no obstacle remains in the way of this master scheme. No landowner need fear that his constitutional property rights will be eroded by <Col N="1876" /> leasing his hand on a long term contract. The implications of this scheme are enormous. Land will be properly looked after, fenced and fertilised and optimum return will be achieved from this great natural asset for us all.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the tax exemption on stallion fees being confined to income from stallions at stud in this country.  This is to ensure that the relief benefits the domestic bloodstock industry only.  This scheme is extremely important in attracting the top sires to stand here and to keep Ireland to the fore in bloodstock breeding circles.  Our good grassland and temperate climate confer a natural advantage on this industry.</P>
    <P>However, there is one matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and one that needs immediate action.  Many farmers are earning a small income from stallions where the covering fees are in the region of only £100 and they are not exempt under the tax exemption for stallion fees while their neighbours running large stud farms where the covering fees are in excess of £10,000 are exempt from the tax.  I am talking about stallions leased by farmers from Bord na gCapall.  To date the system has served the half-bred bloodstock industry well and has put it in the forefront so far as showjumping is concerned.  During the years it has been a valuable export trade. There can be no doubt that the stallion fee exemption was meant to include this category and I urge the Minister to rectify the matter, perhaps with one exception. The recent proposal to introduce Hanoverian blood into Irish bloodstock has been greeted by such dismay by those who have the long term interests of the industry at heart &mdash; they do not view it merely from short term financial expediency &mdash; that this makes me suggest to the Minister that there should not be any tax exemption in respect of stud fees for such stallions.  I will avail of another opportunity to ventilate my views on this subject and of the damage that is being done to one of our premier industries by some of those into whose hands we have entrusted it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> Many companies have been under-capitalised since their establishment and because of low profitability and lack of further equity investment this state continues during the lifetime of the company. The venture capital scheme announced in last year's budget has not perhaps been as successful as it should be, even though it is early days yet.  The basic approach was correct but I ask the Minister to turn his attention to minor amendments that could turn a good idea into a very successful one.  For instance, it is essential that it be made clear that the terms of the general unit trust legislation do not apply to funds set up under this scheme as they are so restrictive few people would take the risk.  Also, the 5 per cent commission or limit on fees is too restrictive in view of the expenses involved in setting up, advising and monitoring progress of such a scheme.  I favour no limit being set and let the market forces dictate the appropriate level.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the cost to investors could be reduced if promoters were allowed to take shares in the companies to which they are directing funds.  This is precluded under present legislation.  There are also restrictions on disposal which are considered by many to be too restrictive.  Companies should be allowed to buy their own shares.  This system operates in the United States very successfully under the SBICs &mdash; the small business investment corporations.  In directing money to business which benefits the investor, as is proposed under our scheme from the tax allowance against the investment, we are helping the economy.  As the economy picks up and business becomes more sound the employment situation will improve automatically.  I look forward to a positive reaction from the Minister in the Finance Bill on the points I have raised in relation to the business expansion scheme as announced in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister announced changes in relation to the writing-off of development expenditure of the oil companies <Col N="1878" /> from the existing 10 per cent per annum over ten years to allowing a writeoff of 40 per cent per annum on a declining balance, which effectively is over four years.  This was heralded by all concerned, not least the Government, as a major concession but quite frankly it was not.  With the third licensing round now on, immediate clarification is needed in relation to royalties and Government participation which remain discretionary. It is this discretion that is hindering development. Ahead of appraisal, all oil fields are potentially marginal or sub-economic and some codification and clarification is needed to judge investment possibilities.</P>
    <P>No one is asking for softer licensing terms &mdash; I cannot over-emphasise that in case we get caught up in an ideological battle between different viewpoints.  It is not softer licensing terms that are wanted.  The ongoing prevarication means that potential exploration is being deterred.  The Government have nothing to lose and have all to gain.  Under the 1975 Act we have not got a single producing oil field.  The Act states that the Minister can take up to 50 per cent unless he is satisfied that the licensees will not get reasonable return.  Section 29 (2) of the 1975 Act needs to be addressed immediately and urgently.  The oil industry must be informed what would be &ldquo;a reasonable return&rdquo; in the Government's view.  After all, 50 per cent of nothing remains nothing.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the deadline for applications for the third round has been extended from 15 February to June?  Is it lack of interest?  This question needs an answer.  In other countries the exploration companies know exactly where they stand.  They have a formula in advance and they know what will be demanded of them by the country in question.  In 1984 some 116 exploration or appraisal wells were drilled in the UK section of the North Sea.  In the same year off our shores only six appraisal or exploration wells were drilled &mdash; 116 in the North Sea under English jurisdiction and six here under our jurisdiction.  I ask why?  Bankers have clients on their books waiting to invest in our economy once we become <Col N="1879" /> an oil producing nation within the EC and in the EMS.  No Government should or could allow themselves to remain in a position where future generations may point their finger at the missed opportunity of enormous potential.  The confidence factor and the psychological boost, as well as the upturn in our economy, cannot be over-estimated if we join the oil producing nations.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that has important political implications.  At the moment there is room for different treatment of individual companies and consortia as well as different treatment of different fields.  The Minister has this discretion under the Act.  In my view this is politically extremely dangerous and open to all sorts of interpretation.  As the economics of individual fields are confidential, the Minister would never be in a position to justify publicly any stand or decision he takes.  I cannot emphasise often enough or sufficiently the importance of immediate codification and clarification of the discretionary terms that exist now in relation to Government participation in oilfields.</P>
    <P>A matter more parochial but extremely important not alone to County Wexford but to the south-east region is the announcement of the ongoing commitment of this Government to Rosslare Harbour, and I applaud it.  This year an increase of 66 per cent is being invested in the improvement of the facilities of the terminal at Rosslare Harbour.  Last year the Government allocated £300,000 to these improvements and this year for the ongoing development works there an additional £500,000 is being allocated, along with another £132,000 for the lifeboat mooring pen, to the RNLI.  I welcome this £632,000 because it underlines the commitment of this Government to the very important natural and national asset which is Rosslare Harbour, the nearest non-tidal port to Europe.  Its throughput figures for classical and passenger traffic are a testament to the economic importance of this facility.  Despite the lack of attention of many Governments before this one, Rosslare Harbour figures continued to increase. <Col N="1880" /> Really we do not know the potential of this port.  When it is developed to the full and maximised, only then will we realise the asset that has always been there.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, promised to press ahead with proposed legislation in relation to the Rosslare Harbour Authority.  As this also requires British legislation and as the queue in relation to that is quite long, he is examining the possibility of an alternative for local involvement for running the port as an interim measure pending the enactment of British legislation.  I welcome this announcement, but I urge the Minister to involve the local people in the running of the port in consultation with them.  I feel that many hard working and interested bodies in County Wexford who are committed to the future of this port have in-depth knowledge and have studied at great length where we should be going.  I recommend that, as an interim measure, the Minister consult with them before any final decisions are made regarding local involvement in the running of our port as an interim measure.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is little room to manoeuvre in relation to the budget of this year.  The overall criteria must continue to ensure that we try to instil in our economy some natural momentum.  This, together with Government aid and the State support system for those who are unemployed, in initiating employment, increasing incentive to work and increasing reward for the risk taken will go a long way towards solving what remains and will be with us for some time as our great national problem, unemployment. Until we have an attitude that profit is no longer a dirty word, until we cease to have a begrudging mentality, it will always be difficult.  But I welcome the measures announced in the budget by the Minister and, with some of the provisos I have mentioned here today, I applaud what he is doing for our country for 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the budget for 1985.  On the Opposition benches and throughout the country people anticipated that the Government and particularly the Minister for Finance in that budget would take <Col N="1881" /> the opportunity to introduce measures to tackle the most serious problem confronting the economy and the people. The figure for unemployment is pushing hard towards 250,000 people, and it was not unreasonable to anticipate that the Minister would consider introducing measures to improve the environment for job creation.  One would have thought that this would have been given sufficient priority, but it was not to be.</P>
      <P>In terms of measures and mechanisms to tackle the unemployment problem this budget must be regarded as a dismal failure. Taxation, PRSI payments and VAT all remain at an excessively high level and are a disincentive to anybody who would wish to start an industry or open up opportunities for employment creation. Our very high production costs are also a disincentive.  Our electricity charges to industry are between 25 per cent and 40 per cent higher than those of any of our competitors in other member states of the EC.  Our transport costs are the highest in the EC.  The 10p per gallon increase on petrol, the increase on diesel, the high insurance levels and the cost of repair and maintenance to the motor industry in this budget do absolutely nothing to reduce the costs of our all so necessary transport system.  Most areas in the country are not so far away from the various ports and outlets but the transport costs of bringing goods to these points are the highest per mile anywhere in the EC.  In addition to that the condition of our roads means that repair and maintenance costs of vehicles are higher than they would be on a properly surfaced road infrastructure or network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems arise from very high insurance claims which in turn mean that insurance premiums for industry and for individuals are excessively high.  Our interest rates mean that money borrowed from our financial institutions is too expensive to encourage people to put it to work for the benefit of the country and of the people.  Regarding rates on industrial buildings, in my constituency of Louth I can identify many buildings that are lying vacant because potential entrepreneurs or people with enterprise <Col N="1882" /> or innovation who might think seriously of acquiring them and starting up different enterprises and industries are precluded or frightened off from doing so because of the level of rates payable on those buildings.  Unless we are prepared to tackle these areas we will not expand the industrial base to absorb the 250,000 unemployed.  The budget fails dismally in that respect.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities on current account are perhaps in the red to the extent of up to £2 million.  This leaves them paralysed in terms of undertaking any works.  Necessary work programmes and infrastructural development are stymied because of the lack of finance. Unless the Government are prepared to recognise the importance of local authorities instead of merely paying lip service to their role, the position of local authorities will deteriorate gradually but surely in the coming years.  In my local authority area the level of outdoor staff is at an all-time low.  Consequently, the volume of work undertaken by engineering staff must be restricted.</P>
    <P>I have always claimed that the opportunity for job creation in the local authority area is considerable but it is a question of the money being put up front so that the infrastructural development work can proceed, work that is so necessary for the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Looking at the end of the year returns one finds that last year £85 million was collected by way of the youth employment levy.  It may be opportune to ask at this time whether that money is being well spent.  Would it not be preferable that the various training programmmes being undertaken by the different agencies involved be channelled through our local authorities where there is the outlet and the possibility where the benefit of the programmes would be for the good of the community and where the work could be assisted and supervised by the trained technical staff who in many cases are working in an under-capacity situation in many local authority areas?  This is a matter the Government must give consideration to.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw fit to give some <Col N="1883" /> impetus to the land leasing legislation that was introduced before Christmas by way of providing for some tax relief. When that legislation was going through the House I expressed reservations about it.  I expressed the opinion that the arrangement, praiseworthy though it might be, had many obvious shortcomings. One of the basic problems is the matter of the fertility of the land being leased.  Whether the period of leasing is for seven or 12 years, one can recognise the attractiveness to the lessee of allowing the condition of the land to deteriorate towards the end of the leasing period. During the debate on that legislation I suggested that a system of annuity repayment be introduced to cover the cost of fertiliser and lime requirements during the period of the lease.  I am asking the Minister again to consider that proposal because it is one sure way of having a mechanism that will go a long way to ensuring the maintenance of the fertility levels of the land.  This would mean that the person leasing the land would be responsible for the repayments for the fertiliser and lime.  In that way there would be a net benefit not only to the agricultural industry but to the entire economy.  I think Members on all sides recognise the unacceptability of having large tracts of land under-utilised because of low fertility levels.  We must keep in mind always the desirability of expanding production generally in the primary producing areas in our economy.</P>
    <P>Many business people in the Border areas were hoping that the budget would bring some relief so far as they were concerned.  We are talking of businesses that have been ravished in the past number of years because of excessive levels of VAT.  While many changes that are overdue and desirable are being introduced, there remains the problem of petrol prices that are far too high, so that it is still an attractive proposition for people from constituencies close to the Border and even from areas much further removed from the Border to travel to towns in Northern Ireland to buy tankfuls of petrol and, of course, while they are <Col N="1884" /> there they buy their groceries and other requirements also.  Many businesses in my constituency have gone to the wall because of this situation.</P>
    <P>I have said here before that Dundalk, which is the biggest provincial town in the country, is effectively for sale.  I am far from convinced that the measures introduced in the budget will reverse the undesirable position that has obtained in that town for far too long.  Very valuable and useful employment was provided in Dundalk in the services and commercial industries, but now every other shop in the town is for sale but with very little by way of offers forthcoming for the premises.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that in the context of the Finance Bill he will reconsider his decision on the imposition of additional taxation on petrol.  The high cost of this commodity is reflected in transport costs generally and in the transportation of goods and materials.  The cost of running a car has become intolerable in recent years and this extra tax on petrol is a crippling blow to the motorist whether his journey to work is five, ten or more miles.</P>
    <P>In addition, the extra tax on petrol will affect the tourist industry.  People who have been looking for potential areas of development in the economy have identified tourism as an area of tremendous potential.  It is being said that this industry may be the biggest industry in the world by the end of the century.  Mobility involves travel costs and this will be a factor in tourists deciding whether to spend their holidays here, whether they are coming from the dollar, the sterling or any other area.  In these times, when people are so cost conscience, they will consider different locations in deciding where to spend their holidays and transport costs must feature highly in their decisions.</P>

      <P>In the few moments available to me I wish to refer briefly to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which in its operation and application is essentially a racist Act.  It is aimed primarily, indeed only, at the Irish people.  The Act is used unjustifiably and indiscriminately not only against the Irish community in Britain but against Irish people travelling to and from Britain.  We must appreciate that there are many Irish people living in that country who have contributed enormously to its welfare and life.  The normal rights of individuals are being suspended by this Act.  It allows for the detention of persons incommunicado for up to seven days.  People detained under the Act can be left without legal advice for up to 48 hours and in some cases for even longer.</P>
      <P>The Act is used on most occasions as an information gathering operation and not necessarily to question people suspected of having committed a crime, as a brief reference to statistics between November 1974 and September 1983 will prove.  During that time almost 6,000 people were arrested but only about 2½ per cent of those were charged and of those charged only about 9 per cent were found guilty.</P>

    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the exclusion order which applied, especially in the past, to Northern Ireland.  That was a system of deportation within the jurisdiction of the UK.  People suspected under the Prevention of Terrorism Act have no redress.  There is no financial compensation for such items as loss of earnings, travelling expenses and so on. We must spare a thought for the many lorry drivers who, while carrying perishable goods between Ireland and the UK, are detained without there being any compensation for those goods in the <Col N="1887" /> event of their deteriorating and not being usable as a result of the delay.  What is of vital importance is that those 6,000 people who were detained for questioning for the period I have mentioned will be suspect forever more.  Those 6,000 people are suspect and their character and reputation has been tarnished as a result of this Act.</P>
    <P>The landing card, which is part of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1976, is aimed at the Irish people.  It is an infringement of civil liberties.  It does not apply to the British travelling to or from this country.  This suggests that all the problems are coming from this side but all the problems are within what they like to call the UK jurisdiction and they should be able to contain it within the UK without harrassing Irish people day in and day out.  Indeed, Irish people travelling to the Continent from Britain are hauled in on the west side of the UK.  It is having a serious effect not alone on the individuals but on business generally here.  At one time when we had a flight from Dublin to Derry it was necessary to fill in a card such as this.  No Government should condone this system. I refused to sign the card at Derry Airport and there were no problems.  I would ask the masses to refuse to sign it but I would only do so if they had the support of the Government.</P>
    <P>From my experience and from the experiences related to me by persons travelling from my county through Northern Ireland and to the United Kingdom I know that people are experiencing tremendous difficulties.  They are finding themselves held in detention for up to seven days.  Their families are not alerted and neither is the Irish Embassy.  They are completely isolated.  If the Act cannot be repealed we suggest that the Irish Embassy must be informed immediately some Irish citizen, whether they be living here or the UK, is arrested.  The Act clearly discriminates against Irish citizens. It violates the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Act should be repealed, as recommended in the Fianna <Col N="1888" /> Fáil motion.  The Government should accept our motion and exert every pressure on the British Government to appeal this Act.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs last night referred to a sympathetic improvement in the communication of information to the Embassy.  We are not satisfied with that.  We want the Irish Embassy to be informed immediately any Irish citizen is hauled in under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Fianna Fáil speakers for the last two evenings and there has been substantial deviation from the terms of their motion. Deputy Collins referred to the alleged fudging by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, of the plastic bullets issue, in relation to the supergrass trials and so on.  This has nothing to do with the motion in their name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to understand, as the Minister pointed out last night, that the 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act is not a good Act and the 1984 legislation is better.  The previous one was written, in the main, by Roy Jenkins who was then <Col N="1889" /> seen to be a good, liberal person.  It seems that many are in the catch 22 situation and cannot speak out in relation to possible or alleged abuses of the legislation for fear of giving offence and because of the necessity for silence.  The 1974 legislation entitles the British Home Secretary or the Government to proscribe an organisation, to exclude individuals and to arrest individuals on the grounds of reason for belief of foul intent.  I came into this House in 1975, and I noted that 1,057 people had been arrested in that year.  The percentage rate charged was 5.9 per cent.  The numbers dropped in 1979 to 857, with 12.6 percentage rate of charge.  In 1983 the number was 191, with 16.2 percentage rate of charge.  While one might say that the changes in the law have led to an increased rate of charge and, therefore, greater detectability under the Act, and while they speak well from a factual point of view, there are indications that the Irish Embassy and our Government have had quite a lot of work to do over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>In all that time since 1975, I do not remember Fianna Fáil Governments of those years calling for the condemnation and repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I do not recall motions having been put down by their then Minister for Foreign Affairs calling for such measures.  It is rather coincidental that Fianna Fáil speakers should now put down motions calling for such condemnation and repeal.  They had their chance on more occasions than one and chose not to take it.  To stand on the Opposition benches and call for these measures is hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>As the Minister pointed out last night, the Provisional IRA are, in the main, responsible for keeping this legislation on the books.  They have a vested interest in keeping on the books what is a natural weapon of propaganda for themselves.  One must tread with caution in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first basic principle is that the rule <Col N="1890" /> of law must be preserved in any democratic country and it must win out in any civilised society.  That principle operates here, too, with the Offences against the State Act.  I do not hear the Fianna Fáil members calling for the condemnation and repeal of that Act, also.  Whatever legislation is on the books, it does not mean that the establishment of the day must not also be bound by the rule of law.  The people charged with the responsibility of keeping that law must be extremely careful in protecting it.  Some years ago, in Dublin, 22 people were killed.  That must never be allowed to happen again.  The same situation arose in Britain where we had the Hyde Park, Harrods and Brighton bombings.  These must not be allowed to happen.  This Government agree that it is necessary to have legislation in civilised societies for the protection of their own people.  However, its implementation must be carried out with extreme caution and care.  There must be a controlling agent.  That it is possible for madmen masquerading as Irish patriots to break into the hotel headquarters in Brighton of the ruling party of a nation of 56 million people, the equivalent of our own Ard Fheis, and kill and maim indiscriminately warns us. That people who were misguided in their own interests could get into this Chamber some years ago also warns us.  The responsibility vested in the Government must be treated with due care.  The right Honourable Member for Finchley, Margaret Thatcher, must behave.  If the gross excesses of subversives, with their foul and dastardly deeds, might tempt her to exceed her duties, that would always be wrong and would have to be condemned.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the central corps of justice, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Justice, the Taoiseach of the day, protectors of our civil rights and liberties have to deal in secret and silent ways with these matters.  It has been pointed out that when persons are arrested, knowledge of these facts cannot be given too freely to the public because of the cloud of suspicion which hangs over families, friends and relations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher is misguided in his <Col N="1891" /> interpretation of this Act.  It is not discriminatory against Irish people, because it also applies to international terrorism, having been updated to take account of this.  Introduced originally in 1974 as a result of the Birmingham bombings, it could have been said to have been implemented for that specific reason, but the Act as it now stands takes into account all international terrorism.  Because of having to deal in silence and behind the scenes, the public perception often grows, on arrest, that it is discriminatory towards certain people or a certain nationality.  Because of the cloud of suspicion that can hang over families, the Embassy and the Department must proceed with great care.  There have been cases where people arrested and detained might not have families or friends to look after them and avoidable situations have to be treated with great care by the staff of the Embassy.  The Minister pointed out the valuable work done by the staff of the embassy in London.  He gave a case of one person having to deal with a 14 hour case very close to the end of the year.  It is fair to say that there is a clear degree of concern and understanding on the part of the Government and the Embassy in relation to these cases.  The Minister has made it perfectly clear that this Government will not stand for abuse in so far as our people are concerned in the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I happen to be vice-president of the Irish Club in Eaton Square and have contact with many thousands of Irish people. As was pointed out recently by our Ambassador in London, there are 750,000 Irish people living in Britain, many have built the cities and highways of that country, having served in her army with distinction and gained honours in that field.  They have gained achievements in politics, business and practically every facet of life in Britain.  These people have had a part to play and are still playing that part.  They are proceeding in their normal life without undue hindrance to their daily work.  That is something about which we can be justly proud. However, the small minority who are <Col N="1892" /> terribly misguided in their efforts have branded us all as bad eggs.  It is necessary to have such legislation on the books, but to prevent abuses in its implementation it is necessary to point out these facts.</P>
    <P>The concern of the Minister has been voiced that there is still a disproportion between the numbers detained and the numbers charged.  Those who have been detained and not charged afterwards can live under a cloud of suspicion if facts are made public.  When they cannot be made public, the perception grows that the Act in its implementation is discriminatory. The shadow of the Act may hang over many Irish people in Britain and it is probably fair to say that every time a bombing occurs, carried out by the Provisional IRA, that leads to suspicion of ordinary Irish people in their everyday work in Britain.  I am sure that the Minister and his British counterpart have discussed this matter in detail and that a degree of understanding has been shown by the British but there is still some way to go down that road.  The trend of Government is to continue in that manner.</P>
    <P>I have not up to date figures of the numbers of people arrested, detained and charged who come from other terrorist organisations but to contend that it is discriminatory against Irish people only is not a true statement.  The Act will be updated by way of the 1984 legislation which has not yet come into effect and will introduce various changes.  The Taoiseach and Minister have already told the British Prime Minister and the Minister's counterpart of the necessity for the implementation of the provisions of the legislation with understanding and concern. We on this side of the House certainly do not want to see the ordinary rights and liberties of our citizens discriminated against in any way through misunderstanding on the far side of the water. I am quite confident in the Minister's ability to continue in that vein, to ensure that the legislation is amended further in the context in which he is at present speaking to the British authorities.</P>

      <P>It is quite appropriate that this House should be discussing the Prevention of Terrorism Act here this evening since it was recently the subject of discussion in the British House of Commons.  That Act, described as draconian by some of its critics in the Commons means that this House, likewise, must record its disapproval of many of its provisions in so far as they impinge on Irish citizens and their rights.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is not for us in this House to question the competence of the British authorities in devising legislation for their territory even if such offends against due process and other articles of legal right held sacred in this country.  It is right for us to be vigilant, to ensure that no inequity arises in relation to Irish citizens as a result of any measure of the British Parliament.  There is no doubt but that the Prevention of Terrorism Act poses a great reversal of the concept of due process and the rule of law.  There is the power to ban organisations on secret evidence without a hearing or right of appeal.  There is the vague offence of supporting such banned groups.  It is ironic that when the United Kingdom Government criticise the USSR for the internal exile of Anton Sakharov and other dissidents that the British Government themselves possess the very same identical power of exile within their territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter that concerns us here for the most part is the power of arrest and detention under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  That represents the largest infringement of civil liberties as far as I am concerned.  Judging by the contributions of many in this debate, that would appear to be the feeling of many Deputies who contributed.  According to the Jellicoe Report, which examined the operations of the Act in February 1983, of those arrested, a very small proportion, 5 per cent only, were ever convicted of offences.  In general this Act is designed to fish for information, to detain for long periods those whom the police are anxious to interrogate.  Nobody in this debate would wish to question the right of a democratic administration to react <Col N="1894" /> to measures of terrorism, none of us would do that.  But we must be on our guard that any measure decided on in the British Parliament &mdash; in relation to our nationals at any rate &mdash; should not treat them in an inequitable fashion or discriminate against them particularly.  We must not forget that the provisions of the Act permit great power to the Home Secretary, particularly the provision that concerns us most, the holding of a person without recourse to legal advice for up to 48 hours.  I came into the Chamber as Deputy Kenny was making the point that, admittedly under the new Police Criminal Evidence Act, after 48 hours, there will be this right to legal advice. There has been no statutory incorporation of the right of legal access in Britain. It is a constitutional right within our jurisdiction but that is not the case in Britain. But it will follow, under the Police Criminal Evidence Act, once it comes into operation, that there will be this right of access after 48 hours.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised in this debate whether our embassy in London should be notified of the arrest of Irish citizens under the Act.  We must continue our pressure to ensure that the embassy is notified automatically in any case of the arrest of any of our nationals under this Act.  It would be helpful also to understand that at least under two administrations representations have been made to the British authorities.  There was the Shackleton examination of the working of this Act in 1978 when representations were made by the then Government to the Shackleton Commission on the Irish Government's reservations about the operations of the Act as of then.  Recently we made similar representations to the Jellicoe Committee who again reviewed the working of the Act.  I would suggest that the Minister should consider the releasing of the material presented by the Irish Government, the kinds of criticisms we offered in 1978, and most recently in relation to the review by Earl Jellicoe, that we should release those two sets of representations and ensure that people are made <Col N="1895" /> aware that the Irish Government, whatever their political complexion, are maintaining a viligant eye on the operation of this Act.</P>
    <P>There was a recent debate in the House of Commons when a member for the Liverpool constituency &mdash; I think speaking in a Commons debate &mdash; said that innocent people had had their fingerprints and photographs taken and kept on file, that people detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act has lost the opportunity of promotion at work.  I should like to see these statements of that member for Liverpool &mdash; where there is a large Irish community &mdash; investigated further.  I know it is the position that our embassy in London have officials working more or less full time on examination of the operation of this Act.  But the Irish Government at this point should draw up their own case file on its operation, ascertaining whether there is any substance in these very serious charges brought in the British House of Commons by a member for Liverpool, that people are discriminated against by way of promotion in their jobs.  The very fact of them having been called in to be questioned under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, in itself, represents a blow to these Irish people who have been living in Britain for many years in local communities and, he maintains, in some instances, led to questions about their ability to obtain promotion in their positions.  That is a matter to which the full time attention of our embassy in London should be devoted.</P>
    <P>If one can talk about improvement of a measure which makes such heavy incursions into the liberties of the citizen, one might contend that there has been some improvement in its operation over the years.  For example, in 1978 there were 622 detentions and 19 people charged; in 1984 150 people were detained and 23 charged.  If one is to talk about some improvement of an Act which has such far-reaching powers, which abridges so radically the liberties of the ordinary citizen, over the years &mdash; perhaps as a result of representations by various Irish <Col N="1896" /> Governments, various review bodies and the concern of the British House of Commons on the matter &mdash; then the fact is that there has been at least this reduction in the ratio between the numbers detained and those charged, that at least that has improved and is not quite as bad as it was in 1978.  This House must continue to keep a very close eye indeed on its operation.  None of us on any side of this House would support the winning by force or by violence of political results, which is the essence of what terrorism is about.  None of us on any side of the House supports the obtaining of political ends by these violent means.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that in defending democratic freedoms the State does not go overboard in abridging the rights of ordinary citizens.  There is some evidence that the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain has had an anti-Irish bias in its operation to date.  Our Embassy in London must be very vigilant.  Perhaps it is not necessary to appoint a full time lawyer attached to the Embassy to watch the operation of the Act, but it requires the attention, if it has not got it already, of a full time official in the Embassy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be advisable for us to release the representations made by the Government in 1978 to the Shackleton committee and to release our recent representations to the Jellicoe committee about the working of this Act.  That would reassure the public that the Irish Government remain concerned and vigilant about this very important matter.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I support the motion in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Prevention of Terrorism Act in its provisions and in its implementation as clearly discriminatory against Irish citizens and being in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and calls on the Government as a <Col N="1897" /> matter of urgency to seek the repeal of this legislation and to insist, in accordance with normal diplomatic practice elsewhere, that the Irish Embassy in London be immediately notified of any arrests of Irish citizens made under this Act.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised at the approach of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  His amendment:</P>
    <P>, ... expresses deep concern at the possibilities of abuse inherent in some of the provisions of the British Prevention of Terrorism Act, and of their application in a discriminatory manner to Irish citizens, deplores in particular the regular practice of denying legal access to detainees and information to relatives for a period of 48 hours or longer,...</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the period is seven days and the first 48 hours are only the initial period.  Towards the end of his own speech he raised that point.  The attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government in meekly accepting the continuation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act is an abrogation of their duty to protect Irish citizens both while travelling and living abroad.  Deputies on both sides of the House have made this point very clearly and have given very good examples in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister failed to grasp the real significance and impact of this price of legislation which violates the internationally respected civil rights of Irish citizens. The Prevention of Terrorism Act is almost exclusively directed against the Irish communities in the Republic, the North of Ireland and Great Britain.  The Republic is repeatedly mentioned in the revised Act of 1984 and is the only other country to which the Act specifically applies.  I heard Deputy Kenny say there was some amelioration in the 1984 Act. I will refer to that later and show that the amelioration is very minor.</P>
    <P>The Republic is mentioned repeatedly in the revised Act.  The Act repeatedly excludes acts of terrorism not related to <Col N="1898" /> the British Government's policies concerning the North of Ireland.  The power to stop, search and detain suspects in relation to exclusion orders only applies to acts &ldquo;designed to influence public opinion or Government policy with respect to affairs in Northern Ireland.&rdquo; In defence of the Government's stance which effectively supports the Prevention of Terrorism Act, while expressing deep concern, the Minister referred to our own legislation which is designed to counter the use of violence for political ends.  The essential difference which he has failed to grasp and to outline to Members of the House is that our legislation applies to any person whose actions are calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State.  I quote that from the Act.  It is not selectively applied against any communities and it is accompanied by safeguards for persons in custody such as the safeguard of having recourse to a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Terrorism Act has been the subject of widespread condemnation in Britain by both politicians and the public.  So concerned was the British Parliament with this selective and repressive legislation that it directed that the Prevention of Terrorism Act may only continue in force for a maximum of four more years.  The Act is dated 22 March 1984.  The total period is five years.  Since one year has elapsed, we can take it that it can remain in force for four more years only.  Its principal provisions will expire on 22 March 1985 unless there is a difference in the implementation date of some of the provisions.  The Secretary of State may then renew any or all of these offensive provisions, or may allow them to lapse.  There is that option.  That is set out in the Act in relation to the powers of the Secretary of State.  He has the power of renewal which he can exercise. Under section 13 the Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument provide for the examination of persons, and so on.  He has power to renew it if he considers that necessary.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should make it quite clear to his counterpart in Britain that he <Col N="1899" /> should not renew these offensive provisions and that he should allow them to lapse.  The Minister made no reference to this option in his speech last night.  He obviously does not want the Oireachtas to be aware of this.  He cannot, therefore, have any intention of pressing the British Government to dispense with even the most degrading and discriminatory provisions of the Act.  What confidence can the Irish public and the Irish communities in Britain and the North of Ireland have in a Minister who so obviously fails to represent their interest and their basic human right to just and fair treatment?</P>
    <P>Anything less than a blanket condemnation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act as currently in force ignores the very serious deficiencies of this draconian measure.  The Prevention of Terrorism Act must not continue in its present form. It could be superseded by an Act which would apply more equally.  The following are some of the steps which should be taken:&mdash; (1) The Act must be expanded to cover all forms of terrorism and the aspects that discriminate against the Irish communities must be removed.  (2) The right of immediate access to a solicitor must be guaranteed now.  (3) <i>Habeus Corpus</i> must be restored in Prevention of Terrorism Act cases.  (4) Evidence not conforming to normal rules of evidence must be excluded.  (5) Adequate safeguards against harassment must be established.  (6) The Embassy must be informed without delay of all arrests of Irish citizens under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  (7) The aspects of this Act which require citizens to inform on neighbours and relatives must be removed to prevent extraordinary invasions of privacy, for instance the fishing expeditions.</P>
    <P>We know there have been changes but very often they are peripheral to the main powers given in the Act.  For instance, you can now only be arrested on warrant under the information section whereas previously you could be arrested without warrant.  That is a invasion into the privacy of the Irish citizens.  We have heard from Deputies on both sides of the House how that Act has operated to frighten <Col N="1900" /> innocent people and to put them at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Until all these provisions are in force nothing less than a blanket condemnation will suffice.  The watered down amendment the Minister has proposed ignores the most odious aspects of the Act.  The Act is so clearly and widely deficient in its safeguards of human rights that it must be condemned and should be repealed. The expiration of the major provisions of this Act next month gives the Minister an opportunity to make major advances in regard to improving the Act.  The Minister should be discussing this matter urgently with the British Government. Should he fail to achieve real improvements he should then bring the matter to a higher court.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Terrorism Act and its discriminatory enforcement should be brought before the Commission on Human Rights for either a friendly settlement or a full court hearing.  Many aspects of the Prevention of Terrorism Act appear to contravene EC rules and regulations.  The Government must not rest until this Act is repealed.  If this Government will not speak in defence of Irish interests, then who will?</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the Minister's approach to this Act.  He seemed to be so pleased that some concessions had been awarded that he was very meekly accepting them and advising us to recognise the benefits we gained through the crumbs thrown to us.  This Act is clearly discriminatory. No free country in the world would not recognise that this Act discriminates specifically against Irish people. Part II section 3 (6) says that the acts of terrorism to which this part of the Act applies are acts of terrorism designed to influence public opinion or Government policy with respect to affairs in Northern Ireland.  This provision still remains in the Act.  Let us not cod ourselves into thinking that other people have been brought into this Act thus making it more equal.  There is no equality in this legislation. There has been a minor amendment in that regard but it remains to be seen if and when it will be implemented.  I do not have time to go through each section <Col N="1901" /> and point out where it discriminates against the Irish people but if anybody wants me to point out the sections, I will be willing to do so later.  I am surprised the Minister did not examine these sections because they stand out like lights in the middle of a bog.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with arrest, detention and port powers.  Section 12 (3) says that the acts of terrorism to which this Part of this Act applies are acts of terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland and acts of terrorism of any other description except acts connected solely with the affairs of the United Kingdom or any part of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland.  If we look through this legislation we will see many references to Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the North of Ireland and there is no doubt about the intentions behind this Act.  The territories affected under this Act are once again the North of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and they mention us yet another time.  There is no doubt that even as it stands this Act relates particularly to the Irish communities.</P>
    <P>Part II, section 7 (9) says:</P>
    <P>In subsection (8) above &ldquo;an appropriate country or territory&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland....</P>
    <P>(b) Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland....</P>
    <P>(c) the Republic of Ireland....</P>
    <P>There is no mention of terrorists from any other country.  Any change made in that respect has been very minor.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's expression of deep concern at the possibilities of abuse.  We want him to ask for a major repeal of this Act.  Those who are sensible and honourable on the other side of the ocean are also looking for this legislation to be repealed and that is the least the Minister should look for.  I totally reject his suggestion that we are asking for too much at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Woods, that this Act is <Col N="1902" /> used against the Irish people.  It is a racist Act against the Irish people which is causing serious problems for the Irish in Britain, the people who did a lot to build the British economy and infrastructure over the years.  These people now find themselves the victims of this very repressive legislation.  We all deplore violence used to further any aims, and this has been condemned in this House time and again, but the fact that there has been violence in Britain is no justification for this legislation where persons can be lifted and inprisoned for up to seven days, and for 48 hours without having access to legal advice or to anybody else.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation 6,000 people have been arrested but only 150, 2½ per cent, were charged.  That is an indication of the misue of this legislation because if appears people are being lifted not because they are suspected of being involved in violence or subversive activity, but because the police may gather information from them.  Many people have been taken for questioning about their neighbours and people in their own towns. There was a case reported in the media today of somebody going from Sligo to Castleblayney who was taken by the UDR.  They described horrific scenes of the way they were treated and questioned about the people in their neighbourhood. This is something we are totally opposed to.</P>

    <P>The police are entitled to do their work but this type of legislation is used solely against one particular community.  Last night the Minister told us that while there were not exact figures of the numbers or the citizenship of the various people this Act was used against, the Irish Embassy was satisfied that in the main it was used against people.  It appears that this legislation is being used mainly to try to collect information because I have no doubt that many of the people taken in are innocent of any charge.  The Government here are not discharging their responsibilities and have taken a softly softly line.  If we see injustice anywhere we should not be afraid to stand up in this House and condemn it.  We are satisfied that injustice is <Col N="1903" /> being done to Irish citizens under this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the last Dáil session the Government did not condemn supergrass trials. Fianna Fáil put down a moderate motion condemning the supergrass trials structure which is totally against the concept of justice or the legal system anywhere else in the civilised world.  The Government did not see fit to support that condemnation. They put down an amendment which they carried through the House although many of their backbenchers had spoken in favour of our motion to condemn the system.  The Government's amendment was merely to note the system.  Since then, the Raymond Gilmour trial collapsed in Belfast and the comments made by Mr. Justice Lowry at the conclusion of the case should have made the Government and those who supported the amendment ashamed of themselves for not condemning the system out of hand.  The same applied to plastic bullets and the Government have an amendment to this motion also which will not condemn the Prevention of Terrorism Act even though it discriminates against our citizens in the UK for whom we have responsibility.</P>
    <P>The exclusion orders made under the Act contain an element of hypocrisy because, in many cases, they exclude people from Britain and return them to another part of the United Kingdom, the Six Counties.  It is extraordinary that you can implement an exclusion order from one part of a country to another.  I am not happy that the Six Counties is part of the United Kingdom but the Prime Minister referred to the Six Counties as being as much a part of Britain as Finchley. I am sure that the British Government would not consider sending somebody to Finchley, telling them that they could remain there but that they could not go to any other part of Britain. That is the ludicrous situation that exists as a result of this Act.</P>
    <P>Another serious aspect is that people who are detained for seven days are not entitled to compensation or have no redress if they are incorrectly held.  A <Col N="1904" /> lorry driver with a perishable load could be arrested at a port on arrival and held for seven days.  His load of perishable goods would probably have to be destroyed and he gets nothing by way of compensation.  The Minister told us last night about the various topics which had been raised by the Government with the British Government arising out of the operation of this Act.  He went on to say that there had been significant changes. He enumerated some which are now rarely the subject of complaint, the detention of children, the difficulties encountered by people with Irish names or lengthy delays while identification of individuals is established.  I do not see those as significant changes except perhaps the non-detention of children.  The others are not significant changes in the context of the effects of being held for seven days, particularly when one considers that many of these people were going about their normal, legitimate business. I gave the example of the lorry driver with the perishable load.</P>
    <P>The other serious implication is the number of young people detained under this Act.  If only 2½ per cent of the total number held since 1974 have been charged, one could conclude that many of these people were incorrectly held in custody.  This is not in the interests of young people and will certainly not instil in them the respect which they should have for a legal system.  The British perception of justice is that their judicial system compares favourably with anything in the civilised world.  That is not the experience of Irish people living over there or of people here who are interested in justice.  While we all condemn violence, nevertheless justice should be administered in a humane way.  I will give one or two examples in which no humanity was shown.  The Gillespie sisters from Donegal were within six weeks of being released from jail in Birmingham. Their father died during that six weeks and they were not allowed out for his funeral.  I do not condone their crimes but I believe that if any other nationality had been involved, the British authorities would have allowed them to <Col N="1905" /> attend the funeral.  Shane Doherty has done nine years of a 14 years sentence. He has been transferred from one prison to another and totally reformed and rehabilitated.  Numerous representations have been made by very responsible people opposed to violence, including Cardinal Ó Fiaich, to have him transferred to the North where his aged mother could visit him.  There is also the case of Giuseppi Conlon who was arrested and charged when he went to England to visit his son.  He was imprisoned on evidence which many people said was very dubious.  He died in prison as a result of tuberculosis.  These are examples where humane treatment was not given to Irish prisoners and I believe if they had been from any other country they would have received better treatment.</P>
    <P>We have the extraordinary situation where persons cleared by the RUC in the North can travel to Britain and are arrested by Scotland Yard under this Act.  I should like to ask the Minister of State if citizens of other countries have to fill in this pink landing card when they arrive in Britain.  We have an agreement regarding common movement between the two countries and one is allowed to move freely without carrying a passport.  In spite of this it says at the end of this card you may be required to furnish proof of identity.  Either you have to have proof of identity or you do not.  I do not see why Irish people should be subjected to having to produce proof of identity when there is agreement about common movement between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I have a letter here which was sent to a Deputy.  It is from an Irish couple living in England and expresses the anxiety felt by them in relation to this Act.  The last three lines of the letter read:</P>
    <P>I would also ask that in the event of anything happening to Tommy and myself that you would help to get Carla, our 3½ year old daughter, back to Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of fear Irish people are living in as a result of this legislation.  I appeal to the Government, instead of <Col N="1906" /> telling us that they have resolved the difficulties of people with Irish names having to endure lengthy delays in establishing their identities, to do something positive to ensure that Irish citizens will not be harassed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The central focus of this motion is a call on the Government to seek the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  It seems as if Fianna Fáil are guilty of gross political opportunism in making this demand. There is an old saying &ldquo;by their fruits you shall know them&rdquo;.  This Act has been in force since 1974.  When Fianna Fáil were in office at a time when four times the number of Irish people were being detained under this Act as are being detained at present they made no such call.  Now freed from the duties and responsibilities of office they consider it politically opportune to call for a repeal of this Act.  One can fairly ask why a party, which now feels free to make this call from the Opposition benches, notably failed to do so while in office.</P>
      <P>The central objective of my Government in this connection is to ensure that the rights of Irish citizens are fully protected whether in the UK or elsewhere. Specifically in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Act we, as did the Opposition when in office, have sought, in many cases successfully, to bring about amendments to the Act.  Additionally we have sought, as also did the Opposition when in office, to ensure that the Act was implemented in a manner which would not discriminate against Irish citizens or be used to harass them.  The success of our efforts is borne out by the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage Government policy is to continue our efforts as heretofore and specifically to ensure that the Embassy in London is informed automatically of the detention of any Irish citizen so that we may inform the relatives immediately. We are seeking access to legal representation on request.  We also insist that those detained should be well treated and in particular should have access to medical facilities if required.  These are but a <Col N="1907" /> few of our demands in relation to the amendment of the Act.  Additionally we have immediately investigated every complaint brought to our attention relating to insensitive or discriminate application of the Act and have sought explanations from the UK Government. We have raised these matters with the British from time to time and they have investigated complaints where we have been able to furnish specific information.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately terrorism is a fact of modern political life.  It is something which democracies in particular need to protect themselves against.  We know this, and we have adopted legislation to defend ourselves against those who would work to destroy the institutions of our State by violent means.  I am speaking of the Provisional IRA and other subversive organisations.  Is the suggestion of the Opposition now that we should not have such legislation or that other Governments are not similarly entitled to defend themselves from terrorist violence?</P>

      <P>I will deal with the Deputy's contribution shortly.  No Irish Government have condemned the Act outright or sought its total repeal.  All Irish Governments have sought amendments to the Act and improvements in its implementation.  Having said that, it does not mean that I or the Government like the Act or approve of all its details.  Like previous Governments we have sought to have changes made to specific provisions of the Act and to the way in which it is implemented.  Appeasement of the British Government is no part of my or the Government's approach.  Neither is appeasement of terrorists part of our approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act was originally enacted because of terrorism, and the continuation of terrorism has kept it in force.  It is relevant to recall who has suffered from this terrorism.  While the victims have <Col N="1908" /> in many instances been selected on an indiscriminate basis it is clear that in some cases directly and in many other cases indirectly, the Irish community in the UK have suffered from in particular Provo terrorism in that country.  Three quarters of a million of our citizens are in the UK and there are many more of Irish descent. Our concern must be, above all, to look after their interests.</P>
    <P>I listened to the contribution made by Deputy Woods and, as with other speakers from the opposition, he began by referring to the terms of the motion and by repeating the request for a repeal of this legislation.  Then the inconsistency of his approach, which is the inconsistency underlining the whole approach in this motion and of the Fianna Fáil contributions, came to the surface.  He said &ldquo;This Act must not continue in its present form&rdquo;.  That would seem to mean that Deputy Woods would like to see amendments made to the Act.  If an Act is repealed it is taken off the Statute Book, but if one says it must not continue in its present form one suggests amendments to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods suggested the type of changes he would like to see made to the Act.  There is a large measure of common ground between the Opposition and the Government.  While I did not have an opportunity, not knowing shorthand, to note down each of the specific points made, it seemed to me when he referred to the need for access to lawyers and the need to inform the embassy that these are the very amendments we are seeking.  On that basis it seems that while the motion is termed in a certain way the Opposition are in a <Col N="1909" /> large measure of agreement with the approach that was adopted by them when in office.  I will not get into the area of dispute but we think we are making greater efforts to seek amendments to the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard from the Minister of State, as we heard from the Minister last night, contributions that, in the Irish Parliament, amount to a disgraceful defence of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  That Act requires from an Irish Parliament and an Irish Government a positive initiative and response such as is envisaged in our motion.  In that motion we condemn the Act both in regard to its provisions and its implementation.  That is the approach that is required here.  It should be condemned in regard to its discriminatory nature and also because it is in violation of European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
      <P>This Act is absolutely indefensible by reference to any national or international cannon of law and to the Convention on Human Rights, because of its discriminatory nature.  If the British Government in their wisdom want general anti-terrorist legislation that is their business but this legislation deals specifically with Irish citizens.  It is discriminatory so far as they are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from being discriminatory it is also arbitrary in regard to the detention provision.  This enables the detention of any Irish citizen without any legal reason being given.  It is also arbitrary because an Irish citizen may be detained for seven days on the basis of mere suspicion without any legal proof or reason being advanced.  That person may be detained in circumstances that do not place any <Col N="1911" /> obligation on the authorities to communicate with relatives or his legal advisers.</P>
    <P>These arbitrary and discriminatory procedures are possible under this Act. It should be roundly condemned both in regard to its provisions and its implementation because primarily it breaches two fundamental legal principles of nondiscrimination and of a non-arbitrary approach to arrest, detention and explosion. The arbitrary nature of the powers given in this instance to the security forces in Britain runs counter to all legal principles as do the discriminatory aspects to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is every reason for Dáil Éireann to roundly condemn a measure that has meant that in the past ten years 5,683 Irish citizens have been arrested.  Showing the totally haphazard nature of the arrests, of that figure only 2.5 per cent were charged and a mere handful found guilty.  Not alone does the Act operate in a discriminatory and an arbitrary way, but it is being used deliberately by the British security forces as a harassment and a constant irritant so far as more than 97 per cent of the people arrested are concerned.  People have been harassed, detained and irritated and they have been deprived of fundamental human and civil rights, primarily because they are Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>It is no excuse for the Minister or for the Minister for State to say the IRA are solely responsible for the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I hold no brief whatever for the Provisional IRA but if the argument of the Minister and of the Minister of State is carried to its logical conclusion, the British would have the right to bring in any legislation they wished and we could still not condemn it on the grounds that it was necessary because of the presence of the Provisional IRA.  That does not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the British Government to introduce legislation willy-nilly and to implement it in the way I have outlined.  By not acceding to our motion, the Minister and the Government are making themselves a party to giving the British Government <i>carte blanche</i> to act in whatever way they like <Col N="1912" /> against our citizens while the troubles in Northern Ireland continue.  In other words, the troubles in Northern Ireland are being used as an excuse by the British Government to act in a continuing discriminatory and arbitrary manner against Irish citizens who are totally innocent of any involvement in violence or anything approaching a crime of violence.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night also tried to suggest that there is some parallel in Irish legislation.  There was, and it lasted one year.  In 1976 the then Coalition introduced the Emergency Power's Act with similar type provisions in it, and the revulsion in public opinion here against it was a major factor in putting that Coalition Government out in 1977, the following year, when we promptly repealed it. Our argument was that the Act was completely unnecessary, superfluous and redundant to the real job at hand. Rightly, we refused to accept that seven or nine days were required, as they were required under that Act, for interrogation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also alleges that successive Governments here have accepted that the Prevention of Terrorism Act and anti-terrorist legislation generally were a matter for the British Government and Parliament to decide.  We all know that that is a truism that within their own jurisdiction the British Government and Parliament have a right to do as they see fit.  But that does not in any way impinge on our right to make our views known where the protection of Irish citizens is involved, nor does it impinge in any way on the rights of an Irish Parliament or Government to condemn measures directed exclusively against Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>There is a new and rather frightening Orwellian dimension to all of this.  Now not alone can innocent Irish citizens, totally unassociated with violence or crime of any kind, be detained and interrogated, but they are being put permanently into a police computer where they will remain on permanent police record for the rest of their lives, to be disgorged by the computer whenever <Col N="1914" /> the particular security officer so wills.  No matter what their occupation or business in Britain, innocent Irish people are now on record, computerised and tabulated for future examination and investigation.</P>

      <P>He stated that the British authorities have agreed to a systematic improvement in the communication of information to the Irish Embassy.  In the very next sentence the Minister made it clear that the British, contrary to general international practice in cases of this kind, have not agreed, despite all the alleged representations and all the chitchat between the Minister and his counterpart, to inform the Irish Embassy automatically and without exception when an Irish citizen is detained under the Act.  The Minister has failed to obtain this vital minimum improvement.  We want the Act repealed absolutely in regard to its arbitrary and discriminatory aspects.  We, on the Minister's own terms, see that he has failed, even within the context of the existing legislation, to get this minimum improvement of the reporting to the Irish Embassy of Irish citizens being detained or expelled under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Failure to follow up this matter in a resolute fashion on the part of this Government results in the constant stream of endless complaints in regard to individual incidents, the constant irritation of Anglo-Irish friction &mdash; which nobody wants &mdash; because of these incidents and all of this individual hardship, growing tension and discordance between the two sovereign states.  All this is caused by refusal to tackle the source of the incidents and the refusal by our Government to ensure in consultation with the British Government that the matter is approached in this radical way. The whole system of law and law enforcement <Col N="1915" /> epitomised by the supergrass trials, the operation of the UVF and the operation of this Act amounts to corruption of the law, which is only making the restoration of peace and reconciliation within this island and between the two islands infinitely more difficult to achieve.  This corruption of the law, leading to the virtual abandonment of the rule of law in regard to legislation, law enforcement agencies and now the courts in Northern Ireland, is a very serious situation and makes it very difficult to restore civilised practices and a civilised rule of law in this island and between the two islands.  This is why we are calling on Dáil Éireann to condemn this Act and not to pussyfoot around introducing meaningless amendments such as the Government have suggested here tonight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They call for Government to stand up and be counted.  The <Col N="1916" /> Government should not run away from these matters because they are concerned with basic and special principles that guide civilised living in this island and between the two islands.  This Government are reneging on their duty in not protesting vehemently, in not making it quite clear that we are opposed to certain aspects of any anti-terrorist legislation. We are opposed to them being directed at Irish citizens in an arbitrary, selective manner.  We are opposed totally to any approach of that kind.  We say that such legislation is anathema to Ireland should be anathema to Britain, and is certainly no way for two civilised states to carry out the business of their citizens' welfare as between the two states concerned.  In the interest of the protection of our citizens we have a bounden duty to take a strong line in this respect, and this motion of ours emphasises a strong line condemning the Act in its provisions and its implementation and calls for the removal of the essential elements I have just mentioned of discrimination and arbitrariness that are inherent in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 397 and 398 together.</P>
      <P>We are not aware of any difficulties with the telephone of the Irish Embassy in Cairo on 22 January 1985.  The Embassy was open and operating.  On being contacted that day by the family involved my Department, having failed to get a telephone connection to Cairo immediately, sent an immediate telex message instead.  The family was told at that time that this was being done.  The Embassy was asked, in accordance with the family's instructions, that the son visiting Cairo be contacted and asked to telephone home for an urgent message. The Embassy was of course informed that the message related to the father's death.</P>
      <P>The son was not a resident of Cairo but only there on a short visit.  The family could give no address for him.  However, the Embasy succeeded on the same day, 22 January, in making contact with some-body working at the location to be visited by the son.  This contact had already received a similar message from another source.  He told the Embassy on the following morning, 23 January, that the son had been given the message and was already on his way to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Since the message was for the son to contact home himself, and since in any case we were aware within 24 hours of being contacted by the family that he was already on his way home, the Embassy did not consider any further action necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry Trade, Commerce and Tourism if, in view of the agreed price reductions of petroleum by OPEC, he will consult the appropriate oil companies in this country so as to ensure that these reduction will be reflected in reductions to oil/petroleum product consumers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent price reductions announced by OPEC related to official selling prices for certain grades of crude oil exported by those counties.  As Irish prices are currently in the main based on the much lower international market or `spot' prices for product the minor adjustments now being made in OPEC official selling prices can have no immediate impact on petroleum product prices here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that, apart from the crude oil refined at Whitegate, oil supplies to the Irish market are imported in product form, for example as petrol gas oil, etc.  Up to mid 1984 a substantial part of the imported product was costed on the basis of official selling prices but by that time the National Prices Commission <Col N="1798" /> had concluded that this basis was no longer a reliable indicator of the price at which oil products were being actually traded internationally.  Following my acceptance of the commission's recommendation which is outlined in detail in their report for March 1984, a new price control system was introduced on 20 June 1984.  Since then maximum prices for petroleum products insofar as they reflect the cost of imported product, have been based on the international market or `spot' prices and adjusted monthly on the basis of movements in the `spot' prices. Details of the monthly adjustments are described in the commission's monthly reports which are available in the Dáil Library.  Would add that since the new arrangements were introduced the `spot' market product prices in US dollar terms, on which the Irish maximum prices are partly based, have been consistently lower than official selling prices by percentages ranging, it is estimated from 8 per cent in July 1984 to 15 per cent in January 1985, or 13 per cent if the current reduction in the OPEC official selling price of Arab light crude oil is taken into account.</P>
    <P>In effect the OPEC peice adjustments can be seen as a response to the substantial dollar price reduction that have occurred in recent months in international `spot' market prices.  These reductions have of course already been reflected in Irish maximum prices.  As the OPEC adjustments will have the effect of reducing the current differential between spot product and official crude prices by only a small percentage, I see no reason to change the more favourable formula on which Irish prices are calculated.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the higher cost of Whitegate products, which provide 35 per cent of our requirements of petrol and gas oil, is also reflected in the maximum prices fixed for these products by way of a specific addition in the maximum prices build-up.  While a substantial part of the Whitegate cost is based on official selling prices, these costs have already been adjusted to reflect the recent North Sea price adjustment.</P>
    <P>I should also emphasise that the OPEC <Col N="1799" /> prices are fixed in dollar terms and that any reductions that may have occurred in those dollar prices have been more than counterbalanced in Irish currency terms <Col N="1800" /> by the rise in the value of the US dollar. The following was the position at each of the most recent changes in the official selling prices of Arab light crude.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for dealing with entry of vessels carrying hazardous cargoes into Dublin are as follows :&mdash; (a) The relevant ship's agents must notify Dublin Port and Docks Board of hazardous goods on board any vessel at least 24 hours before such vessels enters the port. (b)  Before a vessel enters the port the ship's master must also inform the port authority if there are any hazardous goods on board.  (c)  The port authority's fire protection officers also inspect vessels and their cargoes where necessary to ensure that there is no risk to port personnel.</P>
