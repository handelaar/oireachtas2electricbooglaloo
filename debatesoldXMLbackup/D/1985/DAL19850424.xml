    <Title>European Council Meeting: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to make a statement on the meeting of the European Council which I attended, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Brussels on 29/30 March, this being the first opportunity I have had since then to report to the House.  In accordance with the established practice, I have already had the conclusions of the meeting laid before both Houses.</P>
      <P>A broad range of items were down for discussion including Integrated Mediterranean Programmes, the economic and social situation in the Community, the development of new technologies, the final report of the Dooge Committee on Institutional Affairs, a further report from the Ad Hoc Committee on a People's Europe and the famine situation in Africa.  Within the framework of political co-operation, we discussed East/West relations, the Middle East, Latin including Central America and South Africa.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that just before the meeting, the Foreign Affairs Council had, in the early hours of that day, reached agreement on the outstanding and substantive issues in the negotiations between the Community and Spain and Portugal which were primarily in the Fisheries, Agriculture and Social Affairs chapters.  The key issue of concern to us, of course, was that of Fisheries.  On this I am especially happy to recall that the agreement, reflecting the determined efforts of our three Ministers concerned, represents a very positive outcome in the protection and further development of our fishery interests in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important elements of the agreement is that Spanish and Portuguese <Col N="1559" /> fishing vessels will be excluded for 10 years from the Irish 50-mile box around our coast.  This was a central element in our negotiating strategy which we maintained and upon which we insisted throughout these most difficult and protracted negotiations.  Our eventual success was all the more creditable when one recalls that Spain had continuously pressed for access to the Irish box with immediate effect from the date of its accession to the Community.</P>
    <P>This fisheries section of the enlargement agreement also contains a number of other very positive features from an Irish viewpoint, such as a very strict limitation on the number of Spanish and Portuguese boats which will be allowed to fish in the waters of the present Community. A severe limitation will also apply on the maximum number of such boats when the Irish box is opened up in 1996.  At most, the number involved would be 93 vessels of standard 700 h.p. size or the equivalent, but, in practice, these vessels, which will be allowed to fish Zones VB, VI and VII, will be fishing in a much larger sea area.  All of this is after 1996.  We have also secured a commitment from the Spanish authorities that there will be negotiations to secure an orderly and phased access by Spanish boats to the Irish box after that date.</P>
    <P>These provisions will be reinforced by very tight controls, including quota limitations, as well as a strict monitoring system whereby Spanish vessels entering present Community waters will have to notify coastal member states on entry and exit and report their catches.  This system will be subject not only to surveillance by other member states but also by Community inspectors who will now be enabled to inspect landings and records in Spain which, of course, is not possible at present.</P>
    <P>The historic and decisive breakthrough by the Foreign Affairs Council meant that the only outstanding obstacle to enlargement which was left over for the European Council to decide on was that <Col N="1560" /> of Integrated Mediterranean Programmes. In this context, the House will recall that at the previous meeting of the European Council here in Dublin in December last, Greece had placed a general reserve on the completion of the enlargement process until such time as a satisfactory position was taken by the Community on the scale of financial commitments to be given to the proposed IMPs.  In effect this meant that while these negotiations could proceed, Greece would not agree to enlargement taking place until such time as the IMPs issue was satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>An additional complicating factor was a Greek reserve to the board agreement reached by the General Affairs Council on 21 March on a number of budgetary issues.  These issues related to the financing of the shortfall in the 1985 Community budget, the increase in own resources and payment of this year's budgetary rebate to the UK.  The reserve seemed to be designed to apply further pressure to secure Community agreement on the IMPs.</P>
    <P>Because of its concentration on enlargement issues, the Foreign Affairs Council had undertaken little detailed examination in advance of the European Council of the Commission's revised proposals on IMPs which had been submitted on 21 February last.  The Commission's original proposals on IMPs, for 6.6 billion ECUs, all of which would be additional Community expenditure in the Mediterranean regions of Greece, Italy and France, had been characterised by some members of the European Council at our Dublin meeting as excessive.  In its revised proposals, the Commission proposed a financial envelope of seven billion ECUs broken down as between two billion ECUs in additional funding over and above what would be provided in any case under the Guidance Section of FEOGA and the Regional and Social Funds; 2.5 billion ECUs in &ldquo;soft&rdquo; loans &mdash; the real budget cost of this would be 0.5 billion ECUs; with a balance of 2.5 million ECUs coming from the existing structural funds.</P>
    <P>As anticipated, the discussions on <Col N="1561" /> IMPs reflected fundamental differences in approach and, as was the case here in December last, were again very difficult. In my initial contribution to the discussions, I repeated our support for the principle of the IMPs and the need for the Community to respond effectively to the problems which enlargement involves for the Mediterranean regions, more particularly for a relatively under-developed member state like Greece.  But I recalled the Council's agreement, which as Minister for Foreign Affairs I had secured in July 1976, that on enlargement the financial resources of the Community would be increased sufficiently to ensure the continuation of the common projects and policies of the Community or those which it intended to pursue in the future.</P>
    <P>The European Council's eventual agreement on IMPs, including the financial resources to be provided, their duration, and general principles which will apply in their operation, are set out in the conclusions and these will no doubt have been read at this stage by interested Deputies.  I do not propose, therefore, to say anything further on this subject except to remind Deputies that our concerns were met and that, on my insistence, it was clearly set out in the conclusions that the part-financing of the IMPs from the structural funds will not adversely affect transfers from these funds &mdash; and here I quote &mdash;&ldquo;to other less-prosperous and priority regions of the Community&rdquo;.  This covers our position. The cost to our Exchequer of contributing to the extra funding agreed for the IMPs will, we estimate, amount to an average of slightly more than £1 million a year on average over the agreed seven year duration of these programmes.</P>
    <P>Our discussions of the economic and social situation were facilitated by the usual Commission communication.  I strongly supported the Commission in emphasising the need for more employment-intensive growth but expressed concern at a number of notable omissions, and at the failure of the ECO/FIN Council to submit to us the report which we had requested from them at our last meeting.  I accepted the broad thrust of <Col N="1562" /> what had been said by colleagues in emphasising the need for structural changes, including that of reducing excessive bureaucratic controls and red tape as it affects small businesses, but I expressed our worries at the over-concentration on these more medium and long term issues at the expense of discussion on the Commission's call for immediate measures to boost growth and employment.</P>
    <P>I drew attention to the Commission's comment that 0.5 per cent of the expected growth rate of 2.4 per cent this year is due to the high exchange rate of the US dollar and that this would disappear were the dollar to continue to fall as many commentators feel will happen. In any case, the 2.4 per cent growth rate is already disturbingly low and a drop to 2 per cent or even less would be totally unacceptable in terms of pushing unemployment in Europe even higher than is now foreseen.  I referred to our having raised, during our recent EC Presidency, the need to be ready with compensatory measures in the event of a deterioration in the US economy and I pointed out that Europe is already being criticised by the US for not taking adequate action to promote growth in this part of the world. I argued that the improved budgetary and external payments situation in the EC countries as a whole, and the halving of European inflation within the last two years, provide conditions for stimulation of growth, as recommended by the Commission, and I urged that the Community should prepare itself for action in this area, particularly with the likelihood of adverse developments in the US economy.</P>
    <P>Apart from a Presidency comment on the need to face this latter possibility, I regret having to say that I was alone in supporting this part of the Commission's proposals.  Nevertheless, on my proposal, the conclusions of the European Council request the ECO/FIN Council to report at the next meeting of the Council in Milan on measures to be taken, both by member states and the Community, to combat unemployment through sustained <Col N="1563" /> and more employment-intensive economic growth, although I have to say that I do not take much comfort from the inclusion of this request.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in a speech in London on 22 March last, there appears to be a failure of imagination on the part of the Community's collective political leadership, a failure to grasp the use to which its economic space and weight can and should be put in the interests of tackling the economic problems besetting our peoples.  For our part, the Government will not cease in our efforts to secure a change in this situation.  One might now hope, in the light of the recently published estimates which strongly suggest that growth in the US may be faltering, that our efforts and those of the Commission may begin to obtain a better response.</P>
    <P>The European Council emphasised the responsibility of all industrialised countries to achieve greater stability on exchange markets, including the strengthening of the international financial system, and stressed the importance it attaches to a new round of multilateral trade negotiations which it sees as representing an important contribution to the campaign against protectionism which is of vital importance to us.  Deputies may have noted further developments in these areas in the period since the Brussels meeting.</P>
    <P>As regards technology, the Commission, as requested at our last meeting, had submitted a document containing a wide-ranging set of objectives designed to strengthen the Community's technological base and the competitiveness of industry.  Action in some of these areas is already in progress under the Community's Framework Programme for Research while detailed proposals in other areas are at present awaited from the Commission.  The basic argument in the Commission's paper was that the poor economic performance of the Community relative to that of the US and Japan was due to the Community falling behind these two countries in most high-technology industries which, in turn, is due to <Col N="1564" /> a relatively poor business environment discouraging to innovation and to a failure to exploit the Community dimension.</P>
    <P>As regards environment issues, our discussions focussed on a short Commission paper containing three specific proposals, namely the treatment of environmental protection as an integral part of economic and social policies; the necessity for national actions to be part of an overall Community framework; and the designation of 1987 as European Environment Year.  These received unanimous support.  I was particularly pleased that the instructions from the Dublin European Council had been followed up and that Environment Ministers had, at their Council meeting on 20-21 March, reached agreement at last on a Community approach to the control of motor vehicle emissions while at the same time preserving the unity of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the continuing tragedy of the famine crisis in Africa and noted that the commitments made at the Dublin European Council, on the proposal of the Irish Presidency, had been rapidly implemented.  The latest indications from a Commission report showed that the target of 1.2 million tonnes of cereals to be provided by the Community and the member states will, in fact, be exceeded, as well as the target of 0.8 million tonnes which we had set as the target to be met by other donor countries. We agreed, however, that there is no room for complacency and undertook to keep the situation under close and continuing review, in consultation with other donors, as well as continuing the efforts underway to improve co-ordination, transport and distribution so that relief supplies reach all the victims in need. The Commission is to furnish a report on these and other aspects relating to the implementation of emergency aid, following a visit to Africa by Vice-President Natali with whom I had the opportunity to discuss this problem yesterday.</P>
    <P>On the second day of the Council meeting we discussed the procedure to be adopted to prepare for the discussion at the Milan European Council of the final <Col N="1565" /> report of the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs.  As in the case of the interim report, the final report reflects a broad consensus but also contains dissenting comments by two member states, a number of reservations and an expression of the section on Security and Chairman, Senator Dooge, on the inclusion of the Section on Security and Defence in the Committee's report. Senator Dooge also indicated that, while in agreement with the principle underlying the part of the text proposing extension of majority voting in the Council, he felt unable to support the actual text on this matter because, although not excluding the pleading in exceptional circumstances of a vital interest, it did not include an explicit reference to this point, although it may be the case that some of the members, and their Heads of Government, understand this to be implicit in the wording employed.</P>
    <P>There was no substantive discussion on the Committee's report partly, at least, because of the limited time available in view of the extensive discussion of the IMPs.  The Council confined itself to a discussion on procedures.  It agreed that the Milan European Council on 28-29 June &mdash; which we had agreed in Dublin will be mainly devoted to a detailed discussion of the Committee's report&mdash; will be prepared over the coming months on the basis of bilateral contacts to be undertaken by Mr. Craxi in an effort to resolve the outstanding differences identified in the Committee's report and thus to enable us to arrive at clear conclusions at the June meeting.  Consideration of the Committee's suggestion of holding an inter-governmental conference will be deferred until the Milan Council meeting.</P>
    <P>The Council then turned its attention to discussing a further interim report which had been submitted by the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on a People's Europe.  This report contained a number of recommendations to ease rules and practices in ways which would visibly offer tangible benefits to Community citizens in their daily lives.  The report dealt with freedom of movement for Community citizens; <Col N="1566" /> freedom of movement of goods, including transport services; administrative formalities for border-area traffic; and wider opportunities for employment and residence.</P>
    <P>Under the first topic, the Committee proposed a simplified system for the free movement of citizens travelling by vehicle across intra-Community borders. Such a system has been in existence on the Franco-German border since last July.  Under this system, citizens, by showing on their vehicles a disc, declare that they are in conformity with police-custom rules, and pass across that frontier at a slow speed, subject only to spot checks.  Under the second topic, the Committee proposed certain changes in the level of travellers' allowances, relating to goods purchased in a member state on which the Community traveller has already paid tax and which he or she wishes to take into another member state.</P>
    <P>The European Council agreed to all the Committee's proposals and requested the Council, the Commission and the member states to implement as quickly as possible those decisions which are within their respective competences.</P>
    <P>In the discussions, I supported, in the overall interests of advancing European Union, the objective set out in the report of easing frontier controls, while at the same time supporting the point which had been made by colleagues about the need to retain adequate frontier checks to deal with terrorism and drugs.  I emphasised, however, our particular concerns arising from the differences in taxation levels between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, which are substantial in respect of a number of items and have led to such a diversion of trade as to force us to make major concessions in respect of some taxes, at considerable cost to our Exchequer.</P>
    <P>However, as we did not want our particular problems to hold up desirable Community developments.  I stated that we were lifting our reserve on this issue but on the understanding that our partners would recognise the special situation that exists on our land frontier and would <Col N="1567" /> give favourable consideration to any requests from us for derogations in respect of travellers' allowance.  This, I am happy to say, was accepted, and will be taken into account when the Council adopts the implementing decisions in this area.  Under the new limits to apply, we will continue to maintain our derogation of £55 value for any single item.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the European Council did not adopt formal conclusions on political topics.  This was because one or two of our partners felt that the European Council did not have enough time to consider these issues in detail.  Instead, it was agreed that Mr. Craxi, as President of the European Council, would outline to the press the positions set out in the draft conclusions agreed at official level.</P>
    <P>As regards East-West relations, the Ten noted recent positive developments. They welcomed the opening of the US-Soviet arms negotiations in Geneva and expressed the hope that the negotiations would make possible radical reductions in strategic and medium-range nuclear armaments and prevent a new arms race occurring in outer space.</P>
    <P>As regards the Arab-Israeli conflict, Mr. Craxi outlined our welcome for the recent initiatives of King Hussein and Mr. Arafat on the one hand and President Mubarak of Egypt on the other.  The Ten's concern at the continuing Iran-Iraq war and their desire for an end to that conflict were reaffirmed.  In relation to Lebanon, Mr. Craxi reaffirmed the Ten's support for UNIFIL and declared that the Ten called on all parties to respect UNIFIL's role, to co-operate fully with the force, and to ensure the safety of its personnel.</P>
    <P>As regards Latin America, Mr. Craxi contrasted the return to democracy in countries such as Uruguay and Brazil with the deterioration of the situation in Chile.  He reaffirmed the Ten's support for a peaceful solution to the problems of Central America, and in particular the efforts of the Contadora Group to that end.  As regards South Africa, the Ten recalled their appeal for the ending of the apartheid system and their statement on <Col N="1568" /> 25 March condemning the violent action of the South African police at Uitenhage.</P>
    <P>As a brief meeting with the British Prime Minister in the margins of the Council, we reviewed progress on the dialogue agreed between us at our meeting in Chequers last year, which has been conducted since then at ministerial and official level.  We agreed that there was real merit in continuing with the process although it was, however, not possible at this stage to predict the eventual outcome.</P>
    <P>This Brussels meeting of the European Council was a very successful one, indeed a historic meeting.  All the obstacles to enlargement were cleared out of the way. The European Council was able to call upon the Community bodies, together with the applicant countries, to complete the drafting of the Accession Treaty as soon as possible so that enlargement can take place on 1 January next.  The Treaty, when completed and signed will, of course, come before the Dáil for ratification. Without wishing to pre-empt the debate on that occasion, I feel confident that all Deputies will share the satisfaction felt by the Government, and by me personally, that we will shortly welcome into the European Community the old historic nations of Spain and Portugal, with which Ireland has had so many links from the earliest times.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Brussels meeting the way is also clear for the ratification by national Parliaments of the increase in the Community's Own Resources &mdash; a matter of major importance to Ireland as a country to which membership brings not alone crucial support for the prices of our farm products but also net financial benefits which, in relation to our national resources and our budget, are significantly greater than in the case of any other member state.</P>
    <P>The Community is now in a position to chart the course of its further development towards a genuine European Union.  A certain amount of momentum for new steps along this road has been generated.  I believe that Ireland should be actively and constructively involved in this endeavour, putting forward our <Col N="1569" /> views and ideas, while ensuring that designs for the future safeguard and promote the interests of our people.  The bilateral contacts to take place between now and the end of June, pursuant to the Dooge Report, and the Milan meeting of the European Council now assume a vital importance.  The Government will ensure full Irish participation in this process.</P>
    <P>It appears possible, even likely, that we in Ireland, will very shortly be faced with decisions of major importance in regard to the revitalisation and further evolution of the European enterprise and our own part in, and contribution to, that development.  It appears appropriate and timely to have a major national debate on these large questions, assessing the impact and significance of our membership of the Community; how our interests may be affected, and can best be advanced, in the context of the evolving Europe and world of the future; how we wish to see the European Community develop; and what distinctive role we can play.  The Government accordingly propose to arrange for a discussion in this House between now and the Milan European Council on the report of the Dooge Committee, on European Union, and on European developments generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal business of the last European Council on which the Taoiseach has just reported was the finalising of arrangements for enlargement of the Community by the entry of Spain and Portugal.  Our welcome in principle for the enlargement of the Community to 12 to include Spain and Portugal from the beginning of 1986 must be tempered by very real fears about the effect on our economy of the actual terms of entry which have been negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enlargement of the Community will help to consolidate democracy in southern Europe.  We will have a significantly enlarged market for our industrial and agricultural products.  A Community of 12 will contain a more balanced mix of nations at different stages of development. From that point of view it should <Col N="1570" /> be easier in some instances for us to find natural allies in promoting and defending important national interests.  In larger political and economic terms the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community represents positive aspects and opportunities.  Everyone in the House will share my hope that we forge very positive and beneficial links inside the Community with these two new members, both of whom have traditional ties of friendship with this country extending over many centuries.</P>
    <P>There are dangers nevertheless of which we must be very much aware.  The Taoiseach might have dealt more specifically with those dangers rather than giving a glib impression that everything is now satisfactory and that we should all be elated that enlargement is about to take place.  Our feelings must necessarily be mixed.  On the one hand, I am very glad that Spain and Portugal are now coming in to expand and strengthen the Community but, on the other hand, our position in the Community has not been adequately protected in the arrangements and we face very considerable difficulties in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>Spain as a member of the Community with a large domestic market will, as I see it, be an attractive location for foreign investment and from the point of view of incentives and labour costs will be very much in direct competition with this country.  The IDA will have to be very active and effective if we are to hold our own in securing a reasonable share of investment from outside the Community. There can be no doubt that Government policies in the last two and a half years have created the worst possible environment for attracting investment.  There is also a very real danger that we will lose out in regard to future regional development programmes which will be concentrated on the Mediterranean areas as far as we can see.  This has already happened to some extent.  Greece managed to focus attention on its special problems which they linked to Spanish and Portuguese accession.  They secured a special compensatory <Col N="1571" /> package.  We got an entry in the minutes.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Ireland has allowed herself to be divorced in the way she has from the other less developed regions in southern Europe and that our case has not been focused more often when their problems are being discussed. We are also on the periphery of the Community. We have many interests in common with the three new member states &mdash; I am including Greece in that &mdash; even though for the purposes of CAP we belong to the northern block of countries.</P>
    <P>The fact is that of the Mediterranean package 2.5 billion ECUs will come from the existing structural funds.  The Taoiseach glossed over that glibly in his report.  All we succeeded in getting in this country was an entry in the minutes, a reference to other less prosperous and priority regions of the Community.  The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;This covers our position&rdquo;. It does not cover our position.  If 2.5 billion ECUs are taken out of the structural funds for the special Mediterranean package, no matter what entries there are in the minutes or communiques, that must inevitably affect our position.</P>
    <P>I would have thought our efforts should have been directed at being included with the other less developed member states rather than, as apparently happened, taking part in the negotiations as a member of the more developed northern region and permitting this package to be brought forward and implemented for an area of the Community of which we are not members.  The geographic and natural economic approach would have been for some kind of composite package to have been prepared which would have included us as well as Spain, Portugal and Greece in the new arrangements.  We are members of the northern region of CAP but everyone knows that is becoming less and less attractive.  There is a whole new era of limitations, restrictions and cutbacks being applied to the production of our major products.  Therefore it was very optimistic, to say the least, on our part to have these arrangements made <Col N="1572" /> seemingly on the basis that something had to be done for the less prosperous and less developed Mediterranean area while we, as a member of the northern European agricultural zone, were all right.  In that regard we will face very real, serious difficulties immediately.</P>
    <P>This Government and Taoiseach cannot expect to be held in affectionate memory by the Irish fishermen of the future.  The ten year period will not be very long in passing.  There is a great deal of self-delusion about this.  The whole thrust of the Taoiseach's remarks was that there was nothing to worry about because we had put it all back for ten years.  I find his statements in this report very naive.  He said that the outcome represented a very positive outcome in the protection and further development of our fishery interest in the years ahead.  It does not and he will not persuade anyone in the fishing industry that it does.  I do not know what the situation will be like in the ten year period but if past experience is anything to go by we can expect a great deal of incursion into our waters, even in the ten year period immediately ahead.  My main point is that those ten years will pass very quickly and then at least 93 large Spanish fishing vessels will be fishing in our waters.  A fleet of 93 700-tonne fishing vessels is very considerable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we cannot look forward with any equanimity to any aspect of our fishing industry.  We contribute a great deal to the Community waters.  We provide the Community with a very large area of its fisheries, perhaps with the best fishing territory there is.  Consequently, we should have been given very special consideration instead of the evil day being merely postponed.  In the enlarged Community, one-third of the entire tonnage of the EC fishing fleet will be Spanish. It is not clear what controls if any will either be in force or enforceable after 1985.  The Taoiseach says there will be controls and monitoring but we all know that that is very much a paper exercise. We should have held out for the permanent exclusion of the Irish box because of our special position in the Community but at the same time as any concessions to <Col N="1573" /> Spain were being negotiated there should have been some major provision for the future of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion when Deputy Lenihan as Minister was involved in negotiations, we succeeded in getting a contribution of £30 million from the Community.  This contribution was to help us provide ourselves with a fisheries protection capacity.  We are still reaping the benefit of that arrangement.  This time, however, there is no contribution from the Community.  Anybody who is concerned about the matter must visualise that within the ten year period a major effort should be made, with maximum Community assistance, to build up our fishing fleet so that we will be in a position to hold our own after the ten year period has expired.  In addition, we should have some special arrangement to help us provide a capacity to protect our fisheries both during that ten year period and subsequently, but especially subsequently.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says that the provisions will be reinforced by very tight controls including quota limitations and strict monitoring systems whereby Spanish vessels entering present Community waters will have to notify coastal member states on entry and exit and report their catches. He went on to say that the system would be subject not only to surveillance by other member states but also by Community inspectors.  That is meaningless because with the resources at our disposal now, we could not even attempt to supervise, control and monitor the 50 mile box once Spanish vessels have access to that area.</P>
    <P>We can discuss all these matters in detail when we are debating the legislation that will be necessary to give effect to the arrangements for enlargement but even at this point it is necessary to emphasise that in effect we have negotiated away our position.  People may argue as to whether we could have negotiated more effectively, whether we could have negotiated both for protection and for a longer period but what is really detrimental in this situation is that all has been given on our part while there have been no counter measures.  There has been no <Col N="1574" /> balancing factor, nothing to compensate for this major give away of our fisheries protection.  We must contrast that with what the Greeks have succeeded in doing.  They have succeeded in negotiating a positive programme of monetary assistance for the whole Mediterranean area.</P>
    <P>The economic and social situation in the Community is discussed routinely at Council meetings but with very little effect.  They seem to amount to no more than an exchange of information as to what the various member state Governments are doing.  I note from newspaper reports that at the meeting in question the British Prime Minister advocated her own policy for reducing inflation, controlling public expenditure and reducing State subsidies.  The German representative has redefined convergence &mdash; a word that we always understood to mean a policy to close the gap between the richer and the poorer states of the Community &mdash; as a convergence of economic policies.  At our relative stage of development that is meaningless.  It is not of any significance to have a convergence of economic policies. The phrase may be all right on paper.  It might satisfy some in the sense of it representing a kind of academic exercise but for us convergence means the implementation of positive policies by the Community so as to bring about a situation whereby the less prosperous and less developed regions would be brought up to exactly the same level as the more prosperous areas.  We can only be depressed at the total lack of progress in pursuance of that basic principle of the Treaty. If convergence is meant to mean simply dovetailing economic policies on paper, I do not think we can expect any great progress from the Community in dealing with our economic and social problems.</P>
    <P>The Community, the Commission and the huge bureaucracy which the Commission controls, which is probably the most impressive collection of civil servants, bureaucrats and experts in the world, are not committed to combatting the big central social evil of the Community today, namely, mass unemployment.  Figures <Col N="1575" /> published yesterday showed that unemployment would be even greater; I think the new figure is 13.3 million.  The Community is standing back from that situation. Most individual countries are pursuing the same disastrous monetarist policies as we are pursuing but there is no commitment by the Community to having some sort of Community approach to this major central problem. That will be looked upon as one of the great historic failures of the Community. With all the resources at its command and with the unique apparatus of administration at its disposal, it does not mobilise itself as a community to tackle the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that he found himself alone in pressing for the right type of policies to be pursued by the Community and I accept that as I found myself in the same position at Council meeting after Council meeting, pressing for some sort of action to deal with the social and economic situation at Community level.  However, I do not know if the Taoiseach who is pursuing very clear, specific monetarist policies at home is in a position to ask the Community to pursue a different type of policy.  However, I give him credit for trying to persuade his colleagues in the Council to take a sensible, rational viewpoint of the Community as it is today and for endeavouring to tackle the major problem confronting it.</P>
    <P>In the light of the economic reality and the clear unwillingness of the key member state in particular to do anything about that economic situation, much of the discussion about European union is irrelevant.  It is simply not possible in this modern age to build a union of European states on the basis of mid-19th century economic policies unless there are regional and social policies of significance. How can you have a European union which is based on 1.6 per cent of that union?  It is an absurdity and all this talk of European union is escapism.  The political leaders of Europe, because they will not or cannot face up to the economic problems, are running off in this direction <Col N="1576" /> of substituting a new aspiration of economic union when what Europe really wants is positive policies to tackle unemployment and the many social evils flowing from it.</P>
    <P>We have always been interested in a genuine European enterprise but the key element in a European enterprise aimed at union must be solidarity between the stronger and the weaker countries.  At present, we have a loose arrangement of sovereign States which are only cooperating for very limited purposes. Neither the Dooge nor the Spinelli proposals seek to alter that as far as economic and social policies are concerned. Our economy is in an unprecedented state of recession and we have the highest rate of unemployment in our history, notwithstanding our membership of the European Community.  Nevertheless, at this precise moment, people are trying to tell us that unless we modify our position on neutrality and give up our independent international policy, the immense benefits we enjoy may be at risk and taken away from us.  Commentators say that unless we are very good in regard to this new concept of European union and all that it entails in regard to defence, security and so on, the benefits of the Community will be taken from us.  What benefits?  Are our farmers, fishermen or industrial workers enjoying them?</P>
    <P>Protocol 30 of the Accession Treaty dealing with the special problems of concern to Ireland states that the fundamental objective of the EC includes the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the member states and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less forward regions.  That protocol was given to us when we entered the Community and that is what convergence means.  We gave a great many things away in return for that protocol and I do not think anybody in this House or, indeed, in Europe could claim that that protocol has ever been properly honoured.  I do not think that the people of this country are in any mood for an uncritical acceptance of European <Col N="1577" /> projects and proposals merely because they are European.  Any proposals on European union brought before this House will be looked at with a cold and sceptical eye on the basis of past experience and we intend to judge them strictly on their measurable benefits.  If we cannot rely on the Community and that protocol to look after our interests, we must retain the power to pursue national policies to deal with our problems.</P>
    <P>Weighted majority voting is weighted against Ireland and other small countries. The large countries have ten votes each and Ireland will have only three.  While we accept that the veto should not be abused, as happens at present often when there is no vital national interest at stake, national Governments responsible to their own people must retain ultimate responsibility for their nations' wealth. How are we to discharge that responsibility in the last resort in the absence of a veto?  That is a crucial question which must be faced.  If, on the basis of our recent experience, it can happen that our vital national interests are not fully regarded, what will our position be if we do not have the protection of the veto? The European proposals in the Dooge report, even though Senator Dooge entered a reservation, hold a clear challenge to our neutrality and we must accept that.  They contain proposals to make security and defence part of the competence of the union.  If we are then members of such a union which has purpose and objectives regarding defence and security and which systematically discusses security and defence issues within political co-operation, a union that has a joint EC arms production programme, it will be very difficult for us to persuade anyone that we still have a credible policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that our neutrality is not an issue or a convenient one is simply flying in the face of the evidence.  The EC as it stands is neither a suitable nor a legitimate forum for the co-ordination of defence and security problems and I believe a number of our partners in Europe would agree with that point of view.  It is important at this stage that we <Col N="1578" /> constantly make it clear that it is repugnant to an overwhelming majority of the Irish people to have our country become directly involved in military-related activities which will involve us in a further escalation of the arms race and clearly will constitute a direct breach of our neutrality. Those countries who want to participate in some sort of military alliance have plenty of means of doing so without involving the EC.  We must make that clear again and again.  They have plenty of other means at their disposal without cutting across all the basic principals enshrined in the Treaties.  I urge the Minister to continue to make our position clear when, as he said, we might have to veto such a proposal.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see at present that there is sufficient substance to justify convening an inter-governmental conference following the European Council in Rome.  The parameters of majority voting could be settled by the Council itself.  The political will to create the economic basis of a European union is absent.  European union is a form of escapism from the economic difficulties and the challenges facing the EC.  The EC still has enormous scope and capacity for economic and social development, and surely we should concentrate our efforts on that.  If the European union proposals are pushed too hard and insensitively they might succeed only in dividing Europe rather than uniting it, and that would be tragic at this stage after all the patient effort that has gone in to building up the 12 Communities we have today.</P>
    <P>I commend the Council for its consideration of the position of the famine in Africa, and we all hope that the excellent lead that we took in that area will be continued.  I do not think that any of our people would be satisfied that the EC with the enormous resources it commands is as yet doing enough to combat starvation and famine in Africa.  I encourage the Government to take every possible step they can to push or drag the EC into increasingly greater efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>I must confess to finding something <Col N="1579" /> faintly ridiculous about the prospect of the heads of the member states sitting down in a solemn conclave to discuss matters like car discs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; exhaust emission and the amounts which people can take across the border.  I would imagine that that sort of work should be dealt with by the Commission itself as an ongoing matter and that at best we should have one of the many Ministers of State in this Government attending to it on an ongoing basis.  In a way it is indicative of the manner in which the EC is involved. The heads of Government solemnly assembled in the European Council spend their time talking about Europe, the peoples or whatever title they give it, and I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that we would prefer if they spent more of their time tackling the real economic and social problems of the EC and devising policies whereby the less developed regions could be brought up to the level of the more prosperous ones rather than spending their time deciding whether passengers should be entitled to take £55 or £100 worth of booze or whatever across international frontiers.  That is only by way of passing comment but I think the Taoiseach will agree with me on that.  We are all for more and more of this sort of activity making the EC more and more relevant to the people of Europe, and I hope I made it clear that the main thrust of my remarks today is that the EC is becoming irrelevant to the people of Europe in many fundamental ways.  Particularly it is becoming irrelevant in regard to the problem of unemployment, but I think there are appropriate mechanisms for dealing with the matters that I have mentioned which seem to have taken up so much time at this Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach dismissed his meeting with the British Prime Minister in one paragraph, and I suppose that is as much as it merits.  It would be very difficult to decide what exactly is happening in that <Col N="1580" /> area.  British sources are saying with increasing frequency that the secrecy surrounding Anglo-Irish relations at present is at the request of the Irish Government. Of course, we have the inspired leaks from time to time which give an impression that something monumental and far-reaching is under way.  My view is that the secrecy is simply to conceal the fact that nothing is happening in that area, and the fact that the Taoiseach dismisses his meeting with the British Prime Minister in one simple paragraph would seem to indicate that that is the position.  However, one of the important things that emerged from the Taoiseach's report is that we will have an opportunity in this House to debate many of these important issues.  Many important issues are arising at present, developments which will have a very real impact on both our economy and our political status, and it is important that we have an opportunity of a full scale debate on the many matters that are now current in the EC so that we can at least express our views and have time to assess exactly what is in store for us arising out of these many different developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally I welcome the agreement reached at the Summit which cleared the way for the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC.  In many respects perhaps we have far more in common with these two countries than with the more developed countries of the EC.  We are nearer in terms of the level of development and the standard of living to Spain and Portugal than to most other EC countries.  When these countries join we should aim at working more closely with them and Greece to ensure that the interests of the poorer and disadvantaged sectors of the Community are adequately protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ten year breathing space which has been achieved for the fishing industry should be used by the Government to ensure that the strong Irish fishing industry is developed and not simply taken as putting the bad day off for ten years.  Part of the deal for the accession of Spain and Portugal involved increased <Col N="1581" /> spending and the Integrated Mediterranean Programme which will go to parts of Greece and parts of southern Italy and France.  I have no objection to this arrangement and acknowledge the need for it but it must not be done at the expense of other equally disadvantaged parts of the Community, such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The communiqué issued at the Summit is rather vague on that point and the Government should be very vigilant to ensure that there is no question of transferring resources from one disadvantaged area of the Community to another.  The communiqué following the Summit also acknowledged the high level of unemployment in the EC and stated that it was unacceptable.  That must be the understatement of the century.  Ireland has the highest rate of unemployment in the Community but there was very little in the way of concrete suggestions in the communiqué, in the report of the conclusions of the Summit or in the Taoiseach's speech today to indicate that the Community intend doing anything about it.  It is disappointing that the Taoiseach had to report that he was almost alone in urging new approaches to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The Council also discussed the famine in certain African States but appear to have had little to suggest in the way of measures to deal with this appalling problem which is one of the world's greatest scandals.  I doubt if anyone would disagree that it is a scandal that there is such hunger and suffering at a time when Europe is producing food and when we have huge food surpluses in store.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also stated that there was an initial discussion of the Dooge Report, but there is no indication that he did anything to speak out in defence of Irish neutrality.  There is little doubt that there are events in motion at this time which can and will seriously undermine Irish neutrality if allowed to continue. The Dooge Report is the latest in a series of reports and resolutions which appear to be aimed at aligning the EC fully with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Successive Irish Governments and Irish MEPs have to bear a great deal of the <Col N="1582" /> responsibility for allowing a situation to develop in which other members of the EC obviously do not attach much significance to Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>In the past few years a number of resolutions were passed by the European Parliament which have seriously compromised our position.  Irish MEPs failed to oppose many of these and in some cases actually voted for them.  At the same time this Government have failed to clearly speak out against this drift in EC policy.  It is not surprising that other EC countries do not take our neutrality very seriously when only two months ago a Minister in this Government, Deputy Cooney, Minister for Defence, made a speech dismissing our neutrality as simply a policy option, without even drawing a reprimand from the Government for having made that speech.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the refusal of Senator Dooge to agree to those sections of his committee's report dealing with military and security matters, it is clear that a much firmer line must be adopted by this Government and our MEPs if irreparable damage is not to be done to our position of neutrality in the world.  In this regard I welcome the Taoiseach's statement that he intends to have a debate on the Dooge Report and on the European Union in this House before June.  Hopefully all sides of this House will be in a position to express, and will be given adequate time to express fully their views on the whole question of the development of the EC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no basis for the Minister's assertion that there is a growing confidence in the economy. Never was there such despair and depression. Investment is at an all-time low. The building industry, that sensitive barometer of economic activity, is virtually at a stand still.  Public confidence in the <Col N="1583" /> Government is badly shaken because of the monetarist policies they are so determined to pursue.  The present taxation policy, which is punitive, is a serious disincentive to work.  We have the highest unemployment rate in Europe and there is a lack of job prospects for our young people.  Despite what the Government say, emigration is at the highest level for ten years.  This is a graphic picture of our position today and it is having serious repercussions in other areas.  How can the Minister in all honesty make such a bold assertion that there is growing confidence in the economy?  I see no evidence for such an assertion.  How much longer must we suffer such inanities?  Further evidence of the serious state of the economy can be read in the statement by the economist, Dr. Barrett, in this morning's newspaper which gives a much more accurate picture of the state of the Exchequer finances.  He suggests that the IMF should be called in to sort out the financial mess.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went to great pains to say that this Government's proposals would solve our problems, but despite the hardships imposed by their budgets, there is no evidence that the State's finances are being regularised, no evidence that we can expect any easing of the intolerable burden being borne by the people, no respite being offered to those suffering serious hardships and no prospects for our youth.  I sometimes think Ministers are out of touch with reality and with the views of the public. This is especially true in the case of the present Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  There is nothing personal intended here.  The Minister has no basis for saying that there is confidence.  A glance at <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will show that an alarming number of companies go into liquidation each week.  That is most depressing.  I counted 11 companies in three days last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussions with different groups from every stratum of society the constant theme is our punitive tax system. Take, for example, a group of employees who are currently negotiating a salary <Col N="1584" /> increase and with whom I have had discussions.  They have a salary of £10,000 per year and are seeking a 10 per cent increase.  They told me that such an increase would give them £83 per month gross but of that amount they would get a net increase of £26.15.  That shows the effect of income taxation.  The rate of taxation payable on £10,000 is 60 per cent plus 8½ per cent PRSI.  If that is not punitive I do not know what is.  Is it any wonder there is little incentive to work or that people lack enthusiasm for Ministerial promises?  Is it any wonder the budget was so coolly received?  The grim reality is that there is little prospect of any change or respite and that is what is undermining the morale of the people.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Government are well intentioned but they are totally inexperienced in the complexities of high finance.  They are advised by economists who are so inherently conservative that no major innovatory changes can be expected while they are in power.  There is little to be gained by the public from the Government and that accounts for the general malaise throughout the State. The Government may have a goal but they are not providing any incentives towards meeting that goal.  Their promise of rising living standards are nebulous, meaningless statements that give no firm commitment to the nation as a whole.  Despite their assertions to the contrary they are merely tinkering with the system.  They said that anything other than selective readjustments would be no more than tinkering with the system on the margin without tackling the basic problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill which gives effect to the proposals in the budget is merely tinkering with the system.  The national plan was a timid effort which will not inspire the people.  It was devised by economists who were cast in a very conservative mould and incapable of imaginative thinking. There is no hope offered to the people and very little imaginative thinking by the Government.  There are two parties in Government each serving their own purpose, vying with each other to try to claim credit for legislation.  As I see it, it is a <Col N="1585" /> case of one-upmanship between Ministers. They are over half way through their term of office and we have seen nothing but panic measures being taken by them in an effort to woo the electorate. Legislation will be brought before the House and many promises will be made.  I have seen it all before.  I saw it during the term of the last Coalition.  I saw the public relations work carried on by the then Government which was nauseating. I heard a Minister for Health announce a hospital plan on no fewer than six occasions.  He merely altered the words in the press release.  In the last Coalition the Minister for Education announced that 250 extra teachers would be recruited.  In my naivety I believed it and rushed with enthusiasm to the Department of Education to know if some of them would be appointed to the area I serve.  A civil servant told me that was not quite what the Minister said.  It is no wonder I am cynical about it.  I have seen it all before.  What do I see now in the media?  A massive PR job by the national handlers on a very wide scale.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the media succumbing to this kind of nonsense.  The media should maintain their independence and integrity.  They should not succumb to this but rather adopt a critical attitude. By doing that we will have a healthy democracy.  I would not like to think the media would not be objective but they should be more critical and analyse some of the press releases emanating from Government Departments and monitor some of the statements made by Ministers. They should determine how many of the promises have been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I notice that the media are bedazzled by the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  That is not good for democracy or for the country. I hope that the members of that very honourable profession, of which I am honoured to be a member, will be much more critical and analytical in their approach to the performance of this Government.  By doing so they will ensure that the credibility of the media will be upheld.</P>

It gives effect to some of the items announced in the budget which I hope will go some way towards giving a further boost to the economy, getting people back to work, and give credence to the fact that the economy is slowly beginning to come around and get back on an even keel.</P>
      <P>The budget in January gave a much needed and long overdue boost to business. Over the past number of years there were many factors which alarmed the business sector.  The budget introduced some taxation reforms, restructured the VAT rates, and made some changes in income taxation.  There is a long awaited realisation that our taxation system is a hindrance in many ways and needs to be changed.  Our taxation system is overelaborate and is a hindrance at administrative levels, particularly in relation to small businessmen who do a great deal of work for the Revenue Commissioners for which they are not given any credit. We must get rid of the long drawn out bureaucratic battles between the officials of the Revenue Commissioners who are trying to do their job and individual taxpayers. It becomes a test of endurance between businessmen or their accountants and the Revenue Commissioners. The bigger companies have greater expertise and they have the facilities to send in their tax returns and to claim whatever is claimable.  Smaller businessmen get themselves into difficulties and find themselves harassed by tax officials about making returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one stroke there was a reduction from six rates to three rates and there was also a reduction in the level of taxation, and in particular the punitively high 35 per cent rate.  This will restore a certain element of confidence and will generate a greater cash flow in business. We are all aware of the cross-Border traffic prior to Christmas.  We must get our rates down to a reasonable level. Possibly we could have two rates between 5 per cent and 8 per cent with a higher rate on certain items of 20 per cent. Hopefully the 23 per cent rate on certain items can be brought down to 18 per cent <Col N="1587" /> or 10 per cent as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Two industries benefited in particular. One was tourism.  From reports it seems that the bookings are up this year.  The more people we can attract here the better.  Apart from accommodation, they will spend their money in other areas. The newspaper industry which had a fairly extensive VAT rate bill to pay also got a reduction.  This was very important for rural newspapers which are so necessary. It was great to see the price of one item coming down.  I hope the tax changes which were introduced will give a boost to the economy, get business moving again and get more people back to work.</P>
    <P>We have to work much harder to ensure that people take home more of their pay.  They should be able to decide how they will spend their money.  We must try to increase the allowances and reduce the rates and extend the bands and get down the crippling rate of 65 per cent.  That rate is reached very quickly. One does not have to be on a very high salary before one receives 35p only in every £1.  We have taken a step towards ensuring that there is a greater incentive to work and that people take home more money.  People should have a choice in how they spend their money and whether they save it or spend it.  The choice should be theirs in relation to the greater part of their salaries.</P>
    <P>The changes introduced go some way towards improving the tax system and spreading the burden more evenly.  We have to go further in simplifying the tax system and making it easier for people to make their returns and ensuring that there is not a log jam which causes unrealistic assessments to be sent out and creates bureaucratic battles between the Revenue Commissioners and individuals. More has to be done, but we have started.  We are beginning to make progress. The changes introduced were overdue but we are beginning to improve the taxation system.  Some small elements of the various taxation reports have been introduced, but much more has to be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> There are several items in the Finance Bill with which I should like to deal briefly.  One item is new in the Finance Bill as distinct from the budget, that is, the inheritance tax.  The threshold for inheritance between spouses is being abolished. It stood at £150,000, which to some might seem quite an amount of money.  However, between businesses, houses and assets, possibly along with a pension which was capitalised, that £150,000 threshold was being reached very quickly.  People were being left in the difficult position, at a time of other distress often occurring very suddenly and unexpectedly, of having a demand for inheritance tax.  How were these people going to discharge that liability? Possibly there were some assets such as a business or part of one which could be realised, but the reality was that the main asset might have to be sold.  The fact that the pension had been capitalised and would be estimated on what it would amount to over the next ten to 15 years left people in very difficult circumstances. This proposal is a most welcome development, as is the provision where insurance policies are taken out specifically for payment of such inheritance tax.  If an inheritance, say a farm or business, is to be left to a son or a wife one should not have to resort to partly selling the main asset, putting the family into a difficult situation or causing a factory to close or partially close, thereby putting other people at risk.  While this proposal is not the most popular one, in time people will realise its benefits.</P>
    <P>In cases where a farmer or businessman is getting on in years and wants to bring into the business his son who may have new techniques and further developments in mind, progress will not be stifled if greater allowances are made and such bequests or inheritances are not liable to too heavy a tax.  These things all cost money, but I hope that we can go some way towards further extending the allowances or raising the thresholds.  The inheritance tax came into being in 1975 or 1976 as a replacement for death duties but it is interesting to note that while other taxes have been raised from time <Col N="1589" /> to time thresholds tend not to have risen so quickly.  We must keep an eye on this, particularly in relation to the valuation of premises or businesses which can go up by £25,000 to £50,000 without any raising of the allowance, which can cause difficulty. The abolition of the tax on inheritance transfer between spouses will be seen as a most significant development in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions in relation to interest allowances for those over 65 years of age and the rent allowances being increased.  I hope this will encourage them to keep at home as little of their money as is necessary and earn more interest on it.  This might put a stop to the harrowing cases of old people being beaten up and robbed for a paltry few pounds.  People will then not be afraid of receiving tax demands for the few hundred pounds which they have put into a savings account, often making provision for their funerals.</P>
    <P>It has been drawn to my intention that people will still receive demands for the tax at the old levels because banks will still return the forms in the old manner; in other words where interest of £50 is earned, even though a person may now earn up to £100 in interest tax free, the Revenue people will be informed.  It may be the case that the person is not liable to pay tax on the interest due, but these demands have a very disturbing effect on old people who do not understand the position.  Perhaps some provision could be made with regard to the new tax-free allowances that if a person is to reach the age of 65 within that year the matter will be drawn to attention.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 relate to refurbishment and conversion expenditure allowed in relation to the improvement and conversion of buildings which will then be used as dwelling places, where there are two or more units within them.  I hope this will boost the building industry, whose difficulties I appreciate.  The doubling of the £1,000 allowance, plus the added £3,000 mortgage subsidy, plus the grant recently announced in the national plan of £5,000 for people surrendering <Col N="1590" /> local authority housing and making the effort to buy a new house&mdash; all this amounting to £10,000 allowance &mdash; will go some way towards assisting the construction industry.  There must be two units prior to the development and I would hope this would not cause too much difficulty.  Houses may have been let in various ways, possibly not qualifying under the two unit regulation, but these would go towards providing accommodation in the future.  This allowance may be claimed for two years from 1 April.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme will not get bogged down in relation to whether dwellings were used in two separate units prior to 1 April.  We know the difficulties encountered by people who are trying to improve their house.  Builders are anxious to commence work and it often happens that certain works are carried out prior to inspection by the Department officials. I hope we can improve the manner of inspection and expedite the matter.  I am sure that quite a number of people will avail of this allowance in respect of refurbishment and conversion and I appeal to the Department of the Environment to be flexible in their approach.  I appreciate that inspectors have a difficult task in inspecting all houses but perhaps some improvement in the procedure could be introduced.  Unfortunately what happens sometimes is that people start work and then they find they are disqualified from obtaining a grant.  I realise it will not be easy to get over this difficulty but perhaps greater leniency could be shown, even if it meant a reduction in the allowance. Builders are going through difficult times at the moment and they are anxious to get on with work.  The problem arises in that it may take several weeks for an inspector to visit a house and if works are carried out prior to his visit there may be problems.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the car allowance has not been extended.  There have been considerable increases in respect of road tax, petrol and car insurance.  In that connection I hope the long awaited disc system will ensure that more people will have proper car insurance.  In addition, <Col N="1591" /> the cost of car repairs is quite considerable. The allowance of £3,500 has remained static for a number of years and perhaps the Minister would consider doing something with regard to this matter in view of the high costs of motoring. Running a car is a most costly matter and a greater allowance should be made to businesses who depend for their trade on having cars on the road.  When one considers the price of a new car, in addition to the running costs, it is obvious that £3,500 is quite low.  I know it is not easy in one budget or over a few years to do all the things one would like but I ask the Minister to give some thought to the point I have made.  Perhaps in his reply he will give some indication why this allowance has remained static for so long.</P>
    <P>One item that has received a favourable response relates to the reduction in betting duties, both on course and off course.  I hope bookmakers are doing what they can to ensure that money is not going out of the country and that the extra money generated will be put back into the racing industry which is the backbone of the country and which, directly and indirectly, employs about 25,000 people in many different areas.  The Minister told us that the measure he announced would apply for one year in order to see what would be the effect.  I hope the Minister will be able to give some indication that there has been a positive response.  As in other areas, I hope it will be shown that with a less penal and punitive tax, more money will be generated and the Exchequer will not be any worse off.</P>
    <P>I hope that the tax reform started in this budget will continue.  We have much more to do.  We have to look at all areas of public expenditure, but particularly the value and return we get from the semi-state sector which uses vast sums of public money.  This is essential when money is in short supply.  We must consider having a total overhaul of the various bodies and see if the structures are outdated.  We should also consider if there is duplication of services and question if the various bodies are considering <Col N="1592" /> the needs of today in relation to jobs.  We must question if there is the necessary follow-up to the various courses, particularly AnCO courses.  Is there a constant monitoring of people who go through such courses?  When a person goes to the IDA for a grant or some kind of assistance he should not be thrown out if, for example, the machinery he proposes to use is movable.  I had a case recently in relation to forestry where the IDA were reluctant to help because large combine machines were being proposed rather than stationary machinery.  One of the objections was that individuals might not know where the machines were held.  In this age we have to consider using modern machines and to realise that even if they are movable a person will not just walk away with one of them.  We must change our views and our procedures in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome some sections.  In regard to section 67, and hopefully retaining more of the funds earned by foreign based subsidiaries here, perhaps there is need to examine further whether greater benefit could be reaped from this section by extending its scope.  It appears that there must be a tax treaty drawn up between this and other countries which may eliminate some companies with bases in other jurisdictions, for example, in places like Bermuda.</P>
    <P>I would hope that my queries will be answered, particularly that relating to the car allowance which I hope will be examined further in continuing tax reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): I might first refer briefly to section 10 of this Bill which relates to the exemption of certain income from the leasing of farm lands.  I welcome the Minister's attempt to encourage land leasing by way of tax exemption, but at best it constitutes a half-hearted attempt.  It is a step in the right direction but does not go sufficiently far.  Were the Government serious in their intent to promote land leasing they would offer positive financial incentives and allow greater flexibility over the duration of eligible leases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> Fianna Fáil have consistently put forward the need to ensure that agricultural land is retained by farmers.  We have consistently warned of the need for safety measures to ensure that agricultural land does not fall into the hands of rich outsiders with fat cheque books.  It is our view that it is far better to discriminate positively in favour of those who make their living from the land than render it easier for the rich speculators to build up ranch type holdings.  It is also the view of this party that young educated farmers should be encouraged.  I am happy to note that the provisions of this Bill continue the scheme commenced some three years ago by Fianna Fáil under which land transferred to farmers under 35 years of age, and with the requisite agricultural education, will be exempt from stamp duty.  This incentive has played a vital role in encouraging early inheritance, ensuring that a greater proportion of our land is transferred to qualified farmers at a much earlier age.  We on this side of the House will be examining this aspect of transfer.</P>
    <P>It is now positive Government policy &mdash; the right one to be adopted &mdash; to encourage joint ownership of farms. Here an anomaly has arisen on the transfer of farms to joint ownership when one of the parties may not have reached the educational standard required, when there is an element of duty charged on the portion applicable to the spouse not qualified.  Where a farm is jointly managed, in circumstances in which one party is qualified as stipulated under the appropriate section of the 1982 Finance Act, there should be exemption from duty as is applicable to cases where the transfer is to one single person qualified in so far as agricultural education is concerned. I would ask the Minister to examine that aspect on Committee Stage and to comment on it when replying.</P>
    <P>The small crumbs meted out in this legislation constitute a far cry from the anticipated land policy announced by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties amidst much fanfare and which kept at least one agricultural journalist busy for two years or more.  Even that journalist is having second thoughts about the sincerity of <Col N="1594" /> those who fed him pious aspirations at that time.  On this occasion the chickens have come home to roost.  The proposals of the Government then with regard to the positive promotion of land leasing, enshrined in the provisions of this Bill, constitute a far cry from the proposals outlined originally by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton.</P>
    <P>The Government are expert at paying lip service to popular ideals while performing in a totally different way, which can be demonstrated by the contribution yesterday of the Minister for Finance. While blatantly ignoring the recommendations of the first and second reports of the Commission on Taxation, he claimed that this Bill represents, as he said, substantial changes in the taxation system and he cited the changes in PAYE and PRSI as an example.  Who does the Minister think he is fooling?  The only substantial change is that at the end of the day they will pay more taxes.  The Minister is living in a world far removed from reality. I fail to see where the substantial changes come in.  All tax payers will pay far more taxes both directly and indirectly.</P>
    <P>The proposed land tax is expected to double the tax take from the farming community.  The Government should not count on it.  This tax is inequitable and it will bring widespread disharmony.  It will tax farmers without regard to their ability to pay.  No other section is taxed in that way.  It is an unworkable tax, it is unjust and it is probably unconstitutional.  This tax is being strongly opposed by the farming organisations and is being vigorously opposed by Fianna Fáil.  It is amazing that this Government of economists and socialists seem hell bent on pushing through this land tax as it makes neither economic nor social sense.  Even the Government's advisers, the Economic and Social Research Institute, have warned against it.  The chairperson of the Commission on Taxation has also spoken against it, but still the Government persist.</P>
    <P>This tax is expected to yield something in the region of £60 million in 1986.  That is unlikely to be any great improvement <Col N="1595" /> on the existing accounts based system. The existing system has been accepted by farmers and if it is still in operation in 1986 it could yield £60 million.  The difference would be that it would be a tax on farm profits and not on farm sizes.  The system in operation whereby farmers are taxed on income like other sections of the community has now been accepted by everybody as the only fair system of farm taxation.  Since farm taxation was introduced in 1974 we have tinkered with it.  We have moved from a system based on incomes to a system based on a notional assessment.  We have an equitable system operating at the moment. Surely it is folly for the Government to introduce a system which will not be accepted by the farming community. Why are the Government persisting in this approach?  Perhaps this is being demanded by the junior wing of the Government, the Labour Party, with their socialist approach.  When Deputy Dukes was the Opposition spokesman for agriculture he opposed such a system of farm taxation.  In the Fine Gael Programme for Government coming up to the 1982 general election they said they would totally oppose that type of farm taxation.  Why have they changed?  Hopefully we will get the answers in due course.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil know that there is no great revenue for the tax man from the farming sector.  Farmers are willing to pay their fair share of tax when they make enough money to warrant paying tax.  The only way to tax the farming community is on earnings, giving them the same allowances as those available to the rest of society.</P>
    <P>The way of life of the farmer is different from the way of life of the factory worker or the office worker.  The farmers' methods of earning income are different also.  This must be taken into account in computing their tax liability.  Currently there are administrative difficulties which are preventing the collection of tax from a small section of farmers.  The Minister would be far better employed in having these difficulties resolved.  The farmers <Col N="1596" /> cannot be blamed for that situation but the general body of farmers should not use those difficulties as an excuse for not paying their fair share of tax.  Conversely the situation must not be used by the Government as an excuse for imposing a new and inequitable tax.  The land tax cannot be implemented because the essential information on which it might be based is not available.  Tax liability should be related to ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Neither of the parties in Government made reference in 1982 to a land tax.  At that time the Labour Party stated that all farmers earning a taxable income would pay tax and health contributions.  That implied clearly that those farmers not earning taxable incomes would not have to pay tax.  The Government must not take any action now which could only have the result of significant numbers of farmers leaving the land and thereby lengthening the dole queues.  The suggested figure of £10 per acre was greeted with a certain amount of relief.  Perhaps the Government's public relations people were successful initially in giving the impression that the farmers were being treated lightly but after closer examination the farmers have had second thoughts.  The not so fine print indicates that there will be adjustments in the future in the rates of farm tax.  The Government will be in a position to increase the rate whenever they wish without any regard to the taxable income of farmers.</P>
    <P>The land tax is being introduced by a native Government.  There is the question also of adjusted acres.  There are a number of questions to be asked as to what constitutes an adjusted acre.  There are likely to be many disputes and anomalies in this regard.  Therefore, I should like the Minister to outline his concept, if he has any such concept, of what is an adjusted acre.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this policy that is a matter of much concern is the Government's approach to agriculture as outlined in their document, <i>Building on Reality.</i> In that document it was clear that the purpose of the land tax was to double the income tax take from farmers.  In <Col N="1597" /> other words, more tax would be taken from the farmers irrespective of their ability to pay.  We in this party have said repeatedly that farmers must pay income tax but that tax must be based on their income as happens in the case of the liability of all other sections of the community. If the present system does not allow for that it must be improved and the Revenue Commissioners must be given sanction for additional personnel in order to ensure that those farmers who are in receipt of taxable incomes pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>To introduce a land tax at this time when farm incomes are not even keeping pace with inflation is to guarantee stagnation in agriculture and, at worst, a fall in output and in the standard of living of most farming families.  Some farmers, both dairy and tillage farmers, will be hit very badly by this new tax.  But I have doubts as to whether the land tax will ever become law because I consider it to be unconstitutional.  However, if it is implemented the most productive sector in the economy will be significantly worse off than they are now.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how a Government who must have first hand knowledge of the recession in agriculture could believe that there is a vast sum of surplus money in farming.  That is why I am suggesting that the motive in taking additional taxes from the agricultural sector is political rather than economic. One might say that its purpose is to keep this unsteady Government together for a few additional months.  It is unfortunate that the farmers must form the glue to keep this unsteady Government together.  The Minister in his speech yesterday devoted less than two lines to agriculture, Ireland's single most important industry.  That is a measure of the priority accorded by the Government to this industry.  Much could have been done in the budget and in this Finance Bill to give a much-needed shot in the arm to agriculture.  He could have made finance available for farm development at fixed interest rates and could have eased the <Col N="1598" /> disincentives which are strangling the development of our emerging food processing industry.  He could have offered subsidies to ease energy costs in the horticultural sector, as his Dutch counterpart has done.  He could have boosted the crucial areas of research and marketing by making sums available or by offering tax breaks for others to do so.  He could have speeded up early retirement by giving financial assistance to young trained farmers starting off for the first time. He could have expanded the venture capital scheme to include farming and forestry as well as manufacturing industry.  He could have done so much, but instead he has persisted in the penny pinching approach of the bookeeper which has typified this Government's performance to date.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to refer in his reply to the rescue package which was introduced by Fianna Fáil when in Government.  This scheme has now expired. From time to time we hear statements from the Government about consultations with the financial institutions and the farming organisations about the reintroduction or extension of the rescue package, but there is no concrete evidence that such a package will emerge in the immediate future.  I hope I am wrong in this impression.  Many farmers find that their viability is in question because of uncertainty regarding the future of this rescue package.  The Minister must eliminate this uncertainty by making a positive statement that the rescue package will continue in operation. I understand that there is a balance of approximately £12 million remaining on the expiry of this package and it would not cost the Exchequer anything extra to continue the rescue package for a further two years.  We have given a commitment to the farming community that this rescue package would be continued for at least two years.  Because of our closeness to the farming community throughout the country we are aware that this would enable many more farmers to become viable.  I appeal to the Minister to continue this rescue package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): The Government have failed to avail of the opportunity to implement some of the positive and worthwhile proposals in the report of the Commission on Taxation. The Government have failed to take into consideration the importance of reforming the taxation system.  There is no hint from the Taoiseach or the Minister that any of the proposals contained in that report will be implemented.  This is a pity. The time has come for a fresh look at our whole system of taxation.  This was promised by the parties in this Government prior to the last general election but once the election was over and the Government were formed, this commitment and many other pious promises were forgotten.</P>
      <P>We need a fresh approach in dealing with our problems.  We need new ideas, but most of all our people need leadership. We have not got leadership from the Government and I do not think we are likely to get it in the future whether the Coalition are in power for a long time or not.  Irrespective of the length of time the Coalition remain in office I cannot see any worthwhile leadership emerging.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan is living in cloud cuckoo land or perhaps it is a case of none being so deaf as those who do not wish to hear.  Deputy Noonan accused the Minister of not devoting more attention to agriculture but he must have forgotten about the lengthy debate we had on the Vote for Agriculture.  In the course of that debate it was spelt out that the Coalition had done more for agriculture than Fianna Fáil had done in 20 years.  It was also pointed out that it was a Cumann na nGaedhael Government in 1923 that appointed the first Minister for Agriculture.  The late Paddy Hogan, whose slogan was &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;, laid the foundation for virile agricultural industry.  I should like to assure Deputy Noonan that the <Col N="1600" /> Coalition are aware of the importance of agriculture to the economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in introducing the Bill gave a comprehensive review of all sections of the economy and it would have been unfair of him to devote most of his time to agriculture.  We have a good Minister for Agriculture who is well able to tackle any problems that may arise in that sector.  There is no doubt that he is able to deliver goods also.  The Minister for Finance has played his part in improving the agricultural sector by providing grants for farmers.  Under the ewe subsidy scheme a farmer living in a disadvantaged area with 250 breeding ewes gets a subsidy of almost £5,000 this year.  What did Fianna Fáil give such farmers?  They did not give them one penny.  Not one penny was paid out under the premium scheme when Fianna Fáil were in power.  I am amazed that Deputy Noonan has seen fit to leave the Chamber and not wait to hear the facts.</P>
      <P>One would think listening to Deputy Noonan's mournful speech that nothing had been done for the farming community. If one looks at the prices being paid for livestock and the extent of agricultural exports since the Coalition took office one will see the tremendous progress that has taken place in that industry. Deputy Noonan must be aware that the Coalition have given an incentive to the farming community and the organisations that represent them that is second to none since the foundation of the State.</P>

Manpower is our most valuable resource and it is tragic to see so much of it wasted.  On the basis of the registered unemployment figures at the end of January last no less than 55 million man-days will be lost this year.  Apart from the human misery that that means we must remember that it represents a great loss to the economy. The sooner we reach the stage of having full employment the better.  The budget attempts to tackle the problem but if we do not continue that trend we will be going in the wrong direction.  The budget represents a start: a degree of fresh air has been introduced into the economy.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil have been blowing hot air since the Bill was introduced. I have not heard one constructive suggestion from any Fianna Fáil speaker <Col N="1602" /> and I have listened to all contributions since the start of the debate.  Credibility will be restored to our economy if the Coalition are allowed to proceed on their path of recovery.  They are now putting pious proposals before the House and cannot see that there are any problems. Indeed, one of their Front Bench Members is known as a no problems man. However, they have not told us where the money will come from to pay for the cures for all our ills.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that members of that party are so gullible as to make such statements in the House when they were the architects of the misfortune of the economy.  They lived on cloud nine for years as they borrowed and borrowed for non-productive purposes and now we must try to pay the interest on that reckless borrowing which has been going on for the last two decades.  I am very surprised that they could not see the damage they were doing to the economy.  If the nation was given half a chance, it would be as good as any other nation in Europe, perhaps even better.  Our workforce is as good if not better than any workforce in the world provided they are given a lead. Alas, they lacked that leadership and Government inspiration over the last two decades.</P>
      <P>Since the Coalition Government came to office they have pursued courageous policies which can be strongly defended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Opposition are moaning and groaning about jobs and emigration but what did they do to steer the country towards the challenges of the eighties?  They rested on their laurels and did not plan for the difficulties ahead.  Who created our present difficulties?  It was the wildcat policies of Fianna Fáil from 1977 to 1981 which crippled our economy.  The only bonus as a result of those policies was that it gave Fianna Fáil 77 Members in this House.  At that time, Fianna Fáil pledged that everything would be free&mdash; manna from Heaven &mdash; in an attempt to buy power, glory and government for the party.  It was a policy of power at any price to make sure of their return to office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  I am fully aware of the waiting list for residential accommodation in the Eastern Health Board area.  It is a cause of considerable concern to me.  For these reasons in February 1984 I approved the recruitment of 151 staff and of expenditure up to £481,000 for the commissioning of phase I of Cheeverstown House which would consist of 50 residential places and 124 day care places.</P>
      <P>The position to date is that 74 staff have been recruited and 61 day places out of 124 are operational but I regret that the Cheeverstown authorities did not find it possible to bring any residential places into operation in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March of this year senior officers of my Department met with representatives of Cheeverstown to discuss the continuation of the commissioning of phase I of the centre.  At this meeting the Cheeverstown representatives were requested to submit certain information regarding the <Col N="1606" /> residential element of phase I.  That information has been received within the last few days.  I will be considering with my Department the possibility of commissioning residential places in the light of the resources at my disposal this year.</P>

      <P>I asked in Question No. 3 about funds required to provide staff for the existing bungalows. Five fully equipped ten-bed bungalows are available which could be used next week.  The Minister has stated that he is concerned about the long waiting list for residential care.  The facilities are available, the bungalows are fully equipped, but the handicapped children who could get residential care there cannot move in because there are no staff.  Does the Minister intend to provide the funds so that the necessary staff can be employed at Cheeverstown House?  If he intends to provide the funds, within what time scale will he provide those essential funds?</P>

This year I have provided for Cheeverstown an allocation of £1.5 million in my Estimates.  I have been pressing the authorities at Cheeverstown to recruit qualified staff and open up the various facilities and units in the complex. Again when we had a meeting on 19 March last they were asked to bring forward details of what they propose to do. Last year they had more than enough money.  This year Cheeverstown has more than enough money.  There is £1.5 million there.  I hope they will spend the £1.5 million this year.</P>

At the end of 1984, 151 staff were not employed.  The number was far lower than that.  There is no delay on my part.

I had the acutely embarrassing experience of having gone to Government and obtained the money, but it was not spent.  That is unusual in the health services but that is what happened.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that I will be extremely anxious to apply it to the speciality costing area as well as the clinical budgeting side because with the existing system, it <Col N="1610" /> would be possible to have a fully developed speciality costing system.

      <P>The Deputy's <Col N="1612" /> implied criticism is justified and merits serious examination.  There are at present about 1.54 million people attending at out-patient clinics.  I wonder what they all do there because there are only three-and-a-half million people in the country including children.  Attendances have grown from 1.46 million in 1980 to 1.53 million in 1983.  I would say that has increased to 1.56 million now.  I can assure the Deputy that the system of out-patient clinics in hospitals is being examined urgently within the Department and is in need of radical reform even to the extent of having senior consultants at the doors of the hospitals to assess people because the more people who go to out-patient clinics the more end up in beds for one reason or another whether or not that is necessary.  Perhaps they are admitted on a Friday afternoon and no one sees them until the following Tuesday. That costs the taxpayer the best part of £1,000.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that a number of patients are admitted to hospital as a result of the totally inadequate facilities in out-patient clinics?  Has he any plans for a major capital investment in out-patient departments? I am sure the Minister is aware that a number of them are in a deplorable condition.  They are very old buildings and totally inadequate in terms of space and dressing rooms for consultants.  Has the Minister any plans to ensure that there will be more consultants and fewer junior hospital staff available in out-patient departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the physical condition of many out-patient clinics in our hospitals is, to say the least, deficient.  Our big problem is to convince the people that they should not go to the out-patient facility of a hospital unless they are referred there by a general practitioner.  Unfortunately it is now part of the medical culture that people just turn up at out-patient clinics and use very expensive equipment such as radiology equipment and avail of very expensive consultative and nursing <Col N="1613" /> staff for complaints which could be dealt with in the ordinary way by a GP.  People go to out-patient clinics because they get the services for nothing by and large, except in the North-Western Health Board area.  As a result, our out-patient services are enormously costly and eat up millions of pounds.  People queue for hours on end for complaints which do not require hospital treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that junior hospital doctors would be reluctant to take decisions on the spot.  I would prefer to see senior consultant staff in those clinics but the trouble about employing them is that there must be a contractual obligation that they would be there to do the work they are paid to do rather than handing it over to a junior. Naturally more senior people want to practice their profession in slightly more esoteric surroundings.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider that getting information about admissions to out-patient and casualty departments is something that could be done quickly and effectively?  If we had the facts before us we would be in a stronger position to deal effectively with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I usually find myself in dire trouble when I make observations of this nature but although most hospitals are funded 98 per cent by the State they regard their administrative structures and practices as being totally separate.  The information the Deputy is talking about would have to be obtained on a computer basis.  There is no other way it could be done unless they employed thousands of clerical staff.  I hope the hospitals will cooperate in this.  Frequently we do not know what is going on in out-patient clinics nor do the hospital staff because, very often, the records are not kept in a form which is conducive to analysis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is satisfied with the role that the community care service have developed within the overall health service; and whether he has any proposals to develop the role of the service in conjunction with primary care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Significant progress has been made in the past in developing the services which come within the scope of the community care programme of health boards but there can be little doubt that there is still room for improvement in many areas.</P>
      <P>One of the key elements of this programme is the community nursing service and I propose to initiate shortly a full review of the role of the public health nurse.  I am satisfied that this review will lead to a more effective and modern community nursing service which will in particular be more effective in its care of the elderly in their own homes.</P>
      <P>The personal social services are another vital element of community care and a programme of development of day care facilities, family sized hostels and sheltered workshops for the physically and mentally disabled is well advanced. I intend to introduce in the near future the first of three Bills which will strengthen the statutory framework within which professional services for children are provided.</P>
      <P>The effective delivery of the wide range of services within the community care programme requires effective leadership and integration.  A review of management structures has been completed and discussions with staff interests are at an advanced stage.  This should result in improved management and control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a very practical way I have introduced a new programme for the development of small community care premises in an effort to upgrade our old health centres and to ensure that suitable facilities are available in each local community to cope with the developments in community services.  The programme was introduced in 1984 during which year we completed 15 health centres.  I hope in <Col N="1615" /> 1985 to provide at least the same number again within this programme.  This, I might add, is in addition to our normal programme of building of major health centres.</P>
    <P>The staff employed by health boards in the community care programme are not the only elements of a policy for community care. General practitioners are clearly a key group and I am committed to increasing the effectiveness of this service by developing closer contact between the general practitioner and the hospitals and other health facilities.  I am also anxious that a new style of general practice would emerge which would be less dependent on drug therapy and the report of the working party on the general medical service provides a valuable basis for this.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I am committed to the development of community based services for the psychiatrically ill and I have just recently published a review of the psychiatric services which I believe provides us with an excellent framework for the future delivery of community psychiatric services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the points made by the Minister about improvements. This has gone on for a long time. Does the Minister intend to integrate the community care service with the hospital scene?  Not having close links is one of the major deficiencies in making community care an acceptable alternative to hospitalisation. Does the Minister accept that services like home help and the prescribed relative allowance are extremely good value for money and that these should be put in a more effective position within the community care?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view on the latter point made by him that the home help system, the home nursing system, the visits by public health nurses and the role they play can be extremely effective, although the work structures of the public health nurses in their supporting role need to be examined.  In general I agree with the views expressed by the <Col N="1616" /> Deputy.  I commissioned a management consultancy report on community care structures.  This review has now been completed and the Department of Health, in conjunction with representatives from the health board managements, are discussing its implementation with the various staff interests.  Work is going ahead quite substantially. We have been building up a substantial network of small health centres in the past few years and we will go ahead with that in 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that.  One can count heads but it is the actual number of hours put in by persons and the amount of money provided in the area that really counts.  We have to accept that, if we are to develop the community care side, we will have to close beds and transfer staff from the acute hospitals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;both on the psychiatric and the acute general hospitals side.  There is no hope of really bringing about a transfer of resources if we maintain a very large number of beds.  We <Col N="1617" /> have 50 per cent more beds than the average in the European Community. We have hospitals all over the country with 55, 60 or 70 per cent bed occupancy. Beds must be closed and revenue cost transferred out into the community.  I do not think the taxpayer will fork out another £300 million or £400 million a year to have a massive community care programme built side by side with a massive acute hospital structure.  That is the problem, but no politican is prepared to face up to the implications of that strategy even in the psychiatric hospital area where it is most manifestly necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would accept the main thrust of the Minister's argument that there should be a transfer of resources from hospital care to community care, I could not accept that the hospital beds should be closed down first. Would it not be common-sense to ensure that the community care services can cater for these patients before they are discharged into the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest that the hospital beds should be closed down first and then the resources transferred.  I would suggest that they should be closed down simultaneously with the development of the community care facility.  The real trouble is that everybody argues for the development of the community care facility, for more chiropodists, more public health nurses, more social workers, and more home helps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  If the Minister is hoping that the community care services will provide the role he envisages, we would all go along with that &mdash; in other words, take the pressure off the general hospital services &mdash; but is it not a fact that this will require a massive injection of capital?  Contrary to what the Minister said I believe that in the initial period both these services must run in parallel.  We cannot close down the general hospital services and throw that role over to community care.  For a certain period of time they must run in parallel. It would require a massive injection of capital to provide the role the Minister envisages for the community care services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The transfer might be made with a considerable saving of money.  The biggest cost is revenue. There is no shortage of capital moneys. This year we have £58 million.  Last year we had £57 million.  The year before we had £55 million.  We are spending £200 million in the four year period on hospital capital expenditure and community care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The real problem is the revenue cost.  We have 60,000 people employed and well over half of them are working in the hospitals.  I will give the example of £160 million per annum in every area including Waterford being spent on looking after 11,500 psychiatric patients.  There are 6,500 staff and 7,000 more ancillary staff.  About half those <Col N="1619" /> patients should not be in those hospitals. It is not a question of money.</P>

    <P>Figures such as these have appeared in a number of publications and are of course, well known in the Department of Health. There is a problem of definition with these figures and it is probable that like is not always being compared with like. However, the broad thrust of the figures which show England and Wales with the lowest ratio of beds and the ratio for this country between those for Scotland and Northern Ireland is generally accepted as being true.</P>
    <P>However, when viewed in a European context the number of beds in Ireland <Col N="1620" /> is quite low with only the UK and the Netherlands having a lower number of beds per head of population.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the national plan. <i>Building on Reality,</i> it is an important objective of health policy to shift resources away from institutional services into community services and, in line with this policy, the scale of a number of acute hospital developments included in the plan has been reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am very concerned about this whole matter.  I make the point that 40 per cent of all admissions to our acute hospitals are of persons over the age of 65 years.  It would be very necessary to construct and expand a number of hospitals where acute residential nursing care would be required and persons transferred out of the acute hospitals as rapidly as possible.  I know of acute hospitals with elderly patients who have been in there since, say, last November.  They do not require further medical and surgical treatment and should be moved to other residential care which would be far more reasonable to run.  On average, costs in an acute hospital are from £800 to £1,000 a week and the necessary care could be given at from £200 a week to £400 a week.  Ironically, we could almost take over a few Dublin hotels and put these patients into places like the Shelbourne Hotel at half the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage occupancy rate at the General Hospital, Ennis, was 82.6 per cent last year which does not indicate any real problem of overcrowding.  It may be that some overcrowding does occur on occasions but on balance a figure of 82.6 per cent is very reasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not know that some facilities at Ennis are not as good as they might be and every effort is being made to improve them.  For example, a new X-ray unit was completed and equipped last year at a capital cost of over £300,000 and I also allocated £10,000 recently for the purchase of ophthalmic equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, when the Mid-Western Health <Col N="1622" /> Board transfer the maternity facilities from the general hospital to the new unit at Cahercalla, some accommodation will be freed up at the general hospital which can then be used to improve overall facilities and conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics for 1984 speak for themselves.  The number of patients discharged was 6,872.  The bed occupancy was 82.6 per cent.  The average duration of stay was 5.59 days and the number of live births was 659. When there is a transfer to Cahercalla, further space will be freed.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a former Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, indicated to the health board on a visit to Ennis hospital that he was having the conditions at Ennis County Hospital examined?  Is he aware whether the former Minister for Health had any inquiry made or has he the results of this inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a project team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the current condition of the hospital, it is correct and should be put on the record that a project team have completed a planning brief for the general development of the entire hospital.  That is not to say that the current hospital, as working, is overcrowded.  Ultimately, the intention was, in terms of the project team work, to raise the bed complement to about 200 from 127.  At the moment, with a large staff employed &mdash; 200 persons including seven full time consultant staff &mdash; the average duration of stay is 5.59 days.  In those circumstances I do not know what the previous Minister was doing.  Perhaps he was singing a song down there, whatever else he was doing. There is not a critical situation at this stage in relation to the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we get some indication from the Minister that he might look at the situation to see if any temporary <Col N="1624" /> measures could be undertaken immediately to relieve the position, if he would have the matter examined and give some priority to it?  There is widespread concern and anxiety throughout the county about the deteriorating situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My first priority is to have Cahercalla opened up rapidly, pending the development of the Ennis hospital.  We provided a 30-bed maternity unit for County Clare in the St. John of God Hospital at a cost of well over £500,000.  When the maternity unit is fully available it will free another 14 beds in Ennis hospital to alleviate any overcrowding which may occur from time to time.  I give a very definite assurance that I shall be very forthcoming and co-operative when I see the intent of opening Cahercalla.  When that maternity unit is running &mdash; and it is disgraceful that it is not at this stage &mdash; I shall then examine the situation in Ennis hospital with absolute sympathy and understanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is already aware, the maternity unit at the St. John of God Hospital, Cahercalla, has been completed for some time and the Mid-Western Health Board have been examining the means whereby the necessary resources can be made available for the opening of this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter was discussed in detail at a recent meeting of the health board and I have since given my approval to the members' decision that the new unit be <Col N="1625" /> opened by a re-deployment of resources from services which are considered to merit a lower priority.</P>
    <P>The board's management team are at present discussing arrangements for opening the unit with the Sisters of the St. John of God Order and so I am not in a position to give a definite opening date at this stage.  I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department are in regular contact with the board on this issue and I am confident that it will be possible to bring this service into operation in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say in what way does he consider the Mid-Western Health Board have been ineffective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board indicated they required an additional 21 staff to commission the new facility, namely, a consultant-anaesthetist, 14 nurses, four catering and housekeeping staff, one junior hospital doctor and one clerk-typist.  The agreement with the St. John of God Hospital provides that the consultant and support medical staff for the unit will be employed and paid for by the health board.  Therefore, the annual cost of running the unit is about £420,000 in 1984 prices.  We have had considerable discussion with the health board on the closure of Edenvale Geriatric Hospital, which, should have been closed long ago as it is totally unfit.  However, members of the health board were reluctant to agree to its closure until the Department provided additional beds for geriatric patients in other district hospitals. We informed the health board there were sufficient beds in County Clare for geriatrics and we asked them to come up with an alternative strategy.  There have been legal proceedings regarding the failure to open the unit and the Mid-Western Health Board have been served with a High Court summons.  We urged the board to examine their priorities again and they and the Department of Health are reaching a reasonable accommodation on the matter now.  By and large our view in relation to Edenvale and the other <Col N="1626" /> way in which the situation should be managed has prevailed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that, if the funding becomes available within the health board resources for the extra posts, he would be prepared to sanction the additional posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The posts are not in question.  What is in question is the transfer of resources.  Let us take the example of Edenvale.  The cost of running Edenvale with 21 staff is about £300,000 per year.  We have maintained it is no longer suitable for geriatric care as the premises are very old.  It has serious fire hazards and, as a consequence, the first floor of the premises cannot be used.  It is not even served by a public water supply but yet the health board members wanted to keep it open.  It is quite incredible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We pointed out that if Edenvale was closed the revenue for that hospital could be transferred to Cahercalla quite comfortably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am being dense but I do not think I have got an answer to my question.  Is the Minister suggesting that if the Mid-Western Health Board can find funds within their own allocation they can go ahead and appoint the 21 people who are required for Cahercalla?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am not suggesting that.  I have pointed out they would require additional staff.  There would be no difficulty as far as we are concerned with regard to the consultant-anaesthetist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met them in all kinds of ways but I have had to come <Col N="1627" /> to a final position regarding Edenvale. There is no way I will change my view in that connection.  Quite frankly, I am fearful there may be a fire on that premises that has not even a public water supply.  They are bringing water to the hospital in open lorries but the health board still will not close it.  It is the old story of &ldquo;what we have we keep&rdquo;.  That is the problem.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly our economic problems cannot be solved overnight. The nation's economic ills have been fully analysed by this Government.  I do not subscribe to the view that all is bleak as was said by Deputy O'Kennedy in his contribution yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in many years we have a Minister for Finance able to present a sound fiscal budget, prepared to take into consideration the necessity of improving our economy.  It is all very fine for Deputy O'Kennedy and his associates to criticise the Minister and the Government.  It is easy to be the hurler on the ditch.  That is how one might describe Fianna Fáil spokesmen who have spoken on this Bill to date.  They appear now to have cures for all the ills that befell this country in the past decade.  It amazes me how they can procure such cures overnight especially when they were the architects of the unstable economy that obtained when this Government assumed office.  The electorate now realise that we are the architects of our recovery.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean each and every Deputy in <Col N="1658" /> this House who should be playing his part in that recovery provided that the appropriate environment and incentive to so do are presented.  They have been provided in no uncertain fashion by the present Minister for Finance in his budgetary proposals.  With that type of lead I have no doubt that our economy will go from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>The latest budget marks the end of a long period of rising taxation.  Over the years we have seen successive Fianna Fáil Governments merely skim the surface with regard to tackling the problem of getting our economy in order.  They were pussyfooting with the idea of doing so. They did not have the backbone, courage or determination to ensure that corrective measures were taken to aid our ailing economy.  If I might draw an analogy, the situation was like that of a sinking ship; they did not even help to pump out the waters being taken in by that ship.  Now they have come to the point at which they see fit to criticise this Government for taking the correct steps in ensuring that our economy is stabilised, rendering this a country with a better standard of living for its inhabitants, affording them an opportunity of earning a decent living and of playing their part in establishing it once more on a sound economic footing.</P>
    <P>Not alone are this Government adhering to the commitment to increase the share of national income, with tax reliefs exceeding tax increases implemented in the budget, but we are introducing major reform in both the income tax and VAT areas.  It is a well known fact that every single taxpayer will pay less tax this year and that the marginal rate of tax is lowered in respect of over 220,000 taxpayers. For example, 65,000 taxpayers who had been paying a marginal rate of 45 per cent will be reduced to 35 per cent, 80,000 taxpayers whose marginal rate was 55 per cent will now pay at 48 per cent and, as a result of the abolition of the 65 per cent band, more than 60,000 taxpayers will benefit by the reduction to 60 per cent. This constitutes an incentive to our future development as a country.  It is an incentive also to business people to grasp the nettle, expanding where at all possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> For years our taxation code has hindered our economic recovery.  The new system, with two rates of VAT and three rates of income tax only will ease administration, reduce evasion, restore incentives and boost our economy.  As the House is aware, the implementation of only two rates of VAT constituted a major breakthrough.  If risk taking is encouraged our business entrepreneurs will invest, particularly if the appropriate means of realising their gains, repaying a fair proportion, are afforded them.  Likewise entrepreneurs will invest if it is evident that the proceeds of taxation are prudently and efficiently spent and if they foresee a fair return on their investment and effort.  But there must be an incentive given for further development and investment here.  The more investment we can attract, the more development we can achieve, the sooner will our unemployment figures drop considerably.  Recently hopeful trends have appeared in these unemployment figures.  I have no doubt that if the policies being effected by this Government are allowed to continue in future years we will see a remarkable reduction in the amount of unemployment here.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last I had an opportunity of speaking with a German industrialist in west Cork.  He told me that in the great Federal Republic of Germany&mdash; where a major boom existed since pre-war years &mdash; there is now a serious situation obtaining as far as unemployment is concerned, that millions of people in that wonder economy of west Germany are now unemployed with some of the greatest empire building companies in that Federal Republic having gone into liquidation.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that the problems we face are much greater in other European countries.  I have no doubt that with proper incentives, administration and a proper direction from Ministers the economy will be restored in the not too distant future.  A start has been made but much remains to be done.  The problem of budget deficits must be tackled.  The scope for providing incentives by reducing <Col N="1660" /> taxation is limited but that on its own will benefit the economy.  Our Minister has been courageous enough to outline the measures which must be taken if we are to survive.  The pie in the sky policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil administration in the late seventies when we were told that there was no end to the rainbow contributed to the ruination of the economy. About £13 billion was borrowed from 1977 to 1981 for unproductive purposes. The interest on that colossal sum is having a crippling effect on the restoration of confidence in the economy.  There was an abrupt ending to the rainbow.  The manna from Heaven which was hoped for did not come and facts had to be faced.  This Government had the courage and consistency to face the facts.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill contains several features which will improve the business climate, thereby increasing economic growth.  The decision to rationalise the VAT system and abolish the VAT rate of 35 per cent is a very welcome move. It is a step in the right direction.  It will reduce the distortion of trade which gave rise to colossal imports from Northern Ireland in recent years.  It will also reduce the cost of the importation of machinery and parts essential to industry.  The reduction of the 35 per cent rate to 23 per cent has had a good effect in restoring confidence in the economy.  We have seen it in a direct return on income to the pockets of the overtaxed housewife.  A huge range of products were reduced in price.  For instance, a 22-inch colour television set was reduced from £600 to £500, a 3.1 kg of washing powder came down from £3.89p to £3.55p and it costs £3.45 sterling in the North; shampoos are down from 89p to 81p as a result of the VAT reduction and the same type of shampoo costs 79p sterling in the North; disinfectants are down from 75p to 68p a bottle and the same detergents costs 64p sterling in the North.  These are a few of the items in the huge number of items affected by the reduction in the 35 per cent VAT rate.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of income tax bands and the elimination of the 65p rate should act as an incentive to people to work <Col N="1661" /> and take on additional responsibilities. Without an incentive to work the economy would grind to a halt.  The first signs in over a decade of an incentive being given by any Minister for Finance has appeared in this progressive budget.  The reduction in the industrial electricity prices will help to improve the competitiveness of Irish industry although the charges remain higher than those of our European counterparts.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months our exports have almost equalled our imports, for the first time in 20 years.  We have seen that our industrial workers, if given the chance and the incentives, will rise to the occasion and can compete with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>The reduction in VAT on tourism will enhance the competitiveness of the tourist industry.  Ireland has its own climatic charms which we should exploit to the full.  I have no doubt that it is a major attraction over the barren volcanic views of some sun-drenched countries.  Ireland is known as the emerald isle and because of its beauty is in a position to attract many tourists.  It is my belief that we are only skimming the surface as far as attracting tourists is concerned.  Our climate is ideal unlike that in the sun drenched volcanic countries.  Our air is pure and our water clear, two essentials in any effort to boost tourism.  I was pleased to note that VAT on hotel charges has been reduced from 23 per cent to 10 per cent. That will be a tremendous boost to the tourism industry.  Any reduction in taxation in that area will prove rewarding.</P>
    <P>Section 58 exempts from inheritance tax inheritances taken by one spouse from the other on or after 30 January this year.  Small business and farms will be more secure now because of that exemption. The concession will mean that family owned enterprises will not have to be sold on the death of a spouse.  In recent years property inherited from deceased relatives had to be sold to pay inheritance tax to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am pleased that that will not be the case in future.  Such inheritance will be free of tax.  That is a step in the right direction <Col N="1662" /> and one that will benefit small businesses and farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is welcome.  Up to now the single parent allowance was only available to parents who qualified for the £100 child tax allowance.  Up to now if a child had an income of £180 in a year a single parent could be deprived of an allowance of £1,900 per year.  The new income limit for a child is £720 per annum and tapering arrangements are provided under which that allowance would not run out until the child's income reaches a ceiling of £2,120 in the case of a widowed parent or, £2,620 in the case of other single parents.  The Minister should consider giving more concessions to the PAYE sector for children.  Such people are allowed £100 annually for each child. That was the amount allowed 15 years ago.  In making tax concessions in the future the Minister should consider raising that allowance to a realistic figure of at least £1,000 per child.  The days of an allowance of £100 per child have gone. The Minister should take immediate steps to increase that allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 reduces the age qualification for rent relief on private tenancies from 60 years to 55 years.  It increases the ceiling on relief from £500 to £750 in the case of a single or widowed person and from £1,000 to £1,500 in the case of a married man assessed to tax in respect of his own and his wife's income.  That is a step in the right direction.  It is a major breakthrough.  It will help the underprivileged, the aged and the infirm who pay colossal rent in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to increase the limit on the amount of interest on deposits with the Trustee Savings Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank from £120 to £240.  I also welcome the increase in the limit which applies in the case of interest on deposit with certain commercial banks from £50 to £100.  There is no need for pensioners to keep a little nest egg under the mattress.  They need not fear putting money on deposit in the post office or the Trustee Savings Bank.  Up to £5,300 can be invested in those institutions free of income tax.  The Minister's decision to increase the limit was a humanitarian response to the problems <Col N="1663" /> of old people.  He was conscious of the many attacks on old people, particularly those living in rural areas.  I hope he will increase that limit further in the next budget.  I hope this will mean that there will be no more mugging or tying up of old people.  I hope they will be allowed to live in peace and not in fear of being robbed of the few pounds they put aside for burial and other purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that exemption from income tax will be granted to farmers over 55 years in respect of the first £2,000 of leasing income.  The £2,000 ceiling will apply separately to each spouse where both spouses engage in leasing. That will help to encourage the greater utilisation of land by young farmers. Hundreds of thousands of acres of good agricultural land lie idle because the owners feared they would have to pay tax on any money received for the letting of it.  Irrespective of what Deputy Noonan said this morning, the proposal in the Bill is recognised as a major incentive.</P>
    <P>The decision to double the new house grant to £2,000, the granting of a £3,000 mortgage subsidy and a special grant of £5,000 will be a boost to the building industry.  It will relieve the strain on local authorities of providing houses.  Everybody knows that this was a courageous step on the part of the Minister for Finance. The number of applicants for all three grants is increasing by hundreds each day.  This is bound to have the effect of reducing the local authority housing lists.  It is an important strategy and the Minister deserves the kudos.  The reduction of VAT on concrete blocks from 23 per cent to 10 per cent is a very welcome boost to the building industry.  The registered manufacturer will certainly benefit and house prices will be reduced considerably by this measure.</P>
    <P>The additional money provided for fishery harbour development works is very welcome, particularly in Schull where work on the long awaited extension to the pier will commence very shortly.  I need not remind the House how long this problem lay on the desks of <Col N="1664" /> successive Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Fisheries.  It was put on the long finger until the present Ministers saw fit to provide the extra money to give these people the opportunity of making a living and contributing to the economy. The economy will certainly benefit from these works.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on road construction is up by 23 per cent of the 1984 figure. Expenditure on educational building is also up by 17 per cent or £14 million on the 1984 figure.</P>

      <P>Provisions were made in the budget for an increase of 25 per cent in this scheme.  This will mean that old age pensioners in rural Ireland will receive a voucher to the value of £150 rather than £120.  This is a major breakthrough in favour of the underprivileged section of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the taxation on spirits has had a major impact in curtailing the smuggling of spirits across the Border. The Minister may see fit in the not too distant future to reduce duty on the poor man's pint.  This would involve no detrimental effect on taxation and would give <Col N="1665" /> the poor man an incentive to enjoy his pint at a fair price.  The complete removal of excise duty of 8p per gallon on diesel oil used by fishermen will be a welcome boost to our fishing industry.  It will mean an injection of about £2.5 million into that industry.  I have no doubt that the Minister has embarked on the correct course for the economy.  I welcome the Bill and all the increases outlined.  However, it is only a step in the right direction and there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread recognition for some time of the need to reform our taxation structure.  This would have a profound effect on the economy and I have no doubt that our Minister has the foresight to proceed along those lines.  It is evident that if we are to survive and compete with other European nations we must streamline our industrial projects, strengthen the backup services for those industries and keep up the tempo of our exports.  Our exporters must get the best possible advice from CTT and other semi-State bodies which can play their part in the restructuring of our economy.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill represents a creative and forward-looking response to our needs and problems.  I would remind Opposition Deputies &mdash; there is only one Member on the Opposition benches&mdash; that the day of manna from Heaven is over.  All of us must do our best to ensure that the economy will continue to grow and develop to the maximum extent, with the ultimate aim of employment for all. We are all together in this battle for survival. The time has come to discard the begging bowl.  We must all play our part in building the economy, so that this country can achieve its rightful status. This will not be achieved by petty political scoring in this Chamber but only by the dynamic foresight of every Deputy in helping the Minister and the Cabinet to put us on the road to success.</P>
    <P>We will only succeed in putting our economy on the road to success if each of us is prepared to work hard.  Our country needs that boost from the people and from the Government.  We must be realistic. If any concession can be made it <Col N="1666" /> should be made first in favour of the PRSI worker because he is the one who is overburdened with taxation.  I appreciate that other groups, farmers and others who are essential to the economy, have to pay tax also but the PRSI worker should be considered first in the event of our being able to ease the tax burden.  By the time he receives his wage or salary a good deal of it has already been deducted in respect of taxation.</P>
    <P>I would advocate the introduction of a rent allowance for PRSI workers who are paying high rents for flats in cities and towns.  It is difficult for them to pay those rents when on average 45 per cent of their income, after the tax free allowances have been provided for, is taken from them.  In addition, the Minister should consider tax allowances for those who must travel round journeys of up to 60 miles per day because of their place of work being some distance from their home.  In most cases these people have built their homes in rural areas or in villages and must travel to the towns and cities to find work.  It would not be feasible for them to rent flats in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I wish now to make an appeal to the Opposition, to ask them to desist from playing political football with the major problems in our economy.  The Opposition must face up to their responsibilities. It is said that the one who never makes a mistake is never any good.  If Fianna Fáil have made mistakes in the past they have plenty of time in which to correct them.  Consequently, they should begin by supporting the Minister and the Government at this crucial time.  We must co-operate if we are to solve the problems of our economy.  Otherwise, the recovery will be very much delayed.</P>

      <P>I am a little reluctant to break in on this love-in between Deputy Sheehan and the Minister for Finance and to break into a world of shampoos, cheap detergents, disinfectants and colour television sets in a climate that is neither too warm nor too cold.  But love is blind and a lover does not notice the follies of his lover.  Deputy Sheehan is blinded by his affection.  He waxed <Col N="1667" /> eloquently about nest eggs under the mattress. It would be a difficult proposition to use that kind of bed.  The Deputy forgot to tell us about the various gradings that were increased in number by the present Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dangerous to intervene between lovers but the wisdom of decreasing the level of the tax free interest last year on bank deposits and of increasing it this year may be lost on people who are committed emotionally. Last year the figure in this respect was reduced.  Before resuming his seat Deputy Sheehan assumed the role of father confessor by asking us all to confess. No doubt, the Minister confessed to the Deputy that reducing the figure to £50 last year was wrong.  It is unlikely that the Minister will be in office next year but if he remains penitent perhaps he will increase the £100 to £200.</P>
      <P>We are faced with consideration of the Finance Bill and I should like first to comment on the income tax situation. Yesterday our spokesman on Finance reminded the House that one of the major planks of the Coalition platform was that the burden of taxation on the PRSI worker would be reduced.  This has not happened.  The Minister must realise that he has reached the point of diminishing returns.  The April 16 edition of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> indicates that income tax returns this year are down at this stage by £35 million.  Admittedly, in taking a figure like that at an arbitrary date, the full picture does not emerge; but it is an indication that at this stage in the year the income tax take is dropping.  The levy is down by £3 million on the corresponding period for last year.  This indicates that, with the combination of high unemployment and the severity of taxes, the Minister has got the income tax section of the Finance Bill all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions with regard to the relief granted to widows and single parents as far as they go.  A realistic view <Col N="1668" /> of the problem indicates &mdash; although I do not want to make wild suggestions&mdash; that the Minister could have gone a little further down that road.  I also welcome the relief granted to people of 65 years and over and I am sure that the Minister's intention to encourage people to put money in the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Bank is a good one for social reasons as well as for his own reasons of getting more money in which may be used for productive purposes. The increase of £120 to £240 and that of £50 to £100 which were mentioned by Deputy Sheehan are welcome but as the Post Office Savings Bank and Trustee Savings Bank are State controlled perhaps he has started on a road upon which some future Minister for Finance should continue to travel.  I know that during the year some malicious people spread rumours about the Trustee Savings Bank and the Minister had to assure the House that there was no truth in them.  The Trustee Savings Bank was not and is not in danger and is a desirable place in which to deposit money.  The interest rates are good and it is available to the State for proper use.</P>
    <P>I agree with our spokesman on agriculture that the relief from income tax with regard to the leasing of land is a very small <i>pourboire</i> as far as that area is concerned.  However, the idea behind it is right because we had a European farm retirement scheme, for example, and it was so badly constructed and operated that it is now a dead duck.  Allowances were made to people but no cognisance was taken of their rights under the social welfare code and the result was that there was no great change in ownership of land and no retirement on the scale originally expected.  Consequently, it is being done away with altogether.  The thinking behind relief on money received from leasing land is right and if it were applied across the board in the case of transfer of land from an aged farmer to &mdash; I do not know where we can send it now because this lunatic Government are getting rid of the Land Commission, the only bulwark for the small man against the cheque book speculator &mdash; a young <Col N="1669" /> farmer with the proviso that the retiring farmer was properly looked after and not precluded from social welfare benefits, I would subscribe to that kind of philosophy.</P>
    <P>I am slightly irritated by the priority which the Revenue Commissioners and other State institutions have with regard to funds when there is a liquidation or a bankruptcy.  I am a little worried about the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private citizen because very often the private citizen gets 1p in the pound or perhaps nothing when the priority institutions have taken their cut of the funds available.  It should be established by law that the individual citizen has at least equal rights.  I know that very often the management or persons responsible for bringing down a company had not exercised due care and had not lived up to their responsibility regarding the State and I am sure other members of this House are also worried about the position of the private citizen <i>vis-à-vis</i> that type of institution.  But when all is said and done the private individual can often suffer the greatest damage compared with public institutions which will continue to exist one way or another.  It can be argued, of course, that the public institution is holding money for the citizen, and that is true.  However, I should like consideration to be given in our thinking and legislation to the position of the individual citizen and his rights in circumstances where he or she find themselves in a big league.</P>
    <P>I cannot but praise the effort to encourage the allocation of moneys to research and development.  A country which is basically not very wealthy has to use all the rat wit because sometimes we are able to avail of research which can be costly in some fields and which has been done elsewhere.  On the industrial scene, unless a company are going to establish themselves and stay in the country, the results of special research done in the company will be applied for the benefit of the company in whatever country in which they may be operating in a major fashion.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints about industries invited in, financed and looked after very <Col N="1670" /> well here in the past was that they did not provide funds for research and development. We have particular advantages in that we have a very strong, young population and we are trying to provide them with the basics in education and to prepare them in such a way that they will be capable of doing research.  Therefore, anything that encourages native companies or those from abroad to carry out research and development in the country should be encouraged.  I refer in particular to the fact that this extends the facility with regard to the College of Commerce in Rathmines, the two National Institutes for Higher Education, the colleges of technology and the regional technical colleges. A wide diaspora of institutions can now gain by that measure.  I hope that the people responsible for the funds in various industries will act on this.  It is a primitive view that you should not spend money on research and development and that you are not gaining anything for yourself or for shareholders, if it is a company.</P>
    <P>The building societies are carrying a very high burden of responsibility.  There does not seem to be any doubt about the fact that the Government deliberately set out to run down the construction industry.  That is the only conclusion which anybody can come to by dispassionately and objectively examining what has happened since they took office. There are close on 50,000 skilled people unemployed in that sector, people with skills ready to deploy those skills if the opportunity is made available to them, and all the activities, positive and negative, of this Government have been to run down the construction industry.  Apart altogether from the capital programme which is the major one this extra 5 per cent VAT was imposed on new houses this year.  It is impossible to understand it.  It was rapped on the day of the budget and of course a furore was to be expected, or at least if the mandarins in the Department of Finance did not expect it that is further proof that they are insulated from the realities of life.  Some small time contractors stood to lose £1,500 each on <Col N="1671" /> houses that they had already signed a contract for at that time.</P>
    <P>Admittedly the imposition was postponed until 1 May and that at least saved them the immediate burden, but the 10 per cent goes on on 1 May anyway and that is simply incomprehensible.  Therefore, the building societies should get special favour treatment because they are shouldering most of the responsibility as far as private housing is concerned. Without building societies the whole thing would collapse and, of course, people who have skills which are not being used tend to lose those skills. Therefore, the Government and in particular the Minister for Finance are especially culpable in this regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 19, I do not think that the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or for that matter the IDA are making enough effort to fill the advance factories which are already available.  The allowances are generous in anyone's language and I cannot see how the failure has been so great.  It is not merely regional, although my region is particularly badly affected, but all in all the effort is not being made to fill the empty advance factories.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is a pathetic gesture, and this is relevant to what I have been saying about the construction industry.  That industry itself and people who have expertise in that area have stated bluntly that it is a pathetic gesture to the building trade and that it will have no major effect on employment in the construction industry.  There is an indication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that as far as corporation tax is concerned the Minister has crossed the boundary.  Up to 16 April 1985 the corporation tax yield was £33.9 million.  For the same period in 1984 it was £33.5 million, practically the same, and when inflation is taken into consideration one can see that it is a falling back.  There is no surprise about that.  That 230,000 people are out of work is an indication of how many businesses and industries have closed down.  You cannot knock blood out of a turnip, and the Minister should realise that also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> All Deputies from all political parties who represent constituencies along the Border have been talking in this House <i>ad nauseam</i> about our problems.  The trouble is that nobody believes us.  It is apparent that nobody believes the combined wisdom of Deputies from the Border constituencies.  It may be the old story that he who cries &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; too often is not finally believed when the wolf comes, but we have been adhering to the facts with regard to the economy along the Border but to no avail as far as official Government thinking goes, with this Government anyway.  That creates no surprise because our area is not represented in Cabinet, it is not represented in Government.  For that reason there is no voice to indicate the parlous position of the economy.</P>
    <P>An EC social committee high powered team examined the social and economic problems along the Border.  Of course, they would not say the obvious but it has been obvious to us for so long that the thing should not be there at all anyway; there should be no Border.  Belfast was our economic capital when I was growing up and I was born after the Border was established.  Gradually the Border became more of a reality as time went by.  People went to work from my area to Belfast, but there is an unnatural Border which has done violence to the economics of the historic province of Ulster which, as this House knows, has nine counties. The social committee, looking at the scene objectively and far more dispassionately than I can look at it, said that it is one of the most deprived areas in Europe and they made suggestions which were thrown aside churlishly by the Minister for Finance who is responsible for this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>This is not an occasion to go into the whole economics of the Border area and of the Ulster position generally, and I accept no definition of Ulster which does not make an Ulsterman out of me, but what have we now?  We have this Minister coming in and putting an extra excise duty on petrol and diesel.  The result is that within a certain distance of the Border no petrol retailer is selling petrol <Col N="1673" /> or diesel.  He just must close shop and go.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said yesterday, the excise duty on petrol and diesel is absolutely savage and unjust.  It is doubly savage and unjust in our context.  An increase of £1.78 per hectolitre was put on by the Minister and that is incorporated in this Bill.  I do not find much satisfaction in the fact that offcourse bets have been reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent in that context, having failed to have all of County Cavan and County Monaghan declared severely handicapped for the purposes of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have failed on that but we are going to keep talking.  We are not going to be silenced.  We will continue to point out the position there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction from 25 per cent to 10 per cent on motor vehicle parts, any reduction is welcome.  I see that it does not come into operation until 1 February 1986.  It escapes me why if it is good in 1986 it is not good now and why it is not brought into effect.  The answer we used to get in the past in those circumstances was that it would be administratively difficult to do it immediately but I do not know what answer will be thought up for this.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going in pursuit of the mineral water manufacturers.  Would he tell his inspectors to be civil and respectful to the citizens?  I had to raise this matter in the House on a number of occasions with regard to social welfare inspectors.  We do not have a good tradition, I regret to say, of public servants dealing with citizens respectfully.  The result is that when a household has a visit from one of these inspectors, for whatever purpose, there is immediately an atmosphere of hostility generated.  I know our public servants are well trained and well educated and I think the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland, was starting a campaign telling public servants they would not be welcome in the public service if they did not treat citizens with respect.  When I see in a Bill that inspectors are to be let loose on the makers of mineral waters, I suggest that these inspectors be told that <Col N="1674" /> they should treat the citizens with respect.</P>
    <P>I note the provision in the Bill for the reduction of excise duty on spirits.  When the economy was sinking slowly Deputy Haughey suggested that a move like this would be beneficial and would not cause any loss of revenue but might even increase revenue.  At that time it was useful for the national handlers to ridicule that suggestion because of where it came from.  It is one of the mysteries of politics and of many organisations to which I belong that suggestions are not assessed on their merits but rather on their source. This is a major error.  When Deputy Haughey made his suggestion for a reduction in the duty on spirits and beer there was a big build up in the newspapers that Fianna Fáil were being irresponsible again.  I have had letters from people around the Border areas saying we should press for a reduction in the duty on beer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to the reduction of excise duty on television sets when he was involved in his love-in with the Minister for Finance.  The people in the Border areas do not regard the reduction as significant so far as the smuggling of television sets is concerned.  Any reduction is welcome but the fact is that the reduction will have to be very considerable before it is of any use.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already that there was a reduction in the number and rates of VAT from 35 per cent, 23 per cent, 18 per cent, 8 per cent, 5 per cent, 2.2 per cent and zero rating to 23 per cent, 10 per cent, 2.2 per cent and zero rating. The point I have already made is that this Minister introduced the 35 per cent rate and we will not burn incense in front of him for having a maximum of 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>There have been many discussions about the imposition of VAT on footwear.  This subject has been teased out, discussed and debated enough and I will not delay the House, but, in my view this VAT should not have been imposed. I know shoes for children up to 11 years have been excluded but it could be said there is difficulty in identifying children's ages up to 18 years.  There is a lot of pressure on the PAYE wage earner <Col N="1675" /> because he pays very high PRSI and now he has to pay heavily for footwear, much of which I regret is imported.</P>
    <P>The labour-intensive industries which have gone to the wall have left a large gap in the economy and have put many people on the unemployed list.  I remember Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn telling me that some years ago she bought children's shoes in Galway.  When she asked where they were made she was told they were made by a shoe factory in Bailieboro, County Cavan.  She said that for style and quality they were superb.  That factory has closed and I am sure much shoddier shoes, both from the design and quality point of view, are on the market now. She bought these shoes in a big store and I am sure the price was competitive.  Irish Shoes Supplies of Belturbet have also closed down.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to know that there is some soul in the Department of Finance. The provision for theatrical and musical performances should be welcomed by all civilised Members of this House.  We all know the Abbey Theatre is in financial difficulties.  They have had to reorganise the theatre, something I regret very much.  It seems strange that a theatre called The National Theatre should go over the top because of the production of one play by Eugene O'Neill.  The board are trying to cope with this problem at the moment.  I hope they will not lower their very high standards and that they will continue to make available to the public plays which, in the normal course of events, we would not be able to see in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the tourist and hotel industries are very anxious that the VAT on meals should be, if not eliminated, then at least reduced.  We are reducing the VAT for accommodation and the hiring of boats, which is important in my constituency.  Caravans and so on are probably used more extensively in other parts of the country.  I know that as far as the Erne is concerned leasing boats is a thriving industry.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the VAT increase of 10 per cent on new houses <Col N="1676" /> from 1 May.  I do not know if there is any point in appealing to the Minister to do something about that at this stage nor do I know what the thinking was in the Department but it is not too much of an exaggeration to say that the industry is in the throes of death.  Many firms have gone out of business and what the Government have done is inexplicable.  I hope that reason will prevail.</P>
    <P>The question of a bank levy is always a difficult one.  In a sense it is illogical to say that we will take so much from them. There is a modification of the method in this year's Finance Bill but it is very difficult to maintain that there should not be some money taken from the profits made by the banks.  It is easy to attack and criticise the banks.  Many people have had their legitimate transactions hammered by the banks.  I would hate to think that anyone would be afraid to criticise the banking institutions.  However it is important to have a banking business in which the public have trust.  The ICI debacle did not help in this regard.</P>
    <P>Years and years ago, a distinguished Deputy, Deputy Frank Aiken, was convinced that the Government should be in a position to demand financial facilities for industry, whether farming or manufacturing, at a fixed low rate of interest. Most of the arguments he advanced then would hold good today.  At the time he was arguing, in the thirties, I am sure the profits the banks made in a world which was severely depressed were invested somewhere else to develop other countries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased for two reasons with section 56.  This deals with the voluntary transfers of agricultural property to young farmers who hold certain training qualifications.  There is a dual aspect worthy of commendation in this.  First of all, there is the emphasis on educational training.  This provision will encourage people to avail of whatever agricultural education is available to them in their own localities.  I believe the pressure for places in agricultural colleges is very strong and I am delighted to hear that. ACOT are doing a good job in that respect. They put together educational <Col N="1677" /> packages which young people working on farms could avail of.  Suggestions have been made that any money made available for development should only be made where certain educational courses have been followed by the young farmers or certain certificates or diplomas received.  That would provide a great impetus to young farmers to avail of agricultural education.  I understand from educationalists in the agricultural field that they are hardly able to cope with all the demands they have received.  Voluntary organisations, particularly Macra na Feirme, did a great job in educating young farmers.  Now we have formal education encouraged through section 56.  Lending institutions will look with more favour on a young man with agricultural education when he seeks loan facilities.</P>
    <P>Section 58 will get support from all sides of the House.  Those of us who run clinics know that people who could not by any stretch of the English language be considered wealthy could suffer as a result of a severe inheritance tax on the passage of a farm from husband to wife or wife to husband as a result of death.</P>
    <P>There was a new attack from various quarters on the provisions of section 59. That section makes provision for a special insurance policy to cover inheritance tax arising on death.  If those who have strong objections to it could spell out the reasons for them I would be interested to hear them.  I am not saying the objections are not there but I do not understand them. There is no income tax relief for the person paying the insurance policy.  If there was it could be argued that the State was subsidising an individual so that he would avoid having to pay the tax himself. The State does not lose with regard to the actual amount of tax because the insurance policy covers that.  I do not think even a strong ideologist of whatever hue could logically attack that provision.</P>
    <P>In section 66 there is provision for the purchase of shares by the Minister for Finance in Bord Telecom in addition to what is provided for in section 22 of the 1983 Act.  I am more than disappointed at the <Col N="1678" /> attitude of the Government and the Minister for Communications to the management of An Bord Telecom.  I put it on the record that the action which led to the withdrawal of Mr. Byrnes, the chief executive, from Bord Telecom should be condemned by the House.  I had the privilege of hammering out most of the arrangements with the chairman and chief executive prior to the 1983 Act going through the House.  They were a unique team, a unique combination. They had flair.  They had a commitment. The chairman gave his time with no benefit to himself.  I thought the least a Minister might do was to preserve that team and see them over the next four or five years for the benefit of the country.</P>
    <P>I will now come to the tax free Government securities section.  I think it is section 67.  I have some doubts about this whole provision.  It is somewhat of a gamble.  It is difficult to talk about it because nobody will know how it will work out until it has been in existence for some time.  In this House we debated the black hole syndrome for long enough. The Minister for Finance was very reluctant to admit there was any such thing until finally Deputy O'Kennedy and outside commentators indicated to him that it did exist, that it was there and that it was serious.</P>
    <P>People who were encouraged to come here and set up industries were told they were free to repatriate their profits. Therefore, we have no legitimate grouse if they did just that.  There is an obligation on the Government to see to it that the conditions exist for investment, either further investment in the industry concerned, or in an allied one, or in a different industry, which will lure and entice those people to keep the money invested here.  The Minister has promised tax freedom on Government securities provided that the companies are wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign companies.  He said yesterday that interest has already been shown in the scheme.  He was not able to tell us very much about what the actual conditions will be.</P>
    <P>We are glad these companies have come here and started industries and <Col N="1679" /> employed people, but we should not be unmindful of the fact that they got very substantial incentives to do that.  When we are providing this opportunity for them to invest, I hope the investment will rate the title of productive investment. We want to be very careful.  We do not want them to have the money and the bun when the whole operation is over.  I suggest that the Minister is attempting to cope with part of the black hole.  I spoke already about the part of it which affects my own constituency, namely, the money going out across the Border.</P>
    <P>This is another aspect of it.  If this is not successful &mdash; and the touchstones, the yardstick of success I would apply is whether the economy is benefiting substantially &mdash; I would cut it out.  I would give it a try and if it does not work out to the benefit of the economy in a way that satisfies the people who created the idea, I would cut it and cut it fast.</P>
    <P>When the Government were campaigning for office, as was their right, and when they were entrusted with the Government of the country, they told us they would get rid of the large budget deficit.  In my opinion the public were conned in this regard.  Figures given in the House yesterday indicated that there have been no major tax reductions. People are suffering from tax more than ever before.  If it were a question of employment or unemployment I would opt for employment even when it is severely taxed.  I would be traitorous to the whole society in which I grew up if I did not maintain that.  Some people are suffering very severely because of the heavy burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Miriam Hederman-O'Brien income tax tribunal results have never been debated in this House.  The Minister talked about growing confidence in the economy and said that the first phase of the recession has been passed.  He must be joking.  That is codology.  I suppose he has to keep up some kind of a front but that is the greatest of nonsense.  The US boom is petering out.  We did not even gain from it.  We exported chemical, engineering, electronics <Col N="1680" /> and office equipment.  We did very well there, but it has not resulted in increased jobs.  There is no return of confidence. Most of the world's economists think that, with the huge deficit in the United States, that whole economy is in a very coddlesome position.  Admittedly if the dollar flops a bit we will probably gain because we have borrowed so much in US dollars.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very intelligent man so he must be bluffing.  He must know that to say the worst phase of the recession has been passed or that there is a growing confidence is wishful thinking.  I have not met that animal for a long time, Mr. Growing Confidence.  The Minister gave himself a way out of the question of a second budget.  He said the required steps would be taken.  It reminds one of the joke about the policeman &mdash; long steps there will be if there is a necessity for a second budget.</P>
    <P>We have had declining employment and yet the income tax burden has increased by £2,191 million since 1982. This means the burden is much heavier on those who are actually paying tax.  Our foreign debts have almost doubled in that time.  We know about the debacle about interest rates in the fall of last year because the Minister scooped up all the money available for governmental purposes. Pressure came on interest rates and unfortunate devils who had borrowed modest sums for their own productive purposes suffered accordingly. We had a drop in rates and hopefully they will drop still further.</P>
    <P>We should be proud of our workers. They have done their job, particularly in the field I have mentioned and their productivity has been high.  I am tired of people challenging our productivity record.  I have already read into the records of this House comparative figures for other countries and we have nothing to be ashamed of.  I also read into the record details on various other matters as well, such as absenteeism.  We should always look at the general scene before we castigate our own.</P>
    <P>Exports have increased all right but that is in a special field and the labour intensive <Col N="1681" /> industries have been suffering very badly.  We will have to be conscious of that.  As all the studies indicate, unemployment is the big problem.  The NESC report simply says: &ldquo;On the debt side unemployment, which in the Council's view is the indicator of paramount importance, continued to rise and stood at 16.7 per cent of the labour force in December 1984&rdquo;.  There has been a little lift in the most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office.  I hope that trend will continue, but I am not all that optimistic about it.</P>
    <P>We have been speaking about money going out of the country.  The rate of investment is going down, also.  It is sad, in the context of unemployment and my mention of the Border areas, that the Minister has to put 181.1p duty on a gallon of petrol.  It is terrifying and is inhibiting any kind of development.</P>
    <P>We made a strong effort to provide education and training over a number of years.  In our wisdom, we told young people to learn a trade.  All kinds of pundits told young people to be aware of academic studies and to get into electronics, to get a trade.  We have at present almost 50,000 skilled people in the construction industry without jobs.  I know for a fact that many of the graduates of the national institutes for higher education, the colleges of technology, not to mention the universities, who have degrees and diplomas in electronics and in computer science are surreptitiously crawling away to New York and Boston. That is a fact that cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>One of the old chestnuts as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, which was scrambled out of the fire or love nest or whatever Deputy Sheehan was talking about, was the national debt.  I do not have to repeat the figures given here in the House of this Government's performance, which give us pause.</P>
    <P>We had a report from the ERSI about the incidence of pay-related social insurance and people being made to pay 8.3 per cent of their wages, even if they have not enough income to pay income tax.  It would not be a bad idea for the Minister to consider giving special income tax <Col N="1682" /> allowances for the workers who are involved in export industries whose productivity is high.  There would be an outcry against it and we would probably be told that it would be difficult to administer, but it is not too difficult to pinpoint the factories that are producing for export as of now.  We have given relief to the exporters, in fact, what they export is created by the workforce.  It would be a very healthy thing in our economy if we had people clamouring to get jobs in industries that export a great deal, to the benefit of our economy.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about work incentives. One is in a very delicate area in talking about wages of a certain level, if unemployment assistance, plus allowances with regard to local authority rents, plus some allowances for fuel, would leave a worker better off than if he were working at a low rate of wage.  I know that it is difficult to make comparisons between one economy and another and sometimes not very illuminating because circumstances are so different, but if we want to be positive in our approach to something like the Finance Bill we could ask the Minister to have a look at what a neighbouring Chancellor did with regard to workers.  If a firm in the UK are employing someone at £30,000 per annum, there is a £1,700 impost on that person and those under £130 per week are cheaper to employ.  That is two-fifths of the total workforce in the UK.  Those over £265 per week are much more expensive to employ.  There should be an argument for the Minister for Finance here to cut out PRSI on all wages under a certain figure.  I do not think that in the end he would lose very much by it.  It is something that we should think of as a possibility.</P>
    <P>The pay-related social insurance contribution made by the worker is another form of income tax.  What is the difference? It is money taken out of his pocket. As far as the employer is concerned, it is a kind of payrole tax on him.  He has extra money to pay on each person he employs, so that if it were removed below a certain figure &mdash; although there might be certain dangers in this &mdash; there would <Col N="1683" /> be an incentive for the employer to employ and for the employee to seek out the job.  The ESRI report published in today's newspapers has some relevant remarks in regard to that.</P>
    <P>We could also consider &mdash; and I have no statistics on it at the moment &mdash; the cost of our taxes.  I have a figure from <i>The Economist</i> which indicates the price of taxes in the neighbouring country.  The land tax is collected at a very high cost; income tax is next highest; customs duties next highest after that; capital transfer tax next after that; capital gains after that.  Pay-as-you-earn has a low cost as distinct from income tax in general, because it is easy enough to collect.  The employer passes it on, or should pass it on.  Corporation tax has a low cost and also VAT, for the same reason.  Fuel and tobacco taxes have a very low cost, indeed.  Again, this is an area that we could study, to see how our economy could gain by that.</P>
    <P>We can be proud of our entrepreneurs and workers in that manufacturing output has gone up, including agricultural output.  I do not think it is appreciated by the people in general how important agriculture is to the economy.  I remember getting a shock at a press conference called to outline policies with regard to agriculture and other areas of Government when it transpired that not one single question was asked with regard to agriculture which I regard as the premier industry in our economy.  There is a blindness with regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Since 1973 agricultural output has increased by leaps and bounds and even before that farmers had increased productivity. We have run into trouble with regard to milk production but that should not blind us to the fact that it is better to be in that position than to be the sick man of Europe, not able to produce at all or producing half of the amount we should produce.  Obviously we are not producing all that we should produce but generally farmers deserve credit in the matter of productivity and output.</P>
    <P>Consumer spending is down according to all indicators and investment also is <Col N="1684" /> down.  In 1984 the major items exported were chemicals, metals, engineering and office machines.  These are highly commendable but there has been no visible result with regard to employment.  I hope the Minister will resist any temptation to put pressure again, as he did last year, on the money market and thus cause interest rates to increase</P>
    <P>Manufacturing industry has always been regarded as the area where employment could be increased and wealth created. We will have to have another look at that area because the type of manufacturing industry on which that judgment was based has changed considerably in the recent past.  In the United States the employment figures in the services industry are simply amazing when one compares them with the figures for manufacturing industry.  They are way ahead of manufacturing industry and there may be a lesson for us there.  Perhaps we could concentrate on that area.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions when I spoke on the Finance Bill I mentioned our difficulties since the breakdown of the major international monetary arrangement made after the last war.  Even if we had the best experts in the world in the Department of Finance and if we had the top Minister for Finance in the world, the whole matter of international exchange could impoverish us even though we were working hard and making the right decisions. For that reason I advocated that the Minister for Finance in all the councils to which he belongs should push either for the ECU or some other Euro reserve currency.  For example, he should push for the ECU as a petro-currency.  We have to pay for every gallon in US dollars and thus action taken by Mr. Volcker can cause us to pay more for our petrol.  I know that the Ministers for Finance of the Ten were to meet in Palermo in mid-April and one of the matters on the agenda was the position of the ECU.  The idea was to enhance the ECU as a reserve asset.  There are difficulties.  The biggest difficulty is that the United Kingdom did not join the European Monetary System. Some people say they are having second thoughts but I do not know if that is so. <Col N="1685" /> Of course there is a strong link between Washington and London on financial matters and that may be the reason they stayed out in the first instance.  The Federal Republic of Germany is a little cautious about advancing the ECU to the status of reserve currency.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to indicate if any progress has been made as a result of the meeting which I presume took place at Palermo in mid-April.  They intended to increase the interest rates on ECUs held by the various central banks and to encourage its use in the interventions that have to be made from time to time to keep the currencies within the 2.25 or 2.5 band which is the essence of the EMS.  They were also to consider if they would allow non-EC banks to hold ECUs.  Until that matter is regularised we will be at the mercy of something we cannot control.  The dollar and the yen are reserve currencies.  If we had a Euro reserve currency we would be to a greater extent masters in our own house.  Sometimes this is interpreted as an anti-American attitude.  It is not.  It is simply looking after our own shop.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill should be used as a weapon to attack the large pool of unemployed, both skilled and unskilled, but that is not the case.  The problem is the provision of jobs.  In the first place the Government and in the second place this House will be judged on our ability to face up to this problem.  It is sad to see rural villages and parishes being denuded of young people who were trained perhaps at the RTC, at NIHE or at university. One asks where is John Brady and one is told he qualified as a plumber, that he did his course at RTC and has gone to the United States.  He is better equipped to emigrate than many of his forefathers but there is plenty of work for him here and there is plenty of potential for development.</P>
    <P>Despite some of the statements in the White Paper on Industrial Development, I hope that during the year the Minister for Finance will address himself to this problem.  If he does not he should move over and let somebody else do the job.</P>
    <Col N="1686" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Having spoken in the budget debate on a number of general taxation points I should like, in this contribution, to zone in on a number of areas warranting attention by the Minister and the Government and on some of the things I should like to see included in this Bill.  In doing so, I support the Bill.  While some of its provisions merely give effect to budgetary decisions they are innovative and deserving of support.</P>
      <P>I should like to speak principally about value-added tax.  I think it is correct to say that it is our second largest revenue earner, after income tax, and that many consumers are not aware of the difficulties of the value-added code.  That code was the subject of reform in this year's budget when the number of rates were reduced from six to three but, at the same time, many opportunities were lost.</P>
      <P>One can view VAT from the singular point of view of the cross-Border situation outlined by Deputy Wilson, but one must dig considerably deeper to appreciate the real difficulties of the VAT code. The whole tax collection system for VAT is done by people who are not employed by the local inspector of taxes, by the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners but who have to do so simply because they buy and sell goods. The amount of paperwork undertaken by retailers, for which they get no recognition, is simply unfair.  It is equivalent to asking some of the Revenue Commissioners' officials to work for nothing.</P>
      <P>When turnover tax was introduced, as a precursor of value-added tax, there was a credit allowed for those people who administered the VAT collection system. That was abolished.  It should be replaced by a £500 credit, principally against one's net VAT payments.  People make VAT returns every two months when, if one is in a payment situation, one submits the returns and the cheque along with them. At the end of the year there should be a system under which one would receive a credit of £500 against one's net VAT position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second area relating to VAT is at the point of entry.  VAT at the point of entry cheque system is unique <i>vis-à-vis</i><Col N="1687" /> the payment of any other type of tax in this country.  One does not merely write a cheque, one must go along to one's bank manager and pay in the form of a guaranteed cheque, in that it constitutes a continuous drain on one's overdraft accommodation and one never sees that money.  This causes many cash flow difficulties for firms.  At a cost of £190 million, while I realise that VAT at the point of entry cannot be repealed, nonetheless it is necessary to abolish the guaranteed cheque system, replacing it with a normal VAT payment system whereby instead one would pay the cheque on the due date every two months.  If one defaulted in that payment then one would have to give the guaranteed cheque thereafter.</P>
    <P>In Belgium they have a novel system of exempting the whole of the retail trade from the keeping of VAT returns.  They did so through the introduction of an equalisation tax.  Let us suppose here that Deputy Wilson was an electrical retailer. He buys a radio from a manufacturer or wholesaler for which he pays £10.  If he sells that radio at £20 he would be subject to a VAT invoice for the purchase of £10 and would have to charge VAT to the customer on his margin.  Therefore the retailer's margin is liable to VAT.  In Belgium they introduced a system whereby retailers were placed in the same position as the consumer.  This means that when the retailer goes to the wholesaler or manufacturer and purchases the radio, that is the last point at which VAT is paid.  If it were 10 per cent VAT it would be increased to 12 per cent to compensate the Government for the loss but there would be no bookkeeping involved in the retailer's margin because that margin would not be liable.  Therefore, the position that the consumer is in now would be the position of the retailer, at no cost to the Exchequer whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The wholesaler or manufacturer collects all the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  It would operate as a sales tax at that point in the same way as it operates as a sales tax to the <Col N="1688" /> retailer now.  The rate could be raised to compensate the Government for the loss of the retailer's margin being liable to VAT, constituting a cost effective method.  One of its effects would be to render a lot of VAT inspectors redundant. That is probably one of the vested reasons it has not been followed up.</P>
      <P>In relation to value-added tax reform the Minister introduced three rates, 23 per cent, 10 per cent and zero.  There is also a 2.2 per cent rate for farmers' refunds increased by .2 per cent.  I believe the Revenue Commissioners got it slightly wrong.  There should be three rates of value-added tax instead of six to simplify the code; we would all agree with that but it must be remembered that, for every rate, every business person must keep another column of accounts.  The difficulty is that there are basically three types of goods one can buy.  The first are luxury items, such as a fur coat or a glorious hi-fi set, the second ordinary standard or basic goods and the third pertains to services whether that be a house, a plumbing service or a contracting service of any kind.  Those are the three categories of goods and there should be three ranges of rates for them. The Minister simply adjusted the 5 per cent rate up to 10 per cent and reduced the 35 per cent rate to 23 per cent.  One can fiddle the rates so that one gets the same yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crucial rate warranting examination is the service one which has a labour content, whether it applies to a motor mechanic, the building of a house, any type of service, say, the repair of a television set or whatever.  Here there is a black economy factor.  The service rate was 3 per cent, it was increased to 5 per cent and has now gone to 10 per cent and that is the rate that will be added on to the cost of legitimate tax paid labour. The black economy operator does not have to pay VAT on his labour because he is not registered for tax.  What is needed is to maintain the service rate of VAT as low as humanly possible and switch the VAT to the parts that the motor mechanic buys, the parts used by the television repair man, and by the <Col N="1689" /> agricultural contractor for the tractor he buys.  It should be remembered that the nixer will have to buy those components anyway, which will oblige him to be registered for VAT.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognised all of these arguments when he reduced VAT for the motor trade in relation to labour on motor mechanical repairs to 5 per cent but, because it has been rationalised to three rates, it slipped up again to 10 per cent.  If we are to look after small businesses, legitimate employment &mdash; who are paying for everything through the nose, everything being above board and declared &mdash; then one must realise that one may have to introduce new items, food or whatever, into the VAT net, or maintain a high rate for luxury items.  But whatever one does or does not do one must be aware of the uncompetitive position of the people who obey the law.  One might take an agricultural contractor as an example, or anybody else providing a service.  There are agricultural contractors competing with people who will never pay a penny tax.  If they charge a farmer for cutting ten acres of silage or corn they will find they will have less take home pay and are charging the farmer more because the Government get the difference.  That is simply unfair and penalises the people honest enough to register for tax.</P>
    <P>If one wanted to create jobs in relation to VAT there is one area that should be examined, that is the imposition of VAT at 23 per cent on meals.  VAT on meals is unique.  Anybody else who is in the VAT business is subject to VAT on everything that comes in and everything that goes out.  But in the case of meals food is not registered for VAT; only the paper napkins are registered for VAT. Suppose I am an restauranteur and you, a Cheann Comhairle, are another restauranteur. Let us suppose that we are in intense competition in the same high street and we charge £5 for a two course lunch &mdash; which is the most we can get for it &mdash; when we must pay 23 per cent out of that.  It is not the case that we bought, say, tomatoes, potatoes or bread, paid 23 per cent VAT on our inputs and merely <Col N="1690" /> passed it on to the consumer; it comes out of the restauranteur's margin which is unique in the operation of VAT and is simply unfair.  In this instance VAT operates punitively as a sales tax and, given that it is labour-intensive, warrants a change.</P>
    <P>The position at present is farcical because if one goes into a fast food outlet, say, McDonalds in Dún Laoghaire they will ask: are you eating the food on the premises or are you taking it away?  If you take the food away you do not pay any VAT at all while, if you eat it on the premises, you must pay VAT.  Therefore the more jobs created in cleaning up the tables and working in the restaurant the more they must suffer the penalty.  I believe that all fast food outlets should be liable to VAT.  It should be done in such a way that the cost of reducing VAT from 23 per cent to 10 per cent on meals in restaurants &mdash; which I understand to be £26 million &mdash; would be offset completely by introducing VAT on take-away sales.  They have done so successfully in the United Kingdom.  Obviously there are direct employment factors and a tourism factor which generates external incomes.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that Deputy Wilson, as Opposition spokesman for Transport, did not refer to the unusual position of VAT on transport.  We have CIE who provide the national transport service; we have many coach tour operators and many people operating a scheduled service for school bus routes; we have car rental operators, taxi drivers and so on.  We are unique in Europe in that anyone who operates in the transport area is exempt from VAT.  If I take a ride in a taxi or a bus I think I am not paying VAT whereas the fact is that I am.  If one is engaged in the transport business one cannot register for VAT though one pays VAT at a very high rate on one's car, bus, parts and petrol.  One cannot reclaim that VAT because one cannot register for VAT because one is allegedly exempt.  Therefore one cannot charge one's passengers the VAT.  The Commission on Taxation examined this from the point of view of CIE and recommended that VAT on <Col N="1691" /> transport be introduced.  This was a very important recommendation.  The Commission on Taxation estimated that the contribution that CIE already make in VAT is about £7 million to £8 million. That is the refund they could have got if they could have registered for VAT. Passenger fares in public and private transport costs involve a VAT content. If VAT at 10 per cent were introduced on transport the customer might think that an extra 10 per cent was being slapped on but this would not be the case because customers are already paying a VAT content.  The effect of introducing a 10 per cent VAT rate would be that such people as car rental operators and coach tour operators who are being decimated by UK operators in the tourism context, would survive.  At the moment we have an ironic situation in that if I am living in the US and want to take a holiday in Ireland and rent a car to travel around, or if I want to take a coach tour to Ireland, it would be cheaper to take a flight to London and book a car or coach tour holiday from London.  The difference between the car rental and the coach tour prices in Ireland and the UK can be explained by the difference in excise duty and VAT.  If we want to create jobs in tourism we must make transport no longer exempt from VAT.  We should charge 10 per cent and allow the operators to claim VAT on their input as they do in every other European country.  This is one area which needs urgent attention.</P>
    <P>In relation to income tax, last summer, the Joint Committee on Small Businesses had the Revenue Commissioners sitting where Deputy Wilson is now sitting and we asked them questions about tax evasion and the black economy.  They outlined their difficulties in collecting tax.  In relation to the tax collection system, one of the points made was that in 1983 they issued to county registrars and county sheriffs 97,000 certificates for the collections of arrears of tax and they said that they could have issued far more through the legal system but for the fact that it was totally jammed up.</P>
    <Col N="1692" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of them were pseudo ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The 97,000 certificates have worked their way through the system. That was the last resort of appeal, that was not assessment.  The reality is that schedule D tax collection is not working. We must look at another method.  I studied the system in the United States based on the self-assessment system of income tax where a person calculates his income calculating the first few thousand pounds at the 35 per cent tax band and the next few thousand at the 48 per cent tax band and then he submits a cheque with his returns and if he deliberately misled the authorities he would get a very rough ride.  This automatically frees the system of assessment and all the machinations of the Collector General's Office.  The Revenue Commissioners could pilot a self-assessment system here, perhaps for one profession or in one tax area to see if it will work.  I am very sceptical about the vested interests of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to employment but if we asked them about this scheme they would say that it would not work because the Irish character is so malicious, devious, cute and cunning that any opportunity to avoid tax will willingly be grasped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>So that is where they got all those qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have no evidence of this.  There is already an administrative track record within the United States for this to work and the system could be piloted in many ways.  If the people involved in the pilot scheme co-operated and submitted their forms and a cheque for it, it would free the system to deal with the real tax evaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an anomaly as regards the self-employed. A shop keeper could set up a company and the company could employ him and he could draw a salary from that company but he would not benefit from the £600 PAYE allowance.  Alternatively <Col N="1693" /> if a shopkeeper employs his son or daughter they will not have the benefit of the £600 PAYE allowance.  I am not talking about people who are self-employed but about people employed under the PAYE system.  If these people are unlucky enough to be a blood relation of the employer, or if they are a corporate employee of their own company, they do not benefit from this allowance.  This is not a question of tax evasion and the anomaly should be cleared up immediately.</P>
    <P>In relation to income tax, opportunities have been missed as regards employment creation.  There is no doubt that even in the best possible situation, given the percentage of young people here, there will not be enough jobs for those seeking work.  A reasonable scenario for employment is to distribute the existing workload. That can be done in two ways.  It may be said that if those who retire now at 65 or 66 years of age retired at 55 or 56 years of age it would create on a once off basis 10,000 jobs straight away. Apparently that cannot be done because the cost of pensions is too high.  However, it must be remembered that many of those people would be entitled to early retirement pensions either through superannuation, Irish Life pensions or pensions to which they contributed.  I suggest that the age exemption limits in the income tax code be brought down to 55 years of age.  We could tell people that if they retire at that age they will not be taxed as heavily on their pension as they would be if they waited until 65 years of age to retire.  That would be an innovative way to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The tax system can be used in another way to create jobs &mdash; this can apply in particular in the public sector &mdash; through job sharing and splitting jobs.  Many married women become unemployed because they cannot remain full time at work but if they split the work, the wages, the hours and the tax they would be able to do so.  A difficulty with the operation of the tax free allowances is that it will not necessarily pay them to do that.  I would like to see an additional tax free <Col N="1694" /> allowance being granted to those people who make the sacrifice in the national interest of splitting their job with somebody else.  Those people would then have a better take home pay.  It would be reasonably cost-effective and a lot cheaper than paying part of the £11 million we spend every week on the dole.</P>
    <P>In regard to corporation tax and jobs, I must point out that there is a mechanism for manufacturing industry whereby they get £10 per week relief for each extra employee.  In other words, they receive £500 per year against their corporation tax liability for each employee they hold on to for a year.  As Deputy Wilson said, the common experience in the United States has been that the job growth will be in the service sector, in the personal service sector.  Our tax system must take account of that.  An employer or a business in the service sector must be able to obtain the same corporation tax relief for new employees as the manufacturing sector.  In other words, if a shopkeeper, a hotelier or a publican takes on an extra person off the dole, whatever about the employment incentive scheme, they will get £10 per week off the corporation tax bill of the company.  It is not tax dodging; it is an incentive to recruit people off the dole.</P>
    <P>The whole area of capital allowances needs to be looked at.  We must look at the rate at which one can depreciate fixed assets, a building or a machine.  There are some gross anomalies in this regard. A farmer who builds a farm shed or cow byre gets depreciation of 30 per cent per annum on those buildings.  A garage proprietor who buys a forklift truck gets depreciation on that equipment but a grocer who renovates his premises or builds an extension is not allowed to claim one penny of that against tax.  If the grocer borrows the money the interest paid on it is allowed against tax.  We have an anomalous situation between different sectors as regards capital allowances and there are anomalies in the way some businesses are competing with UK concerns and the operation of capital allowances. For example, a taxi driver can only depreciate his car by 20 per cent per annum. <Col N="1695" /> In other words, his vehicle is supposed to last five years.  Any taxi driver will say that a vehicle will not last five years.  In Britain there is a 100 per cent capital allowance in the first year.  Given the deplorable state of our finances I would not go that far but I would allow the special licence plate holders, the tourist operators, those involved in coach tours and car rentals exclusively for tourists, a special 100 per cent capital allowance in the first year.</P>
    <P>In regard to capital acquisitions tax there is an appalling anomalous situation. Section 58 deals with the abolition of an estate duty on transfers from husband to wife but an appalling anomaly still exists. I should like to refer to the position of a farmer who sells his property and buys a bigger farm.  If that person does the decent thing and puts it in his wife's and in his own name he does not get roll-over relief on what he sold the first farm for. The fact that there is joint ownership of the second property means that only 50 per cent roll-over relief is granted.  There is a glaring anomoly there.  One would think that the roll-over relief should apply where a person puts the new property in joint ownership.  For all capital tax purposes the measure in section 58 should be taken as the path to travel on with husbands and wives being treated as one.</P>
    <P>There is also a difficulty in regard to capital acquisitions tax.  Land prices reached a high pinnacle in the late seventies but prices have dropped from £3,000 per acre to £1,000 per acre.  It is totally unfair that on property transfers now one should pay tax on a totally artificial land value that is unsustainable.  I would like to see some mechanism introduced through the Valuation Office whereby current land values would be taken.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Bill there is a switch in emphasis from the Revenue Commissioners and the legal status they have to the local inspector of taxes for the various tax collection systems.  I welcome that. When the Joint Committee on Small Business were carrying out a study on <Col N="1696" /> the black economy the members found it incredible that a known tax dodger in difficulty with corporation tax would not be known to those who were looking after his VAT books, his P35 returns for employees' PAYE or PRSI.  Those officials did not know each other.  With the exception of the special investigation branch there was no central mechanism to deal with such problems.  The new move is obviously a way to simplify certain arrangements and I hope there will be some mechanism at the inspector of taxes level to combine the different types of tax an enterprise has to pay.  I hope there will be a better cross communication system within the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 14(3) amends the Finance Act, 1969.  The change means that if one has a thoroughbred stallion one is free of income tax if one operates in Ireland. The section in effect says that if one has a stallion located in Newmarket or Longchamps one will not benefit from that concession but it is a great pity that the Minister did not use this opportunity to deal with a glaring anomaly.  If one leases a stallion from Bord na gCapall and it generates an income from stud fees one does not benefit from the exemption under the income tax code.  Small farmers with two or three mares may lease a stallion from Bord na gCapall.  We must remember the importance of those small breeders to the country.</P>
    <P>We must remember their financial position as against that of such people as Robert Sangster.  It is anomalous that they should not benefit from income tax exemption on stud fees.  The Minister might look at section 14 on Committee Stage and at the anomaly whereby people leasing stallions from a State board cannot benefit through half-breds.  It is very unfair.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly exists in relation to the building industry and the subcontractors' tax certificates.  A main contractor for the building of, say, a school may employ an electrical subcontractor.  In order to pay the latter he must produce <Col N="1697" /> a C2 tax certificate.  If the electrical subcontractor cannot do so, the main contractor must deduct 35 per cent of the money due to him.  This is reasonable because it helps to stamp out the black economy.  However, the subcontractor may encounter a contrary inspector of taxes when he applies for his C2 form and could experience various delays.  My complaint is that this is the only aspect of the tax collection system where there is no appeal mechanism.  People who have been refused this C2 certificate should have a right of appeal because often there can be administrative errors.</P>
    <P>The Minister might clarify the business expansion scheme introduced under the 1984 Act which has been operational since 1 January this year.  The basis of the scheme is the allowance of £25,000 free of income tax for individual taxpayers who invest in certain funds which provide low risk capital equity for manufacturing firms.  I have no doubt that the scheme will be successful.  There is a great lack of equity base in small indigenous firms. There is also the problem of the debt-equity ratio.  There have been problems with this business expansion scheme.  The operating expenses which the administrators of these funds can charge are absolutely minimal &mdash; 3 per cent or 5 per cent. This needs to be amended.  I am not sure if there is such provision in this Finance Bill.  The scheme is designed to get private funds into small businesses in the form of equity.</P>
    <P>In section 67 new securities are being introduced in relation to multinational profits.  During the rumpus about the black hole everybody missed the point. It is not a matter of knocking multinationals. They come here on a certain understanding and they are perfectly entitled to send their profits back home.  There should be no problem about that.  The lesson is that if we support small Irish industry they cannot repatriate their profits abroad but must keep them at home.  Therefore they are worth far more to the Irish economy and deserve preferential treatment.  If gilts are to be established through these funds in much the same way as any investor can invest in <Col N="1698" /> Government securities and bonds tax free, the Minister should specifically ensure that the proceeds of these funds should not go into the general Revenue pool but should specifically go towards providing equity finance for indigenous business.  Multinational companies such as Digital and Wang have a stream of middle management who can set up small industries on their own.  Many of the parent companies are only too delighted to help them.  They see it as part of their contribution to Ireland's development. They set up the front-runner in computer software and there will be spin-offs in research and development.  I would like to see the proceeds going to an equity fund for small businesses.  There would be a far better reaction from multinational companies if we said that the funds were to be earmarked for a specific purpose.</P>
    <P>Lurking behind this Bill is the question of land tax.  There may be people in Dublin, Cork and other areas who are convinced that there is some crock of gold among farmers who are not paying their contributions.  Various figures can be quoted such as their contribution of £35 million in income tax out of a total income tax receipt of £2,000 million.  One could say that agricultural incomes amount to about £900 million and that farmers are not paying their fair share, that they are mean and selfish.  The fact is that there is not a crock of gold out there.  I do not say this out of love for farmers; it is simply a statement of fact. They do not have the advantages of limited liability and they are exposed to everything from climate to being unsecured creditors.  I will be supporting the land tax in principle.  It has advantages as a replacement to the PLV system of rates and adjusted acreage is fair.</P>
    <P>There are two points I would make which I should like the officials of the Department of Finance to note before they ride rough-shod into a wilderness. The rate of tax to be paid has been set at £10 per adjusted acre. if the rate of increase is linked to inflation they will be walking a very dangerous road.  As we saw in the late seventies, high inflation can mean low farmers' incomes because <Col N="1699" /> the increase in what they are obtaining for their produce does not match inflation.  They bear the cost and are caught in a cost-price squeeze.  A high rate of inflation does not guarantee a high rate of increase in farm income.  I should like to see a three-year moratorium on any increase from £10 until it is fully operational.  A farmer with 100 acres might say that the land tax was costing him one thousand gallons of milk.  It could be linked in such a way that in ten years time he would be paying the then equivalent of 1,000 gallons of milk.  Alternatively it could be linked to real farm income increases or decreases as determined by An Foras Talúntais.  There must be some mechanism which relates to the farmers' ability to pay.</P>
    <P>A farmer who has 60 cows could be destroyed overnight by the loss of 40 of those cows through brucellosis.  There is no way he can get compensation.  He may have a huge family but the land tax takes no account of that.  He may have 70 acres but owe £120,000 to the ACC and the Bank of Ireland.  There are various cases of genuine hardship.  There should be some single mechanism for mitigation of land tax payments.  In other words, if a farmer can obtain from his local inspector of taxes a certificate to the effect that because of brucellosis or because of unusual family circumstances or because of huge borrowings, his tax liability should be nil and if after the Revenue Commissioners have decided that no tax is payable that farmer could then present that certificate to the local authority and have his land tax bill mitigated.  Those are the two areas I urge the Minister to take note of when the land tax Bill is being prepared.  We accept the principle of a land tax and all it entails but essential ingredients of it must be the rate of increase factor and some single mechanism to deal with hardship cases.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the operation of the Collector General's office.  There are some very understanding and reasonable people in that office but for every understanding person one will always find another who is not so understanding. <Col N="1700" /> Many of the cases with which the Collector General must deal relate to companies who are in arrears in respect of tax.  I am not condoning the late payment of tax because such a policy would involve unfair competition in so far as those who pay on time are concerned, but there is inconsistency and a lack of uniformity in the collection of tax arrears.</P>
    <P>I know of one construction firm who in the years 1980, 1981 and 1982 paid about £200,000 in tax but who in each case were three months late in making the payments.  The company are being pursued and vilified in respect of every penny due by way of interest for the three months during which the payments were late in each case.  It is unfair that slightly delayed payments should be dealt with in this way while there are some who are grossly abusing the system by way of not paying their tax.  The people I am talking about are in the white economy.  They are paying their taxes, but because of a cash flow difficulty in the construction sector they were three months late with their payments.  Very often the Office of Public Works and other State institutions, too, are much later than three months in terms of payments while refunds from some tax offices are very often delayed for some time.  The Revenue Commissioners should be allowed use their discretion in the application of interest penalties.</P>
    <P>So far as the Collector General's office is concerned, there is preferential status in respect of the tax arrears of a company. One might argue that if the situation were otherwise the Revenue Commissioners would not be paid in many cases.  However, one can argue also that because the Revenue Commissioners know that in the event of a company going to the wall they have a fair chance of being paid and that they will be paid before unsecured creditors and after the banks, they adopt a very complacent attitude.  If, say, for three weeks in succession a company fail to make returns there is no emergency system to alert the Revenue Commissioners to the possibility that that company are experiencing cash flow difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> A person taking over a company from a receiver as a going concern will not agree to pay the taxes that are due.  He will be interested only in paying for plant and machinery and in having money for raw materials.  The point I am making is that in many instances of receivership companies are not being taken over but are being allowed go to the wall as a result of the preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners.  Huge problems in relation to tax arrears are allowed develop because of the complacency of the Collector General's office.  Therefore, the preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners should be abolished.  I am not saying that tax should become negotiable but following two or three weeks of returns not being made by a company the Revenue Commissioners should move in fast, ascertain if there is a problem and, if so, reach some arrangement. The present system allows arrears to accumulate to huge amounts and this in turn leads to unemployment.</P>
    <P>The whole question of PRSI is very relevant in terms of the ERSI report published today.  I have not read the report in detail but from what I have read of it and from what I have heard of it on radio I consider it to be very selective.  It is easy to pick holes in certain aspects of the PRSI system.  Chartered accountants who trot around from conference to conference tell us that we have the lowest rates of PRSI in Europe.  That is correct, but the inequity in the system rests in the area of the employers' contribution.  An employer's PRSI contribution in respect of his employees is usually about 10 per cent of his operating surplus.  Therefore, a person in manufacturing or in business who employs 25 people pays 10 per cent of his gross profit in PRSI.  However, a person employing 100 people whether, he be in the textile industry, in the construction industry or in any other area, pays 40 per cent of his operating surplus in PRSI payments.</P>
    <P>The simple message is that the more people one employs the greater share of one's profits will have to be handed over in PRSI payments.  Consequently, one <Col N="1702" /> would minimise in so far as possible one's employment levels.  Not only do we have a State apparatus that encourages employers to utilise machinery rather than people but we have a tax system whereby the more people one employs the more tax one pays.  We have figures to indicate that in respect of the labour intensive industries: in the construction and textile industries the employer's share of PRSI is about 40 per cent of his operating surplus.  That factor is more important than the case of any one individual, having regard to the fact that employment is our biggest problem.</P>
    <P>I am relying largely on Patrick Kinsella's account on RTE of the ERSI report, though perhaps the true picture cannot emerge since he was given about 60 seconds during which to outline the contents of a report of perhaps 60 pages or more.  However, Mr. Kinsella made the point, from his reading of the report, that the PRSI system was unfair so far as the low paid worker was concerned.  This view apparently is based on the fact that people who earn more than £12,500 do not pay PRSI on the additional amount while people at the low end of the scale pay 8.3 per cent on everything they earn.</P>
    <P>There are a few points to be made in this regard.  We all know that 100 per cent of nothing is nothing.  The low paid worker who is paying 8.3 per cent of his income in PRSI is entitled to the flat rate disability and unemployment benefits while this is not the case in respect of the higher paid worker.  In addition, those earning the lower wages are entitled to far more from the social welfare fund than is paid into that fund by way of PRSI payments.  Therefore, they are not necessarily losing but, what was more unfair in relation to the comment on the report, was that specifically people earning over £12,500 per annum are not entitled to a hospital services card, they have to go to the VHI for health insurance. Perhaps that is fair in one sense in so far as they do not pay for what they do not get but it must also be remembered that if you are earning over £12,638 per annum and are single you pay 73p in every pound through PAYE and PRSI.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> In the long term, the only way to reform PRSI is to combine it with PAYE. They have done this in other countries and contributions to PAYE could be increased to compensate for the drop in PRSI.  I am not saying the Exchequer should take in less but that is a simpler and more effective system which provides the same benefits.  It also combines the social welfare and tax systems.  The employer's contribution should be abolished but should not be shifted to the employee, clearly that would be unfair. The Commission on Taxation recommended the introduction of a social security tax which means that everyone will pay 4 per cent of their income to pay for the welfare state.  It has to be paid for by someone and it should have an income distributive effect on the economy whereby you take from the people who have it and give it to those who do not in a straight social security tax.  The Commision on Taxation did not make any comment on taking in less taxation, they just recommended a simpler, more efficient way of getting in tax.  It is tragic that successive Governments have seen fit to neglect the commission's report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the black economy, the Joint Committee on Small Businesses in their second report on retail distribution, which I hope will shortly be debated in the Dáil, devoted a section to the black economy and I should like to see the numbers of the staff of the special investigation branch, which at present stands at 14 and which uncovered 23,000 operations in a period of two years, extended to 40 people.  The increase in staff is badly needed to deal with this problem.  The Revenue Commissioners should not hound people who are registered for all taxes but should concentrate on those who are evading the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and others have made suggestions in relation to tax relief and I am equally guilty in that regard but I try to be constructive.  Many people do not realise that for every pound paid in taxation of all kinds, we spend £1.20.  If you are running any kind of business on a 20 per cent deficit, there is no scope for <Col N="1704" /> tax relief.  When people talk about tax reform, they really mean tax reduction which is not feasible.  However, a case can be made for the PAYE sector.  If you want to help that sector, one way to do so is through the £600 PAYE allowance. This year, that will cost £211 million but I hope that the Government, or any future Government will not dream up a new system for helping the PAYE sector.  The means to do this are already there; if you double the allowance that would be the most effective assistance you could give. Because we are spending £1.20 for every pound paid in taxation, we must look at ways of reducing the sum of £1.20.  Of that sum, 84p goes on Departments of State.  The largest sum, 20p, is spent on the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health accounts for 16p, a sum of 12p is spent on the Department of Education and the Department of the Environment gets 9p.  The biggest single expenditure of that sum of £1.20 is 32p on paying interest debts.  In other words, if we could reduce the sum of 32p to 30p by reducing the debt, we would have exactly the right amount of money to double the PAYE allowance from £600 to £1,200.  That may sound very simple but we need to understand that the best way to help to reduce our biggest single tax collection, income tax, and the biggest sector of that, PAYE, is to reduce our expenditure and our debt service by 2p from the sum of £1.20 which I mentioned. The fundamental point is that if you want tax relief you must have cuts in public expenditure.  I support such cuts but many of the people who are so adamant about tax relief would not support such cuts.  Hypocrisy or double think is something which the electorate will see through but I hope that the Government, by their tough decisions which we support, will get down their debt service and will then be in a position to double the PAYE allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike last year's Finance Bill, there are no significant changes from the budget this year.  The Minister's speech was significant in certain respects although, in some ways, it <Col N="1705" /> says nothing.  It is mostly made up of a rehash of the explanatory memorandum. Some parts are almost exactly the same, there are just little bits added on here and there.  On page three, one thinks he is about to go on to something important when he says that this affords an opportunity for discussion on overall strategies for the economy and the public finances in particular.  We think we will hear a Government assessment from the Minister of their overall strategies for the economy but he dismisses it in about ten or 12 lines with phrases like &ldquo;we have taken a responsible approach to public finances&rdquo;, &ldquo;we have resisted the pressures to take short term initiatives&rdquo;, &ldquo;we have achieved our budget targets&rdquo; and so on and he attacked the spendthrift policies which brought all this about.  He also said that they will continue their prudent approach and that they will watch their budget targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the next paragraph he gives an opening for a mini-budget by denying that he has any intention of bringing one in at this time.  He said that there is no basis for this kind of comment and although some receipts fell short of expectation it is much too early to draw conclusions. However, should it happen that a significant overrun emerges in the course of the year, he said that the Government will take whatever steps are necessary to keep the budget in line with targets.  The steps required would obviously be a mini-budget which nowadays comes in not as a mini-budget but as Government action in the August holiday period.  This has been done by Fianna Fáil Governments in the past.  They make significant changes even in the direction of the economy without bringing in any budget or, as the Government did last August, abolish half the food subsidies.  Probably they will abolish the other half once the recess comes in July or August next.  That will be his mini budget if, as he says, a significant overrun begins to emerge.  He has promised to abolish the other half in 1986 so he can anticipate it by six months by abolishing them next August, and I think that is precisely what he has in mind.  Of course, there is a great possibility of a <Col N="1706" /> significant overrun when we see what is likely to happen in regard to the ICI affair and the possibilities of the Government having to take further action in that when we begin to understand the full extent of what might be occuring.</P>
    <P>What most annoyed me was the Minister's reference to tax reform.  He says that this budget and this Finance Bill constitute only one phase in the process of tax reform.  There is no tax reform in it.  There is some relaxation in the PAYE area, the tax bands and VAT which is welcome &mdash; anything that simplifies the tax system is welcome &mdash; but it did not reduce the amount taken from the PAYE sector, or for that matter the VAT sector, so there was no tax reform whatsoever. As he went on the mind of the Minister came out very interestingly.  He said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We still have much to do before we can be satisfied with the structure of our tax system.  We have to widen the tax base further by limiting concessions and bringing more areas of activity into the tax net.</P>
    <P>That is very interesting and I agree with him absolutely.  The nub of the whole question is to bring more areas of activity into the tax net, which not one Member of Fianna Fáil in all their criticisms of the budget suggested.  They criticised and showed all new areas of expenditure but they did not give any area of activity which they would tax to bring in further taxation.  I thought that now our Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, was facing up to this when he said, &ldquo;We will have to bring more areas of activity into the tax net&rdquo;.  He went on to indicate what we are doing:</P>
    <P>We are planning the introduction of a child benefit scheme which will unify in a single payment State support towards the cost of rearing children and tax this payment as appropriate.</P>
    <P>That is the new area of activity he proposes to bring into the tax net, not wealth or capital or property but this child benefit scheme.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> This will achieve a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the very significant level of support for children which is funded by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister introduced this into his speech because it does not come into the Finance Bill and it did not have to, but he sees this as a new area of activity that he can tax.  The whole social welfare system and in particular this child benefit scheme are designed to bring in more money from taxation.  We will resist this very strongly.  It is very interesting and seems very significant that you put together all the present forms of child support such as tax reliefs, social welfare child allowances, children's allowances and the new family income supplement and bring all that into a single payment, the child benefit, which will be about £30 a month.  That is very good and sounds great, but it will be taxable.  The significance of that changes the whole concept of what we are talking about.  As things stand with the present tax structure and the present social welfare system many lower income families, especially larger families, will be brought into the tax net if social welfare payments and child benefits are made taxable and if the tax bands and allowances are not increased very dramatically.  If they are, then possibly those people could avoid it; but if they are not increased very dramatically then the low income families, particularly larger families, will be brought into the tax net for the first time.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, if that is what the Minister is doing, the effect of increasing the child allowances and then taxing them will be that the PAYE workers and social welfare recipients will be in the tax net and will be paying this, many of them on ridiculously low incomes.  Those who are not paying taxes, the non-taxpayers, will get a very fine bonanza.  They will get the £30 per month for every child and not pay a penny tax on it.  It will be tremendous for them.  The same people will be screwed into the ground again. Go down the scale to the lowest possible incomes and tax them on the child benefit <Col N="1708" /> while others who are not paying taxes will get the same £30 per month and will not pay taxes on it.  That is what the Minister in his speech referred to as tax reform and bringing new areas of activity into the tax net, and it shows a sick attitude on his part.  Presumably the intention is that it will come up in the next budget. If that is the Minister's intention we will certainly oppose it and build up a campaign of opposition to it from now right up to budget time.</P>
    <P>In this Finance Bill all the inequities, all the income levies, the youth employment levy and the temporary income levy remain.  Remember the temporary income levy that was brought in two or three years ago.  That is renewed of course and will continue to be renewed. They cannot do without it now.  That 1 per cent temporary income levy is a most iniquitous tax.  There has been no change in PRSI.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill renews again for 1985-86 the special allowance of £286 in the case of employees who pay the higher rates of PRSI.  That allowance was £312 in 1982-83 and this Government reduced it to £286 in 1983-84.  That allowance by now should be at least £400 but it is continued at £286 in this Finance Bill.  All those inequitable areas remain, but some significant people are being helped.  Sections 20 and 21 of the Bill are fairly extensive and the people they help are the landlords.  The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act which was passed here gave landlords a guaranteed income for life.  They no longer had to just go out and get their market price for their property. They went out and got an economic price, the economic rent, not whatever they could get from the market.  They are guaranteed an economic rent and if the people out there in the flats cannot afford to pay this rent the Minister pays them out of the taxpayers' money.  These landlords are paid out of the Exchequer, and now the Minister is giving them new incentives.  We know what that means. &ldquo;Incentives&rdquo; means more money into their pocket, less taxes for them to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say that this is a great way of giving incentives to them to refurbish <Col N="1709" /> property that is dying, collapsing, in decay, to reroof, rebuild and so on, but note that only landlords get this tax relief. The ordinary &ldquo;Joe Soap&rdquo; might put his money into refurbishing a house or his property but under this Bill only the landlords will be allowed to offset their expenditure on refurbishment against future rental income.  This incentive is for landlords who are letting property.  That is very significant and shows the attitude of this Government and the Minister for Finance.  When he thinks of taking more money he goes to the bottom of the pile and screws as much as he can out of those people but when he thinks of incentives he goes to the top, to the landlords.</P>
    <P>There has been no change in the area of corporation tax.  A recent case which came to notice as regards the payment of corporation tax was Tara Mines, and I am sure Tara are not the only profitable concern who are not paying tax.  The only way we found out they were not paying tax was that we heard that they were not paying any royalties.  It transpires that under their lease their royalties are dependent on the amount of profits and the tax they pay on those profits.  Since the Government and the Ministries concerned have not succeeded in working out precisely how much tax is to be paid, how much their profits were and so on, Tara Mines do not pay any royalties.  This means they have paid neither royalties nor tax on the ore they extracted from the Tara ore body since 1978.  In all that time they have been exporting the raw ore and making profits but paying the Government neither tax nor royalties. Now the Government are in the process of making a deal to hand over to them the Bula ore body for less than one-tenth of its value.  The minimum we are asking the Government to do is to ensure that, before they hand over the Bula ore body, they should work out a new deal with Tara Mines and alter the terms of the lease so that royalties will be paid on every tonne of ore extracted from the mine, not on profits, which is how the lease should have been read in the first instance.  Now the Government have an opportunity to do that.  If Tara have to <Col N="1710" /> pay royalties on every tonne of ore extracted, they will then have to pay tax on profits.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the oil companies are looking for a deal as good as Bula got?  They are saying the oilwells off the south coast are small wells and that a previous Minister, Mr. Justin Keating, had in mind only large oil wells.  The oil companies are saying they will not bring the small wells ashore unless they get a new deal.  That is the usual threat of mining and exploration companies &mdash;&ldquo;If you do not do what we say, we will not extract the oil or the ore&rdquo;.  What difference will it make to us if we make a deal like that made with Tara?  Apart from the jobs in the Navan area, Tara Mines are of no benefit to the country in terms of increased wealth or jobs down the line.  Are we going to make a similar deal with the oil companies to allow them to bring the small wells ashore?  There are probably hundreds of small wells rather than one big well, but it seems the oil companies are trying to put the screws on the Government in the same way Tara were allowed to do some years ago.</P>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy got a copy of a press statement I received from the Irish Customs and Excise Union, who are affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  With your permission, Sir, I will read from this statement by the Irish Customs and Excise Union in relation to recent Government directed cutbacks in the customs and excise service, March 1985.  This is a cry from the heart by people who know their job inside out. They are pointing out that in spite of denials to the contrary there have been savage cutbacks in manning levels throughout the uniformed customs and excise service with effect from 17 February 1985 and that further cutbacks are being implemented on a day to day basis. They say the situation has been arrived at where they are left with a shambles of a customs service on Sundays and public holidays, the very days when the numbers of people entering or leaving the State are at a peak.  They go on to say that the cutbacks range in severity from about 35 per cent to 65 per cent.  They say that the <Col N="1711" /> opening hours at all frontier posts have not only been reduced but that manning levels during these reduced hours have been savaged.</P>
    <P>They go on to say that it has been decided &mdash; and this is the frightening thing &mdash; by the Minister for the Public Service, presumably with the knowledge of the Minister for Finance and other Ministers, that not all arrivals or departures of small aircraft to or from EC countries would in future warrant a customs presence.  Up to now all aircraft warranted a customs presence.  This means that small aircraft will be able to fly to and from EC countries without any customs presence whatsoever.  As the statement from the union says, this must be very welcome news for the smuggling fraternity and must be viewed as a most alarming and serious development because it can only lead those misguided people to thank their lucky stars and to take advantage of this Government directed good fortune.  This move will be welcomed by all smugglers, including drug smugglers. The Taoiseach said they had got on top of the drug problem but now they are cutting back on the customs service and leaving the country wide open to drug smugglers.  They say that at ports and airports only a token customs presence is now provided.</P>
    <P>This is very serious not just from the point of view of the Minister for Finance but from the point of view of the drug problem which we have.  I thought before I received this circular from that union that surveilance had been increased at all exit and entry points in the State &mdash; ports, airports and places where small aircraft could land.  I was quite sure that there was increased vigilance to ensure that drugs would not be smuggled into the country.  Now I find that this is far from the truth.  I ask the Minister and the Government to look at the position again.  This ridiculous embargo has no meaning whatever and if the Government looked at it they would see that it was losing them money in many areas. By all means reduce staff in as many areas as possible, because we must reduce <Col N="1712" /> expenditure, but surely it could be done in a more scientific manner rather than having this embargo of one in three.  It has reduced our customs service and many other services to a state of ridiculousness.</P>
    <P>The VAT changes were welcomed by most people.  The system was simplified for everyone.  The main areas the vast majority of people did not welcome were VAT on footwear of 10 per cent, the increase of VAT on clothing from 8 per cent to 10 per cent and the increase to 10 per cent on new houses.  The damage done to the construction industry has been well dealt with over the last couple of months and it must have hit home by now.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there will be fewer local authority houses, and income ceilings have been introduced in order to reduce the numbers on the waiting list. Incentives have been offered to encourage people to buy their own house, yet we have this increase to 10 per cent on new houses.  It is contradictory and does a lot of damage to the construction industry.  It is difficult to see the purpose of it.</P>
    <P>One of the specific VAT proposals I welcomed on the day of the budget was the reduction of VAT on theatres to zero. I thought theatres and live performances were all zero-rated.  I discovered then that they were exempt but not zero-rated. There is a difference between being exempt from VAT and being zero-rated. The director of the Gate Theatre, Mr. Michael Colgan, wrote to me and other Deputies and said he was saving £20,000 on the reduction of VAT from 5 per cent to zero but he could no longer claim VAT rebates on goods such as material for sets, printing, advertising etc.  If he was zero-rated he could claim such rebates. Last year the Gate Theatre claimed £30,000 rebates.  This year they expected it would be £45,000 because they planned major refurbishing.  While they gained £20,000 they lost £25,000.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister for Finance regarding this.  I was sure the Minister's intention was to try to catch up on Deputy Haughey's great move for the arts and was sure Deputy Dukes felt he would <Col N="1713" /> get in on the act and do this out of the goodness of his heart.  I thought he reduced VAT on theatres to help them out.  I wrote to him and said it would be a great pity if the usefulness of this was lost through some technicality.  I said I was not aware that there was a difference between exemption and zero-rating.  I appealed to him to do what was necessary to ensure that what was obviously his original intention would be carried out.  I really thought it was his original intention.</P>
    <P>When I received his reply he went down very much in my estimation.  It appears that instead of putting up the rate to 10 per cent the Minister decided to take out the 5 per cent, not for the good of the theatre but simply to rationalise the VAT system.  As a result of the budget changes the number of VAT rates were reduced from six to three and the 5 per cent rate was abolished.  All the goods and services at the 5 per cent rate were moved to 10 per cent rate with the exception of admissions to live theatrical performances and certain other forms of live entertainment.  I was told the Minister had now re-examined the position and that it was considered that the theatre had by no means been badly treated by being exempt given the 10 per cent and 23 per cent rates which apply to most other goods and services.</P>
    <P>On the figures supplied by the Gate Theatre it is obvious that the Gate would be better off if the Minister had announced that he was increasing VAT to 10 per cent because then they would get £45,000 rebates and would pay £40,000 in VAT thus giving a saving of £5,000.  As it now stands they will lose £25,000.  I do not understand why the Minister cannot see that.  I ask the Minister to look at it again on Committee Stage to see if it is possible to have theatres zero-rated.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate I asked about the position of unregistered farmers but I did not receive a satisfactory reply to my question.  The figure has increased from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent. The refund of VAT to unregistered farmers totalled £6.8 million in 1979.  In 1981 <Col N="1714" /> this amount increased to £22 million.  In 1982 it went up to £41.5 million.  In 1983, which is the last year for which I have figures, it went up to £53.70 million paid out of the Exchequer to unregistered farmers. Apparently there are only 700 registered farmers.  Now it is intended to increase that 2 per cent to a VAT refund of 2.2 per cent.  I cannot understand what this is about because a number of farm inputs, including fertilisers, are zero-rated. What has increased in price which makes the Minister want to increase this VAT refund from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent?  I hope the Minister will answer that question during the course of Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Rourke on 23 April 1985:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the major cutbacks in educational finances which have led to excessive increases in the size of classes, the unemployment of large numbers of teachers and many other serious problems in our schools and calls on the Government to make full and adequate provision for education.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the progress made by this Government in educational development and reform in particular its emphasis on special intervention for the disadvantages, and considers that adequate provision has been made to maintain this progress.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>By agreement, <Col N="1715" /> Deputy O'Kennedy will come in now and he has ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no accident that when the House is debating the Finance Bill as the major business of the House, Fianna Fáil have submitted a Private Members' Motion on the inexplicable and unjustifiable cutbacks by this Government in the Vote for the Department of Education.  When our spokesperson, Deputy O'Rourke, proposed to the Front Bench of our parliamentary party that these matters were inevitably and inextricably interlinked, there was an immediate response in support for her from our Front Bench that this was the time to put down a motion on education to demonstrate the importance of investment in education for economic expansion in the future and, in particular, to demonstrate that this Government have shamefully cutback the expenditure allocations for education when the social and economic crisis requires a comprehensive and consistent plan for investment in education.</P>
      <P>Facts speaks louder than words.  The facts are contained in the Estimates for public expenditure to which I propose to refer.  The allocations for primary, post-primary and higher education in 1985 on the Government's figures &mdash; and one can question their percentages and their calculations &mdash; show a mere 2 per cent to 3 per cent increase in nominal terms over 1984.  In real terms, discounting inflation, they represent at least a 5 per cent cutback on last year.  If we look across the board at primary, post-primary and higher education allocations, the one constant is 2 per cent to 3 per cent.  Clearly the Government, through the Minister for Finance, issued instructions to the Minister for Education and the Minister of State for a 2 per cent cutback across the board and that was achieved.  They decided deliberately to apply an indiscriminate reduction of that order right across the board in education without any regard for the social and economic consequences of such an indiscriminate reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> This savage attack on education contrasts sharply with the 48 per cent increase in the allocations for the administrative agencies of the Department of Labour which now account for the unbelievable figure of over £163 million of the taxpayers' money in 1985.  The Minister of State apparently has a dual role in the Department of Education and the Department of Labour.  This astronomical figure is actually 60 per cent more than the total allocation for higher education.  That is a terrible reflection on any Government.  It emerges from the Estimates for higher education.  It is 60 per cent more than the total allocation of £101 million provided by the Government this year.  On the basis of that allocation, the Government attach a much higher priority to short term training, work experience programmes, interviews for the sake of interviews, Manpower institutes interviewing thousands of children around the country for the sake of interviewing them, than they do to education for permanent employment in this era of technological change.</P>
    <P>I heard an expert consultant from England interviewed recently on one of our own radio programmes and he pointed out that you educate the human for permanent employment and a capacity to adapt to changing circumstances, and you train the animal for one job and, if that job goes, he can no longer react.  That is the Government's priority.  They have singled out education and our young students to bear the brunt of their attack since taking office.  This year the allocations across the board are 12 per cent less in real terms than the allocations provided by Fianna Fáil in 1982.  This is not just the view of Deputies on this side of the House.  The NESC pointed to this as being a very worrying pattern in this Government's approach to education.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on higher education in the few minutes available to me.  Higher education has been singled out for a particularly pernicious attack with real reductions of over 25 per cent since this Government took office.  Even in nominal terms in 1984 we were dealing with a 1 per cent reduction over the previous <Col N="1717" /> year.  Add them up and the figure is 25 per cent less than it was when the Government took office.</P>
    <P>Investment in education was always a central element in Fianna Fáil programmes which lifted the country out of the doldrums of the original Coalition fifties into the vigorous and confident expansion in the sixties under Fianna Fáil.  I was privileged to be the equivalent of a Minister of State in the Department of Education in the late sixties and early seventies. That is when we launched the NIHE, the technological colleges, to guarantee that we could exploit every opportunity in the future.  This was a crucial element in our plans for economic expansion.  In the most successful and buoyant economies throughout the world such as Japan, Switzerland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria, Norway and the United States, they planned their economic expansion on consistent and major investment in education.</P>
    <P>Investment in knowledge in this era of technology is a <i>sine qua non</i> for economic growth.  Over 45 per cent of first time employees in Japan have third level education. This investment is repaid many times by the added value contributed by such specialists in research development, marketing and product refinement to exploit the ever-changing world markets. Is it any wonder that we are forced to react to what these people who invest in knowledge and technology are able to promote in a pioneering way?  That is at the higher end of the scale and it is not being treated as a high priority by this Government.</P>
    <P>Let me turn briefly to the lower end of the scale.  The social tensions which follow from deprived educational backgrounds are all too obvious at the moment.  Our prisons cannot cope with the ever-increasing numbers sentenced by the courts.  Our prison officers, the Garda and the Judiciary are suffering from increased frustration and disillusionment as a consequence.  The penal system is breaking down.  The Garda are being blamed for not apprehending offenders and when they apprehend these <Col N="1718" /> children, who are deprived and who are habitual offenders because of the lack of educational opportunity, they bring them to court and get convictions.  They knock on the front door of Mountjoy and they are sent home.  Is it any wonder we have a breakdown in order at the moment? The only way to deal with it is to give those children the same advantages from day one, and not have them cast in the role of habitual offenders.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Government can afford to lavish huge funds on the public relations consultancy of every Minister. Apparently the Minister for Education said our spokesperson, Deputy O'Rourke, put down this motion simply to attract publicity.  Let us plead guilty. The Minister is quite right.  We want to attract publicity for this neglect on the Government's part who are the past masters of public relations.  They can afford to provide over £3 million for the public relations consultancies of Ministers. We never had them in our time. The Minister for Foreign Affairs never had them in my time.  The Minister for Finance never had them in my time.  They have them now.  They have the public service for themselves personally.  No PR exercise however sophisticated and sustained can hide the fact that the Government have turned their backs on the youth of the nation and the contribution which those young people can make towards a fairer and more prosperous society.  A Government which has no confidence in our young people forfeits the right to direct the affairs of this nation in the challenging year which lies ahead of all of us.</P>

Nowhere is that more clear-cut than in the treatment last night and dismissal by the Opposition spokesman of the stand taken by the Minister in relation to eliminating sexism and in achieving equality for girls.  Such initiatives were dismissed as worthless, all for the sake of a headline &mdash; all talk and no action.  That is an outrageously inaccurate statement and can only be dismissed with contempt.  How can it be made, still less made seriously?  What interest has ever been shown in that area by any Fianna Fáil Minister or spokesman in Opposition over the years?

      <P>It is easy and cheap to dismiss, but that ignores the facts and ignores what is happening in our schools and our educational system. Let us look at it, step by step, detail by detail, to see who is uttering pious platitudes.  The fact is that a most extensive programme for action has been undertaken and will continue.  The Progress Report on the Programme for Action in Education, which was published in January, listed a series of initiatives taken in this area of eliminating sexism, but they were all dismissed.

      <P>Changes were made in the numbering so that the sex of a candidate would no longer be known to the examiner.  A review of pre-service training programmes has been carried out so that the obligation of teachers to avoid sexism is made clear.  Seminars throughout November and December, promoting awareness of this area.  Regional seminars held for principals of post-primary schools.  Special measures taken to ensure that women are appointed to selection boards for teachers and principals of primary schools.  The fact that schools have been asked to ensure the code of practice of the Employment Equality Agency is observed in regard to interview procedure.  Co-education being promoted in the case of new school building programmes and wherever rationalisation of school facilities can be achieved. Schools being strongly encouraged to offer curriculum options equally to boys and girls.  Equality of opportunities for girls.  As every Member of this House knows this was one of the major themes sponsored by the Irish Presidency during the six months in which we held that position in the Community before Christmas.  As the House knows, there was a major EC conference on that subject.</P>
      <P>Yet we are told that nothing has been done.  This very day, a major seminar was held on this topic of equality of opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to which the Opposition spokesman graciously referred last night.  That seminar, as she will graciously admit now, was organised by the Minister.  The Deputy will also, I am sure, recall that among the papers read at that seminar was one by Jerome Morrissey, principal of the Senior College in Ballyfermot, in which he gave quite splendid examples of what schools are now doing in a very positive way in order to promote equality of opportunities. Much as some people might find it convenient to run away from this simple fact, things are happening and there is now much greater awareness of the problems than before the present Minister came into office and this Government took office.  To say that nothing has been done is just absurd, so let us stop that kind of nonsense and proceed.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition spokesman did not allow a concern for accuracy to inhibit her contribution, one must say that she was excelled by the contributions of some of her colleagues.

      <P>Let us consider some of his more interesting statements and see to what extent they stand up and to what extent other Fianna Fáil speakers are going to stand over them.  Deputy Byrne took as his theme the question of <Col N="1724" /> remedial education.  Let us put this clearly in context.  It is quite true to say that there is a percentage of children who for any number of reasons fail to make normal progress in basic reading and other skills and equally true that in that situation our obligation is to help them to overcome those difficulties and do so as early as possible in the school system. It is precisely towards that end that all our policies and provisions are directed. What Deputy Byrne said in this House last night deserves to be quoted:</P>
      <P>The results of a survey show that 75 per cent of all pupils entering post-primary schools are in need of remedial education because they have a reading age of ten or less.</P>
      <P>He did not leave it at that.  That was only in the nature of the <i>hors d'oeuvres.</i> He then went on to say:</P>
      <P>This is the case with all pupils entering vocational schools.</P>
      <P>That is a monstrous slander on the pupils of this country and on the teachers.  Were it true, it would be a massive indictment of the work of every national school teacher here.  If the statement were correct, every national school teacher would have to look to his or her laurels.  Of course, it is not true.  It is what I say it is &mdash; an inexcusable slander.  The question now arises as to whether Fianna Fáil spokesmen are going to tell every national school teacher in the forthcoming local elections that that is the regard which that party have for their abilities. I wonder whether one of the teachers who sits on the benches opposite can seriously suggest that 75 per cent of all pupils entering post-primary schools and all coming into vocational schools need remedial education.  It is so monstrous and absurd that a reply is scarcely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me move on.  I come to the area of adult education.  I want to take this opportunity in the few minutes which are left, to recapitulate briefly on the developments which have taken place in the lifetime of this Government.  The House <Col N="1725" /> will recall that when the report was published the Minister welcomed it saying that it was Government policy to respond sensitively and positively to the needs of literacy and the requirements of community education in the disadvantaged areas.  She went on to say:</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal that adult education boards should be constructed in each vocational area as subcommittees of the VEC with a representative composition recommended.</P>
    <P>What has been the response?  In the Government's national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> the commission's report is referred to and the commitment is reiterated to the establishment of adult education boards and the provision of a separate budget to be administered by local adult education boards.  We spell out that the Government have agreed to provide over £1 million in 1987 in funds to the VECs to enable them to establish courses free of charge or at a nominal sum in community education and in literacy. Against that background a circular letter on the establishment of <i>ad hoc</i> adult education boards was issued to all VECs in December 1984.  The circular invited VECs to establish such bords as a matter of urgency, using the structure recommended by the commission.  As all of us know, a number of VECs have taken action on the basis of that circular.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to all voluntary bodies has been increased substantially.  In the case of Aontas, the national organisation, the increase has been from £52,000 to £95,000, an increase of 83 per cent. Yet, the Opposition speak of cutbacks. In the case of Nala, the national voluntary organisation founded to promote the interests of learners, tutors and organisers engaged in adult literacy activities, the grant has been increased from £10,000 in 1984 to £42,000 this year.  In the case of the Dublin Institute of Adult Education there has been an increase of 38 per cent, the ICA have received a 25 per cent increase and the grant to the People's College has been doubled.  All <Col N="1726" /> of this is eloquent testimony to the concern of this Government in the area of adult education.  Action speaks louder than words and our action speaks eloquently.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the coordination of education and training and he seemed to believe too much money is spent on training.  This is a constant theme of Deputy O'Kennedy.  When he has been pressed to suggest an area for possible cuts in public expenditure, on every occasion he has suggested this area. I think young people should be aware of his thoughts on this matter.  The young people who are given the opportunity to make the transition from education to working life and who benefit from the range of programmes funded by the 1 per cent levy should be aware of the intentions of the party opposite.  They should know that apparently their intentions are to squeeze more money out of the taxpayers so that when these people get jobs they will be less well off.  At the same time, this is an area that has been properly identified by the Government as an area of priority and this has happened in the case of every Government in Europe.  Yet the need to respond to the problems of youth unemployment is to be the one area to be singled out for cutbacks.  That represents nothing more nor less than an attack on young people who are trying to make their way onto the labour market.  In particular, it represents an attack on the most disadvantaged section of young people for whom those programmes are specifically tailored.</P>
    <P>I had thought I had heard everything then but then we heard the line that all the problems in the area of education and justice are inter-linked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Nobody on this side <Col N="1727" /> denies that but this party have shown their commitment to tackle the problems of the disadvantaged.  We have done this in the most practical way.  In a unique way we have singled out the area of disadvantage from primary education to out-of-school informal education.  We have said our priorities are the areas of disadvantage and to those areas we will respond.  That continues to be the ethos on which this Government exist and operate. In the most practical way we have shown our concern for the disadvantaged and that is recognised by the people who participate in the programmes, either as pupils or teachers.  Even if the Opposition do not know, they know that this Government have continued to support the educational system and will continue to regard the area of disadvantage as a priority.  That is much more important than an attempt to run away from cuts imposed three years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time at my disposal I wish to deal with some of the points made in relation to the area for which I am responsible.  Last night the Minister dealt in detail with the broader aspect of education.  I listened to the contribution of Deputy Byrne but I was not here to listen to Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall deal first with the primary and post-primary school building programme. There has been no cutback in <Col N="1728" /> capital for financing the construction, furnishing and equipping of educational buildings.  In fact the opposite is the case. The overall capital allocation for 1985 at £96 million is £13 million or over 15 per cent more than that allocated for 1984. Not only is it intended to maintain this large capital investment but as can be seen from the national economic plan it is intended to increase it.  The planned provision for 1986 and 1987 is £107 million and £115 million respectively which shows a further considerable increase.</P>
    <P>At the primary level the allocation to the building, equipment and furnishing of national schools for 1985 is £30.33 million.  This programme has to cope with many competing priorities from new schools in new housing areas to additional classrooms in existing schools and the upgrading and improvement of schools which do not meet modern requirements. A significant number of the new buildings replace prefabricated and other temporary accommodation and a proportion of the available finance is also reserved for the renewal and improvement of basic facilities such as sanitation, heating, lighting and furniture.</P>
    <P>The programme of primary school building continues apace and a target for the provision of 18,500 school places has been set for the current year.  Present indications are that this target will be achieved.  At the present time 137 projects for new school buildings and 218 projects involving extensions and renovations are being dealt with in the various stages from grant sanction onwards through detailed design, tender action and construction.</P>
    <P>A further 255 projects are under active consideration while 215 more are at the stage of preliminary investigation.  There is no evidence of cutback either in the size of this programme, or in the pace at which it is being handled.  There have been no cases of projects being held up at the tender or advanced planning stages due to inability to finance new starts. Indeed, the Government's concern to ensure the expeditious handling of primary school building projects and to minimise administrative delay is at the <Col N="1729" /> base of their decision to transfer the responsibility in respect of primary school buildings, hitherto exercised by the Office of Public Works, to the Department of Education.  Discussions are taking place as to how best this decision might be implemented without interfering with the ongoing progress of the programme of school building work.</P>
    <P>In the second level sector the demand from school authorities for additional school buildings and facilities continues to be very heavy.  In fact, the demand has increased to the stage where my Department are at present processing over 400 second level building proposals.  This represents a very large proportion out of the 800 second level schools recognised by my Department.  May I say that it is my policy that the architectural planning of all building projects proceed in the normal way until each has reached the stage where it is ready to go to tender. At that stage I have to make a decision as to whether to allow it to go to tender or not.  This decision is taken in the light of the finance available and the other commitments that have to be met.  I am glad to say that to date I have been in a position to release to tender all the projects that have reached that stage.  To date in 1985 I have released to tender 32 projects &mdash; all major projects.  No case has been held up for financial reasons alone.  This is an indication that adequate finance is being made available for the purpose.</P>
    <P>In acknowledgement of the increased demand from school authorities, a significant increase in the capital for second level building has been envisaged in the national economic plan.  This is reflected in the capital provision of £37 million for 1985, £41 million for 1986 and £47 million for 1987.  As you will see, far from these being major cutbacks in capital for second level building projects the provision is being increased.  In providing this increasing capital investment we are keeping in mind our main priority &mdash; the provision of student places.  In the remaining years up to 1990 it is estimated that 65,000 new places will be required at second level.  About 30,000 will be <Col N="1730" /> required to meet new enrolment growth arising from population growth and population shifts.  The balance will be replacing unsatisfactory and temporary accommodation which has outlived its usefulness.  We are making adequate provision for that purpose and will continue to do so in our Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with what was said by Deputy Hugh Byrne last evening with regard to school transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said last evening that we had had no debate on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had, as the record of this House will show, lengthy debates on the question of school transport and on the cutbacks initiated by the previous Fianna Fáil administration which necessitated the introduction of charges for school transport in the case of eligible post-primary pupils.  Let me remind Deputy O'Rourke of the statement issued by her colleague, Deputy Ger Brady, then and for a brief period, Minister for Education, on 18 November 1982 in the context of the publication of the Estimates for the Public Services, 1983, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no charges for pupils of national schools eligible for free transport in accordance with the school transport regulations.  The cost of the scheme for primary and post primary schools has, however, been growing to such an extent that measures need to be taken with regards to it.  Since no alteration is contemplated on the range of the service, the measures required to control cost must involve the introduction of a charge in the case of second level school pupils.  Consideration is being given to the question of the arrangements to be made for the implementation of such charge.  It is contemplated that such arrangements would take the form of the issue of a season ticket, that there would be a lower rate for junior pupils and that a concession would be made to take <Col N="1731" /> account of the circumstances of large families.</P>
    <P>When the present Government came into office, on 15 December 1982, despite inheriting a substantial shortfall in the provision for school transport services, they set about maintaining the structure and level of this service.  In order to do this it was necessary to proceed with the imposition of charges in the case of eligible post primary pupils, but having given full consideration to the possibility that such charges would constitute a hardship for very many families, they took steps to alleviate this hardship by introducing a maximum charge per family and by exempting from the charges eligible post primary pupils whose parents or guardians were in possession of a medical card.  In the event while there was some reduction, approximately 15,000, in the number of pupils availing themselves of school transport, it is clear that the pupils concerned had alternative means of getting to school as there is no evidence of reduction in school enrolment following the introduction of the school transport charges.</P>
    <P>The essential fabric of the school transport service was maintained and it continues to operate successfully, providing this valuable service for some 70,000 primary and some 84,000 post primary pupils.  All of the former and 39,000 of the latter are carried free of charge.  The receipts from charges contribute less than 10 per cent of the cost of school transport, which will be of the order of £34.5 million in 1985.  The charges have been increased from January 1985 by an amount in line with the much attenuated rate of inflation brought about by the prudent financial management of the present administration. A cutback there may have been in school transport provision, a cutback which was initiated by the Fianna Fáil administration before it left office.  But this cutback has been contained by the Government and the essential fabric of this valuable service has been maintained as an important factor in the access of 154,000 children to education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> I want now to deal very briefly with what I regard as a very important aspect of education, that is, special education. Let us look to the area of special education to see whether the Deputies' contention regarding cutbacks and serious problems in our schools can be sustained in this area.  I can state emphatically in this, the most sensitive of areas of educational provision, that they cannot.</P>
    <P>The policy of providing extra teachers to meet the remedial needs of children in primary schools who encounter difficulties in mastering the basic skills of literacy and numeracy has been continued under the present administration and 30 extra remedial posts were sanctioned in each of the school years 1983-84 and 1984-85, bringing the total of such posts to 797, serving 1,030 schools.  In this connection, too, I might add that the Department, in co-operation with school management and the teachers' organisation, is examining on a pilot basis how best the services of these teachers may be deployed in the interests of the children.  As Deputies must well know, there are many ways of approaching the problems of remediation and the responsibility of my Department clearly does not stop at merely sanctioning extra teaching posts.  This whole area of remedial teaching is being systematically backed up by an enhanced programme of inservice training in which special attention is being given to coping with remedial problems in smaller schools where specialist remedial teachers would not normally be available.  The pre-service training of teachers generally is also being examined to ensure that all newly qualified teachers are given appropriate training to cope with the problems of pupils who encounter learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>The policy of educating mildly mentally handicapped children in special classes in national schools was one which received special mention in Fianna Fáil's White Paper on Educational Development. It was seen as a policy which would facilitate the integration of these children with their peers and contribute to their overall social and educational development. The present Government, while <Col N="1733" /> recognising the excellent work done in the special schools and foreseeing an essential role for them in the future, has no quarrel with this policy of integration by means of special classes.  In fact it not only advocates such a policy, but is prepared to do something to encourage it, as evidenced by their decision in January 1984 to pay the same rate of capitation grant in respect of pupils in special classes in ordinary national schools as that which obtained in the case of similar pupils in special schools.  This had the immediate effect of increasing the capitation grant for the majority of such pupils from £21 to £48.50.  Such a decision &mdash; and I would be the first to acknowledge that it did not cost the earth and to wonder why it was not taken during the period when Fianna Fáil was in office &mdash; put the ordinary national schools in a position to provide the resources in the way of teaching aids and materials so vitally needed for the education of these children.</P>
    <P>I would contend that a decision of this kind is not an evidence of a &ldquo;cut-back&rdquo; mentality where there is a genuine need, any more than is the fact that since the present administration took office some 12 extra special classes for mildly mentally handicapped children, three extra special classes for younger moderately mentally handicapped children in remoter parts of the country and some 23 additional special classes for the children of travellers have been formed.  I can add, for Deputies' information, special measures to improve the funding of pre-schooling for the younger children of travellers, the appointment of extra visiting teachers, the increase in the number of training centres financed totally or partially through my Department and, above all, the decision, arising from the recommendation in the report on the education of children with severe and profound mental handicap, to provide an educational service for these children, on which it is planned to make a start in the present year.  God knows, and so do Deputies, we can claim little credit for providing for the needs of these, the most special of all our children, whatever our financial <Col N="1734" /> circumstances; but the outline I have given, and by which I stand, is a clear indication to the House that special education is an area that has continued to develop as it should and that there is neither evidence nor intention of cutback, but indeed the contrary in this important area of educational provision.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to deal with another area of my responsibility, sport.  Having regard to the current economic climate and the resulting restrictions on public expenditure, I am satisfied that the Government's allocation of £1.36 million to sport at national level in 1985 has been an extremely generous one.  Indeed, since this Government took office the allocation for the promotion and development of sport at national level has increased by 68.5 per cent.  This increase is evidence of the Government's commitment to cater for the sporting and recreational needs of the community and in particular of our young people.</P>
    <P>On the advice of COSPÓIR, the National Sports Council, I have allocated a total of £589,780 in direct grants to national sports organisations for 1985, in addition to special allocations amounting to £275,000 announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget for designated organisations.  These grants represent a significant increase over 1984 allocations and will ensure that the needs of sports organisations are catered for to a greater extent than ever before in this country.</P>
    <P>The major beneficiary of the increased allocation for sport in 1985 is the Olympic Council of Ireland which has received a total grant of £240,000 this year.  This is the most substantial and significant contribution ever made by a Government to the development of athletes of Olympic potential from the commencement of the four year Olympic cycle.  The allocation of this grant to the Olympic Council of Ireland is in response to a joint submission which has been prepared, at my request, by the Olympic Council of Ireland and COSPÓIR.  This submission contains specific proposals as to the best means of meeting the requirements of our athletes in elite sport leading up to <Col N="1735" /> the 1988 Olympics in Seoul and also relating to Olympic sport in the long term.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this grant will have a major impact not only for our most elite athletes but also for the identification and development of the potential of junior athletes in the various Olympic sports.</P>
    <P>Ireland Special Olympics will host the European Special Olympic Games in Dublin from 3 to 7 July 1985.  I am very happy that the Government was in a position to provide in the budget for a grant of £50,000 to Ireland Special Olympics to ensure that these games will be a successful undertaking.</P>
    <P>Various other schemes administered by my Department to assist sport, such as the sports scholarship scheme and the scheme of grants to assist sports organisations towards the cost of sending teams abroad to compete in major international events, have also benefited from the increased provision for sport in 1985.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision made for sport at national level a sum of £812.000 has been allocated to assist vocational education committes to support and develop youth and sports services and activities at local level.  The sum of £812.000 represents an increase of 6 per cent over the 1984 provision and will ensure that the level of support for activities at local level will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am very happy indeed that this Government have given due recognition to the importance of sport and physical recreation in our society through a record investment in the development of sport at a time of economic stringency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the reaction of the Government side of the <Col N="1736" /> House to the presentation of solid facts from the Opposition last night.  The contributions from this side have been denigrated in strong terms not by the Minister of State for Education whom I commend for his honesty in his approach to this problem, but by other Members.  Any criticisms I direct at the Minister's Department are not intended personally. I will leave the fixation on sexism which is obviously emanating from the Government side of the House to the Minister. The presence of Deputy Doyle, in response to the very valuable contribution and concerned expressions last night from Deputy Byrne, is an indication, as is the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for youth, of their concern for the facts we presented here. Statements made by the Ministers last night are difficult to accept as facts.  In her opening statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>My first reaction to the motion proposed by Deputy O'Rourke is one of surprise as to why it has taken the Opposition nearly two and a half years to put forward this motion.</P>
      <P>In his statement on school transport the Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>We have had, as the record of this House will show, lengthy debates on the question of school transport and on the cut backs... which necessitated the introduction of charges for school transport</P>
      <P>How can those two statements be reconciled? One is grossly inaccurate.</P>
      <P>The Minister last night responded to our spokesperson in a paranoid fashion and referred to the schizophrenia of Fianna Fáil.  We came into this House to outline the difficulties that are becoming more serious and to expose the ongoing constant posturing and struttings of the Minister and the ongoing churning out of material from her office to the public, which has little significance and which makes a hollow contribution to the problems so evident in the field of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to spend all my time commenting on what is a very cleverly worked out facade by the Minister.  I <Col N="1737" /> support the motion, which reflects the mounting concern of Members of the House and the public at the abysmal failure of the Minister and the Government to develop and maintain educational services at the level at which they found them.  The serious cutbacks in education allied to the lethargic approach of the Minister &mdash; although she is not too lethargic when it comes to publicity &mdash; to the present issues under her administration must be condemned as anti-social and in many respects it reflects a lack of understanding. When we talk about education we are talking about an integral part of our contribution to the well-being of society.  There has been increasing unrest at all levels in the education area, and if the Minister of State does not know that he has not been reading the papers recently.  I do not believe everything I see in the papers, but when I see an obvious consensus emanating from all the practitioners in the field, I do not ignore it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's abject failure to address the problems of large classes at primary level and the increase in the ratios at post-primary level and her failure to bring forward a code of discipline for primary schools is deplorable.  I unequivocably condemn the decision by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Boland, to remove corporal punishment from the schools without introducing a clearly worked out code of discipline.  Nobody regretted the passing of corporal punishment from the schools but a Minister understanding the situation would have phased it out while at the same time introducing a clearly worked out policy and code of discipline in consultation with the teaching interests. The shortsightedness and the hunger for glory caused the Minister to make this hurried and, in hindsight, very unwise decision.</P>
    <P>An obvious link is being illustrated between the cutbacks in education and the increase in juvenile deliquency.  This, along with a totally inadequate response to the pressing problems in the area of special and remedial teaching, has contributed to a growing cynicism among young people.  If the Minister of State with responsibility for youth is not aware of <Col N="1738" /> that cynicism, he has not been listening to our young people.  The Minister spoke of young people in glowing terms, and I agree with him, but we also have a lot of cynicism among young people.  This cynicism has grown because they are being so callously rejected by this Government and it has spilled over in many instances into violence.  It is evident in the indiscipline and in the mounting challenges to authority in our class rooms.  All this is a manifestation of a festering sore born out of disillusionment and rejection and it reflects a failure by the Government to grasp the fact that the needs of the education services are central to the well-being of society.  If up to now the Minister has felt that she has had no responsibilities in many of the areas mentioned, as seems to be the case, and if the Government felt that an improvement in services and resources to education could not significantly address those problems, I hope both she and the Government took the opportunity recently to listen to an analysis from many practitioners and specialists who in their capacity as professionals have amply demonstrated where some of that responsibility lies.  I am not saying that the responsibility lies with this Government only.  I am referring to previous administrations also, but the Minister has not faced up to the matter.  There is ample evidence available to her.  To dismiss that as mere nonsense is to be foolish, lacking in understanding as to the real meaning and significance of education and the contribution it must make to society.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has accepted that there is a logic and a reasoning to many of those views.  There is greater onus on her to ensure that resources for education are increased substantially as soon as possible. The cuts in education are causing frustration in the system by preventing schools from responding adequately and caringly to student needs.  It is becoming very apparent at post-primary level that it is now almost impossible to maintain standards.  The Minister's speech last night would tend to suggest that she is not aware of that and I suggest she consult those involved in that area.  It is now <Col N="1739" /> almost impossible to offer certain courses as the school populations are increasing while teacher numbers are being reduced.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to provide finance to employ teachers to teach continental languages is very disappointing. French is taught in most of our schools but other continental languages, so necessary for international trade and commerce, are assuming less importance. The Minister may say that there has not been a numerical reduction but a teacher who leaves the service on leave will not be accepted back into the system unless a new post is created in the school. The cutbacks in 1983 meant that if a teacher died, changed job, or retired the vacancy in many cases could not be filled.</P>
    <P>Minority subjects which are vital for, and basic to, technological training and industrial development are seriously affected.  Physics and applied mathematics are traditionally chosen by small numbers of students, but the days of providing class for numbers below 20 are gone.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the ratio is 20 or less but the practicability of establishing classes below that number has gone.  The effects of the cutbacks at post-primary means that class sizes must average 27.  Since class sizes normally should not exceed 30, it means that any class below 24 is not viable.  This is a disastrous blow to the prospects of students whose aptitudes are in the less popular subjects. It is also a disastrous blow to the technological potential of the country.</P>
    <P>As this problem extends to other areas, such as the need for greater individualisation of learning for the greater numbers of students going through the system, the increase in the level of need for remediation as well as special education facilities and resources, is it any wonder, therefore, that the practitioners and the public at large are becoming increasingly incensed at the Government's repeted kicking of the rights and needs of young people out the classroom window?  The Government, and the Minister responsible, are ruining the education system at first and <Col N="1740" /> second level, and by allowing exorbitant increases at third level are denying many students any reasonable hope for the future by refusing them access to third level education and by their deplorable failure to invest in the provision of jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to reply to the reaction of the Minister of State to Deputy O'Kennedy. The Minister of State conveniently quoted Deputy O'Kennedy out of context when he said that the Deputy was obviously against training programmes for our young people.  Deputy O'Kennedy is against substituting the very necessary creation of jobs by training programmes. That is the context in which Deputy O'Kennedy has consistently referred to the potential for saving.</P>
    <P>A look at the Estimates for Public Services from 1980 to 1984 with regard to public expenditure on primary education reveals some interesting patterns.  In 1981 the Fianna Fáil Government's allocation to the primary school capital programme was £30,500,000.  The 1984 figure from the Minister was nearer to £29 million.  If that is an increase I am baffled.  Taking inflation into account over the period this must represent a real decrease in the order of at least 30 per cent.  The outcome is most unacceptable.</P>
    <P>On the current side between 1980 and 1981, Fianna Fáil provided a substantial increase in investment to resources.  I allow that a considerable portion went on teachers' salaries but it was a considerable increase.  The increase every year since then has diminished rapidly so that from 1983 to 1984 there was but a miserly increase which did not take account of inflation.  The pattern from 1982 to 1983 was almost identical.</P>
    <P>The effects have been to lessen the annual level of resources available in our primary schools and thereby diminish enormously the prospects of tackling the many very serious problems at this level. It really says something for the commitment of the Government to our young children.  One has to regard all the pious platitudes thrown around with such ostensible flaithiúlacht and no little eloquence by the Minister as nothing more than a load of old hat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1741" /> Last year the Minister committed the Coalition Government to what she titled The Programme for Action 1984-1987. That programme, or catalogue of needs identified many of the serious problems which had been addressed in the 1980 White Paper on Educational Development. However, its failure to address the pupil-teacher ratio, the most serious outstanding problem in primary education, represents a fundamental weakness in this document.</P>
    <P>On 1 September 1980, the appointment figure for a first assistant was 35 pupils.  That situation obtained until 1 September 1982 when Fianna Fáil reduced it to 33 pupils with a <i>pro rata</i> reduction down the line.  Since that date in 1982 there has been absolutely no change in the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools except where additions to school populations have caused increases in class sizes.  The only change in ratio was at post-primary and as I said that was in the reverse direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister has waffled on for many hours over many pages of policy statement and through many columns of newspapers, but the figures, the statistics, the facts remain the same.  This Government have not the slightest intention of doing anything about the many large classes in our schools, and they should come clean and admit that this is so.  It is a public shame and disgrace that this Government can keep &ldquo;hollering&rdquo; about their concern for the disadvantaged while we have 58,000 of our children still in classes of over 40 pupils.  Nobody outside the Department knows for sure how many of these are in the mid or high forties.</P>
    <P>A further 360,000 are in classes of over 30 and a considerable percentage of those are in multigrade classes.  Because the Department only give a breakdown in bands of ten, it is not possible to be certain how many of this group are in classes above 35 but it is fairly conservatively estimated that the vast majority are.</P>
    <P>The only solace the Minister had to offer recently to all those concerned &mdash; thus important &mdash; about the problems emanating from large classes was to make <Col N="1742" /> the extraordinary statement that smaller classes did not necessarily make for improved educational services.  What evidence is available to the Minister to lead her to such an outlandish and convenient conclusion?  It must be considerable if the Minister's statement is to have any credibility.  If she has such evidence, she has a duty to let us all know its source and its content.  If she has not such evidence then she should retract that recent statement and admit that it was based solely on financial considerations.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that there is a huge body of evidence built up over many years by large numbers of practitioners and research experts that large classes have created and contributed to numerous and sometimes enormous problems.  One simply cannot speak about moves towards equality of educational opportunity, about more innovation within the classroom, about greater individualisation in attention to special needs or about intervention for the disadvantaged unless this crucial and vital problem is tackled.</P>
    <P>In the many schools where remedial facilities have not been provided, there can be very considerable learning problems for individual pupils, and large classes with a multiplicity of needs do not enable teachers adequately to assist these children on an individual basis.</P>
    <P>In mixed ability classes, which form the vast majority of classes within the primary school system, the pupils of high and middle ability have also to receive their fair share.  But where the ability range is great and the numbers are high, progress on all fronts, to enable every child to realise his or her true potential, is extremely difficult to achieve to any satisfactory degree.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister in her speech last evening utter one truth. Under the heading Resources Re-Allocated, the Minister said that of course the pupil-teacher ratio had been disimproved but she asked what had been done with much of the money saved from these cuts. The Minister said that the Government had introduced a series of new measures which in the main divert the saved resources <Col N="1743" /> to the disadvantaged and other priority areas.  The main thrust of that statement is that they went to the disadvantaged. She then went on to a neat arithmetic exercise which this Minister is very good at.  While the measures she outlined are very necessary, commendable and worth-while, it is simply not true to say that they are in the main diverted to the disadvantaged.  This kind of arithmetic juggling, which the Minister has brought to a very fine art since assuming office, does not prove anything about education.</P>
    <P>A decision to disimprove the pupil-teacher ratio is a very retrograde step.  It is blind, shortsighted policy and quite frankly it clearly illustrates the philosophy of the Minister as a sophisticated cosmetic exercise.  It is nothing more; hollow in the extreme.  That kind of maladministration will do absolutely nothing to improve the ills of the system or address the problems in society.</P>
    <P>Turning to the disadvantaged, which of course embraces a wide spectrum of the school going population &mdash; I admit it is very acute in the inner city but it is also extending to new parishes in suburbia and to many urban and rural areas &mdash; if performance over the past three years was to be measured in terms of the profusion of pious platitudes emanating incessantly from the Minister's office the result is dismal.  Any Minister who is capable of spending the same £500,000 four or five times over in the same year has not only dreamt about but must surely be living the life of Alice in Wonderland.</P>
    <P>Apart from the increase in the capitation grant to pupils in special classes in ordinary schools, a very necessary measure I accept, very little else of any significance has been done to alleviate the mounting problems of this entire sector. Indeed, it is fair and reasonable to state that the entire primary sector and the remedial, disadvantaged and special education services have in real terms been taken back to the middle seventies. I can say with conviction that the remedial services are a very grey area in the Minister's list of priorities.  Like her statement <Col N="1744" /> on the pupil-teacher ratios, she probably considers that the development of this service does not necessarily improve the educational services.  Any argument, no matter how hollow, couched in eloquent waffle can save face, for a while, when a Minister wants to shield herself from public reaction to the disinvestments she is bringing about.</P>
    <P>I have recalled in the main the few items incessantly being thrown at the public as evidence of care for the disadvantaged.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creed, has just informed us that the present total of remedial teachers at primary level is 797 and that 30 additional teachers per year have been appointed for the past two years.  He goes on to concede that there are many ways of approaching the problems of remediation to tackle the problems encountered by children trying to master the skills of literacy and numeracy.  Yet the only item to which he and the Minister resort for solace is the 30 additional teachers per annum.  This is surely to disregard the numerous initiatives taken in this area by bodies and groups working in this field outside the Department.</P>
    <P>First of all, the numbers added to the pool of remedial staff simply do not reflect a favourable comparison with the enormous investment made in this area by Fianna Fáil up to 1981.  Thirty extra teachers per annum to serve present needs is totally inadequate.  It does not compare with the enormous growth in the pool of these specialists brought about by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the statements from the Minister and Minister of State over the past two days fail to grasp the central fact that this whole area has been crying out for review and updating for the past three or four years.  Surveys conducted on a local and national basis by the INTO and other agencies during 1981 and 1982 have clearly illustrated the need for immediate and comprehensive reappraisal of the entire service to ensure that the pool of talent trained and partially trained within the system is fully and effectively utilised.  The teachers involved <Col N="1745" /> in this section have been crying out for the past three years for clear policy directions regarding the future development and expansion of the service.  Yet nearly all the initiatives over the past few years have come from outside the Department.  I certainly do not blame the section inspectorate for it as I am fully aware of their care, concern, enthusiasm for initiative and innovation.  I also happen to be aware that they are constantly muzzled and hog-tied by the present administration.  Any initiatives involving, or even implying, the possibility of financial commitment are frowned upon and quickly nipped in the bud.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential even within the pool of existing staff numbers that simply has not been tapped because the necessary back up and resources to facilitate its realisation are being denied it by the present Minister.</P>
    <P>She knows very well that the addition of 30 teachers per annum to the pool represents a substantial decrease in the annual growth of any sector up to her time.  Again I want to stress, however, that the practitioners involved in this sector have become very disillusioned at being literally abandoned, since many of them were not trained or assisted to take on the increasing and changing demands being placed upon them.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any mention from the Government of the slightest intention to undertake a programme of psychological service to primary education.  This is vitally needed because of the difficulties of children of varying abilities in reaching their true potential.  It is widely agreed that there is a need for the establishment of this kind of service.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline some of the fundamental aspects of the programme which should be initiated.  It has been appealed for by all those involved in the primary sector.  If the Minister of State has any influence with his Minister this is a matter he should raise with her, as well as the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools.</P>
    <P>It is fundamentally important that the training and work of educational psychologists orientate them towards all pupils <Col N="1746" /> to ensure that the mediation of their skills contributes to the optimisation of attainment by children, from the most able to those requiring special provision.  Most of their time and energy would be spent with teachers rather than pupils to enable them mediate these skills as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>The role should be a positive and developmental one, not wholly therapeutic. Their findings should have a direct bearing and relevance for all aspects of educational activity within the school, including curriculum development.</P>
    <P>It should be accepted that a considerable amount of time would be spent dealing with the special school, the special class and the remedial groups.  Contacts with clinical psychologists should be ongoing to ensure the meaningful transmission of clinical findings to the classroom setting.</P>
    <P>They should see their role also as striving to ensure that the school and a normal class would assume responsibility for the great majority of children who have difficulties.</P>
    <P>Involvements with parents in so far as possible should be encouraged and promoted.  I repeat what our spokesman said in our document on education &mdash; that we as a party are committed, as we stated in our 1980 White Paper, to the principle that every child should be educated in the least restricted environment and that this principle should be cherished by all our schools, special and ordinary. I thank the Minister of State for acknowledging that.</P>
    <P>For some years now difficulties regarding the referral of children with special problems for assessment to health board clinics have been very acute.  This has now reached crisis point.  Children can wait for anything between nine months and a year &mdash; and I have heard of cases of 18 months &mdash; from date of referral to date of assessment.  The queues are growing longer and longer.  Yet this caring Minister chose to let incessant pleas and cries from school principals for help and intervention by her Department fall on deaf ears.  That is the record she is trying to defend in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> I am not blaming the health board psychologists who, I am reliably informed, are already overburdened.  I am informed though that officers at the health boards, because of constant pressure from schools arising from those backlogs, are dodging school principals out of embarrassment and shame.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister is absent tonight.  She very often leaves this House when the heat comes on.  She has often left the Minister of State to deal with questions at Questions Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid the Minister of State the compliment that he spoke honestly and frankly tonight.  The Minister should remember that for every day a child with mild or moderate form of mental handicap is left in limbo considerable damage is done and a grave injustice is inflicted.  Any Minister countenancing such injustice is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>Surely there is a clear duty on a Minister for Education who witnesses such a system fall before her eyes and performs so inefficiently to intervene at the Cabinet table and ensure as an immediate interim step that the resources of both the Departments of Health and Education be brought to bear to reduce the waiting period to a more reasonable duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply no excuse to say that parents sometimes are slow to give consent for referral or that children awaiting referral can be placed in the most convenient special class available.  The latter, although in operation, is merely a cop out and in most instances is administratively impossible.  Again, I regret the failure of the Minister even to refer to the plight of these young children.  Another aspect of this problem refers to the nature and content of the clinical findings passed back from the assessment unit to the class teacher.  There is serious inadequacy of contact between assessment teams and the schools and teachers providing the <Col N="1748" /> educational input.  Very often, therefore, the clinical findings are not meaningfully transmitted into the classroom settings.</P>
    <P>A programme of psychological service to primary schools referred to earlier, would have a very meaningful and worth-while role in ensuring that these findings would have a direct and relevant bearing on all aspects of educational activity within the special, remedial or the ordinary classroom.  Present arrangements are far from satisfactory and the lack of initiative as well as the apparent absence of committment or conviction by the Minister to the needs of this area give a very hollow ring to her sentiments of care and concern.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to act seriously to tackle the development of this area, a programme of psychological service to primary schools involving educational psychologists should be got underway. The Alice in Wonderland mentality has bitten deep into the Department of Education in the past three years.  For all our children's sakes, let us hope it can be rooted out quickly, so that this fairy tale can end.</P>

      <P>We pay lip service to our children by referring to them as the nation's most valuable resource.  Such phraseology comes lightly from the lips of too many politicians.  It is the overriding principle of this Government to pass on the reins of State to the next generation without having mortgaged their future. We will insist that they have a future and a future with the best possible education, having regard to the limits of the Exchequer. Our taxation rates are penal but this results from our having lived beyond our means for years.  Our borrowings, particularly <Col N="1750" /> our foreign borrowings, are much too high as a percentage of GNP. Yet Deputy O'Kennedy suggests that we allow our children a shopping list that will enable them to make a contribution to a fair and more productive society.  We are anxious to ensure that there is a society for them, that the option for them will not be the emigration ship, that they will have jobs and not merely be well educated people on the dole queue.  We must balance this whole argument.  The tragedy of this debate is that basically when we talk about this subject outside these doors we agree on what we consider best for our children in terms of education yet the Opposition come in here and continue this farce as if we differed from them in regard to the educational needs of our children.</P>

      <P>I am speaking here as a member of the back bench committee on education.  There has been reference to the gall of the Minister for indicating one hour after she had assumed office that she was ignorant of what was going on in the country.  Immediately she came and enacted what the previous Minister, Deputy Gerard Brady, had insisted on and had included in the Estimate for 1982.  The Minister for Education ameliorated the worst effects of his Estimates. She insisted that children should not have to bear the brunt of what he had proposed.  Fianna Fáil do not mention the word &ldquo;cuts&rdquo;.  They try to conceal from the people what is happening but they do not fool anyone.  To use the words used by Deputy Brady, they like to restrict current expenditure.  That, in 1983 would have included amendments to the conditions relating to the appointment of teachers in post-primary schools.  Now two and a half years later and when we have ameliorated the worst effects of <Col N="1751" /> those Fianna Fáil policies, they have the gall to produce this motion.  This Government will ensure that all our children will receive the best education that the Exchequer can afford.</P>

Twelve months ago he came to my constituency and denigrated my family.  He has done the same here this evening. However, that may be some kind of inverted tribute from one who, in his own mind anyway, is such an important person.  I can produce headlines from the papers to illustrate the scene he seems to be engaging in.  All I can say is that this portrays something rather sordid in his mentality.  Admittedly, the Minister offered an apology but I cannot let the occasion pass without saying that what I represent is my business and my business only.

      <P>There is a total dichotomy in what the Minister for Education said last evening and what are the facts. She said that two and a half years have elapsed since a debate on education has taken place in the House.  This evening the Minister of State, Deputy Creed, said rightly that there have been many debates on education in that time.  Wherever the script writers do their business, they do not meet in the corridors.  Since I have become spokesperson for Education for my party, we have had three major debates on school transport, one of which was initiated by Deputy Byrne.  The other two also were initiated by us.  In addition, in that time we have had two major debates on the Estimates for Education and we spent two days discussing the so-called action plan on education.  Soon we will have another Estimates debate on Education. Therefore, there have been seven major debates on education in the past two and a half years yet the Minister tells us that two and half years have elapsed since Fianna Fáil have debated education.</P>

      <P>I am in the business of putting together the various thoughts that have been put before the House during the debate so far on this motion. The attitude of the Government and in particular of the Minister for Education is that no one has the right to oppose. One dare not say anything against our Minister on the basis that everything she says is right.  Therefore, if we criticise her we are told that we are looking for media attention.  That is the problem.  The Minister wishes to have all the media attention all of the time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, admitted that we have featured in the headlines. From now until 20 June and thereafter I shall continue to play my role in Opposition. We are not living in some country where there is to be a permanent Government. God forbid that would be the case <Col N="1753" /> so far as this Government are concerned. We are living in a democracy which has within it a Government and a government in waiting.  There is no democracy that does not have an Opposition.  Every democracy has an Opposition and I never heard of a Parliament in which the Opposition were not entitled to put down a motion relating to an important area like education.  However, that is what the Government have said &mdash; last night in the person of the Minister and tonight in the person of the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham.  They do not think that we have any right to put down a motion on education although we are the only party which made any significant attempt to further the cause of education.</P>
      <P>The Minister said last night that no previous Minister for Education ever comes into the House.  We have the honour to have with us tonight Deputy John Wilson, arguably the man who made the greatest input to education and we are glad that he has come in.</P>

      <P>I have several questions to put to the Minister, some of which I asked last night, but none of which has been answered.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Birmingham and Creed, Deputy Avril Doyle and Deputy Carey have all spoken but none of them has answered my questions.  I will ask these questions again tonight and perhaps in the numerous media speeches which the Minister will make in the months ahead &mdash; one gets weary of them &mdash; they will be answered.  Will schools take in four year olds next September?  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Creed, will tell the Minister when he sees her that I want an answer to that question.  As the representative on education for the largest party and on behalf of parents, I want to know if four year olds will be taken into school next September or will it be a case of the Minister giving an interview and then denying what she said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the age of transfer?  The Minister said that she had proposals ready to go to Government in this regard. <Col N="1754" /> School principals, managers, parents, pupils and I want an answer.  Where has this mysterious pool of extra remedial teachers been appointed to?  When are they going to be appointed?  Will the Minister consider my request last night to at least replace school caretakers and primary school secretaries, as schools have been without their services for the last two years?  I make a special plea in regard to caretakers because, in inner city schools, they are essential.  I have had many letters, telephone calls and deputations from harassed, careworn and overworked school principals who find their windows broken and other kinds of vandalism perpetrated on their schools. They cannot cope with the problem and it is taking from the educational content of their daily lives.  As a result, they cannot give time to running their schools.</P>
    <P>I also asked a question three times last night to which I got no reply.  I must now have a reply because the integrity of the Department of Education and their personnel in Marlborough Street is at stake. I quote from the January report of the National Economic and Social Council entitled &ldquo;Economic and Social Policy Assessment&rdquo;.  It is a Government publication which said that the percentage of gross national product spent on education had fallen and will continue to fall.  The Minister said that the gross national product on education had not fallen and that it would continue to rise.  However, the NESC report is clear and concise.  I also want to give notice to the Government, as I have done over the last two years, that I intend to continue as Opposition spokesperson on education doing my job which my constituents sent me here to do and for which Deputy Haughey selected me.  As long as he leaves me in this position, I will continue in that role and I will not be browbeaten by anyone.</P>
    <P>I also intend to show up the shameless hypocrisy of the Minister in speaking about her commitment to equality of opportunity in education for girls.  The greatest constraint on equality of opportunity is the pupil-teacher ratio, and the cutbacks over the last two and a half years mean that girls that have the ability and <Col N="1755" /> brains and who want to get on are unable to do so.  I spoke last night about a school which was brought to my attention in which there are four of the brightest young women in the country who cannot take honours mathematics because the teacher who took that subject has left and has not been replaced even though the Government pay lip service to equality of education for women.  The location of this school prevents its pupils from attending another school to avail of the subject.  If the Minister is seriously committed to equality of education and for access by girls to non-traditional subjects, she should commit herself to resources and stop preaching about it.  When we hear about commitment to curriculum reform, the greatest constraint in that regard is the adverse teacher-pupil ratio. I meet teachers who would dearly wish to participate in reform but there must be provision for such commitment.  The Minister is suspect in this regard and the house of cards which has been so carefully constructed by herself, her Department and various consultants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An irregularity related to concurrent working and signing as unemployed arose in relation to the person in <Col N="1642" /> question as there was subsequently some doubt as to whether he fulfilled the statutory conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance.  He was accordingly instructed to sign the unemployed register daily to prove unemployment.  Following a recent review of the case it has been decided that the current signing arrangements are necessary for the present.  His case will, however, be kept under continuous review.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a family income supplement with effect from 6 September 1984.  His gross family income for the purpose of calculating the amount of the supplement was assessed at £127, comprising his gross earnings of £90 weekly and social welfare benefit payable to his wife.  The amount of supplement awarded, £3.25 represents 25 per cent of the difference between his gross income and the limit of £140 which applies in the case of a family with four qualified children.</P>
      <P>The supplement was awarded for the period beginning on 6 September 1984 and it is the family size at that date which determines the level of payment throughout the period of entitlement.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Her allowance was suspended for two weeks from 21 February 1985 to 6 March 1985.  It was then restored (including the two weeks in question) and at the same time she was awarded an increase of £11.60 per week in her rate of payment in respect of an additional child, backdated to 27 September 1984.  An order book at the increased rate of £62.65 per week payable from 7 March 1985 was sent to the designated post office for collection <Col N="1646" /> by her.  Arrears in respect of the additional child at the rate of £11.60 for the 21 week period from 27 September 1984 to 20 February 1985 (including a double payment on 6 December 1984) came to £255.20, and arrears of the full payment at the increased rate of £62.65 for the two weeks from 21 February 1985 to 6 March 1985, came to £125.30.  A sum of £140.55 was with held from the total of £380.50 and refunded to the South Eastern Health Board for supplementary welfare allowance paid to her by them from the week ending 23 February 1985 to the week ending 9 March 1985 and the balance of £239.95 was sent to her by payable order on 11 April 1985.</P>

      <P>Work permits are not granted until it is clear that the skills and qualifications required for the particular position on offer cannot be found among the available workforce in Ireland or among the European Community.</P>
      <P>The procedures followed by my Department in ensuring that there is no Irish or EC national available involve written communication with the National Manpower Service and with the representative association and, in certain cases, circulation of details of the vacant position to national offices of the European Community Placement Service, SEDOC.  There is also an obligation to ensure that the position of the prospective employee has been regularised with the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>In a substantial number of cases involving health boards, particularly where locum doctors are concerned, applications are submitted for work permits in respect of persons due to take up duty at short notice and the timing of the application makes it extremely difficult to comply with the necessary procedures. My officials have also been obliged to seek additional requirements which on a number of occasions should have been submitted with the original application from the health board.</P>
      <P>My Department are continually striving to improve and streamline the procedures required to administer the work permit system and I am satisfied that every effort is being made to expedite the processing of applications consistent with protecting the legitimate interests of Irish and EC personnel.  The work permit fee of £50 per annum was introduced by the then Minister for Labour in October 1982.</P>
      <P>The total number of work permit applications processed on behalf of the health boards in 1984 was 304 and the number processed to date in 1985 amounts to 169. The number of applications on hand at present amounts to 121 and in the case of 117 of these applications the health boards have been asked to supply either a photograph of the subject or the work permit fee which is required before any work permit may issue.</P>

      <P>The balance of grant due relates to expenditure in respect of materials and craftwork. The conditions of the scheme provide that materials and craftwork grants can be paid only on submission of appropriate receipts of expenditure and of an audited account within two months of completion of the project.  The club was reminded of these conditions in November 1984 but has failed to comply with them.  Payment of the balance of grant due, £3,420, must be withheld until these conditions are complied with.</P>
