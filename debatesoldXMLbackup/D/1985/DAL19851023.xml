      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the progress of the current Anglo-Irish talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a firm date has now been set for his next meeting with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions have been taking place at official and ministerial level between the Government and the British Government with the objective of devising a framework and measures which would help to bring movement towards peace and stability, in place of the violence and instability that have <Col N="2" /> mainly affected Northern Ireland but have also had their impact in this part of Ireland and in Britain.  It is, naturally, the wish of the Government that the talks will be successful in attaining this objective but it is not yet possible to make a final judgement on this.  The discussions are in the concluding stages but have not yet been completed.  When they have been brought to a conclusion and the overall outcome can be seen, the Government will assess it and decide whether it can be recommended for implementation. Until then it would be neither useful nor appropriate to go beyond the terms of the present reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements for any meeting with <Col N="3" /> the British Prime Minister, in accordance with normal practice, would be announced simultaneously in Dublin and London close to the time of the meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of any broad outline from the Government of the way in which the negotiations are taking place and the inordinate length of time these talks are going on, I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that rumour and speculation are constant, indeed rife, about all sorts of suggestions and ideas. The Taoiseach appears to be keeping certain parties aware of what is happening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>A question, please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>While not giving specific details of what is likely to emerge from the talks, could the Taoiseach at least give us specific details of things which will not emerge from the talks? For instance, is there going to be a hot pursuit corridor?  Can the Taoiseach at least give us some indication of what information he is giving to the SDLP? Could this House be told at least as much as other parties outside this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the negative answer which the Deputy seeks, that there is no question of a hot pursuit policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the unprecedented, long and protracted delay in conducting these matters has aroused a great deal of doubt, fear and suspicion in people's minds which have been accentuated by statements by him in which he uses gamblers' language about 50/50 chances?  Is he aware that this is a most unsatisfactory and dangerous way of conducting the affairs of this nation?  Will he acknowledge that these negotiations have gone on for so long that the normal precedent about retaining secrecy and confidentiality can no longer apply, that the situation now is such that he must inform the House, if not about <Col N="4" /> what is taking place in the discussions, at least give us some assurances about what is not being discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to reply to a negative question phrased so broadly.  At least Deputy Mac Giolla asked a specific question.  What is taking place in the negotiations is based on the Forum report.  Our concern is to secure an outcome which would be in accord with and based on the principles set out in Chapter 5.2 which sets out the proposals of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach will not give me any information on that point perhaps he would give me a categoric assurance that, in the name of the Irish people, he will not agree to anything which would undermine Ireland's case for unity or which would be in conflict with the principles of national unity enshrined in our Constitution.  It would not be disclosing any secrets or constitute a breach of any confidentiality if he were to give me that categoric assurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely necessary to give the Deputy the assurance that the Government will do nothing which would be contrary to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach advert to the fact that on a number of occasions he has stated that radical changes in the present structure and method of working of the security forces are necessary to end alienation in Northern Ireland?  May we take it that, without such radical changes, there will be no agreement?  Will the Taoiseach and the Government insist on the removal of the present Chief Constable of the RUC before any agreement in which security might eventually be involved is contemplated? Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he is prepared to continue discussions with a Government, a servant of which is prepared in the middle of those discussions to go to the United States and, in effect, stab him and his colleagues in the back?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has obviously indicated that he was prepared to answer a question on this matter.  I am asking if he is prepared to continue negotiations with a Government, a prominent servant of which behaves in this despicable fashion and, as I said, in effect, stabbed him and his colleagues in the back, or is the Taoiseach prepared to say to the British Government that there can be no further discussions until this matter is cleared up?  On that point, am I right in believing that the British Government have already given what can only be regarded as a contemptuous, inadequate and skimpy reply to the protests made by him and his Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that negotiations are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national television and radio services announced today the terms of a reply given by the British Government and the import of the reply is to the effect, apparently, that there was justification for what this servant of the British Government said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the reply given this day by the British Government to the protest that he made? Is the Taoiseach aware of the contents of the reply given by the British Government today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the contents of the British statement issued today in which, <i>inter alia,</i> it was stated that the speech by the Chief Constable <Col N="7" /> had been seriously misrepresented in the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the statement go on to say that while co-operation on security was satisfactory there was room for improvement, thereby lending justification to and standing over these reprehensible statements by the Chief Constable? Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Secretary of State noted, among other things, that the Chief Constable paid tribute to the Garda force, that the RUC and the Garda had a good relationship along the Border at working level and that there was no lack of will by the Garda to combat terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to accept a situation where, in spite of all his grovelling and protestations, the British Government are prepared to stand over this reprehensible castigation of him and his colleagues and our security forces?  Is he prepared to accept that or are there any limits to which he is not prepared to go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy said, because, as I have just pointed out, it has been stated that the remarks of the Chief Constable were misrepresented and that he said other things which I have just quoted.  The Deputy, therefore, is not working on the basis of information published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of very grave import and importance.  You have ruled out my Private Notice Question because you said it was not urgent.  I will challenge that later but I will not be denied my right to find out from the Taoiseach the Government's exact position on this crucial issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting for the last ten minutes to ask a question. It is a continuation of the original question I asked and it has a direct bearing on the question.  Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a general perception that the SDLP are privy to the negotiations and talks taking place although we are not included and does he agree that this perception by the Unionists will ensure that no matter what comes out of the talks they will bitterly oppose them?  Has there been any attempt to give information to the Unionists or to negotiate with them on the same basis as with the SDLP?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the last question by the Leader of the Opposition as to what the Taoiseach was going to do <Col N="9" /> about the statement made by the Chief Constable of the RUC, could I ask the Taoiseach whether the answer should be &mdash; and always should have been &mdash; that we tell Mrs. Thatcher and company to look after the Border themselves as we do not want it and we are keeping it there with money which we do not have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the Government's position with regard to the IRA and other paramilitary forces. We will do our duty in respect of maintaining the security of the State and in ensuring that the lives of people on this island are protected as far as is in our power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision has been taken about the meeting.  I explained to the Deputy and I thought he had taken on board what I said, that the discussions are in the concluding stages but have not yet been completed.  When they have been brought to a conclusion and the overall outcome can be seen the Government will assess it and decide whether they will recommend it for implementation. In those circumstances the question of the location of the meeting is entirely premature.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have made considerable progress in achieving the objectives set out in the national plan &mdash;<i>Building on Reality</i>.  No serious arguments have come from any quarter for economic policies different from those which underlie the plan.  We are, inevitably, closer to achieving some targets than others.</P>
      <P>Marked progress has been made in curbing the rate of inflation.  Compared with a rate of over 20 per cent in 1981, inflation has been reduced to 5½ per cent. Interest rates have also come down, falling by over four percentage points since the start of the year.  Mortgage rates have now fallen to 9¾ per cent per annum, the lowest level since 1977 including a fall of over 3 per cent since March last.  Irish mortgage rates are now 3 per cent below those in the UK.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has also been made on the balance of payments front. Compared with a deficit of almost 15 per cent of national output in 1981, the deficit this year should be down to less than 4 per cent of output in line with the plan.</P>
      <P>Employment performance has not been as strong as had been hoped for. Despite the welcome improvement in the unemployment figures for September there has been a strong upward movement in unemployment this year.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of contributory factors to this disappointing outturn, including the higher than expected level of interest rates that prevailed earlier in the year, the slower than expected startup of the social employment scheme and the greater tendency of school leavers to register as unemployed while seeking their first jobs or before going on to further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the OECD innovation report to which Deputy Haughey referred in one of his questions, I should point out that the time frame of the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> is 1985 <Col N="12" /> to 1987 whereas the time frame of the OECD report is from 1985 to the year 2000.  This obviously invalidates any comparison of projections underlying these separate documents.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism will be making a definitive statement shortly on the action to be taken arising from the OECD innovation report.</P>
    <P>In considering what measures should be brought forward now in response to the disappointing experience with unemployment, the Government have to have regard to the position of the public finances which we inherited from our predecessors. There is no realistic or responsible alternative but to continue to work within the framework established in the plan for an improvement in the state of the public finances.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly irresponsible for the Government to abandon the thrust of the plan's financial policies.  The fiscal objectives set out in the plan were described by the EC in their Annual Economic Report 1985-1986, published recently, as the minimum amount of progress which is compatible with ensuring a halt to the situation where growing debt interest payments have pre-empted the real growth in national resources.</P>
    <P>The Government have firmly committed themselves not to finance increased spending by any increases in the burden of taxation as a proportion of national output.  This is why there is so little room for manoeuvre in relation to public service pay.  Equally new measures to expand employment cannot have a significant net impact on Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government have reviewed progress on the national plan and consider it appropriate to introduce additional measures to boost employment creation and to improve the process of tax collection and enforcement with a view to bringing the employment and public finances position closer into line with the plan expectations.  I will be dealing with these measures in my statement after the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>I will be arranging to send copies of that statement this afternoon to members <Col N="13" /> of the National Economic and Social Council and I will be asking them to discuss the proposals in it with me at a meeting which I have requested for Friday, 1 November.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at meetings with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and employer and farming organisations last July, I would intend that the meetings in NESC could be followed by meetings with the social partners separately.  I am, of course, together with my colleagues in Government, prepared to meet with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at any mutually agreed time to discuss matters of common interest to the Government and to Congress.</P>

      <P>Neither the British Prime Minister, the Chief Constable of the RUC nor anyone else outside this jurisdiction is involved in the simple question I addressed to the Taoiseach, namely, if he has any plans to meet the Congress of Trade Unions to discuss pay, jobs and taxation.  It is a very simple question, capable of a yes or no answer. May I remind the Taoiseach that the question originates from the fact that the Government stated that there would be no question of discussing anything except the public service pay freeze in their statement of 14 August?  Is it the position that he is now prepared to discuss a much broader agenda, including pay, employment and taxation reform?  If this is now the position, why could it not have been the position on 14 August last, thereby avoiding the unprecedented withdrawal of labour by the entire public service?</P>

I am trying to find out if he is prepared to discuss with Congress this broad agenda to which I have referred.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach two supplementary questions?  Having regard to the fact that the plan was based on certain things developing, such as the <Col N="17" /> extent of world trade, average earnings per head with our main trading partners, consumer prices compared with our main trading partner countries and so on to what extent have those projections been realised and what effect will they have on the plan?  Secondly, what has happened as regards the social employment scheme mentioned in the plan to achieve a participation level of 10,000 within a year?  What is the progress made to date in that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first question, there are a number of external factors which influence our situation. One which has evolved favourably, and somewhat more favourably than the plan targets envisaged, is the level of interest rates which have declined more rapidly than we foresaw.  The volume of world trade is a little less buoyant than we projected at that time but I do not think the divergence is great.  There are a number of factors involved and I do not know which ones the Deputy wishes to pursue but I have mentioned two important points.  The Deputy's second question dealt with the social employment scheme.  I understand that 9,000 jobs have been approved and provided for and they are being taken up as rapidly as can be arranged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the questions the Taoiseach took together, I had one asking about the proposed meeting with the Congress of Trade Unions and I did not get a satisfactory reply.  I can only deduce from that that the Taoiseach does not know whether he is coming or going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have a question down about targets in the document <i>Building on Reality</i>...  I want to ask the Taoiseach specifically about some targets in that document.  First there is the question of unemployment.  The Taoiseach will recall that the document indicated that unemployment would peak at 220,000 at the end of 1984.  Does he not <Col N="18" /> now admit that that was totally unrealistic and that the unemployment projections are unattainable?  Secondly, does he accept that the document which projected for 1986 a figure for public service pay of £2,525 million is no longer realistic or attainable?  Thirdly, does he accept that we are in 1985, never mind 1986, heading for the greatest single largest budget deficit ever recorded in this country in terms of volume, size or amount and also in terms of percentage of GNP?  So far as these critical areas are concerned, will he not admit that the document is totally out of line and should be withdrawn and something more realistic put in its place?</P>

With regard to unemployment, I made it clear in my reply that the level of unemployment is higher than projected in the plan.

In the current year the target is 7.9 per cent but it will be marginally exceeded as a result of a shortfall of revenue and some excess expenditure.</P>

Is it possible that the Government are beginning to see the light and to realise that helping the building and construction industry is the only way to reduce our unemployment queues, reduce the deficits about which there is so much talk and give some hope to our people?  There are many useful projects outstanding and we have the manpower to carry out this work.

      <P>asked the Taoiseach in view of the publicly reported delays in the presentation of books of evidence in criminal prosecutions, if he will provide information on the extent of this problem and the number of cases thereby dismissed in the past 12 months; and the action he has taken to rectify this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the measures being taken to ensure that books of evidence are produced on time in view of the circumstances surrounding a charge which was struck out in the Dublin District Court on August 9 because of the non-production of the book of evidence, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Attorney General that he has made himself aware of the facts of this case.  Counsel who was retained by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prepare the book of evidence in the case did not do so before the date fixed by the District Court for its production, and the district justice struck out the charge.  Another counsel was then nominated by the Director and he has prepared the book of evidence.  The Attorney General is satisfied that, contrary to some newspaper reports, no <Col N="23" /> default can be attributed to any member of the Chief State Solicitor's staff in this matter.  The General Council of the Bar of Ireland have informed the Attorney General that they are investigating a complaint of delay on the part of a member of the junior bar which they have received from relatives of the victim. Since a warrant has been issued for the arrest of the accused person in question, that prosecution is <i>sub judice</i> and it would not be proper for me to say anything further about that particular case.</P>
    <P>There are no records of the exact number of cases which were struck out in the past 12 months for non-presentation of the book of evidence within the time fixed by district justices.  However, I understand that in the great majority of such cases the book was subsequently presented and directions were given to recharge the accused person.</P>
    <P>As for the preparation of books of evidence generally, I am informed by the Attorney General that there are a number of reasons why their preparation may be delayed on occasion.  For example, gardaí or civilian witnesses whose evidence has to be included in the book of evidence may not be available through illnesses, absence on holidays or other cause, thus delaying the completion of the Garda file on which the book is based. There has also been a substantial increase in the number of criminal cases coming before the courts.</P>
    <P>In addition, some time ago, there was a significant shortage of staff in the office of the Chief State Solicitor resulting from the effect of the embargo on recruitment to the public service.  This was a cause of delay in the production of books of evidence by that office, which prepares the book of evidence in the great majority of cases in the courts in Dublin.  Following representations by the Attorney General, the Government decided that the Minister for the Public Service should authorise an exception to the embargo and extra staff have, as a result, been appointed to the office of the Chief State Solicitor.  This has produced a considerable improvement in the situation and <Col N="24" /> a continuing improvement is anticipated when the recruitment of the balance of the authorised extra staff, now in progress, has been completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland:</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the action taken by the Government since these questions were tabled, what action did the Taoiseach and the Government take in the last two years to improve the output and efficiency of the office of Chief State Solicitor where books of evidence are prepared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The efficiency of the office has improved considerably over that period but the details of that are a matter for a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put it to the Taoiseach that in the last week or so, since the question was tabled, an effort was made to increase slightly the level of staffing in the office but he ignored the warnings from the Judiciary about the delays in providing books of evidence over the last two years at least.  Will the Taoiseach make a statement in relation to the sad and tragic event which resulted in a person charged with murder being released from our courts because the book of evidence could not be produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not clarified the matter.  Will he inform the House why the accused in this case was not arrested following his release and recharged?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that in March Deputy De Rossa brought to his attention the staffing problem in this office and that he replied that the number of solicitors employed in the Dublin District Courts section of the Chief State Solicitor's office on 1 January 1981 was 13 and on 1 January 1985 was seven?  What steps did the Taoiseach take <Col N="25" /> when this grave matter was brought to his notice, a problem that resulted from this crude embargo that everybody has drawn the Taoiseach's attention to? What steps did the Taoiseach take to ensure that the problem was corrected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  Authority has been given to recruit additional staff despite the embargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done since this incident occurred but is the Taoiseach aware that this is a direct result &mdash; as the Taoiseach admitted in his reply &mdash; of Minister Boland's crude embargo system which is having similar results in many other areas of the public service? Will the Taoiseach lift the embargo system which is causing these problems in many areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is a bit more complex.  There was a reduction in the number of law clerks available and as a result some solicitors undertook the work of law clerks and barristers were brought in to undertake the work of solicitors. The position now is that an addition to the number of staff has been authorised and they are being recruited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put it to the Taoiseach that if he, and the Government, had ensured that the level of staffing in the office of the Chief State Solicitor was up to the required standard this problem would not have developed. Therefore, the Government must accept responsibility for the tragic position that resulted following the striking out of the charge by the district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy would know had he listened to my reply, that is absolutely incorrect.  The problem did not arise from problems in the office of the Chief State Solicitor but arose because counsel were not ready with their part of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put it to the Taoiseach that the district justice <Col N="26" /> deferred for one month the presentation of the book of evidence.  What action was taken by the office of the Chief State Solicitor to ensure that the book of evidence was produced within that period? It was nothing short of negligence on the part of the Government, the Taoiseach and the office of the Chief State Solicitor that action was not taken to ensure that within the month granted by the district justice the book of evidence was prepared. Surely somebody in the Taoiseach's Department, if not himself, or somebody in the office of the Chief State Solicitor should have taken steps to ensure that the book of evidence was produced after that month.  It was nothing short of a disgrace that that was not done and it represents total negligence on the part of somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Deputy listened he would have heard my reply to that, which was that the Attorney General was satisfied that, contrary to some newspaper reports, no default can be attributed to any member of the Chief State Solicitor's staff in this matter.  The problem arose in relation to counsel preparing the book of evidence.  Every effort was made to get that done on time.  It was not done on time and certain consequences have followed from that.</P>

      <P>The offer of the Ernie O'Malley Art Collection as a gift to the State was made conditional on the collection being housed in a museum in Castlebar, County Mayo, to be constructed and maintained by public funds.  This Government, in the light of the capital and running costs involved in the project, confirmed the decision of the previous Minister for Education taken in July 1982 <Col N="32" /> with the agreement of the then Tánaiste and Minister for Finance not to proceed with the provision of that museum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a number of points, many of them incorrect. The offer of the gift was made clearly on condition that the collection would be housed in a purpose built building in Castlebar.  The cost of that, in 1981 terms, was in the region of £417,000 with an ongoing cost of £60,000 per annum for running it.  The collection is valuable.  It was valued by the William Doyle Galleries of New York in 1978 and updated in 1981 at $412,000.  Some of the items in it are valued at between $10,000 and $25,000 but 70 per cent of the items fall into the range of between $10 and $300. In view of this the Government confirmed the decision of the Minister for Education in the Government of which the Deputy was a member not to proceed.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be drawn into what any other Administration did. I am asking the Minister why he has not availed of the opportunity to repatriate some considerably expensive documents and other priceless artefacts which could be acquired for this State for a small sum. It has been suggested in the west that if Mr. Ernie O'Malley's widow had bequeathed this collection to be located in Sligo town, the money would have been found fast enough.  The Minister is <Col N="33" /> committing an act of cultural savagery so far as the west is concerned.  It is about time the Minister practised what he preaches to others and did something for the cultural aspects of this country.</P>

On the logical arguments produced by that Minister, we had to agree that it was the correct decision in view of the expenditure involved.  There was ample time since 1978, when the Ernie O'Malley collection was first offered, ample time under three Fianna Fáil Administrations, if they wished to proceed with the proposal to have it located in Castlebar, but they did not.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice in the wake of the recent riots and damage to State property at Fort Mitchel, the action he has now taken to remedy the frightening defects revealed in the management and security of the prison and to provide adequate protection for civilian occupants of the island as well as his own Garda and prison staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> At the outset a Cheann Comhairle, I think it right to say that I deplore the tone of the Deputy's question in so far as it relates to criticism of prison management.  I have already pointed out to the spokesman for the Deputy's party that it is wrong to make critical comments about those who are not in a position to defend themselves against charges of this kind either in this House or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I have already said in this House on the many occasions on which the issue of Fort Mitchel has been raised by Deputies, the Government's decision to utilise Fort Mitchel to house prisoners was made against a background of a rising prison population and in the knowledge that no purpose built prison accommodation was available or likely to be available until 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts of prison management to make Fort Mitchel a workable custodial institution, despite its inherent drawbacks, deserve the highest praise.  It is worth recording that in the space of a few <Col N="35" /> months over 120 prisoners were being accommodated there.  The fact that Fort Mitchel was able to cope with those numbers during the months when, traditionally, the prison population reaches a peak was a major contribution to efforts to combat crime, particularly the epidemic earlier this year of car stealing.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing for families on the island, six have already left, five to local authority housing in Passage West and the sixth to private accommodation. Of the two remaining families, one has acquired private accommodation in Cobh and the last family will be rehoused in Passage West.  I would like to publicly acknowledge the assistance of Cork County Council in securing the rehousing of these families.</P>
    <P>To turn to the final part of the Deputy's question, I think it must be accepted that the job of both gardaí and prison officers can never be made entirely free of any element of risk, but all concerned with the deployment of staff obviously are concerned to avoid unnecessary risk.  No reduction in the number of prison staff assigned to Fort Mitchel or the number of gardaí who perform duty there during the hours of darkness has taken place despite the reduction in the number of prisoners which occurred following the disturbance.</P>
    <P>Fort Mitchel now accommodates 50 or so prisoners and the number will be increased to 80 or so in a few months' time.  The question of major development of the remainder of the fort is at present under consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it extremely difficult to hear the Minister's reply.  It is important if we are to make any constructive contribution that we should be able to hear the Minister.  In order to establish the extent of the problem we are talking about I ask the Minister to inform the House of the cost of repairing the damage to Fort Mitchel arising from the prison riot which took place there.  Will the Minister please now inform us of the cost of bringing about the necessary repairs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There will not be a cost of bringing about necessary repairs.  If we redevelop Fort Mitchel it will be developed as a secure prison and it will be a new developed prison. The question of repairs to damage in A Block will not arise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It would be very difficult to give a cost relating to a building which was built in 1806 and was added to at various points during the intervening years.  The damage in large part consisted of the destruction of wooden floors and wooden ceilings which the prison authorities had intended taking out anyway and replacing with concrete floors and concrete ceilings. According to preliminary reports the walls and roof of the prison remain intact and structurally sound.  It will not be put back as it was.  If there are development plans for Fort Mitchel it will be developed as a secure prison.  Sketch plans are being drawn up at the moment to evaluate the possibility of doing that.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;following the burning of the prison that repairs would have to be carried out.  I will leave that for the moment and put it to the Minister that a major contributing factor to the riots in Fort Mitchel was the category of prisoners sent there, some of whom were committed on very serious charges and, I hold, most unsuited to an open prison.  In the light of that costly and embarrassing experience, will the Minister assure the House that this will not occur again?  Can <Col N="37" /> he give the House details in relation to the screening process which took place within the existing prison system to select the prisoners allocated to Fort Mitchel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are no saints in prison and, since I have introduced a number of alternatives to imprisonment, particularly the Community Service Orders Act, quite a number of people who have been in prison over the past 12 months are now serving sentences to work rather than sentences of imprisonment.  One of the consequences of that to which people have not adverted is that the level of the offenders who are in prison now in terms of difficulty is higher than it was and those in prison now on average are of a more violent nature than was the case before we developed alternatives for care in the community.  If we take that segment out of the prison system, the next segment of a less offensive nature we deal with are those who go into open centres, to Shelton Abbey and Loughan House, for example.  So the catetory designated for Spike Island was a category above that. Any prisoner who was moved from another prison to Fort Mitchel on Spike Island was moved on the basis of the recommendation of the prison in which that prisoner was serving his sentence.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There has been no reduction in availability of training facilities in the prisons.  In relation to education services, it is intendded to have the unit at Cork returned to educational use when work which has started on a new cell block is completed in, it is hoped, about six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that last Friday I met a deputation from the City of Cork <Col N="38" /> Vocational Education Committee to discuss the situation and to see what could be done in the interim to improve the services available.  Certain proposals which will, if implemented, in my view lead to an improvement in the situation were discussed and are being considered. I should say that I was pleased to learn that 89 prisoners are attending at least one class per week at the moment compared to 90 attending one class per week before the purpose built unit was taken over for accommodation purposes and I would like to congratulate the teachers on their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the case of Arbour Hill Prison, educational services were, in the main, relocated in a pre-fab previously used for educational purposes while other classes were continued in the purpose built unit. The question of restoring the purpose built unit depends on the availability generally of accommodation for prisoners.  I am at present reviewing this question.</P>

If I had gone ahead with the total building programme envisaged by our predecessors, the consultancy and architectural costs of which were £13 million, I would not have had accommodation any sooner.  As a matter of fact, I went ahead with the Wheatfield project in Clondalkin which was most advanced at the time and that will provide us with accommodation in mid 1987.  Any other part of the building programme which I cancelled due to enormous cost would not have provided any accommodation sooner than the summer of 1987.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Provision of a treatment unit as part of the prison system along the lines apparently intended by the Deputy has not been recommended by any of the various bodies who have examined this matter. The question of the provision of treatment for prisoners addicted to drugs is a complex one and general experience indicates that treatment in a coercive setting is not conducive to achieving the desired result.  What is needed is the active support of the addict, on a voluntary basis, and where there are indications that an individual prisoner has the necessary commitment I am prepared to consider releasing that prisoner to attend at a treatment centre such as Coolmine. The question of providing a separate unit for the screening and detoxification of drug-addicted prisoners has been considered from time to time but due to pressure on accommodation no such unit has been provided.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As a result of the very effective work of the Garda there are now behind bars a number of people who are addicted to drugs.  This is an absolute consequence of the effective attack on the drug problem on our streets.  There are drug treatment facilities available to prisoners in Mountjoy.  That is the only prison in which the problem exists.  The facilities include detoxification and good co-operation with the drug unit in Jervis Street hospital.  Any prisoner who is not violent by nature will be sent by me to the Coolmine centre or to one of its associated houses.  The difficulty arises in respect of persons with drug problems who have to be kept within the prison <Col N="40" /> system on grounds of security or of propensity to violence.  For those prisoners I am trying to provide the best possible facilities within Mountjoy in order to ensure that they will be given treatment for their addiction.</P>
      <P>Professional groups &mdash; chaplains, for example &mdash; have remarked that drug addicts enter prison frequently in very poor physical condition but that their general health condition improves dramatically after from four to six weeks as a result of the care and attention given them.  Dr. Geoffrey Dean of the Medico-Social Research Board made the same point during an RTE interview following the publication of the MSRB report on drug abuse in the north inner city.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to answer Questions Nos. 33 and 34 with Priority Question No. 38.  As <Col N="41" /> announced on 25 September 1985, the Government decided to set up a tribunal to assess <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to victims of the Stardust disaster and their families.  As stated in that announcement the Government were concerned that the agony suffered by the victims of the tragedy and their families should be brought to an end as soon as possible.  In accordance with that decision the scheme of compensation for personal injuries suffered at the Stardust, Artane, on 14 February 1981 was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday, 22 October 1985.</P>
      <P>A notice concerning the scheme appeared in today's national newspapers which, <i>inter alia</i>, states that copies of the scheme and application forms are available from the office of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The staff of the tribunal will process applications in the first instance.  The assessment of claims by the tribunal will depend on how quickly the necessary documentation is submitted and processed.</P>
      <P>It was precisely because of the delays being experienced prior to the initiation of legal proceedings &mdash; and to be expected in the course of such proceedings &mdash; that the Government took the decision mentioned.  The Deputy will, however, appreciate that it would not be open to me to intervene in any way in these proceedings.  I have no doubt, however, that the question of expediting any cases that may go to court rather than to the tribunal is something that can be considered by the courts hearing them and the parties to each case.</P>

Can the Minister tell us whether there is any way whereby we could have a statement from him or from the Taoiseach about this tribunal so that we might tease out various aspects <Col N="42" /> of it?  Is the Minister aware that many of the victims and their families are confused about the issue?  They are in grave difficulty in trying to decide whether to proceed through the courts or through the tribunal.  It is a matter for us to have the maximum possible disclosure of all the relevant factors in order to help these people to reach a wise decision, a decision that will be in their own best interest.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot do as I ask now, but there is one point that is of much concern to these families, that is, that if they opt to go before the tribunal their own costs can be covered by the award from the tribunal but the defendants' costs in these actions will not be covered by way of awards to them by the tribunal.  This could have a very serious effect on the outcome for each individual or family.  What is at stake is a crucial matter.  Is the Minister prepared to say that he will come before the House on some occasion and give us an opportunity to tease out the various aspects of this issue?</P>

      <P>May I, on the Order of Business, raise with you, A Cheann Comhairle, two matters with regard to Question Time?  I want to draw your attention to a very serious matter which took place with regard to a question I put down in relation to the Stardust Tribunal. That tribunal was announced by the Taoiseach and the matter is being handled by the Attorney General who is part of the Taoiseach's office establishment.  I addressed my question to the Taoiseach in the interests of my constituents, a question which was designed to do nothing more than extract and secure information for the guidance of the families and the individuals concerned &mdash; a question which was very timely because the tribunal was about to start work.  Apparently the Taoiseach's office decided last Friday that that question should be transferred to the Minister for Justice. Because the draw for Justice questions had already taken place, my question could not get into the Justice sector of the Question Time agenda this week.  I want to complain seriously to you, Sir, about this behaviour by the Taoiseach in regard to this matter.  It is not a political matter.  It is something about which most <Col N="274" /> people in this House are agreed.  It was totally outside politics.  My question had no purpose whatsoever except to help those unfortunate families.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want to draw your attention to the fact that in my view you have behaved very unfairly and injudiciously in ruling out a very important and urgent question by me today, a Private Notice Question in regard to the behaviour of the Chief Constable of the RUC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the question of the Stardust matter, I explained fully to Deputy Haughey yesterday why I acted as I did, that I had to, strictly in accordance with the Standing Order.  First, I am giving this explanation because it is not a ruling.  I am explaining how the Standing Order concerned works.  It has been the practice here since the foundation of this House that the Chair is not responsible for, nor has he any part in, the transfer of questions from one Minister to another.  That has always been the practice and has always been the ruling of the Chair.  In regard to the fact that Deputy Haughey's question could not be taken, in accordance with an order made by this House the ballot for today's Justice questions had to be held last Thursday.  Without wishing to appear to be smart, as things turned out it would not have made any difference because all the Justice questions were non-runners.  None of the balloted ones was reached.  However, that might not have been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the case today.  I am talking about the Justice questions.  That being so, the question which was transferred to Justice could not be put in the ballot.  Instead it had to be put at the end of the questions.  The Chair had no option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Private Notice Question about which the Deputy complained today, that is the question concerning the statements made by the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland, the Chair conveyed his ruling to Deputy Haughey through his <Col N="275" /> private secretary, which was strictly in accordance with rules, Standing Orders and precedents relating to Private Notice Questions.  If Deputy Haughey wishes to discuss the matter further with me, I shall be only too glad to do so.  I am not prepared to discuss it here.  If I were to do that, it would involve a <i>post mortem</i> on every ruling of mine, which would make the Chair's position quite untenable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to discuss the matter with you.  I just want to register a very strong protest about your ruling and your decision in the matter.  I think that it was misguided and that you have been unfair to the Opposition in this matter and, indeed, unfair to the general public, but I shall leave that for another day.  I accept, Sir, your outline of what took place in regard to my question about the Stardust Tribunal.  I want to ask the Taoiseach, through you, if it was on his instructions that his office at this late stage directed that this question be transferred to the Minister for Justice?</P>

From the beginning of the matter of the Stardust tragedy, I had no motive except to be of assistance to the families and the victims.  I want to ask the Taoiseach why he personally &mdash; or, if not, somebody in his office &mdash; had this matter dealt with in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to announce to the House this afternoon a series of actions which the Government have agreed as part of our programme to combat the twin evils that afflict our country &mdash; unemployment and the issue of equity in our taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, in answering questions about the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, I <Col N="277" /> outlined the background against which these actions were decided.  We are, as I have said, concentrating on the fight against unemployment.  We are doing so for this reason &mdash; my Government believe that there is no more important issue, in terms even of the basic dignity to which people are entitled, than the problem of unemployment.  That is why the Government have decided on the following measures designed to be consistent with our budgetary strategy.  First, the Custom House dock site will be acquired for a major re-development programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A special development authority will be established to promote and control the development of the site. We will be making available a wide range of incentives that will stimulate investment in construction.  Among the incentives we will be introducing for the Custom House site are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;100 per cent capital allowance on non-industrial buildings;</P>
      <P>&mdash;section 23 type relief on new dwellings;</P>
      <P>&mdash;double rent allowance offset against tax for traders;</P>
      <P>&mdash;full rates relief for ten years. </P>
      <P>Second, we are instituting an additional programme of inner city development and reconstruction in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are designating the areas running from the Custom House northwards to Mountjoy Square and along the quays from approximately Grattan Bridge to Guinness.  We will be making available the following range of incentives in respect of these designated areas:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a 50 per cent capital allowance for commercial development;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;a new 5 per cent tax allowance on the purchase price of private dwellings <Col N="278" /> which will apply annually for ten years;</P>
    <P>&mdash;double rent allowance offset against tax.</P>
    <P>&mdash;full rates relief for ten years. </P>
    <P>Third, we will also designate specific areas in Cork and Limerick to attract incentives designed to meet the needs of those cities.</P>
    <P>Fourth, a new scheme of home improvement grants will be established, providing for grants up to £2,000, to enable householders to carry out improvements to their homes.  There will be grants of up to £5,000 to facilitate the rehabilitation of older houses.  All these grants will be available to be used in the employment of registered building contractors.</P>
    <P>Fifth, a programme of improved community and leisure facilities and other general amenities is being introduced. Five million pounds is being made available to develop these much needed facilities and it is intended that this money will be spent principally in urban areas. Specific proposals in this regard will be brought forward in the very near future by the Ministers for the Environment and Labour.</P>
    <P>Sixth, in furtherance of the objectives set in the Government's recent White Paper on Tourism, to lengthen the season and attract young tourists, special new grants are being given to develop better facilities at hotels and guesthouses. Grants will be made available up to a maximum of £30,000, and the investment that these grants totalling £2 million will generate will yield a substantial number of jobs.</P>
    <P>Seventh, the development of the natural gas grid will be accelerated.  The Government have decided in particular to extend the grid to Limerick and Waterford, bringing the benefits of gas, together with a substantial number of construction jobs to a number of cities, towns and industries that do not enjoy them at present.</P>
    <P>Eight, the number of new employees <Col N="279" /> eligible for aid under the employment incentive scheme will be doubled.</P>
    <P>Nine, in order to stimulate new employment a scheme of exemption from PRSI contributions by employers will be introduced for the tax year 1986-87.  The exemption will apply to additional new full time employees taken on by any private employer between now and 31 March, who have been on the live register for at least six months.</P>
    <P>Ten, the Government also have in mind further proposals, in particular</P>
    <P>&mdash;to modify employer PRSI contributions in order to favour the labour intensive industries, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to overhaul the disability benefit scheme with a view to reducing the costs of absenteeism </P>
    <P>and we will be consulting with the NESC in relation to these and other issues which I will be raising later.</P>
    <P>Responsible Ministers will be giving full details of these employment measures over the next few days.  As the House will see, the measures involve the encouragement of private spending by means of tax incentives and by grant assistance. These grants will be financed by reductions in less essential spending. Existing schemes are also being improved in the light of experience; and some aspects of social insurance are being overhauled.</P>
    <P>These proposals should be looked at in the context of the Government's overall strategic approach &mdash; an approach which has resulted in much progress in correcting the factors that have inhibited growth and that have slowed the prospects for recovery.  These proposals are a coherent development of existing policies.</P>
    <P>When I met, at the end of July last, the representatives of the trade unions and employer and farming organisations, I indicated to them that the Government intended to discuss, initially with NESC and subsequently with the social partners separately, the proposals emerging from an assessment they had just made of the current economic situation.  We also <Col N="280" /> intend to discuss with them the opportunity and need the Government see to accelerate and intensify the employment thrust of the national plan by means that do not impinge unfavourably on the over-strained public finances.</P>
    <P>I am sending a copy of this statement to the members of the National Economic and Social Council with a request to meet them on Friday, 1 November to discuss and consult with them on the proposals in the way I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Those who would question our commitment to the unemployed might care to contrast it with the commitment of the Opposition.  That commitment was very succinctly summed up, as recently as Sunday last, by the Leader of the Opposition, who blithely announced that if returned to office he would repeal a Bill which, judging by his comments, he does not seem to have read, and in so doing would abolish the NDC, the largest single commitment made by any Government to job creation since the establishment of the IDA, which was also opposed by Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Turning to the question of taxation, new measures have been agreed by Government that will substantially improve the process of tax collection and enforcement.</P>
      <P>While there have been misunderstandings about the amounts of tax arrears the fact remains, however, that there are serious deficiencies in the collection process which should be corrected without further delay.</P>
      <P>A more vigorous approach in dealing with tax abuse is needed.  Public opinion must be mobilised to improve tax compliance. It is important that the defaulter should be identified and punished.  Payment of taxes is a civic obligation and delays due to inefficiencies or for other reasons help to shield defaulters who exploit slackness in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that in our society, among the majority who pay what they owe honestly and fairly, there are still more than a few prepared to rip off the rest of the <Col N="281" /> community for the sake of their own gain. These &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; are a contributory factor in the burden that honest working people carry.</P>
    <P>The measures I am announcing are a further phase in eliminating this scandal, and in ensuring that the people who are robbing the ordinary taxpayer are dealt with.  Any increase in yield will be used to alleviate the burden carried by the PAYE sector, and the extra fairness that we are introducing into the tax system will be a reassurance of equity to the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The measures that we are introducing are, in outline, as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Government will encourage employers and unions to establish committees at the level of individual business to ensure that PRSI and PAYE payments are deducted and are transmitted promptly to the Revenue. The Government will discuss this proposal with the NESC and, if necessary, make statutory arrangements for involvement of employees in the payment process.</P>
    <P>&mdash;In order to avoid the delays and administrative costs associated with estimated assessments made because tax returns are not forwarded on time, a surcharge will be applied where accounts and returns are not submitted to the Revenue within a specified period.  Implementation of this new procedure which will bring about a radical change in the tax collection process will begin in the 1986-87 tax year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The special inquiry units in the office of the Revenue Commissioners, who have a good record of success in countering tax exasion, are being expanded.  Since establishment these units have uncovered around 9,000 cases which had been escaping tax liability.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Small local collection units will be established on a pilot basis to pursue arrears of tax prior to enforcement. Each unit is expected to consist of four officers.  These local collectors <Col N="282" /> will make personal visits on occasion to taxpayers failing to meet due liability. Both the inquiry unit and the new local units will give special attention to the building industry where, the evidence suggests, evasion is particularly widespread.  This is seriously disadvantageous to the many honest firms in that business.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The functions of county registrars in regard to debt enforcement generally will be assigned to sheriffs.  At present there are sheriffs only in Dublin and Cork. </P>

      <P>&mdash;Sheriffs will be made more accountable to the Revenue Commissioners in regard to tax enforcement and the relevant law will be updated to remove some anomalies and to facilitate implementation of the powers of seizure.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Up to now the powers of seizure have, in many instances, not been a deterrent to tax defaulters because of the widespread conviction that these powers will not be invoked. They will be invoked in future.</P>
      <P>&mdash;New arrangements to ensure closer contact and co-operation at local level between the inspectorates of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare are being put in place.  These will further reduce tax avoidance and evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;The tax clearance scheme for public sector contracts introduced in 1983, and which at present applies to main contractors only, will now be <Col N="283" /> extended to cover the sub-contractors engaged on public contracts by the main contractors.  In this way, it will be ensured that all contractors and sub-contractors employed on public contracts will meet their legal liabilities in relation to taxation and social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Some public sector organisations have not yet begun to implement the tax clearance certificate requirements in respect of their contracts. They are being required to do so at once.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Minister for Finance will have discussions with employer and trade union representatives in the construction sector to identify what further action may be required to counter abuses.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An outside expert will be brought in to the office of the Revenue Commissioners to direct and advise on the implementation of reforms and to develop ways and means of further improving collection and enforcement including, if necessary, restructuring of the office. </P>
    <P>The new tax enforcement measures are a major step forward.  Implementation of these proposed changes will have a very significant effect in improving tax compliance. Success, however, will depend to some extent on changing attitudes towards tax abuse.  An efficient tax administration must have the co-operation of the public in identifying and defeating tax abuse.  It is very much to the benefit of the ordinary taxpayer who pays his taxes honestly and promptly that the administration of tax collection be improved and that tax defaulters be brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The present taxation package is not intended to be the final word on reorganisation of the collection and enforcement process.  The Government expect to have before them shortly reports from the Commission on Taxation and from the Interdepartmental Working Group on Tax Enforcement which was established <Col N="284" /> earlier this year.  The Government will examine carefully the recommendations put forward in both reports and they will implement quickly such recommendations as they consider will provide scope for further improvements in the system of tax administration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to think he has no say in the workings of anything, particularly the workings of the country. I am asking the Taoiseach, as head of the Government, as the person responsible for arranging the business of the House, to allow a proper debate on the proposals he has just put forward.  Otherwise we will be involving ourselves in an extraordinary way to do the nation's business. It is outrageous to use this parliamentary procedure for an entirely different purpose, to announce a programme of what purports to be economic action and tax reform.  I compare this procedure today with the carry on at the launching of <i>Building of Reality</i>.  We went over to the gilded halls of Iveagh House and assembled all the industrialists, trade unions and friendly commentators from RTE and elsewhere to hear the words of wisdom and to accept a great new economic dogma being laid down.  On this occasion the Taoiseach comes here, reads out a statement, following a procedure aimed at an entirely different target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this package is meant to be taken seriously, we must be given an opportunity <Col N="286" /> to discuss it and debate it here.  There are many things in it that have to be teased out, looked at carefully.  The Taoiseach came in at short notice to deliver this package, hastily cobbled together in an attempt to deflect public anger from the Government's disastrous performance. The public know that the Government have failed totally to deal with unemployment, or to do anything about the exorbitant level of taxation, or to improve public finances, or make the slightest progress in economic and social matters.</P>
    <P>How many times have we heard it all before?  First of all we had the <i>Joint Programme for Government</i>.  Then we had <i>Building on Reality</i>.  At the beginning of this year we had the 1985 budget which was supposed to be a major package of tax reform.  Can I recall for the Taoiseach that his <i>Joint Programme for Government</i> promised &ldquo;to halt and reverse the growth of unemployment&rdquo;.  That promise was made as a basic plank of the Government at a time when unemployment was at 170,000.  Today it is at least 230,000, and of course that figure is an unreal one because we all know there has been and is massive emigration of young people. Without that massive emigration, that figure would be a great deal higher.  Even the most optimistic economist would accept that by the end of the year unemployment will be between 240,000 and 250,000, under a Government which at the beginning put in as their objective &ldquo;to halt and reverse the growth of unemployment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then we had <i>Building on Reality</i>, launched with great pomp in Iveagh House. That document stated that unemployment would peak at 220,000 in December 1984.  Already it is 230,000 and pushing up to 240,000.  I have indicated that the general objectives of <i>Building on Reality</i> will not be attained because they are totally unrealistic in so far as unemployment is concerned and in regard to the current budget deficit this year, next year and in 1987.  There is no possible way in which the Government will be able to reach the targets set out in that document.</P>
    <P>The Government have presided over massive increases in taxation, both direct <Col N="287" /> and indirect.  Those increases have been responsible for a collapse in living standards and for the deepest economic depression we have had to endure here in decades.  The Government are well aware of the deep anger being felt among the general public at their performance. The Government are now seeking to appease or nullify that anger by this piece of deception today.  This will not make any perceptible change in the general economic state of the nation.</P>
    <P>We all recall that the 1985 budget was represented as a radical reform of the taxation system.  That was only an exercise, because ten months later we are presented with another package which this time does not have even the audacity to call itself reform &mdash; the Taoiseach called it tax collection.  It is the crucifying levels of taxation and unemployment that concern our people.  The Exchequer returns clearly show a fall off in revenue. The Coalition relied exclusively on tax increases to deal with our current budget deficit and that has failed.  The only suitable label we can apply to the Government is, to quote the words of the song, &ldquo;Another day older and deeper in debt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What about public borrowing?  When they came to office the national debt was £12 billion.  It is now £18 billion and, if they stay in office much longer, they will have the unique distinction of any Government here of having doubled the national debt during their period in office.</P>

This exercise today is directed more at the people on <Col N="288" /> the backbenches over there than at the general public outside.</P>

      <P>I note that we are going to have a major programme of inner city development. When we embarked on that programme we were criticised, held up to ridicule, told it was foolish, that we were gambling with taxpayers' money.  We decided to acquire the Custom House docks site and develop it.  Three years later this Government have come round, agreed with that decision and I am quite glad they propose going ahead with that.  However, I want to point out to them that they are three years late delivering it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are some welcome developments here in regard to the building industry.  We welcome those because we have always preached the gospel that, if building and construction prosper, then our economy as a whole will prosper.  We are glad to note that something of that truth is beginning to percolate into the minds of this Government.  On the question of building I want to make this point: the Taoiseach, in his statement, is proposing to bring in a new scheme of home improvement grants and make a grant of £5,000 available for the rehabilitation of older houses.  There is nothing particularly new about that.  But the real crucial issue in the building industry at present is the 5 per cent extra VAT imposed in the 1985 budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in all sincerity to the Taoiseach and the Government opposite that if they really want to revive the building industry at this stage they should take off that 5 per cent and, if they can possibly do it, take off the 10 per cent, but certainly remove the 5 per cent imposed because it has had an impact out of all proportion to the rate of tax or yield involved.  Welcome though these grants may be, the Government are only tinkering with the problem because the real way of getting the building and construction industry on its feet again would be to do something about that 5 per cent VAT imposition.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions mentioned about leisure facilities and other general amenities.  We were engaged in a full scale programme in that regard before we left office.  Under the aegis of the Department of Education and other schemes we had a national programme for providing these community facilities and leisure centres.  Therefore, again, all the present Government are doing is resurrecting something they cut out three years ago with disastrous effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the grants proposed for the <Col N="290" /> tourist industry.  I do not know what effect the proposed £2 million will have. That is why we want a debate on these matters.  There is a limit of £30,000 and the grants are supposed to total £2 million.  I do not know whether that will have any real impact on the tourist industry but, for what it is worth, it is welcome. One must ask the question: will it be of any significance whatsoever?  How is it proposed to allocate these grants?  For example, will it be first come, first served, or how will that very small amount of £2 million be parcelled out?</P>
    <P>Then we come to number seven &mdash; the development of the natural gas grid will be accelerated.</P>

      <P>I have bored every audience to which I have spoken for the past two years asking that that be done.  I want to congratulate the Government on finally agreeing to do so; it was so obvious I cannot understand why they did not do so long ago.  I see the Minister for Energy opposite fingering the old chin.  Perhaps it was because of their ideological differences that it was not undertaken to date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If they have succeeded in overcoming them they are to be congratulated. We are delighted that they are going to get on with it at last because it is simple, economic sense so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other things contained here which we must regard as welcome on face value &mdash; improvements &mdash; but we must know exactly how they will work.  For example, there is the provision with regard to exemption from PRSI contributions by employers.  It appears to me that that is negatived largely by the provision that such people have to be engaged before 31 March next.  I do not know and we on this side of the House <Col N="291" /> will have to consult about that, ascertaining exactly what are its implications.  Certainly it appears to be a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is one rather doubtful proposal about which we shall certainly have to hear more, that is, the one to overhaul the disability benefits scheme with a view to reducing the costs of absenteeism. That could be very sound, or very sinister, it all depends.  If it is a question of depriving people genuinely ill of their disability benefit then we shall not accept it.  If there is some enlightened approach to the whole problem of absenteeism, then naturally we will support it.  But we shall have to have a further discussion about it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued to say that responsible Ministers will be giving full details of these employment measures over the next few days.  I do not know exactly what he has in mind by that.  Does the Taoiseach mean that Ministers will come into the House and elaborate on these different proposals?  As I have already suggested, the right thing to do is to give us time for a full debate on all aspects of this set of proposals so that we can ascertain which we can approve, recommend and which would warrant further teasing out before acceptance.</P>
    <P>On the question of taxation we were told by the Minister for Finance, when introducing the budget earlier this year, that it constituted a major piece of tax reform.  Of course, it was nothing of the sort.  It made practically no difference to any taxpayer.  If anything it constituted a deterioration in the position of many taxpayers.  The reality of the present situation is that the levels of taxation, particularly direct personal taxation, are exorbitant and something must be done about lowering them.</P>

However, his constituents might appreciate it if he would listen and perhaps reply <Col N="292" /> in his own time and in his own way.  I know that is what the people of west Cork would like.  There is nothing in this package to alleviate the crushing burden of taxation.  All that is proposed is a series of measures to improve the collection of taxes, in other words, if you are a taxpayer they will ensure that you pay your taxes much more quickly than you seem to be doing at present.  We all accept that those who are not paying their fair share should be compelled to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey:</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals should be carefully gone into by the House because the whole area of tax collection is a complex one and this side of the House would like an opportunity to discuss these specific proposals with the experts in this field to see if what is proposed will work and improve the situation.  These are matters of fairly far reaching importance and we should not be expected to deal with them on the basis of a simple statement by the Taoiseach here under a procedure which was never intended for matters of this sort.  We will have to have time to look into the various suggestions and proposals with regard to county registrars, sheriffs and so on to see if the situation will be improved.</P>
      <P>In this connection, on the basis of my personal experience as Minister for Finance, I should like to remind the Taoiseach that when you get into this area you have to be very careful about the constitutional situation.  I remember on a couple of occasions seeking to do something to facilitate and expedite tax collection but coming up against the Supreme Court because of the provisions of the Constitution.  These proposals merit examination and, if they are successful in improving the fairness of the tax collection system, well and good, but we need time to consider and examine them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat my request through you to the Taoiseach that time be arranged for the sort of discussion and debate which I have in mind, rather than having Ministers coming in here and dealing with different <Col N="293" /> sectors of these proposals piecemeal or, indeed, doing it outside the House.  I see a hint in what the Taoiseach said that the announcements by Ministers will be made outside the House.  If that is so, I object to it and I ask very specifically for a full scale debate with reasonable time allocated for discussion on the various aspects.</P>
    <P>Some specific measures in this document are welcome and, in many cases, we have already been pushing for and advocating them.  I hope they will have a beneficial effect but, by and large, this document will not in any way tackle the serious problems of unemployment and crushing taxation which we have at present. Only a complete reversal of the monetarist economic policies being pursued by the Government, which have been shown to have totally failed, will bring about the major improvement which is required and will help to stem rising unemployment and the tide of emigration, and offer our young people in particular some hope for the future in their own country.  It should also offer some prospect of a major amelioration to the hard pressed taxpayer.  In so far as this document does nothing about tax reform, never mind tax reduction, it is hopelessly inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were told that the Taoiseach was going to make a statement on jobs and taxation, the major issues of the day, we all expected something more.  I am not saying that the measures outlined in the statement are not welcome &mdash; they are &mdash; but they do not tackle the issue of jobs.  Tens of thousands of jobs need to be created yearly rather than the handful which will be created as a result of these measures. Indeed, the statement looks very like the &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; section of a budget and one wonders why it was brought forward now as there is very little chance of any of these measures being implemented before the budget.  Taken in conjunction with the next item on the Order of Business, the National Development Corporation, which is finally coming before us after great ideological controversy over a <Col N="294" /> number of years, it fuels the speculation that the Government do not see themselves lasting too long and that this is all part of preparing the ground to meet the electorate.  That may well be sooner rather than later, but it is strange that it comes in this form when we were expecting bits and pieces like this in the budget in a couple of months' time.</P>
      <P>The measures outlined are welcome despite the fact that they do not tackle the major issue of unemployment.  In regard to taxation, they merely deal with the collection end.  Of course that is very welcome but the area of jobs requires a major U turn.  There is no objection to U turns.  All Governments have taken U turns in the middle of their terms of office and many have taken U turns even earlier. A Government who were in office for six months only did a U turn in the middle of their term in 1982 between April and August.  There is nothing wrong or unprecedented in taking U turns in matters of fiscal policy and it is time the Government faced up to this and did so.  They are doing it to an extent in regard to tax collection procedures, so why not do so in the area of jobs, investments, State companies and other areas with which the IDA are involved?</P>
      <P>We outlined this in 1982 in our document <i>End to the Crisis</i> which is not in the grave unlike <i>The Way Forward</i> and <i>Building on Reality</i> which are already dead and buried.  Our document is relevant today and its general outline was supported by Telesis.  In fact, the IDA advocate that the area of investment and development must be in our own resources, foodstuffs, forestry, marine resources and so on as these are the areas of huge industrial development which will provide jobs.  Unless the Government turn in that direction, people will not see them as tackling the area of jobs in any meaningful way.  Tens of thousands of jobs could be created in those areas, not overnight, but in a development plan over a number of years, certainly in a decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax area dealt with is the collection end.  The Workers' Party have been pressing for this for a long time and we <Col N="295" /> have constantly mentioned the failure to collect outstanding taxes.  We have been told time after time that there is no pot of gold, and no area of uncollected taxation worrying the Government.  Now in 1985 the Government, after three years in office, are saying there are serious deficiencies in the collection process which should be corrected without delay.  All of a sudden it is very urgent.  The Taoiseach has suddenly spotted something that any person in the street could have told him about for some time.  Everyone knows from his or her employer or from friends of the nature and size of the problem. Everyone knows it is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>The point we made was that there were cutbacks in the areas of health, social services and education due to the failure of people to pay their taxes and that was seen by the public.  Cutbacks were due to shortage of funds.  Many factors were involved in the shortage of funds but one was the failure to collect outstanding taxes.  People were refusing to pay taxes and were getting away with it.  We have seen many instances of bankruptcies under the legislation dealing with company law.  We have seen many instances where there was a failure to pay PRSI and PAYE contributions by companies before they folded.  We also heard about people having their money and their villas in Spain.</P>
    <P>It is welcome that at last the Government have seen the size of the problem and have taken certain steps, many of which we recommended, to deal with it.  I am surprised at Deputy Haughey questioning whether these steps should be taken.  I have not gone into the Taoiseach's statement in detail because I got it only shortly before he spoke but, as I see it, all it is doing is implementing existing legislation.  There is nothing new proposed in the area of tax collection other than to implement provisions regarding the seizure of goods and to have a special inquiry unit.</P>
    <P>Presumably the major action of the Taoiseach must be to throw out of the window the disastrous embargo of the <Col N="296" /> Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland.  Certainly in the area of tax collection and revenue it has been a major disaster.  It has also been a disaster in many other areas of Government service and has been seen as such by the Minister for Finance.  I take it the Taoiseach is declaring that the embargo of the Minister for the Public Service will not apply so far as the Department of Finance are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the special development authority to deal with the 27-acre site of the Dublin Port and Docks, will this matter be brought before the House? Dublin Corporation have a great interest in that site as well as the Port and Docks Board.  They are the planning authority for that area and they would like to be aware of the Government's plans.  They would like to know if they will be consulted on the matter because they have many ideas regarding what should be done with that site.  They hoped they would be allowed to acquire the site because they know more about what is needed for the centre of Dublin than the Government or the Department of the Environment. They must have a say in the development of this site.  Will the Dublin Port and Docks Board get enough money to solve all their financial problems as a result of its sale or will the Government take it over for a song and leave the Port and Docks Board still in a major financial crisis?  I assume there will be legislation needed to set up that authority.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Taoiseach said there is a need to overhaul the disability benefit scheme with a view to reducing the costs of absenteeism.  Is that a response to the kind of headlines in our papers which appeared again in the past few days when it was said that 25 per cent of people on disability benefit were found to be fit for work when they were examined by doctors?  Does anyone understand the implications of that statement? People are on disability benefit for short periods.  They get well, are examined by a doctor who certifies them as fit and they return to work.  That is the procedure. In some cases the medical expert in the Department of Social Welfare will say a <Col N="297" /> person is fit to work but the doctor of the individual concerned will not agree. Thus, there is an argument between two doctors but it is a medical decision that is involved.  It is quite obvious that 25 per cent will be fit for work but another 25 per cent come on for disability benefit. There are headlines that try to show this is a major source of fiddling and loss to the Government by sick people.  If there is any argument it is a matter between two doctors, not the individual who is out of work because he is sick.  He is only getting what he is entitled to and this is certified by the doctors.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that grants will be financed by reductions in less essential spending.  The Taoiseach should give us some outline of the areas in which there will be reductions.  What is less essential spending?  There are many such areas I could point out and I would not have to go far outside here to put my finger on many of them.  The Taoiseach should give us an indication of the areas in which there will be reductions.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement is welcome with regard to the possible benefits to the north inner city and with regard to the belated efforts in respect of tax collection. However, in no way is it a change of policy by the Government and only a change of policy by them will give them any possibility of remaining in office.</P>

I do not want to argue with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle about the denial of rights to myself and a few of my backbench colleagues.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish the National Development Corporation, which is an integral part of the Government's industrial and job creation strategy. It is a body with the task of investing in enterprises which might not otherwise develop or even get off the ground.</P>
      <P>Businesses, new and old, in Ireland are starved of investment funds in the form of share capital.  They have to rely to an unhealthy extent on money borrowed from banks.  The resultant disproportionate requirement to pay interest and repay capital on bank loans, makes the business unduly vulnerable to temporary setbacks and fluctuations in market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> Likewise there are investment opportunities in which the corporation itself alone can take a lead or set up an enterprise, given that its financial and developmental perspective is longer term than that of private sector venture capital agencies acting on their own.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation is an integral part of the Government's strategy for innovation.  New products and new processes are essential to our national economic growth, because markets are changing all the time and a country or a firm which fails to adapt will go into decline.  New products need the investment of &ldquo;patient&rdquo; money which can wait for a profit while the product is being developed and tested.  On its own, and in conjunction with others, the National Development Corporation will provide such crucial support to the process of innovation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It will work alongside other initiatives taken by the Government to provide investment funds for industrial and economic development.  I will briefly describe these measures and the background to them.</P>
    <P>Critics and observers of the economic scene in this country are unanimous in their view that in order for industry to flourish, and particularly for small indigenous owned industry to flourish, there must be a shift away from the traditional reliance on bank borrowings to finance start-ups and expansions.  A much greater emphasis must be placed on the need for equity style investment.  The development of this environment will be a gradual process requiring a significant change of attitudes, not only on the part of investors, to encourage them to be less risk-adverse, but also on the part of entrepreneurs and businessmen, to encourage them to be more receptive and understanding of the advantages of relinquishing part ownership of their business in return for equity finance.</P>
    <P>The existence of a thriving venture capital market has often been cited as being a major, if not the major, contributing factor to the industrial strength of the United States in the past decade or so.  Our capital markets are not as well <Col N="306" /> developed in this direction, but the momentum is there and, with Government encouragement will, hopefully, build up a substantial flow of funds for venture capital in the years ahead.  To achieve this we have introduced the business expansion scheme which provides income tax relief to eligible individual investors.  In response to suggestions this scheme has been further improved this year.  The BES is conservatively estimated to have resulted in excess of £3.5 million of new investment in industry during the 1984-85 tax year.  The scheme has recently been strengthened by the passage of the Designated Investment's Funds Act in the last Dáil session.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper on Industrial Policy, I asked consultants employed in my Department to undertake a study into potential measures for the development of a more active market in the stocks and shares of Irish industry.  Among the recommendations contained in the consultant's report was one dealing with the establishment of an over-the-counter, or OTC, market to facilitate trading in the shares of smaller, less developed, enterprises.  In response to this recommendation, the Stock Exchange have now submitted proposals to me for the setting up of a third tier market to complement the facilities already provided by their full and unlisted markets.  I will be examining these proposals closely and, indeed, hope to meet representatives of the exchange in the next week to discuss their ideas further.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that certain private interests have expressed a willingness to become involved in the operation of OTC markets.  I am, of course, anxious to provide for proper regulation of such markets as may operate outside of the Stock Exchange framework, to ensure that we can protect adequately the interest of investors.</P>
    <P>Following the success of this initiative, I propose to ask the same consultants to undertake a new study.  This will be to examine the potential for generating a greater level of institutional investment in industry.  The pension funds and life assurance companies have annual funds <Col N="307" /> available for investment which are estimated at about £400 million.  I am anxious to see a greater amount of these funds directed towards the productive sectors of the economy.  The consultants are at the early stage of preparing the framework for this study but if the fruits of their labour are as significant as previously we will all have cause to be well pleased.</P>
    <P>I am also hoping to shortly renew my dialogue with the principal banking concerns in the country to discuss their potential contribution to our future industrial prosperity.</P>
    <P>For some time past, I have been promoting the cause of profit sharing and worker shareholding in industry.  This Government have introduced significant tax incentives which exist for profit sharing and worker shareholding.  This is a means not only of encouraging harmony and accelerating the process of innovation in industry, but it will provide a source of funds for development.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also that we should keep abreast of measures being taken to develop the capital markets in other countries, particularly Europe and the US.  Officials of my Department recently held extremely useful discussions with Government authorities and financial representatives in the city of London which is reckoned by many to be the nerve centre of the most developed venture capital market in Europe.  I am concerned to ensure that we fully participate in and draw on developments in foreign financial markets to the benefit of our economy.</P>
    <P>The development of a venture capital market which is capable of making a significant contribution to industrial expansion is as much an educational process as anything else.  I am convinced that the measures and initiatives outlined above will accelerate this process and lead us to a greater understanding and appreciation of the intricacies of industrial financing.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation, the structure of which is defined in this legislation, is to be a further vehicle for State involvement in, and promotion of, industrial development.  The principal <Col N="308" /> objective of the NDC will be to assist, by means of investment in industry, in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  It represents a new approach in many respects but in particular, I would highlight that it is not designed to be a grant-giving body such as the IDA.  It will be an investment vehicle which will be seeking to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it.</P>
    <P>I want to allay any fears that there may be about an overlap or duplication of functions between the NDC and the IDA.  It is my intention that there should be an operating agreement drawn up between the two bodies which will be subject to my approval.  This will allow the NDC and the IDA to co-ordinate their respective functions and to act in complete harmony thus ensuring the creation of the maximum number of viable jobs.</P>
    <P>It also represents a new approach because, unlike existing State agencies such as the IDA, CTT, the Irish Goods Council and so on, all of whom provide excellent assistance to industry, the NDC, where it identifies a particular niche or gap in the market place which the private sector is not yet exploiting, will be empowered to establish a business on its own initiative to meet that demand. One of the key elements of the role of the NDC is that it will be required to establish a revolving investment fund thereby enabling it to roll over its resources and continually reinvest in new enterprises offering new employment opportunities.  The corporation will not be restricted in terms of the type of enterprise it might invest in and the definition of enterprise in the Bill is quite broad. Opportunities exist in all sectors of industry, manufacturing, services, tourism, agriculture, natural resources and so on. The NDC will be in a unique position of being able to exploit all such opportunities. Obviously, its remit will be to invest in enterprises which are, or are capable of becoming, profitable and efficient and offer reasonable prospects for development and the provision of viable employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> The enterprises established or supported by the corporation will of course often compete with other companies both Irish and foreign.  It will do so on a strictly commercial basis.  It is my intention however that it will concentrate wholly on the traded sector of the economy where the main competition will be companies operating from other countries.  Its aim will be to develop new markets, and to strengthen existing Irish industries by prudent equity investment as is provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the NDC should operate as a commercial entity which will invest in enterprises, establish them on their own initiative, unlike the IDA, and then dispose of them in accordance with normal commercial prudence.  The NDC's ability to do this profitably will be a major factor in determining its success. The framing of this legislation is designed to take account of the fact that the State has limited resources and must aim to get maximum return in terms of employment from every pound it spends.  As part of its normal investment criteria, the NDC will set at the outset of each investment time limits for its involvement in that investment.  They will further be required to notify me of the time limits so set and of any subsequent decision to extend them.</P>
    <P>The Government's employment objectives can best be achieved not by artificially increasing employment figures at the expense of unsustainable Government borrowing and deficits, as was done in the past, but by selective investment of available resources in modern viable industries.  It is important to remember that the new technology of the mid-eighties will be outdated in the mid-nineties. We cannot afford to tie up our resources permanently in the technology of the mid-eighties.  We need to have a constant stream of funds available to invest in new technologies as they arise over the next 20 years.  The NDC, by operating a revolving investment fund, will be in a position to stay on the frontiers of technology and provide the jobs required by our young and increasing population <Col N="310" /> without the need for a continuous source of new funds from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to ensure that the maximum number of investments is encouraged, the NDC will be empowered to enter into joint ventures with the private sector.  This involvement of private enterprise partners in NDC investments is an important means of increasing the level of funds available for investment.  It is also a means of encouraging a greater level of risk investment on the part of the private sector.  Indeed, syndication of investments, as such joint arrangements are called, is an important and growing feature of the risk business and it is unlikely that the NDC could operate to its full potential if it were to be restricted in this regard.  As a consequence, it will be possible for the NDC to be jointly involved with private venture capitalists in projects with a substantial financial dimension and where a spread of risk is essential or in overseas projects with definite potential for technology transfer or project development in Ireland.  In this latter role the NDC will also be able to influence firms to locate or maintain their headquarters and decision-making functions here in Ireland rather than elsewhere. It is, of course, important to point out that the corporation will also be empowered to carry out its investment role in consultation and co-operation with existing State enterprise.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation will have an innovative and commercial outlook.  I must stress that it is not designed to undertake the functions of a rescue agency.  I will not allow it to function as a means of resolving the difficulties of ailing State or private sector industry.  At the end of the day, the success of the National Development Corporation will depend on the success of its individual investments.  As such, each investment will be judged on its merits and assessed by the corporation in the context of its potential to contribute to the overall aim of creating the maximum amount of viable and sustainable employment in the State.</P>
    <P>The NDC will play a critical role in the Government's overall strategy for the <Col N="311" /> development of the indigenous resource sector of the economy, particularly in relation to agriculture, fishery and forestry resources.  The Government are committed to the preparation, in conjunction with sectoral and agricultural interests, of a co-ordinated development programme for the indigenous resource sector.</P>
    <P>The most pervasive problem in this sector &mdash; affecting agriculture, forestry and fishing &mdash; has been that of insufficient integration resulting in a lack of synchronisation between production patterns and market needs.  Substantial investment is needed if production patterns are to be tailored to market needs. Seasonality of production and unevenness of quality can only be eliminated if primary producers are prepared to invest substantial sums and take substantial risks.</P>
    <P>Partnership equity is needed to enable the entire natural resource sector to achieve its full potential.  This will be especially necessary if long-term production contracts are to be developed.  A buffer fund may be necessary to overcome difficulties that will arise if market prices diverge substantially from contract prices.  I hope that the NDC will, on its own or in partnership with other investors, be able to step in to assist in underpinning the development of long-term contracts or analogous arrangements.</P>
    <P>I also hope that it will be able to invest in identified niches in the natural resource sector where the full added value potential of Irish produce is not being achieved. Our timber resources also need to be exploited in a more commercial manner than heretofore and the NDC is being given a special role as an investment vehicle in commercial projects in this area.</P>
    <P>The NDC will also be empowered to become involved in projects designed to assist the development of our tourist industry.  The significant capital investment often required in respect of tourist facilities such as hotels and related activities as well as the seasonality of return would make this a key area for NDC <Col N="312" /> involvement in joint ventures with the private sector.  Their involvement will also fill an important gap in terms of State financial and available to the tourist industry, as pointed out in the recently published White Paper on Tourism.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the NDC will play an important role will be to assist and, if necessary, participate in the establishment of development companies to provide services to small enterprises on a commercial basis.  The Telesis report took the view that smaller Irish manufacturing firms could not achieve their full potential because they lacked adequate resources for marketing, R &amp; D, warehousing and so on.  It argued that, in some cases, these could be supplied by development companies providing common services to a number of firms.  It is my hope that the NDC will be able to invest in, and share in the profits, of such schemes.  The availability of investment funds from the NDC should act as a catalyst in establishing the initial viability of joint schemes of this kind throughout industry.</P>
    <P>Because of the structure of the Irish capital markets there is a serious shortage of both private and public seed capital for projects, particularly technology-based projects, which take a number of years of development work before they reach the stage of commercialisation. The NDC is, therefore, being empowered to assist in the development of, and invest in, commercial enterprises based on the results of research and development activity in higher education or related fields.</P>
    <P>I have been very impressed by the development of university-based industries in the United States.  Many of the most successful high technology zones are located close to universities.  Their success derives both from the direct application in industry of ideas emanating in universities, and from the indirect effects of the creation of an innovative atmosphere influenced by the institutes of higher education.  The Industrial Development Authority have recognised this and an industrial park is being located in proximity to University College <Col N="313" /> Dublin.  A successful industrial park has already been set up at Plessey in proximity to the NIHE in Limerick.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation can complement these efforts, and those of individual entrepreneurs, by providing a new source of investment funds for enterprises established in this way. The NDC will be aiming, as in all its investments, at making a profit.  But its investment perspective will be longer than that of many traditional investors. Thus it will be well suited to the commercialisation of research-based products and processes.  The Bill also empowers the NDC to act as a holding company for new projects initiated by public sector companies where such a facility would be helpful.</P>
    <P>The corporation will not initially be empowered to act as a holding company for existing State industries.  This will, however, be considered by the Government in the light of the progress of the NDC in its basic innovation and developmental tasks.  In many of the existing commercial State enterprises, there is a need for policy and performance prospects to be more clearly delineated as corporate plans are submitted and evaluated. There would be little point in handing over to the NDC unsettled policy problems of certain State enterprises. Objectives and strategies must be settled first, and social &mdash; strategic roles, if any, clarified.  Moreover, it will be important &mdash; particularly during its crucial formative period &mdash; for the NDC's resource and staff not to be diverted from its primary project, development &mdash; job creation role.</P>
    <P>Although the corporation's main activity will be that of taking an equity stake in projects, it is also being empowered to give loans.  The giving of loans by the corporation will, however, be subject to the following conditions:&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  where financial assistance is being provided by the corporation for a project, a maximum of 30 per cent of the initial assistance provided by the corporation may be by way of loan capital;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> (ii) where loan capital has been provided for a project any further financial assistance provided by the corporation to that project may be by way of equity investment only;</P>
    <P>(iii) in cases where loan capital has been provided by the corporation to a project the corporation shall specify that the interest rate attaching to the loan shall be as determined by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance. </P>
    <P>The giving of loans together with equity investment is a feature of the venture capital market.  The inclusion in the legislation of the conditions outlined above will ensure that the giving of loans will be part only of the initial investment and thus there is no danger of the corporation losing sight of its job-creation function and becoming a State rescue service.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the corporation to fulfill its investment role, it is being provided with an authorised share capital of £300 million which will be held by, or on behalf of, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In advancing the corporation funds out of its authorised share capital, the Government will have regard to the financial commitments of the board in terms of the projects and investment programmes with which it is, or is likely, to become involved.  In later years, the Government will also have regard to the amount of funds available to the corporation from its own resources, that is the revolving investment fund for employment.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's objective to ensure that the corporation exercises due commercial prudence in the selection, administration and disposal of its investment portfolio.  If it does not make profits, it will not be able to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The corporation will be judged at the end of the day in accordance with its success in achieving these twin objectives. Therefore, the rate at which the authorised share capital of the corporation is issued must remain at the discretion of the Government.  If the corporation is performing profitably and is succeeding <Col N="315" /> in creating employment, a greater amount of funds can be released.  The opposite, by definition, also applies.</P>
    <P>In order for the corporation to build up a base of profitable investments capable of providing sustainable employment, it is necessary to ensure that investments are judiciously spread over a range of sectors.  For this reason the NDC will not be allowed to make investments in excess of £1 million without my consent, or in excess of £2.5 million without the consent of the Government.  As a further element of protection for the taxpayer, section 33 of the Bill imposes restrictions on the corporation entering into financial commitments in respect of items such as leasing or purchasing office premises or office equipment.</P>
    <P>One of the crucial factors which will determine the success of the corporation will be the level of expertise and commitment of those appointed both to the board and the staff of the corporation.  It is not mine or the Government's intention that the members of the board be appointed simply because of their political or ideological views.</P>
    <P>The board should be made up of men and women who have proven business, economic and enterpreneurial skills and who have a commitment to, and belief in, what they are doing.  The board should also be a closely knit group capable of working in harmony.  There is a maximum limit imposed by this Bill of nine board members and I believe that this will allow the proper balance to be struck.  Likewise, if the corporation is to become a vibrant, job creating organisation, staff of the highest calibre must be attracted to its ranks.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the corporation may not take a majority shareholding in any enterprise other than one which it establishes on its own initiative.  The financial risks attaching to a majority shareholding are far greater and so, too, are the administrative and management responsibilities of a holding company. Such factors would impose an enormous strain on the resources of the corporation and would result in staff being deflected <Col N="316" /> from their primary function of job initiators.  With a large number of majority holdings, the staff of the corporation would become more involved in the management of existing investments instead of finding new ones.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House makes the usual administrative provisions in respect of State bodies.  It is not necessary for me to comment on each of them in turn.  I will of course be happy later in this debate to clarify any particular provision where Deputies require me to do so.  However, I would like to mention a number of points at this stage.</P>
    <P>First, the Government, in addition to the share capital of the corporation, are empowered to make grants of up to £2 million available in any one year to meet the administrative, day to day, running costs of the organisation.  Secondly, I draw attention to the facility to give policy directives to the corporation.  This is extremely important and allows the Government to steer the policy of the corporation in line with their own general industrial and employment objectives. Such directives must relate to general areas of policy and may not attempt to influence the corporation in regard to any specific investment proposal with which they are involved.  Furthermore, such directives must be given in an open manner and must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the provision which dissolves the National Enterprise Agency and vests all their property, assets, debts, liabilities and so on in the corporation.  This is an extremely beneficial way of eliminating any difficulties in the transfer of responsibility and it ensures that the corporation may step directly into the shoes of the agency.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that speakers on the opposite side of the House will ask why we are setting up a National Development Corporation at all.  What can they do that the National Enterprise Agency cannot?  A fair question and one which I propose to answer before it is posed.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the National Development Corporation are being <Col N="317" /> established by law by the Oireachtas, whereas the NEA were just a company set up by administrative means.  Secondly, this legislation provides the NDC with a proper capital base, the lack of which was a serious inhibiting factor in the operation of the NEA.  The NEA were formed with only a nominal share capital and were required to draw down their capital funds under a grant-in-aid arrangement.  This produced a degree of uncertainty and mitigated against the agency entering into long-term financial and investment commitments.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the NDC will have specific statutory power to operate and invest in areas as defined in the Bill.  This new statutory framework is a significant improvement in that it clearly outlines the NDC's remit and greatly enhances their potential to operate successfully as against the provisions affecting the NEA. It crystallises the NDC's function and leaves no room for doubt as to its primary job creation role.  Furthermore, it greatly improves the administration procedures involved and removes the uncertainty which has surrounded the operation of the agency in recent years.  Also the existence of legislation gives the Oireachtas a major say in the operation of the corporation.</P>
    <P>At this point, I would like to pay a compliment to the chairman, directors and staff of the NEA.  They have operated under a cloud of uncertainty as regards their future for some time but notwithstanding this their commitment and endeavour have never waned.  Let me say also, that although the NEA had been established by a previous administration I actively encouraged them to continue their work until something better was available.  They have already made some good investments.  During 1984 and 1985 some 20 projects have been approved committing over £2 million of capital funds.  It would be wrong to assume that the 150 or so jobs provided by these investments is the total employment potential of the projects concerned.  There is a saying in the venture capital business that venture capitalists do not invest in small business, they <Col N="318" /> just invest in businesses which happen to be small at present.  Let me say that the work of the agency to date has been ample testimony to the role which this Government perceive for State involvement in equity investment in industry. They have provided a foundation on which the NDC may now commence to build a much larger structure.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us proposes to set up a National Development Corporation. Initially I pose a question and answer it at the same time.  What is it? My view is that this is but a piece of ideological nonsense set up to appease the Labour element in Government simply because it was part of a deal cobbled together after &mdash; I stress that word &mdash; the last general election by Fine Gael and Labour, and now, in the dying days of this Coalition Government, after three years in office this Bill is being presented to the House and the nation as a panacea for all our ills and particularly as saviour for industrial development and the creation of jobs.  Nobody is in any doubt that the Government have failed totally to create an environment in which enterprise, investment and job creation could grow and develop.  Since this Government came into office they have pursued policies which have had the effect of running down the economy, and instead of growth and development, what have we got?  Retrenchment, cutbacks, closures, receiverships and liquidations are the order of every day, not just of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution lies in the creation of an environment which is conducive to investment and such a solution is not to be found in the proposed Bill or within the capacity of the Minister and the present Government, nor is it indicated, outlined or contained anywhere in the Bill or in the speech which the Minister has just read to the House.  Is it not only reasonably to expect, in an environment which has been created by this Government since assuming office, an environment which is hostile to enterprise, that talented Irish people are unwilling to take <Col N="319" /> the risks involved in bringing their ideas for new products and services to the market place?  The return on industrial investment is much too low to attract funds.  These are the facts and they are not being dealt with by the Minister or the Government in this Bill or in the Minister's contribution which we have just heard.</P>
    <P>Is it not true that there is no shortage of available funds?  The Irish financial sector is currently awash with funds. Against this background it is difficult to see the appropriateness of the justification for the establishment of this new agency.  The ideological bickering and the public recriminations between the partners in the Coalition Government which preceded the publication of this Bill do not augur well for the establishment of a successful National Development Corporation. I remind the House and the Minister by extracts from some of the national dailies of the ideological bickering I have mentioned.  We read in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 July 1984 with reference to the White Paper the heading &ldquo;Coalition rift on Bruton job plan.&rdquo;  This is written in all honesty as a learned opinion by a journalist for the consumption of people who read this paper.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Industry Minister John Bruton faces a head-on clash with his Labour counterparts at today's Cabinet meeting.</P>
    <P>The row is over the shape of Mr. Bruton's long awaited Government White Paper on industrial policy.</P>
    <P>As well as establishing the National Development Corporation, the White Paper, due to be published this Thursday, also proposes a total revamp of grant and tax incentives to industry and strict controls on the operation of State-sponsored companies.</P>
    <P>We have learned what some of those strict controls meant in regard to Irish Shipping, for instance.  The extract continues:</P>
    <P>The Government plan proposes to <Col N="320" /> double industrial output over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>Labour sources were adamant last night that significant policy decisions still remain to be agreed.</P>
    <P>But the Department of Industry sources were equally insistent that the final text has already been agreed by the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>They said also that the White Paper was already with the printers, making ready for the following Thursday's official publication. Then there are references to the Labour reservations about the final shape of the document focusing on the NDC and again I quote:</P>
    <P>While there has been much agonising over the industrial policy White Paper stretching back over the previous year, during which it has been exhaustively before Cabinet, it is clear that it is the chapter in the White Paper dealing with the National Development Corporation which is the major source of friction between Mr. Bruton in particular, and Mr. Spring, Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I shall quote further from the media because, apart from anything that may be said here, they tend to form public opinion.  I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 24 January 1985.  The heading is &lsquo;Spring-Bruton feud hots up over NDC&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>The first signs that the running battle between Dick Spring and John Bruton over the National Development Corporation was entering the public arena came on Friday, April 13, last, when Mr. Bruton chose to include a section on the NDC's operation in a script for delivery at a technology awards ceremony.</P>
    <P>These references were bland but Dick Spring was infuriated.  Mr. Bruton was speaking on the opening day of the Labour Party conference...</P>

      <P>And when we have strung them together, we might hang them around the necks of the Minister and the Government.  This Bill is only a repeat of the Government's good intentions on the unemployment problem, but good intentions of themselves will not solve that serious problem.  Action is needed but this Bill offers no specific practical solutions. It does not even contain a proposal that would produce one viable job. The whole Bill lacks substance.  The Government would have saved much valuable time had they adopted the National Enterprise Agency and applied themselves to practical means of creating the employment that is needed so much.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated the reasons for scrapping the National Enterprise Agency.  He has told us why the agency must be scuttled to make way for the NDC.  One of the most damaging effects that the Government have had on the NEA resulted from the uncertainty surrounding that body for the past three years while all the time the Government continued with their ideological dithering about the setting up of the corporation. During that time they left the NEA in a vacuum and that was not conducive to the creation of employment.  Instead of strengthening the agency all we have are empty gestures from a Government who insist on sitting in their ivory towers of unreality while everything around them crumbles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> In a nutshell, this Bill sets out mainly the objectives of the NDC and the administrative methods and controls that should be adopted.  <i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; dare I mention that document?  &mdash; contains plenty of flowery rhetoric but does not contain one practical suggestion of how jobs are to be created.  I am sure that an opportunity will be afforded to everyone who wants to contribute to this debate, in support or otherwise, or to say other than what I have said.  I had hoped to see some solid proposals emanating at this stage of the Government's term in office, for instance, identifying projects where investment could be channelled as a result of feasibility studies, or suggestions on how to exploit to their full potential Ireland's forestry, fishing and food industries.  Instead, the Government are once again kicking for touch with regard to the main problem facing the country. There is nothing in this latest legislation to encourage real entrepreneurs to build up and increase our productive capacity, thereby decreasing unemployment. There are many problems inherent in the manner in which this legislation has been drawn up involving the creating and maintaining of entrepreneurship in an institution such as the NDC, where the environment may be basically hostile to such an initiative.  The main task of the Government, if they are serious, about and capable of decreasing unemployment would be to ensure that the business environment does not actively discourage investment and risk taking, as is happening at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very careful not to make any commitments on the scale of funds to be given to the NDC.  We all know that the share capital of the company will be IR£300 million.  It is being portrayed that this money is to be issued immediately.  Will the Minister tell us how much of this is available immediately, or will it be available over a number of years and, if so, for how long?  The Minister appears to be encouraging joint ventures with State-sponsored commercial enterprises which in a number of cases are unable to manage their own affairs profitably.  He has set down no <Col N="325" /> criteria on the return required from these investments, nor has he set down any terms of reference as to how and when these investments will be disposed of.  No conditions are laid down as to the quality and experience of the directors to be appointed.  Sufficient to say that, as is the practice and custom of this Government, no doubt these will be appointed substantially on a political basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons:</NameTxt>
      <P>The downturn in manufacturing industry averages a loss of 7,000 jobs per year over a four year period and there is spiralling unemployment. Despite the Taoiseach's commitment to halting and reversing the trend in unemployment figures, we have a live register figure at the end of September totalling 229,518.  We are all aware that if the true figure were obtained the number looking for jobs would surely top 300,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now abundantly clear that neither the Government nor the Minister are in a position to reverse these trends.  It may seem all right for the Minister to bulldoze his way down to Ennis and, through the IDA, to put pressure on a firm on Monday night last to accommodate him in another of his publicity gimmicks.  The media mentioned his flying visit to the Limerick region.  Even his own Deputies in that constituency were not aware of this visit and when a phone call alerted them, only one could turn up.  Further, at the reception during which he was making this announcement he added insult to injury and sneaked out of the reception to hold a press conference, which was partially <Col N="326" /> reported in the national media.  I do not mind that the Minister introduced into the NDC debate a matter of envelopes and stamps.  His success as Minister for Industry could easily be contained on the back of a stamp.  To list his failures and those of his Government would need a great number of envelopes.  His efforts to conceal his own inability on the industrial front are evident.  Did he say anything to the assembled gatherings at the reception or press conference about the Hyster plant?  Did he explain how he had supported that plant but the Cabinet had not?</P>

I now give the Minister the opportunity to correct me if I am wrong on this and to come clean with the nation.  Is it not a fact that this deal will not benefit the Irish farmer to any extent?  Is it not true that the beef being sent to Russia is coming out of intervention and has been lying there since as far back as 1980?</P>

What benefit will accrue to the producer arising from this deal?  These are two examples of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Minister acting in his own right and on behalf of the Government.  I indicated earlier the daily occurrence during the lifetime of this Government of closures and liquidations. I presume, a Cheann Comhairle, that I am right in referring to these matters in terms of the Bill, because the underlying object of this Bill is to create jobs and develop industrial employment, to take on firms, invest money and so forth.  I am only too well aware of the hardships created and the signs of despair and hopelessness evidenced all over this country, but particularly in my native Cork over the last three years.  I welcome any proposal to reverse that trend.  I am saying with sincerity and conviction that the proposed National Development Corporation will not change the trend which has been continuing under this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Foreign Affairs as well as the entire Government have set a record in the staggering unemployment figures I have <Col N="328" /> already quoted.  There are many others who are not included in those figures. We have been indicating the trend of emigration which has been caused without a shadow of doubt by the inefficiencies of this Government.  Because no emigration figures were available from the Central Statistics Office the Government would not acknowledge the seriousness of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons:</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an announcement this week that the Government have realised that a serious situation exists and mentioned the possible payment of moneys to young people to stay at home.  Is that the Government's answer to providing jobs for young people?  A significant feature of the <Col N="329" /> launching of the NDC was the limited support from Government and elsewhere, shown most conspicuously by the absence of any contribution from the national handlers.  Obviously they have no stomach for it.</P>
      <P>In spite of all the volumes of propaganda in favour of the NDC, it simply will not work.  That conclusion was reached some time ago by most people of good sense.  Now an economist has confirmed this.  Writing in the September issue of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> R. S.  Thompson of University College Cork argues that neither basic economic reasoning nor comparable experience elsewhere leads to an optimistic expectation about the NDC's future prospects.  Now we see the sponsoring Minister.  Was there ever a more reluctant sponsor at a baptism?  The Minister may assemble a worthy collection of bankers, accountants and others who will eliminate from the outset totally incompetent, technically impossible or financially impracticable projects. Neither they nor anybody else can predict commercial success.</P>
      <P>If, as the Minister and some members of the Government would have us believe, sustainable and badly needed jobs will be created by this measure, why has the introduction of this wonder of wonders taken so long from the day of its conception at least three years ago?  We all know that it is an ideological sop to the Labour Party to ensure that they will not pull the plug and send the Government gurgling down the drain as an overwhelming majority of the electorate would like before wreaking any further damage to the fibre of our people, socially, morally, culturally and nationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons:</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate will leave this Government in no doubt when the opportunity is given to them.  Let us look at some alternatives.  During the debate last June on the Designated Trust Funds Bill then before the House the reality of the extent of the problem of lack of investment in industrial development, which relied heavily on State aid and debt finance, was recognised and acknowledged by Members.  I supported the Bill, even though I expressed some reservation that it would not achieve what it set out to achieve, that is, the encouragement of the greatest possible number to invest in venture capital, as designated by the Finance Bill of 1984 and the Designated Capital Investment Fund.  I had hoped that the Bill would change the attitude of the Government who, by their policies, had stifled investment in industry and undermined confidence.  It is high time to create an environment more conducive to investment and expansion in industry.  Only two funds were established in the previous year, a measure of the Government's failure in this regard. I suggested dismantling the intimidating barbed wire fence which surrounds the scheme.</P>
      <P>What will the NDC achieve which could not be achieved by existing State agencies such as the National Enterprise Agency?  The Minister gave reasons for taking it out of existence and replacing it with this corporation. Why not take the existing agency and if necessary strengthen it? This could not be done because an ideological requirement in setting up the Government was the establishment of a national development corporation at the insistence of the smaller grouping in the Government.  The IDA and others must be able to get rid of their inhibitions.  They must be strengthened in their efforts to develop the activities necessary to create badly needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there is no need for this ideological charade we now have before us, and the Minister can be assured that his <Col N="331" /> proposal is being rejected because of its quality, not because it is the Government who put it forward.  The Minister is being less than honest when he says that £300 million is being provided for job creation. The Minister and I know that is not so. Would he indicate whether £2 million or £3 million will be provided next year, the year after&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons:</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not give those bodies the capital they require to cause a growth in employment, the sort of viable jobs we are looking for?  Section 16 provides that the NDC will be under the control of three different Ministers, the Ministers for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Finance and the Public Service. Approval must be got from the Ministers for the investment of even £1 million.  In other words, the Bill requires that layers of approvals must be had in order to provide capital for the relief of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I have touched on section 22, which provides for the dissolution of the National Enterprise Agency.  That was unnecessary for the realisation of the alleged objects of the NDC.  It is an outrageous proposal.  The National Enterprise Agency were inhibited not so much by lack of funds as lack of enterprise, and I doubt very much that that lack of enterprise will not be transferred to the NDC.  Enterprise is needed if we are to achieve an atmosphere conducive to job creation, but such enterprise has not been shown by the Minister or the Government. Now they expect the people to believe that this charade, this nonsense, this ideological commitment given three years ago, will provide all the answers to our industrial problems.  All the efforts of the Government so far have ended in massive failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment to establish the NDC was given after the general election, but let us look at the promises given before the election.  There was the commitment <Col N="332" /> to eliminate deficit budgeting.  That failed and consequently unemployment rose. There was a commitment before the election to reduce foreign borrowing but that is now higher than ever, much of it being used for day to day spending and little to create employment.</P>

      <P>You would never know how close we are to that.  When we are contributing to Bills I agree that we should apply our remarks 100 per cent to the Bills but I submit that this Bill is more than a Bill: it is not before us because of a commitment prior to the election but as a promise given after the election.  That is why I consider it necessary for me to re-state the evidence already given by me in regard to the setting up of the Government after the election.  It has taken the Government three years to bring this Bill to the House.  That is another indication of the Government's incompetence which should be the subject of adjudication by the electorate. The Bill is nothing more than an effort to appease the Labour Party.  Earlier today we had the Taoiseach's effort&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Bill has nothing to do with pre-election gimmicks and promises.  We note that it was upstaged today by the Taoiseach's statement on employment and tax reform.  The proposal to set up the NDC is only a last gasp effort to save the Government.  They know of their unpopularity after the local and European elections.  The Bill has been brought in after three years of failure. If it is passed not a single person with money to invest would have any confidence in the Minister or the Government. Therefore, the Bill does not stand a chance among the investing public or the community.  The Minister and the Government are moving progressively into cloud-cockooland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it slightly patronising on the part of the Fianna Fáil spokesman to refer to this Bill as he did, as constituting an appeasement of Labour Party policy.  We in the Labour Party do not seek appeasement so far as our policy is concerned.  We seek its implementation to the maximum extent achievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of a national development corporation is something which has been a major Labour Party policy plank for many years past.  We have had to fight very hard to achieve this day when a National Development Corporation Bill would be introduced into this House.  We had to fight very hard to have it, as far as is possible, in the image of a national development corporation as seen by the Labour Party.  I do not say that its format is 100 per cent what it would be if a Labour Party Government were introducing it.  To a major extent it is in satisfaction of Labour Party policy.  As Deputy Lyons pointed out, the party and its members in Cabinet, at parliamentary party level, administrative council level and rank and file have had to fight long and hard to achieve the Bill in its present form.  In the Labour Party view it represents a substantial improvement on the scenario depicted in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  We believe that is all <Col N="334" /> for the good, that it gives the corporation a much better chance of succeeding in the objectives we wish it to achieve and which we believe, given the right parameters and conditions, it will achieve.</P>
    <P>Let me say, first of all, what we do not put the Bill forward as.  We do not put it forward as a panacea that will, of itself, cure and dispose of the entire unemployment and endemic employment problems we have and have experienced for decades. We do not put it forward on that basis.  But we do put it forward as a probability of constituting a major factor in contributing to the creation of employment that would not exist otherwise.</P>

      <P>We have an endemic unemployment problem.  That is not new. It is true that the figures may have been on the increase in world recessionary circumstances and in other situations.  But we have had here very serious unemployment in the good times, when the booms were on, when Fianna Fáil were in power, when other Coalition Governments were in power.  Times of boom and recession apparently made very little difference to us; we have always had one of the highest unemployment rates ever.  Is it not time that we stopped short for a minute and began to analyse why that is so?  Or are we to carry on merrily and gaily as we have done all those years since the foundation of the State?  There is talk here of ideological considerations &mdash; Deputy Kelly and so on being referred to.  I do not know what this criticism of ideology is about.  Is there something wrong about having an ideology?  The State would not have been founded in the first place had there not been very many people who had ideologies.  There is nothing wrong with having ideologies provided they are thought out, reasoned and considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very serious unemployment situation and have always had it.  What are we going to do about it?  What are the proposals to resolve that?  There is the cliché we have often heard bandied about over the years.  It takes different <Col N="335" /> forms but the usual one goes: Governments do not create jobs; they only create the right climate for the private sector. We have all heard that cliché in different forms many times.  Indeed I think the Opposition spokesman used it today in one form or another.</P>
    <P>I do not know what kind of climate one has to create in order to induce the private sector to resolve our unemployment problem.  Have not they been molly-coddled and nursed over the decades? Have not State institutions bent over backwards?  Is there anything that was not done for them between tax concessions, export relief, IDA grants and so on?  You name it, they have received it.  The whole thrust of fiscal policy going back decades was directed towards creating the right climate to resolve our unemployment problem and did it ever do that?  It never did so.  There were times when it was marginally worse or better but they never got to grips with the problem. They never seemed to have any realistic prospects or adopt an approach in order to bring our unemployment rates down to the levels of the remainder of Europe or to those of other countries of a comparable level of natural resources and population.  They never did that. Relatively speaking, we have concentrated what meagre resources we have had over the years on helping them &mdash; for the most part foreign firms &mdash; to do that.  For the most part did we not bend the knee, cajole and beg them to come here from all over the world?  One must remember the hundreds of millions of pounds given them, never mind invested, but given them by way of grants.  It would not do one good to total the amount that must have been paid out over all those years.  All right, it must be admitted that they created some employment, some viable, some continuous, but a very large proportion has gone.  We had Mostek last week, which was the latest in a long line. It is not the climate here that caused that. Rather was it that we placed our reliance on that format of national development. The theory was &mdash; do anything, bring them in from Japan, Germany, Italy, <Col N="336" /> wherever one liked.  Let them do it; we will give them enough money.  Let them solve our employment problem for us. When it suited them they solved their profit problems all right.  But certainly they never solved our unemployment problem.  They gave no indication of it then and have given no indication of doing so now.</P>
    <P>When I am critical of the private sector in general terms in failing to meet the needs of our people over the years that should not be taken as a blanket criticism of the private sector.  I do not intend it that way.  There are, of course, very many first class firms in the private sector, both indigenous and foreign firms, who play a very valuable and important role in providing the viable employment that, God knows, we need.  They have their role to play and more power to them. The criticism I am making is that the private sector, as such, has not nearly met our needs.  Are we to continue as before, paying lip service to the idea that we will make grants available, continue the same old previous, tired policy and, like Mr. Micawber, hope that something will turn up?</P>
    <P>Nothing will turn up, nothing will happen unless we come to a determined conclusion that we will make it happen. The days are finished for placing our entire reliance on enterpreneurs, at home or abroad, to do the job for us.  We do not have to do that because I firmly believe that, with our resources and available expertise and money which we can raise or borrow, we can set about doing the job ourselves.  That is true, modern nationalism.  People, including international economists, recognise that the old system has failed.  We must recognise that fact and I regret that the Fianna Fáil Party seem very reluctant to face up to this and to recognise it.  Indeed, the whole thrust of the speech by Deputy Lyons reminded me of the old saying among law students when I was studying law that in the practice of law if you had a very bad case you attacked the witnesses for the opposition.  Deputy Lyons was attacking the witnesses for the opposition instead <Col N="337" /> of giving a constructive analysis of how he would resolve the situation.</P>
    <P>Economists world wide, in the OECD in particular, recognise the failure of our policies up to now in relying on the grant system through the IDA and hoping that it would resolve our problems through foreign firms setting up here.  An OECD observer, referring to our industrialisation situation, said that our industrialisation policy which has concentrated on encouraging foreign companies to establish plants in Ireland proved less efficient than had been hoped in generating employment and developing a broad infrastructure of supply industries.  It is an understatement to say that it has proved less efficient than had been hoped.  That is putting it at its very best. It has done considerably worse than that.</P>
    <P>What did the foreign companies who worked well do?  Were they out to help us?  I am not referring to Mostek and firms like them who closed down and left their workers stranded but to firms who did well from grants provided by the Irish taxpayer.  Did they plough the money back into their businesses?  Did they set up new ventures here with their profits which would create additional employment? They did not.  They just pumped their profits back to their head offices.  As the OECD observer pointed out, foreign companies have regularly remitted over half their earnings to their parent organisations. The outflow of repatriated profits rose from £258 million in 1980 to £940 million in 1984, amounting to 6½ per cent of our GNP.  That was the thanks we got from the international firms for all the assistance they were given.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in our economic set up is that we have not seen to the establishment of manufacturing firms of a sufficient size and with sufficient funding to enable those firms to compete on the international markets.  We have had small firms aplenty.  That has not been the problem but we lack major, substantial manufacturing capacities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  If our private sector <Col N="338" /> had been able to organise itself over the years when these things were provided we would not be in such dire straits now in regard to employment.  However, with minor exceptions, they never did this and this is where the role of the National Development Corporation will be crucial. That is the reason the Labour Party welcome the fact that a substantial capital sum of £300 million will be made available by the Government to enable us to set up manufacturing capacities in a number of major industries.  We can do that and let nobody think otherwise.  If we have the confidence to do that we can do it, and we do not have to wait for anybody else to set it up.</P>
      <P>We are now setting up the means of doing this and the money will also be provided.  Engineers are graduating from our third level institutions who can be of great assistance in this regard.  The National Development Corporation can also do it and are given power in the Bill to do so.  That is a major achievement in the Bill by the Labour Party and that kind of power was not provided for in the White Paper which concentrated on a secondary level of investment.</P>
      <P>We have achieved a major improvement in that the NDC are empowered to set up manufacturing institutions.  People asked what sort of things they could realistically set up.  There are a wealth of things which they can set up.  I am not talking about major items such as cars and aeroplanes because even with £300 million these would be well beyond our capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are innumerable opportunities that the NDC can take up on their own behalf or jointly with the private sector.  In appropriate cases I see nothing ideologically wrong &mdash; neither do the Labour Party &mdash; in having joint ventures with the private sector where the expertise, resources and opportunities may be there.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention a few possibilities &mdash; the list is endless.  I refer to items such as surgical and medical instruments, chemicals, food processing, food processing machinery and pumping equipment. These are just a few items.  In his opening speech the Minister said there were opportunities for new things.  I am not quite sure what he meant by &ldquo;new&rdquo;.  Let me put it this way: they do not have to be new but they could be new for us and if that is so then they are new enough. One has only to look at all the manufactured goods we buy.  Only a very small proportion is manufactured here and it is ever-decreasing to our eternal shame.  I hope we will be able to reverse the situation to some extent at least and to an extent that will increase as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard the response of Fianna Fáil to the introduction of this measure. Deputy Lyons has been quoting from newspaper cuttings but the reports I saw stated that Fianna Fáil were opposed to this Bill and that if they come back to Government they would repeal it and abolish the National Development Corporation. That was a most remarkable comment and one can hardly understand its sense.  Were they to say that when they got back to Government they would consider if the National Development Corporation were good or bad and if they found it was bad they would abolish the corporation, at least one could see some sense in that kind of comment.  However, to say before the Bill is brought in or debated and before a factory is set up that they do not want to know and that when they get back to Government they will abolish the National Development Corporation is a reflection on a party who put themselves forward as an alternative Government.  What a sad reflection and what a poor level of Opposition is shown <Col N="340" /> by such a reaction, without even seeing what employment could be created in Cork and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is important that the corporation when operational should have the flexibility to run themselves as a major commercial complex, which is what we hope will happen when they develop and build themselves up over time.  In the Labour Party we were very unhappy about earlier suggestions that time limits for selling off would have to be set.  We did not think that made good commercial sense.  Any major conglomerate must be in control of their affairs, must decide what they will retain and for how long, how they will invest and so on.  That aspect has been improved in the Bill to a major extent, although not to a complete extent.  Nonetheless, there has been a substantial improvement and a fair measure of flexibility is provided for the board of the National Development Corporation as to how they will run their affairs.</P>
    <P>My own view is that there could be occasions when it might be right or appropriate for a project to be sold off.  We do not say that every investment made, every project and factory set up must be retained indefinitely.  However, we take the view that if the corporation set up a factory that is going well, where viable employment is created and where it is making a profit, it would be, in the words of the Bill, &ldquo;commercially prudent&rdquo; to retain that investment.  By all means take the profit thereby generated and put that profit into the revolving fund to use as a base for creating additional outlets and additional sources of employment.  Perhaps it could be subsidiaries that would be related to a particular manufacturing capacity.  That would be good and prudent sense if things were going well but we do not want a situation where the State would take a risk in the form of the National Development Corporation and then find that the project is sold off so that the private sector reaps the benefit. That is not our intention and we do not anticipate that matters should operate in that way.</P>
    <P>Of course the decision regarding what <Col N="341" /> will be retained and what will be commercially viable to retain will be made by the board.  I was pleased to see that the Minister specifically excluded himself from directives on that aspect of the matter.  It highlights the importance of membership of the board of the National Development Corporation.  The personnel who will occupy the seats on that board will be crucial to the success of the corporation.  Tremendous care will have to be taken in making those appointments to ensure, first and foremost, that they are people who are dedicated and committed to the public sector, that they are people who are convinced that the future creation of employment through the corporation will be achieved in ever-increasing numbers by using the resources of the corporation.  These people will have to work aggressively and with determination to create the employment we need so desperately, using the opportunity that will be given to them by way of this Bill. People of commitment and dedication to the public service will be required and I trust tremendous care will be taken in making those appointments.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the National Enterprise Agency could do what it is intended that the National Development Corporation will do and that what is being proposed is a duplicate of the IDA.  The Minister has dealt with some of those matters in his speech.  Perhaps the National Enterprise Agency could do that or perhaps they could not.  The NEA were set up by a Fianna Fáil Government who were never very enthusiastic about the agency.  The latter were never given the proper resources or given the directive to intervene in the market and to set up major industrial projects in an aggressive manner to deal with our serious problems in the way that is being done here with the National Development Corporation.  The IDA have had, and still have, a very important role to play.  Nobody is suggesting that the advent of the National Development Corporation means that the IDA are redundant.  Far from it.  So serious are our unemployment and employment positions that we need to avail of and exploit <Col N="342" /> every opportunity open to us &mdash; in the private sector, joint ventures, the semi-State sector and now through the National Development Corporation, the State sector &mdash; if we are to have any hope of tackling the present situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons said there was nothing in <i>Building on Reality</i> that would contribute to our economic progress.  I cannot say I would regard that document as my bible, very far from it, but it does contain the parameters for the National Development Corporation and that will, I hope, turn out to be a very significant and important factor for us.  That is the position. We are on the threshold of a new development.  It is true to say that many people do not as yet fully appreciate what the National Development Corporation is all about.  To many people it is just a series of three more initials.  The National Development Corporation is about the creation of jobs, taking an interventionist role in the economy, seeing that we will no longer be passive on this subject and that we will no longer sit back hoping somebody will come along and do something for us &mdash; an Irish or foreign entrepreneur. We must make a decision that we will not just sit back and hope something will happen, that somehow these jobs will appear.</P>
    <P>This is a new exciting prospect.  Without relying on anybody else, but by using our own work force &mdash; whom we have educated over the years in our technical colleges and universities &mdash; and all the money we can gather, we are setting up a national development corporation to build, develop and expand different ventures. I hope the State will not make the mistake of dissipating precious funds on a number of small ventures.  The emphasis must be on setting up a number of large manufacturing projects which will be able to compete with the other manufacturing countries of the western world.  If we get one, two or three of these projects off the ground, the boost they would provide would be immeasurable and would be a source of encouragement not only to expansion in the public sector but also in the private sector as well, and could be a green light for us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> It is up to us as a people to unite on this, and to determine that we will make it work and that we will plough into that corporation all it needs and all it takes to make it work.  I believe we have the capabilities to do that.  We can look forward with some degree of hope to something positive being done, seeing people working in factories which we have set up, goods being sold abroad and goods which up to now have been imported, being sold at home.</P>
    <P>We are at a very interesting stage.  This is a new development, a new challenge and I believe we can meet that challenge which will be of tremendous benefit for our economy and for employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds:</NameTxt>
      <P>I only wish I could share the enthusiasm expressed by Deputy Taylor about the National Development Corporation.  Fianna Fáil would welcome any meaningful measure by this Government to confront what I can only describe as a crisis of frightening proportions &mdash; approximately 230,000 unemployed. These figures have been kept down by very high emigration over the past 18 months and, if recent trends continue, we are in for a very tough winter.</P>
      <P>I can understand Deputy Taylor and the Members of the Labour Party blowing their trumpet after three years waiting in the wings for a type of national development corporation.  The concept and idea of the National Development Corporation first appeared on the Irish political scene in the mid seventies when it was an objective of the Coalition Government from 1973 to 1977.  I suspect the same problems that beset the setting up of this National Development Corporation over the past three years were also evident around the Cabinet table in 1973-77 because by the end of that period in Government, the National Development Corporation still had not surfaced.  There was nothing done about it in 1977-81.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a concept we never shared.  I would love to be convinced about this by the debate but, reading the Minister's speech, I am as unconvinced as I was before he made his contribution.  Let us <Col N="344" /> be honest for a moment in a political sense.  I share the same political concepts as Deputy Bruton because he no more believes in the National Development Corporation than I do.  He never did and he never will.  I am making that statement deliberately because I have listened to him speak about this so often.  He has taken out some of the provisions he found objectionable but, in my honest opinion, this corporation has only seen the light of day because of pressure.  I know the rebellion which existed in the Labour and Fine Gael Parties in recent times when they lost their nerves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not have been at the same meeting as Deputy Skelly and others when the Minister for Education was called arrogant and another Minister was called everything else and when other backbenchers, even with relations in the Cabinet, said they were the worst bunch who ever appeared on the political scene.  Contradict that if you wish.  Those comments were made in public by Government backbenchers. The Deputy's party managed to keep that dampened down for a long time but it finally broke through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was under such circumstances that the NDC was born.  It has been stillborn since the mid-seventies.  Indeed, in 1981 we heard about it in a programme for Government.  That Government collapsed very quickly on a budget and I am aware of the hurry and scurry that went on in the Department of Industry and Energy to try to get a few leaflets together for the Minister, Deputy Michael <Col N="345" /> O'Leary, to bring to a hurried press conference to try to resurrect once again a national development corporation. Deputy O'Leary was not fooling the pressmen on that occasion because within a few minutes they knew that such a corporation was a non-starter.  They were aware that work had not been done on it.</P>
    <P>I defy any Member to contradict what I have said.  On being made Minister in 1982 I asked for the file on the national development corporation.  I will not say what the boys in the Department said to me, but I knew by the smiles on their faces that they did not want to bring me an empty file.  Finally, they brought a file and I will not attempt to describe to the House what the corporation was supposed to mean.  Following the general election in 1981 I took over as Minister for Industry and Energy and I was not convinced that a national development corporation would work.  I am not being shallow in making that statement and I have looked at similar organisations that have been tried in Belgium, the UK and other European countries.  The only exception to the rule was Sweden but that country has managed to run State industries very well.  One must admire the way they run their State industries but the concept is different from what is proposed here.  Our track record has been very poor in the management of State industries with some exceptions.  Different politicians may have different views as to why that is the position.  It is my view that the Devlin report damaged and killed the enthusiasm and innovation which were part and parcel of our thriving semi-State organisations for a long time.</P>
    <P>I live in the real world and I am aware that in the State and private sectors one must operate in the market place but, when it is decided that the chief executive post must be held down by the Department of the Public Service one cannot expect success.  I would prefer not to have mentioned that Department because I do not want to know that they exist.  I never believed that they should exist &mdash; another layer of bureaucracy.  That Department, aided and abetted by the Devlin report, <Col N="346" /> have held down the enthusiasm, innovation and drive that were part and parcel of our semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>I do not have any hang-ups about having semi-State industries but I want the criteria of success applied.  When I look across the board I cannot see, with certain exceptions, why that cannot be done.  I believe in paying the person who has to carry the responsibility.  I do not believe that person should be in the job for life and that he should be sitting on a soft chair irrespective of the results he produces.  That is why it is my view that the quicker the Devlin report forms part of a bonfire the better.  Our semi-State sector needs a new lease of life and we do not need talk of NDCs and so on. Successive Governments have honoured the Devlin report, but how can any person with common sense expect a chief executive of a semi-State organisation, who has a huge responsibility to the number of staff employed, to do a good job and get the feeling that something is being achieved when at the same time a small industry in the private sector pays a chief executive much more?  We should stop codding ourselves and take one step in the right direction by getting rid of the Devlin report.</P>
    <P>Semi-State companies do not need the NDC to go into joint ventures.  They should be given the ways and means of running at the opportunities themselves. We have plenty of examples of such successes. For example, how many ventures have Aer Lingus embarked upon with the NDC to prod them?  Aer Lingus went into the development of hotel chains around the world and I wonder what would be the position of our national airline today had they not done so?  The company got involved in a very successful venture on the Naas road in Dublin Airmotive. Their venture into the area of computers was very successful.  When a food company in Cork, Swissco Limited, got into trouble Aer Lingus, and others, stepped in and put that company back on the road.  It has been very successful since.  I have no doubt that there are many more examples of such successes. <Col N="347" /> There was no need for the NDC to prod them.</P>
    <P>Having followed all the rows that went on in regard to this, I cannot be convinced that the NDC is an agreed thing that will be made to work.  In the early days of the Government when there was talk of the NDC, I put it to the Minister that, if he believed that this could contribute to the creation of jobs, he had an opportunity to go to the companies registration office where, by using the names of two civil servants and paying £35, he could form a company.  I listened to the lame excuses that were tossed across the floor of the House such as that the Government wanted to give the corporation statutory backing.  That was three years ago and if the Government believed the corporation would contribute anything they could have formed a company with a statutory basis.  There are many precedents for such a procedure.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation does not have a statutory base and I am sure there are many others.  There was no commitment by the Minister to bring in such a corporation, good bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Taylor refer to the fact that the National Enterprise Agency were established by Fianna Fáil.  That was correct but they were disbanded by the Coalition in 1981.  In 1982 I had to resurrect that agency.  I heard Deputy Taylor say that there was no commitment to that agency, that they were not funded and did not get a chance.  I should like to remind Deputy Taylor that they were fully funded and were unable to spend the money allocated to them in the first year.  Those are the facts and we should deal in facts, not in fairy tales.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party should not try to convince the public that this is the great panacea for the unemployment problem. They are misleading the public by saying that they have a £300 million package for jobs.  The £300 million they are talking about is the authorised share capital of the corporation.  There was not one word from the Minister as to what share capital <Col N="348" /> will be taken up.  The Minister, or anybody else, could go to the Companies Registration Office and, for £35, form a company with £300 million authorised share capital, but it does not mean anything. That amounts to a paper exercise and that is what the Bill is all about.  It is a paper response to a national emergency. It is being used to keep the two sides in Government together.</P>
    <P>If the Government are serious about this they should tell the House how much issued share capital they will take up. Only then can we judge whether they have any commitment to this.  I heard the Minister, Deputy Quinn, say that this will speed the day when jobs will appear.  The jobs will not appear.  They have to be created, and that will not happen if the Government continue to try to fool the people by producing a document to get them over a problem.  You know the problem exists but you do not have the cohesive policy to deal with it.  I am delighted to adjourn the debate and take up this matter again tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's mishandling of public service pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of public sector pay increases has been handled in a bungling fashion <Col N="349" /> by the Government.  There are many reasons why we decided to move this motion on the first day of the Dáil after the recess.  Public service pay was one of the major issues during the recess and it is appropriate to discuss the matter in the Dáil rather than in the media.  Last Tuesday, for the first time 150,000 public servants took strike action and tomorrow, the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions meet. Tonight's debate gives the Minister an opportunity to outline the present position in regard to the reappointment of the arbitrator and other matters.  If the Minister's plans remain unchanged further marches and stoppages will take place over the next few weeks.  Last Tuesday's public service strike over the Government's handling of a number of pay related issues involved hardship for many people.  Schools were closed, air services were brought to a standstill, Government Departments were unmanned except for a few senior staff, county councils and corporations closed, refuse collection, road works and maintenance services ceased, customs staff stayed away, thus losing revenue for the State, hospitals operated restricted services, court sittings were disrupted, meat factories ceased production, prison officers staged a protest.  These and the lack of many other services affecting the old, the infirm and unemployed brought the country to a standstill.  It is of paramount importance to discuss why this strike took place and put to the Government a case which would avoid a recurrence of this strike because of the damage caused to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The breakdown in negotiations between the Government and the public service trade unions, and the trade union movement in general, in recent months has occurred because of, amongst other things, the Government statement of 14 August which set out to impose a pay freeze in the public service for 1986, to refuse to honour special grade claims/pay findings and the non-appointment of the public service arbitrator.  When the Minister, on the day preceding the strike of <Col N="350" /> 15 October, said that he was prepared to negotiate a 25th round general pay agreement covering 1986 and beyond, to negotiate on other pay related matters and appoint an arbitrator in the context of agreement being reached on the first two proposals, provided that the public service committee agreed to enter into discussions about the various methods of public pay determination and to discuss any other matter which might be perceived as causing difficulties for the unions or their members, he acted far too late and after damage had been done to good industrial relations in the Civil Service and the public service generally.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to look at what developments occurred in the negotiations in the months prior to 15 October.  On 14 October last in the news analysis page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> the Minister stated that the Government were extremely taken aback that several days before the public service stoppage began, the leaders of the unions involved were not able to respond in any meaningful way to the positive initiatives which could have diverted the strike and that to his astonishment he had discovered that the public services committee delegation did not have the authority to negotiate pay rounds.  The Minister knew exactly the position in the public service on that date.  The reason they did not respond at that stage was that the public services committee did not seek a centralised 25th round because for most of the public service the 24th round does not end until the end of this year, and only the most preliminary steps had been taken to process the 25th round claim.  In the early summer, the public services committee resolved to discuss the 25th round and the committee's likely approach to it at the September meeting.  However, the Minister's statement of 14 August meant that the priority for the committee was not the arbitration system and the Labour Court as in 1984, but the removal from the negotiating table of the 12-month pay pause for 1986.  Even if they had wanted to have discussions on the centralised 25th round they would have needed the <Col N="351" /> mandate of the individual unions followed by a majority decision of the public services committee.  When the Minister made his various statements on 11 October and thereafter he knew that they had neither, yet he tried to make capital out of the fact that he had a mandate from the Government and was prepared to make an offer on the 25th round.  It is clear that the unions just wished to get an indication that the 25th round would not include a Government imposed pay freeze.</P>
    <P>I am astonished at what has happened because the warning signals were clear as far back as last April when the Civil Service general staff panel wrote to the Minister asking about the position on the arbitrator.  There was various correspondence after that in which the Minister seemed to say that they were delaying. However, it was clear from that correspondence what was the position of the central staff general council panel.  They separated the two matters of the arbitrator and the negotiations on conciliation and arbitration.  In a letter to the Minister I understand that the general staff panel said that they saw no connection between the appointment of the arbitrator and possible discussions on the operation of the present machinery for pay determination and accordingly they requested that the views of the Government regarding the appointment of Mr. Geoghegan, SC, be conveyed to the panel as a matter of some urgency.  It is unreasonable of the Minister to say that he was not absolutely clear as to the unions' position until the last minute. Relations with the unions were also clear from a number of statements made on 20 April 1985 at the annual meeting of the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants at which their secretary, Mr. Greg Maxwell, said that the Government were trying to dismantle the system of comparability and to abolish independent arbitration and rejected any invitation from the Minister to enter into the &ldquo;spider's web,&rdquo; as he put it.  The chairman of the same union, Mr. Alan Craig, told the same conference that they must be ready <Col N="352" /> to take action at any time to protect their vital interests and the fundamental base where pay determination is threatened. What would happen later in the year was quite clear.  On 18 September, almost a month before the strike, the Government reported that they were surprised at the decision of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to back out of the 1 October meeting on the jobs crisis.  The congress decided not to talk to the Government because of the Government's demand for the 12-months pay freeze and the non-appointment of the arbitrator.  For the Minister to try to give the impression that he was unaware of what might happen on the non-appointment of the arbitrator is silly.  The build up of hostilities did not only stem from the 14 August statement, though clearly the Government's indication that they accepted that the basis for determining conditions of pay and employment should be free collective bargaining and that the Government concluded that apart from existing commitments under the national plan there should be no increase in the public service for at least 12 months from the expiry date of the 24th round, indicated a conflict of interests.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for the Public Service when appointed was the first Cabinet Minister with full responsibility for the Department of the Public Service, and much play was made of that at the time.  He commenced his task in a manner which spoke of effectiveness and efficiency. I leave others to judge whether he has achieved those.  Time and time again he decided to adopt terrier-like tactics of confrontation and bringing people to the battle lines rather than consultation and conciliation which would be more appropriate in matters as delicate as industrial relations.  I am sure that his colleague, the Minister for Labour, would agree with me on that.</P>
    <P>I will give a few examples of the many attacks on the public service.  At the 1983 Fine Gael Ard-Fheis the Minister made a hard hitting speech on the public service and stated among other things that he had enough pious rhetoric about reform of the public service and that the great <Col N="353" /> stumbling block to change had been an attitude most often prevalent amongst senior management based on the traditional approach which was, &ldquo;If it works, why change it?&rdquo;.  That is an unfair way to attack senior civil servants.</P>
    <P>On 31 August 1983 the Minister was compared to Adolf Hitler and Margaret Thatcher by the leader of the Civil and Public Service Staff Association over a dispute on computerisation involving clerical assistants.  At one stage in those negotiations the Minister decided to take away the right of the staff to stop the automatic deduction of union dues and stated at the time, &ldquo;If the other side will not abide by the rules and refuse to accept an independent referee, they cannot expect us to play ball&rdquo;.  This is an extraordinary remark by a Minister who within a year was to attempt to take away the referee altogether.  He told the Association of Higher Civil Servants at their annual conference in early May this year that the Civil Service does not exist for the benefit of civil servants.  Is it necessary to tell any civil servant that?  At the same conference, although a motion had been withdrawn by the relevant branch and by the executive, he spoke of motions on anarchy.</P>
    <P>At the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis on 6 October 1984 the Minister, speaking on pay, stated as Government policy that there would be no further increases for public servants in 1984 and a nominal increase in 1985.  He said that any new demands for special increases during the life of the plan could not be countenanced and, having regard to the very special advantages public servants enjoy at present in the way of security of employment, they should refrain from taking any action which might be seen to threaten the success of the Government's plan for the restoration of public finances. He stated that by and large civil servants have recession-proof jobs but they cannot expect at the same time to have inflation-proof pay, that any such demands could not be countenanced by any member of the Government and that if the Government's plan did not succeed public servants would, more directly than any other <Col N="354" /> group, have to suffer the direct consequences. He told them also that it was not an exaggeration to say that their jobs were at risk.  If those were not warmongering statements and attacks on the public service then I do not know what they were.  The Minister made several other statements of a similar nature and eventually, in face of the threat of a strike in October 1984, he gave in.  The arbitrator was appointed, and the Minister continued to make statements that nothing outside the plan could be paid.</P>
    <P>On the eve of the 1985 budget, having set aside £20 million for public service pay, the Government said that they would pay the arbitrator's award, that they accepted it and that £88 million would have to be found overnight.  As I pointed out at the opening of the debate on the budget, this gave rise to a very strange coincidence.  I remind the House and those outside it of that £88 million because if I have heard the Minister once I have heard him a hundred times this summer saying that the only way an increase in public service pay can be got is through taxation or foreign borrowing. That £88 million was obtained by revenue bouyancy.  An estimated £58 million was just stuck into the budget and the extra £30 million was estimated savings on staff costs.  That is how the books were balanced. After all the talk about how sacrosanct the figures in the national plan for public service pay were, £88 million could be got overnight and it is difficult to accept that the only way it could be got was by additional taxation or borrowing. Events this year are following the same pattern, except that because of Government mismanagement and indecision a more serious dimension has now been introduced.  The Government and the Minister for the Public Service, in particular, succeeded in arousing the anger and hostility of virtually every man and woman employed in the public service. Whether in the Civil Service, the local authorities, schools, hospitals or elsewhere, that anger and hostility more than anything else brought the thousands of public sector employees on to the streets last Tuesday week.  The Minister for the <Col N="355" /> Public Service has been engaged in Civil Service bashing since he took up office, as I have outlined.  It would seem that he deliberately sets out to paint a picture of the Irish Civil Service as comprised of people with cushy jobs who do little or no work and are no better than parasites living off the taxpayer.  The Minister likes to present himself as the great crusader who would like to change that.</P>
    <P>Civil servants rightly regard this as a libel on themselves which they and all who have first hand knowledge of the capacity and calibre of the Civil Service resent bitterly.  The many thousands of civil servants who have been characterised, as I have just described, by the Minister for the Public Service over the past three years must have smiled cynically to themselves when the Minister went on television to say that he was against those who were involved in Civil Service bashing and to pay tribute to the staff.  Public servants will have little difficulty in identifying the real civil servant basher.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service and the Government must realise the damage they have done to the Civil Service in the way they have constantly kicked it around and because of the shape and manner in which they have continued to portray it. Every Minister and ex-Minister of this House will testify to the high competence and total integrity of our Civil Service. This has been one of our country's great assets at home and abroad down the years, and that any Government should set out as this Government have done to degrade the Civil Service is nothing short of disgraceful.  Not to be unfair to the Minister for the Public Service, let me say that the Minister for Education made probably some of the worst remarks of all and they will be dealt with by some of the other speakers to this motion.  Apart from her morality speech, she said when talking about the loyalty of civil servants, &ldquo;They give that kind of service because they appreciate the special conditions of employment they enjoy, the most advantageous being permanency as well as very generous pension rights.&rdquo;  Nobody could <Col N="356" /> agree with that comment.  They give because of dedication to their job and nothing else.  That remark was totally unfair as was the rest of the speech which she made in O'Shea's Hotel.</P>
    <P>Civil servants have no voice in this Chamber and I would like to put down some facts here.  Since 1981 we have had the 22nd, 23rd and 24th pay rounds which commenced on 1 December 1981 and ended on 31 December.  Inflation is about 37 or 38 per cent and the civil servants received an increase of 24 per cent, 14 per cent less than the inflation rate.  The Minister for the Public Service and others in the Government say that public servants have got all their increases in line with inflation.  If that is wrong the Minister can correct me later, but on my figures they have lost 14 per cent, which surely pays for their permanent, pensionable and recession-proof jobs.  Was it not the Taoiseach who when this House met last on 11 July this year said that, this is now one of the healthiest economies in Europe with a growth rate higher than anywhere else; that this year the after tax income of workers will be up rather than down, that purchasing power will rise for the first time in six years, that private consumption and living standards will rise for the first time in years?  Shortly afterwards the Dáil went into recess.  On 14 August the Government stated that there should be no pay increase in the public service for at least 12 months after the expiry date of the 24th round.  That is an extraordinary change about in a few weeks.</P>
    <P>There is no argument about this country's economic difficulties, but on the question of pay determination it is essential that some conditions exist to determine public servants' wages.  An agreed and independent neutral party to whom disputes between employers and workers can be referred is also essential.  The alternative which we now have is confrontation in which the winner is the group who can inflict the most damage.</P>
    <P>Comparison with the pay of workers in outside bodies doing comparable work has been the principle in determining pay for the public sector since the fifties.  The <Col N="357" /> Labour Court and the Public Service Arbitration Board are the independent third parties to whom disputes in the public service are referred for recommendation. The arbitrator, usually a senior counsel, is agreed by both unions and Government.  It was to maintain this system that thousands went on strike on Tuesday of last week.  During the week I read the Official Report of 30 March 1938, column 1196, volume 70 when Deputy Costello moved:</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Government should immediately establish machinery whereby conditions of employment in the Civil Service and other matters which may from time to time be in dispute between the Government and the Civil Service would be settled by agreement between the representatives of the Government and of the Civil Service associations, and, in default of such agreement, would be submitted for decision to an independent arbitration board, the awards of which, subject to the overriding authority of the Oireachtas, the Government would undertake to implement.</P>
    <P>He went on to fight the case for arbitration and he ended up by saying, and I quote from column 1210 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>For these reasons I believe that this machinery of arbitration should be set up in the public interest &mdash; not in the interest of a Party or even of the personnel of the Civil Service, but in the interest of an incorruptible Civil Service, an efficient Civil Service, and an independent Civil Service and, ultimately and in the last analysis, in the general interests of the public &mdash; of the people of this country at the present time and of the generations to be in the future.</P>
    <P>We are in that future and the Minister for the Public Service is trying extremely hard to dismantle the conciliation and arbitration machinery which has served the country well for 30 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I shall conclude by making some constructive suggestions by way of trying to overcome the impasse.  The road the Minister is taking is not leading anywhere, but I do not think that the unions, public service employees or any of us in Opposition have any wish for further strikes. It was a shame that last week's stoppage occurred.  It was caused by delay, procrastination, arrogant statements and so on.  Action must be taken now to avoid any further national stoppage.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the following recommendations would not cause any loss of face to anyone and would solve the dispute quickly.  These recommendations are, first, the re-appointment of the arbitrator and the continued operation as before of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Secondly, the Minister should invite the public service committee to discuss at an early date a possible 25th round pay agreement for the public service which would take into account any pay related matters other than awards made already.  Thirdly, with regard to the special grade findings which have either been signed by the arbitrator or are pending signature, the Government should negotiate with the individual unions concerned and with the public service executive of the ICTU a solution which would be acceptable both to the Government and to the unions.  If that is not possible the Government should bring their proposals to the Dáil.  At that stage the House could decide whether to accept or reject the proposal.  Lastly, as a matter of urgency, the Government should call on the public service unions to enter into meaningful discussions on the present conciliation and arbitration system for public pay determination.  In the meantime the present system should continue as before.</P>
    <P>There is much room for discussion on the conciliation and arbitration system which may be both in the interest of the Government and of the public service unions.  The conciliation and arbitration schemes for the public service, local authorities, teachers and the Garda are similar, with the exception that the Civil Service and the teachers have a clause <Col N="359" /> whereby a decision must be brought before this House if agreement cannot be reached.  Perhaps it would be in the interest of the nation if a pay research board, to which there has been reference frequently, for the public service and the private sector were established.</P>
    <P>Invariably what happens is that the public service accept the minimum and then must endeavour by way of grade claims to keep in line with people in comparable positions in the private sector. On that basis the various findings of the board either in the public or the private sector could be examined and in that way a clearer indication could be given as to what increase the country could or could not afford at any time, taking into account the different and varying circumstances of the sectors involved.  If such a board were established and functioning properly, the conciliation and arbitration scheme might not be as overburdened with grade claims as it is now.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to support the motion, to re-appoint the Arbitrator and restore the proper machinery for the resolution of disputes.  This is the key issue in the present impasse.  By acting in this way the Minister would not be prevented from seeking and entering into discussions on machinery for the future.  The Minister's argument can be compared to that of his colleague, the Minister for Labour, entering into discussions on his industrial relations document by asking first that the unions shut down the Labour Court in order to concentrate the minds of the unions.  The success of the Minister for Labour in such action should be self evident and I contend that the same fate faces the Minister for the Public Service. He should acknowledge his misjudgment and announce to the House this evening the appointment of the Arbitrator.  Then we could move forward.  Otherwise the country will face many difficulties and much argument.  The Minister never thought matters would reach the stage they are at now.  He was advised badly and he adopted an arrogant approach. He should avail of this debate to end the matter now rather than waiting until <Col N="360" /> several more national strikes have taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann approves of the Government's action in authorising the Minister for the Public Service to offer to negotiate, within the unavoidable Exchequer constraints an agreement with the Public Services Committee of ICTU covering the 25th pay round and other pay-related issues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Opposition spokesperson for the Public Service and Labour has said that the last thing the country needs is confrontation and argument.  I wish to begin my contribution by agreeing with that sentiment.  We do not need that kind of confrontation.  As Minister for Labour I regret very much last week's stoppage. However, it is very important that we keep a sense of perspective.  The constraints on the Exchequer at this time are very severe.  The fact that annual debt servicing needs now exceed annual PAYE receipts is one measure of the dimension of the problem.  The difficulties faced by employees in meeting their own and their families needs are severe also as the Government are all too well aware.  In such circumstances there are bound to be tensions and difficulties between the Government and public service employees, but these difficulties are not in any way unique to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scarcely a country in western Europe which has not had to effect some measure of retrenchment in the area of public service pay and in some of those cases the retrenchment has been far more severe than anything experienced here. As recently as Tuesday of last week, the entire employment of Greece was closed following such severe type of action. When the extent of our problems in relation to public finances is compared with theirs, the comparison is worth <Col N="361" /> noting.  I regard these tensions and problems not as a curtailment of free collective bargaining but as fit subjects for resolution within the context of free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to something the Opposition spokesman said at the outset of his historical review.  He referred to a pay diktat.  There is no basis for assertions about a pay diktat.  The 24th round award for the great majority of public service employees is not set to expire until 31 December 1985, more than two months away.  It is far from uncommon for employees to have received no firm offer from their employer two months after a pay award has expired, but it is very uncommon indeed for employees to have received a firm offer from their employer two months before an awared is due to expire.  Yet not only have the Government indicated their intention to negotiate a 25th round agreement but the Minister for the Public Service has offered also to table an opening pay offer on behalf of the Government.  In these circumstances I suggest that use of the inaccurate and inapplicable term, &ldquo;diktat&rdquo; should cease immediately.</P>
    <P>Much of the recent comment about public service pay seems to reflect little more than a misunderstanding of the role of the Government in this area.  The Government have a responsibility to the 170,000 or so employees in the public service but they also have a much wider responsibility to 3,500,000 citizens, which figure includes also those public servants. The Government's responsibility for the public finances cannot be shut off totally from their responsibility as an employer.</P>
    <P>Just as the Government understand the role of the public service unions and do not expect them to abandon claims because of the problems in the public finance, so also the role of Government should be understood and they should not be expected to concede claims without regard to their financial circumstances.  It would be an abnegation of the Government's responsibility, not just to the country as a whole but also in a real way to their own employees, for them to take the course of action that some people <Col N="362" /> have suggested.  More than most people, the position of public servants is dependent on the health of the public finances. If the health of the public finances is critically undermined, the stability or standard of employment of public service workers will suffer sooner or later.  The former Chief Whip of the previous Administration, Deputy Ahern, is well aware of what I am referring to.</P>
    <P>While public servants may oppose particular restrictions imposed by Governments at a given time, they will have far greater cause for complaint if this Government concede demands without regard to the capacity of the Exchequer to bear them.  I noted with interest in relation to the machinery available to the public service that, among the quotations which Deputy Ahern read into the record of this evenings debate, he referred to a quotation from as far back as 1938, when a Fianna Fáil Government were in power.  A prominent member of the Fine Gael Party at that time, Deputy John A. Costello, was arguing on behalf of the public service that the Fianna Fáil Government should establish a C &amp; A scheme.  It is extraordinary that that Government and, indeed, successive Fianna Fáil Governments, did not see fit to establish such a scheme.  It was not until the inter-Party Government were in office in 1954-57 that the Leader of my party, Deputy Norton, put on the Statute Book the very kind of scheme to which Deputy Ahern was referring.  History can be very selectively quoted for the purposes of opposition and debate.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the time allotted to me by agreement on both sides of the House, may I conclude as Minister <Col N="363" /> for Labour by saying that the Minister for the Public Service on behalf of the Government has given the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions a firm commitment to negotiate the 25th round and other pay-related issues?  As Deputies will be aware, it is an article of faith with Ministers for Labour that there are few differences that cannot be resolved through negotiation.  There is nothing whatsoever about the present situation that would make me depart from this conviction.  I urge the Public Services Committee to accept the Government's offer to begin such negotiations without any further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion in the names of Deputy Ahern, Deputy O'Kennedy and myself that we condemn the Government's mishandling of public service pay.  I could not help paying attention to a statement by the Minister for Labour that what the public service did not want to hear were exhortations about pay or any other issues.  I refer now to exhortations which were addressed particularly to our teachers.  I was glad to hear the Minister say he was of the opinion that the public service did not want these exhortations.  It has been very noticeable in the debate so far, from the Government side, that no specific reference has been made to the C &amp; A scheme already leaked to the media but which had not yet reached the Government. The Minister said that everything was on the table, to put it in more ordinary parlance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak tonight as Opposition spokesperson on Education.  When I was appointed nearly three years ago by the Leader of our Party &mdash; and I digress a little, but there is a point to my digression &mdash; I made a speech about the introduction of charges for school buses.  I was lectured very firmly by the Minister for Education to the effect that it was not my duty to oppose and that she would regard it as a reprehensible step were I to stand up <Col N="364" /> for my constituents or for my area of responsibility throughout the country. On several occasions since then she has adopted a hectoring, lecturing tone of voice when speaking of her duties, and, as she would see them, my duties.  I have quite firmly, and may I say with modesty, consistently resisted such exhortations. In my party, Fianna Fáil, I represent educational interests.  I represent goodwill for education and, while I continue in this position, I shall say what I have to say.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that it is the Minister's deliberate arrogance and calculated contempt for teachers which have caused the proposed confrontation between teachers and herself.  It is important to put clearly on the record of the House for future reference that, if there are educational stoppages over the coming months, it will be because the Government have deliberately brought them about and have acquiesced in the Minister's blundering and her bombastic statements on Monday 19 August and Tuesday 20 August.</P>
    <P>I refer to what has been called, infamously, her morality speech.  I think that the Minister for Education was on a high at that time.  She had been given, correctly I am sure, a good rating in TAM polls.  There was talk that she might become Minister for Finance.  Does that not seem hilarious now?  What happened to her then, as has happened to Ministers on both sides of this Chamber, was that she got caught up in the belief that what was said in the papers was true and that she would become &ldquo;macho female&rdquo; as the Minister Deputy Boland had become &ldquo;macho male,&rdquo; if such a discrepancy were possible.  She decided to give her famous speech to the country and to the nation.  It would be correct for me at this time to quote the words that cause the rift.  They were spoken in O'Shea's Hotel, Bray, to Young Fine Gael, mark you:</P>
    <P>It is vital that all those organisations who publicly clamour for increases should address themselves to the morality of what they are about.</P>
    <P>That was the speech which started the <Col N="365" /> fire, which launched the rift and resulted in the clamour which has since arisen.  I want to repeat many of the things said by Deputy Ahern about the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It has been accepted by the Government, by employers and by teachers for the settlement of disputes. It is quite ridiculous for the Minister for Education to allege that teachers have behaved immorally in submitting themselves to a process of machinery set up by the Government.  One might as well say that everybody else involved in that process was also immoral.  The Minister may not like the result.  Indeed, the Government may not and lots of people may not.  However, the charge of immorality is offensive.  Every time I speak on this issue to anybody I put on my two hats, that of Education spokesperson and my previous career as a teacher.  I say categorically to this House that for a Minister for Education to issue offensive statements about people's morals is beyond her brief and should not be tolerated. Such statements should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The current scheme of conciliation and arbitration representative of all bodies involved in the management of primary, second level and other schools was agreed upon and signed by then Coalition Government in 1973.  The present claim by the teachers' unions was first presented in December 1982.  The claim is now being loudly disclaimed but it will be three years in gestation this coming December.  During last August a leak occurred in the national media giving the terms of the draft report which had been sent to Mr. Geoghegan.  All the indicators are that it was a Government-inspired leak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know who leaked it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am at one with Deputy Bell.  I am constrained by my position and I cannot say it but everybody knows who it was.  Right on cue with the leak we have the moralistic Minister with her halo clamped firmly on speaking to Young Fine Gael and later to the nation <Col N="366" /> on the radio and saying that this arbitration award would not be paid.  Today I listened to a replay of the tape so that it would be quite fresh in my mind.  We know the Biblical quotation &ldquo;Let those without fault cast the first stone&rdquo;.  The Minister cast the first stone and committed a grave indiscretion in rushing to the battlements and hurtling down the first stone.  The report had not been presented to the Government and has still not been presented.  The Minister breached the confidentiality of such a document.  It is nonsense for the Government to put hand on heart and declare that they cannot pronounce on the teachers' conciliation and arbitration issue because they have not yet received the report.  A Minister who, we are told, is one of the leading lights of this Government, went on radio and was not refuted by the Minister for the Public Service or the Minister for Labour or any other eminent people. Therefore we must take it that she spoke with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Government. This foolish action by the Minister has directly provoked the present <i>impasse.</i></P>
      <P>It is reasonable to expect that any Minister will argue for his or her Department. We always think in paternalistic or maternalistic terms of a Minister pleading for his or her public servants and arguing their case skilfully and well.  This Minister for Education has seen fit on more than one occasion to denigrate and castigate teachers in a thoroughly unpleasant and malicious fashion.  She is malicious about teachers.  I feel outrage welling up in me when one can discern the snideness and contempt with which she treats teachers. Two years ago there was a half-day stoppage and the remark by the Minister was that the teachers were lucky to have jobs. The Minister is not taking into account the educational needs of the children who are for practical purposes in her care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers do not want to go on strike, as shown by the long number of strike free years.  It was with great reluctance that many of the teachers I know took to the streets with their placards on that day.  Many of them would never have wanted to indulge in such behaviour but <Col N="367" /> it had been forced upon them by precipitated action and by the unilateral decision of the Minister which has not been repudiated by the Government.  Nine or ten weeks have passed since that speech to Young Fine Gael in the Minister's constituency and her comments on the radio programme the following morning but there has been no sign from the Government as to whether they agree.</P>
    <P>It was a very conscious decision by my party to wait and see what the Government intended to do on this matter.  I could have been as strident as the Minister but we decided to see how the issue would be treated by the Government. There has been total silence.  I discern among leading Ministers on the Government side an attempt to divide and conquer, an attempt within the trade union movement to separate the public service issue and the conciliation and arbitration matter.  To divide and conquer was an old colonial trick and I should not be surprised at the people who would purport to put it forward again.  That trick will not succeed.</P>
    <P>During the past few months and years we have had major changes and initiatives, many of which I have publicly praised, especially in relation to the curriculum and examinations system. Teachers and civil servants have been extraordinarily supportive of the Minister in these moves.  Will all of this now founder on the obstinacy of this woman?  If this happens, the cause of education in Ireland will have been very badly served. Far from being known as an historic Minister for Education, this Minister will be seen as the worst this country has known. On her head must it be if these actions continue.</P>
    <P>In the course of the speech I have mentioned, the Minister said that the executive of the teachers' unions were media crazy, starved for media attention. That is a lark, coming from the Minister for Education who, I have heard from very reliable sources, if she is not in the daily paper summons her advisers to know why.  The papers are rung madly and the photographs must go in the next <Col N="368" /> day or she will be equally very cross and will proceed on another lecturing binge. Yet she proposes to lecture the teachers' unions on looking for media attention. She is media mad herself.</P>
    <P>Education services have been massively cut back by this Minister during the past three years.  At the same time she has initiated many worthwhile programmes. Are all now to be thrown away because the Minister for Education has decided that she wants to go down in history as the strong woman, the Gráinne Mhaol of Ireland.  She will not be known as that; she will be known as the person who destroyed education and for ever lost the trust of the teachers, the children and their parents.  I beg her, for the sake of the educational future of this country, to take back what she has said.</P>

      <P>Our amendment No. 2 states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the attempt by the Government to impose a 12 month pay freeze for civil and public servants; deplores the arbitrary nature of the announcement of the Minister for the Public Service which has seriously undermined the procedures for negotiation and arbitration, carefully built up over many years; notes that public sector employees have already suffered greatly through cutbacks, recruitment embargoes, and increases below the rate of inflation; and therefore calls on the Government to (a) re-appoint the public sector arbitrator, (b) honour all awards made by the arbitrator, (c) enter into serious negotiations with public service unions with a view to reaching agreement on adequate increases for public servants, and particularly for the many workers in the public service, who at present earn below the average industrial wage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not have been necessary to put down that amendment if the pathetic Fianna Fáil motion had not appeared on <Col N="369" /> the Order Paper in such a form.  It can only be compared to the pathetic handling of the public pay issue by the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Education.  The Fianna Fáil motion seeks only to condemn the Government's mishandling of the public service pay issue and contains no suggestion as to what the Government should be doing and offers no indication of what Fianna Fáil would do if returned to office.  Deputy B.  Ahern fudged the whole issue of awards already dealt with by the arbitrator and I do not think it will be possible to find a solution to the problem which the Government face on the basis of fudging that issue.  It is significant that the motion proposed by Fianna Fáil lets off the hook all those Deputies on the Government side who have indicated that they oppose a pay freeze being pursued by the Government and who support the reappointment of an arbitrator. Deputies, particularly in the Labour Party, would have no problem in opposing the Fianna Fáil motion, but it would be only reasonable for them to support the amendment which I have tabled. Indeed, I ask Fianna Fáil to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>At the root of this dispute is the right of public sector workers to be accorded equal treatment with their colleagues in private employment, that is, the right to negotiate freely within procedures of arbitration and conciliation established over many years and to which they have applied themselves and agreed to abide by.  It is totally unacceptable, when agreements have been arbitrated, for the Government to decide that they want to change the rules.  It is totally unacceptable for the Government to blame public sector workers for the state of the public finances, to blame people who are struggling to provide public services in very difficult circumstances as a result of cutbacks and so forth.</P>
    <P>The records show that the public sector have been highly responsible in their approach to negotiation and arbitration. However, there is growing frustration at the arrogant attitudes of certain Ministers. It should be pointed out that the vast <Col N="370" /> majority of public servants are relatively poorly paid, many of them being below the industrial national average.  It is a popular misconception that they are well paid.</P>
    <P>I will give some examples of public service pay, taken from the 1985 State Directory.  I will give gross figures, before deductions for PAYE and PRSI.  A clerical officer earns as little as £104 per week; a clerical assistant has as little as £102; a messenger gets between £126 and £133; a cleaner gets £109 per week; and a private in the Army can earn as little as £103.  That dismisses the myth thrown around that public service workers are well paid, living off the fact of the land.  It is totally erroneous.</P>
    <P>The Government must accept the need to restore collective bargaining procedures in the public sector.  They should reappoint the public service arbitrator, agree to pay the awards already recommended by him and enter into realistic negotiations with the public service unions.  Therefore, I earnestly call on Fianna Fáil to accept my amendment. They would then clearly show where they stand and it would enable those Members of the Coalition parties who feel the way we feel to support a realistic proposal. We must not hold our public servants to ransom.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Boland, and other Ministers ask frequently where the money will come from.  The answer, given by various Ministers in the House during the years, shows that up to £700 million remains uncollected in taxes.  In his statement today the Taoiseach admitted that ten times the amount which this pay award would cost in real terms is outstanding in uncollected taxes.  That is where the money can be found to pay realistic wage levels to teachers, nurses and civil servants in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland):</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern read out an interesting script, including references going back to 1938, long before either of us was born and before a number of Deputies in the House came into existence.  I do not want to invite the House to go back that <Col N="371" /> far but I ask the House to remember 1982 when the Government of which Deputy Ahern was Whip made a unilateral announcement in the summer that the Government had decided that the employers would not agree to pay any further special increases in 1982 or 1983. The statement went on to say that the Minister for the Public Service would enter discussions with the public service committee of congress with a view to securing agreement to the postponement until 1 January 1983 of payment of the third phase increase in basic pay provided for in the current agreement between the committee and the Minister. Discussions to defer a phase of a general round increase negotiated just seven months previously by the same Government would be initiated.</P>
      <P>I invite Deputy Ahern to recall &mdash; he must remember discussions at Cabinet meetings which he would have attended as Whip &mdash; the reaction of the public services committee.  The committee totally rejected the Government's freeze on public service pay and demanded that the Government cease their unprecedented interference with the operation of the agreed industrial relations machinery throughout the public service.  The public services committee recommended the unions' participation in a co-ordinated campaign of industrial action to defend all pay agreements.</P>
      <P>Some days later, the General Purposes Committee of the Executive Council of the Congress of Trade Unions stated: &ldquo;This was an arbitrary breach of a freely negotiated agreement reached only months ago and cannot be justified under any pretext&rdquo;.  The statement went on:</P>
      <P>This peremptory attitude on the part of the Government is unacceptable and poses a serious threat to industrial peace.  To seek to operate by way of diktat spells the end of free collective bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern was Whip to a Government who were accused of diktat in 1982 and he now comes in to deliver from a script suggesting that this Government <Col N="372" /> are engaged in precisely the same thing. I will deal with that later.  The Congress statement went on to refer to the tearing up of agreements freely entered into and stated: &ldquo;This is the path to anarchy in industrial relations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement blamed the Government for their cynical and dictatorial abrogation of agreements entered into with the trade unions.  A letter from the public services committee some days later said it was the view of the committee that the Government were in breach of the current public service pay agreement. Since I became Minister I have not received any letter like that from anybody with whom I had entered into an agreement.  Later in 1982 Congress went on to make a statement that the arbitrary breach of freely negotiated agreements was unjustified and totally unacceptable to the trade union movement.  Congress warned that it would lead to confrontation and conflict, the responsibility for which lay wholly with the Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder how, in the light of that episode just three years ago, Deputy Ahern could have had the gall to come into the House today to make the contribution he did.  I can only say that the attitude by Fianna Fáil today at best is ambivalent and it would not be describing it at its worst to describe it as dishonest.  I will leave out, in view of his usual contributions in the House, the personal nature of the attack on me as Minister responsible for the discharge of Government policies, but it was interesting to see his obsessive interest in speeches made by me over the years.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to consider and the nation to reflect on Deputy Ahern's suggestion that pay increases can be funded from somewhere other than borrowing or taxation.  Perhaps when Deputy O'Kennedy speaks he will explain if pay increases are not to be funded from borrowing or taxation, how they will be funded.</P>

      <P>They come from cuts in or charges for public services.  We have <Col N="373" /> all seen just how politically unpalatable are those cuts and charges.  At present pay accounts for 45 per cent, almost half of net current expenditure, three-quarters of the remainder being spent on social welfare.  Therefore, the room for manoeuvre or the desirability to reduce further the other public services financed from the remainder is limited indeed. Presumably Deputy O'Kennedy will explain to the House in detail just which public services he wants cut or which public services he desires to be charged for if the raising of further borrowing or further taxation are not options.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity, nor would it be helpful in the context of the debate, to make any reference to the contribution of Deputy O'Rourke, which was not relevant to the text of the motion nor to any matter before the Government at present, except to say that this Government have never leaked, or been party to the leak, of any arbitration finding or draft finding.</P>

      <P>I should like to outline the developments that have taken place on the pay front over the past few weeks. On 8 October 1985 the executive committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions declined an invitation from the Taoiseach to meet the Government on the issue of public service pay.  In declining, they said that there was already an established mechanism for this purpose, that is, the public services committee of Congress. Their statement also urged all members of public service unions to support the one-day stoppage on 15 October called by the PSC and affiliated unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government expressed regret at <Col N="374" /> the Congress response in view of the grave inconvenience to the public and the serious damage to our delicately-balanced economy which the public service strike would cause.  Subsequently &mdash; on 9 October &mdash; I invited the public services committee to meet me as soon as possible for talks on all relevant issues relating to public service pay.  Given that the state of the Government finances left little room for manoeuvre, I indicated that I would try to be as positive as possible in endeavouring to reach an agreed solution to the public service pay problems which faced the country.</P>
    <P>Two days later, on 11 October, the public service committee agreed to meet me later that day &ldquo;to establish the Government's present position on the Committee's demands:</P>
    <P> (a) that in relation to negotiations on the 25th round there will be no pay freeze;</P>
    <P>(b) on the honouring of all arbitration-Labour Court awards in full both in terms of the amounts of the awards and effective dates;</P>
    <P>(c) on the immediate reappointment of the chairman of the various public service arbitration boards. </P>
    <P>While I had doubts about the stance being adopted by the committee, nevertheless I approached the meeting in the most positive manner possible, given the constraints of the Exchequer.  I explained to the committee the extremely difficult economic and financial situation which faced the country in 1986 &mdash; a situation which formed the background against which public service pay issues had to be considered.  That background, a Cheann Comhairle, is the very same tonight as it was two weeks ago.  I make no apology for again setting it out in some detail for the benefit of members of the House.</P>
    <P>Before doing so I should like to say that I should very much like to be in a position tonight, earlier, or at any time, as Minister, to be able to offer large, even generous, pay increases to public service workers.  It is not always remembered that members of the Government are <Col N="375" /> also politicians.  One of the things which politicians, perhaps with some degree of accuracy, are often accused of wanting to do is to please the majority of people most of the time.  It is fair to point out to the House that when any Government decide that they must adopt a given policy of constraint in the area of spending in any particular way, that is only because the overriding demands of the economy, the public finances and, consequently, the real, long-term interests of the country so demand.  I would love to be in a position to say that whatever a wage demand was &mdash; whether 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent &mdash; I, as Minister for the Public Service, had been authorised by the Government to agree to its payment and for it to be funded from resources which were available.  Unfortunately that is not the truth.</P>
    <P>Equally, of course, I would love to be able to say that it was the intention of the Government to reduce personal taxation from a maximum rate of 60 per cent to 50 per cent.  But I know that it would not be responsible in present circumstances to say that.  I know that those who are responsible, who have had a conversion to responsibility, or who masquerade as having had a conversion to responsibility, would rap my knuckles and, rightly so, for making such offers.  The difficulty is that some politicians, some public representatives, some of the time &mdash; and now all of the time &mdash; have to be responsible in an effort to redeem and redress the actions of previous Administrations who have led us into our present state.</P>
    <P>Despite those difficulties in the public finances and the bleak outlook for 1986, the Government appreciate the aspirations of individual public servants.  It was in an effort to reconcile those aspirations that the Government authorised me to offer to enter into negotiations with the public services committee.  I was disappointed at Deputy Ahern's reference in this respect.  I want to say again that the Government appreciate and pay tribute to the loyalty and dedication of so many individual public servants, who have their own family and personal responsibilities, <Col N="376" /> so very many of whom are so concerned, so dedicated, have such a realistic attitude, realising the difficulties that beset the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister has five minutes to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland:</NameTxt>
      <P>The national plan set out the provisions for public service pay and the amounts of money available.  In essence the Government's approach is based on a policy of curtailing the growth in average pay per head in order to avoid severe reductions in public service staffing.  The planned targets set out for the years 1985 to 1987 permit a nominal increase in expenditure in 1985 followed by a moderate increase over the remaining period.  They also permit the payment of special increases already sanctioned or committed under the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement.  The House will remember that agreement, the one in respect of which I have had to pick up the pieces of the debacle of 1982 created by Deputy Ahern and his colleagues at that time.  It was stated, quite clearly, that it was not possible to provide for any further special increases for the period of the plan.  That plan was published, debated &mdash; to my recollection on four different occasions &mdash; and adopted by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to those debates in the House I invited the public service committee for discussions on the public service aspects of the plan.  I was anxious that the committee should have a clear view of the thinking behind these aspects, how the various elements were inter-linked and what this meant for the public service.  I also sought discussions on the pay determination machinery in the public service.  Regrettably that invitation was declined.</P>
      <P>Our main economic problems can be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P> (a) High Unemployment: Unemployment is currently running at about 230,000 which represents about 17 per cent of the total labour force.  This rate is much higher than the average in the European Community (10½ per cent).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> (b) Current Government expenditure has been persistently running ahead of revenue.  The projected currect deficit of £1,234 million for 1985 seems likely to be exceeded &mdash; due to increased expenditure, mainly on social welfare, and shortfalls in revenue. Looking to the prospects for 1986 the gap between revenue and expenditure has widened considerably <i>vis-à-vis</i> the national plan targets, which already envisaged expenditure exceeding revenue by over £1,000 million next year. </P>
    <P>Quite obviously the situation is a difficult one &mdash; one that cannot be resolved by any simple formula involving increased taxation or borrowing.  On the taxation front everyone agrees that the burden of taxation is already too high by international standards and also when compared with countries at a similar stage of economic development.  Tax revenue has increased substantially in recent years &mdash; from 26.3 per cent of GNP in 1979 to a prospective 36 per cent of GNP in 1985.</P>
    <P>Tax rates have risen to very high levels. This is why the Government promised that over the plan period there would be no increase in the overall level of taxation and that so far as personal taxation is concerned there would be no increase in the overall income tax burden on taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As far as borrowing is concerned, this year it will cost £2 billion to remunerate debt and this is almost 10 per cent more than the total amount collected in PAYE. More than one third of total tax revenue is absorbed in servicing debt and outstanding debt at the end of September 1985 at over £20 billion is the equivalent of 130 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>With regard to public service pay and the attitude of the Opposition, it is appropriate at this point to allude to their document <i>The Way Forward</i> and to remind them of what was said at that time.  If the projections in that document for moderate increases in public service pay were projected to 1986 one would find that it provided for a public service pay bill provision of £2,525 million, precisely the <Col N="378" /> same amount that is provided for by the Government in the national plan.  However, for 1986 we will have an overrun because of a £37 million carry-over cost of the 24th pay round, £25 million for the carry-over costs of special increases under the 1983 pay agreements, £20 million for retrospective payments to certain groups and £30 million for annual increments.  The prospective pay bill in 1986 is already running at £2,570 million compared with the target of £2,525 million set out in the plan.  At the meeting on 11 October I outlined all those difficulties to the public services committee and I indicated that, despite those problems the Government were prepared there and then to negotiate on all matters relating to public service pay.  I, for my part, had secured from the Government a full mandate for negotiations on all relevant pay issues.  In the interest of industrial relations harmony and the preservation of services to the general public, I asked the committee to enter into immediate negotiations with me on these issues.  I indicated that I would be available for discussion at all times that night and throughout the weekend.  I was extremely taken aback that three days before a threatened public service stoppage, the leaders of the unions were not able to respond in any meaningful way to positive Government initiatives which could have averted the strike.  In effect, the PSC indicated that they had no mandate to negotiate an agreement on the various issues.</P>
    <P>The Government hope that the PSC will reconsider their position and come back to the negotiating table as quickly as possible with a mandate to negotiate an agreement which would resolve all outstanding issues in the pay area.  I now wish to reiterate what I said to the unions on 11 October.  I told them that, on behalf of the Government, I was in a position to negotiate an agreement covering the 25th round and other pay related issues. Furthermore, in the context of such an agreement, I would be prepared to appoint an arbitrator under the existing schemes if the PSC would participate in discussions about the machinery for pay <Col N="379" /> determination during the coming months.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I have been seeking such discussions with the PSC for some time but the unions have declined my invitation.  I would have thought it extremely reasonable that if one side indicates that it would like to discuss modifications or changes in the machinery, then the least the other side might do is to make themselves available for such discussions.</P>
    <P>Much to the surprise of the Opposition party I would like to thank them for having tabled this motion, especially for discussion here this evening.  I know &mdash; I am not sure if the Opposition do &mdash; that the public service committee are meeting tomorrow.  I would like to take this opportunity to ask them to agree to a series of detailed and meaningful discussions so that we can secure the best possible solution to any of the difficulties which may be perceived as standing between each of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I trust that the House will endorse the Government's action to date and in particular their preparedness to negotiate in a positive manner on all pay related issues.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Opposition, when replying to this debate, will agree the reasonableness of my attitude and will agree with me in asking the public service committee to return to the negotiating table in the interest of industrial relations harmony, the nation, the taxpayer and the individual public servant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy De Rossa had paid attention to what Deputy Ahern said he would find that he dealt with the <Col N="380" /> issue specifically and made our position very clear.  The issue we are facing is a direct and inevitable consequence of the Government's mishandling of the economy which has antagonised every section of the community.  I can now call, in support of that case, the Minister who is now present.</P>
      <P>I did not intend to burden the House or to depress the nation by repetition of what they know all too well but I will now repeat what the Minister acknowledged although he did not have time to read all his script because of the irrelevancies in which he indulged beforehand.  Yes, we have the highest tax levels not just in Europe but in the world.  Because of the policies of the Government out tax revenues have increased from 26 per cent of GNP in 1979 to 36 per cent in 1985.  He is right in saying that our borrowing has now reached £21 billion and that unemployment has reached the unsustainable level of well over 17 per cent of the work-force, an average of 230,000 people.  The Minister is right in all those assertions and it is because of the consequences of the Government's failure to deal with these problems that we are faced with this issue and that the public sector unions are faced with a breakdown of the most basic element in the whole issue of public sector negotiations &mdash; conciliation and arbitration.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister now acknowledge that the central authority in all that has been, is and always will be, the arbitrator? The concept of arbitration was originally launched and promoted in the mid-fifties by a former leader of the Coalition.  Is the Minister prepared, without preconditions of the kind he suggested this evening, to reappoint a public service arbitrator without whom we cannot have any reasonable or meaningful discussion on the issues before us? Who will bridge the gap and reduce the confrontation that he and his colleagues &mdash; in particular the Taoiseach &mdash; have generated over the last few months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have killed the spirit of enterprise in the private sector and they have now brought about the unprecedented breakdown in relations with the <Col N="381" /> public sector.  The productive sector of the economy which has always worked in tandem with an effective and committed public service is not capable now of meeting the demands of public expenditure growth that the Government have failed to curb.  They have imposed the burden of huge and suffocating taxation on a private sector which is suffering unprecedented burdens.  The Minister for the Public service has attempted to justify the Government's confrontation with the public service unions and indeed last week he said that the situation that faces us from a budgetary point of view next year is just appalling.  The public are all too well aware of the fact that the budgetary situation is appalling this year.  The Minister for Finance, in his statement accompanying the last quarterly Exchequer returns, acknowledged that he is incapable of redressing the position of diminishing returns which are evident in revenue at this stage.  In an unprecedented abrogation of responsibility he confined himself to saying, &ldquo;where possible to realise savings so as to minimise the scale of the overrun&rdquo;.  In an effort to minimise savings the Minister for Defence, of all people, was appointed to supervise public expenditure control at the beginning of the year and that nonsense can now be demonstrated for what it was.  It is the role of the Minister for Finance, not the Minister for Defence, to supervise that matter.</P>

      <P>If savings of any consequence can be realised at this late stage, I wish to put it on record that it is a damning indictment of the Government's wasteful expenditure up to now and of the failure of the Government to prepare realistic and accurate Estimates at the beginning of the year.  Today in the great new hope that is now presented we are told the cost of the new package will be <Col N="382" /> realised from savings from some undisclosed source.  What were the Government doing at the beginning of the year when they were preparing the Estimates? They have now had to acknowledge that those Estimates were a wasteful expenditure with no clear purpose or priority.</P>
      <P>The inevitability and scale of the difficult overrun the Government have now belatedly acknowledged was evident when <i>Building on Reality</i> was launched into the outer atmosphere of unreality a little over 12 months ago.  Fianna Fáil pointed out within days of publication of that document what would be the consequences and we met the financial correspondents of all the newspapers.  We pointed out that the unemployment average for 1985 on which the Government's projections were based was already at least 20,000 below the realistic target. Tonight the Minister for the Public Service has belatedly acknowledged that fact and, because of the cost of having to pay social welfare, we now have to tell our public servants we cannot meet our responsibilities.  Was there ever such a craven acknowledgment of failure on the part of any Government?</P>

We are being offered jargon instead of action but the public are not reassured by self-contradictory nonsense such as &ldquo;adjustments within the framework of the plan&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the need to roll over the plan&rdquo;.  The Minister for the Public Service was so infatuated with that phrase that he repeated it on the programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;.  Adjusting the plan or rolling over the plan means jettisoning the plan and consigning it to the dungeons where it should have been in the first instance. In short, the plan has been abandoned to <Col N="383" /> its own uncharted orbit and the technicians who launched it are now concentrating on disseminating false propaganda to save their own skins.</P>
      <P>This Government are concerned only with public relations, packages, adjustments and whatever else will give them some faint hope of survival but the public sector and the private sector will pay the price for this preoccupation of the Government, their only preoccupation at this time.  The Government are concerned only with attempts to prolong their own life, while prolonging the agony for the rest of the nation.  For instance, they threatened to introduce punitive measures against the self-employed who apparently warrant this kind of punishment while, at the same time, castigating the public service for immorality and irresponsibility.  The gratuitous comments of the Minister for Education, the Minister for the Public Service and, above all, the Taoiseach have so incensed the teachers and public servants generally that any prospect of reasonable negotiations have been gravely undermined even if there was a policy to sustain normal economic activity to fund the necessary programes for the public service.</P>
      <P>The scheme of conciliation and arbitration is the bedrock on which wage negotiations in the public service are secured.  If the Government deliberately undermine established procedures in the public sector, how can they reasonably expect adherence to established procedures in the private sector?  What price appeals from the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or anyone else to the private sector for a reasonable approach in negotiations when the Government themselves have undermined the basis of the most established procedure of all, that of conciliation and arbitration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service seems to be totally unaware of the procedures and this was exemplified in his challenge to the public sector unions to <Col N="384" /> commence negotiations with him personally on the 25th round.  It was an unprecedented challenge and an indication of his total ignorance of how such negotiations are conducted.  When, if ever, did a Minister for the Public Service say to the unions that they should come to him to start negotiations on a wage round?  Then, he presents this as being a reasonable position.  He must be aware of the established procedures of conciliation and arbitration which, in the first instance, do not involve the Minister himself. If he is not so aware, it is time he learned.</P>
    <P>The Government have brought about a state where the claim of inability to pay of hard pressed employers is the last refuge of the Government themselves. The harsh fact is that the private sector no longer can support the crushing burden of taxation.  Investment is declining at an alarming rate.  The economy has become debilitated to the point where it cannot generate any consistent activity.  We are losing our top managers because of high taxation.  We are losing our young people through emigration and unemployment is undermining the dignity and the character of the few who remain.  A healthy and committed public service creating the conditions for growth and development in the private sector is essential to any national plan.  They have proved it before but now they have been gratuitously offended by a Minister who does not even understand the whole basis for conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the Government have succeeded in creating unnecessary tensions and divisions between the private sector and the public sector.  This is happening at a time when what we require more than ever is a sense of common purpose and cohesion.  The current levels of taxation which this Government have deliberately introduced and increased to the highest levels in the democratic world are the real cause of the problem and of the diminishing returns now evident from income tax, excise duty and VAT.  That is why we cannot meet our obligations to the public sector or to the private sector. That is why we are talking now in terms <Col N="385" /> of packages, adjustments, rolling over and rolling on while the nation continues to suffer.</P>
    <P>This Government have so consistently changed course that by now they have abandoned all their original targets.  A little honesty at this point could get some response.  Could we please be told now about the original targets of the Government, about the targets in <i>Building on Reality</i> and the targets set out in the budget?  Has what has been hinted at today regarding some undisclosed savings become the great new prospect?  The Government now say that in this package, the cost of which has not yet been disclosed, they are going to give relief to the industries they have up to now crucified &mdash; the building industry by the imposition of extra VAT, and the tourist industry by the levels of excise duty and VAT.  Is there any hope of consistency from a Government who behave like that?</P>
    <P>The interest and well being of every section of the community takes second place to the survival of this Government. These adjustments and rolling over will not solve our problems.  This Government can still make a major contribution by acknowledging not their inability to <Col N="386" /> pay &mdash; and let us face it the Labour Party know this &mdash; but by acknowledging their inability to function as a Government, and let a Government take office that will face responsibilities and give new hope to all the people.  This new Government would face their responsibilities particularly to the teachers who play a very special role in our society.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> As a general proposition, the Garda Síochána have no legal authority to act in the manner suggested in the question.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The arrangements for District Court business in the Dublin Metropolitan District are matters for the President of the District Court.  In 1982 a committee, chaired by the then president, considered the question of a night court in the context of attendance difficulties for the Garda Síochána.  This committee concluded that, contrary to popular support for the notion, the setting up of a night court would not be justified.  I am not satisfied that there is sufficient reason to ask the president to reconsider the question at this stage.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy cares to send me information on those aspects of the District Court's operations which he regards as unsatisfactory I will bring them to the attention of the president for his consideration. I should say that the president has made a number of changes recently to streamline the court's business.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information required as to the frequency and cost of transfer of prisoners to Dublin for court hearings is not readily available.  To compile such information would require a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.  Information in respect of such transfers from Portlaoise during 1984 was compiled with considerable difficulty in response to a previous question from another Deputy which was subsequently withdrawn.  It emerged that there were 121 transfers from Portlaoise to Dublin for court appearances during 1984 at a cost of the order of £250,000.  Cases are always called when a person in custody is brought from prison for a court hearing. However, on occasions, for reasons outside the control of the court, a trial may not proceed after the case is called.</P>

These measures include a substantial increase in Garda strength at Coolock station, revised rostering arrangements and the introduction of 24 hour opening at the two other stations in Coolock Garda District &mdash; Malahide and Swords &mdash; which reduced the demands on Coolock station.  The situation is at present under review by the Garda authorities in the light of these developments and I expect to have a report and recommendation from the Commissioner on the question of a Garda station for Donaghmede within the next few months.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am glad to take this opportunity to place on the record of the House the special thanks of the Government and myself to Mr. Justice Lynch for the comprehensive report that he has produced and for the long period of concentrated attention that he devoted to the work of the tribunal.  His dedication to the task was widely recognised.  Over and above that, his capacity to assimilate, and to recall as needed, the details of evidence given throughout the long hearings attracted admiring comment from observers on several occasions and obviously would have been, and undoubtedly was, brought fully to bear also when he came to write the report.  We in the Government are most grateful to him.</P>
      <P>There is one other preliminary point that I believe should also be placed on the record of the House.  It concerns some, though only some, of the criticisms that have been directed at this or that comment or conclusion in the report.  I would emphasise that some of the criticisms that have been directed at points in the report clearly are legitimate expressions of a point of view based on a study of the report.  More than that, some of them &mdash; in my view at all events &mdash; can be useful contributions to general public awareness of various problems.  Others again are what one might decribe as criticisms with an ideological slant and, since they are readily identifiable as such, people will evaluate them accordingly, agreeing or disagreeing with them on their own terms, and no comment from me is necessary.  On the other hand &mdash; and this is the point of my comment &mdash; there have been a number of highly publicised criticisms for which there is no possible justification and which are, I regret to say, liable to confuse and mislead the public.  In that context, because of the impact of television as a medium, I think it necessary to refer in particular to the fact that the tribunal's report was the subject of some seriously erroneous and misleading statements in a television programme over the last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose, nor would it in my <Col N="48" /> view be at all appropriate, for me to proceed to go into detail either in defence of the report or in refutation of various criticisms of the kind I have mentioned; but it is, I believe, necessary to say something to put Deputies &mdash; and, I hope, the general public &mdash; on their guard.  I will therefore mention in this context two, but only two, points that arose in this particular television programme.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it was said by one contributor that the tribunal's report overlooked an important point in a pathologist's evidence and that that statement was not corrected by any of the other contributors present who, because they were presumed to have read the report, were liable to be taken by the viewing public as acquiescing in it.  Apparently there is even some reason to think that it was that statement that led one member of the public to telephone the station to criticise the judge.  The fact, however, is that the evidence that was said to have been overlooked is expressly referred to in the report and, even if it had not been, there would have been no ground for the assumption that it was overlooked by the judge.</P>
    <P>The second point from that programme that I pick as an example is where, as I am informed, it was said that the judge had overlooked particular evidence of a forensic scientist from my own Department.  Again, there is no justification for such a conclusion.  The particular item of evidence was of a negative character and related to a time well after the relevant events.  The reasonable and indeed obvious inference to be drawn is that the judge's evaluation was that that evidence proved nothing whatsoever of any significance and that that was why he did not refer to it in a report which, of necessity, had to exclude references to numerous pieces of evidence given to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>While I am at the stage of referring to that particular programme, I think it right to refer also to another point in which a suggestion seriously hurtful to the reputation of an identifiable member of the Garda Síochána and of that member's wife was broadcast.  That was that the <Col N="49" /> particular garda might have invented the account of offensive telephone calls concerning which that member had given sworn testimony and which were part of a campaign which the garda's wife in particular was a victim.  I think it should be enough that I invite attention to the point and that the wrong done will be put right.</P>
    <P>I now turn to my own reaction to the report.  I shall comment in a few moments on certain references to members of the Garda Síochána.  For the most part, however, I regard the report as speaking for itself and, as I have already indicated, I have no doubt that it is neither necessary nor desirable that I should engage in any detailed analysis of it.  However, some comment is called for and I believe that, as the person who proposed to the Dáil the establishment of the tribunal, I should begin by going back briefly on one point that was already before the House, namely, the reason for the setting up of the tribunal.  This is necessary because of various recent allegations that the report fails to do what it was set up to do.</P>
    <P>One could express essentially the same point in various ways and the report itself describes in one particular way the background to the decision to set it up but I think the way I would prefer to restate the position is to say that, as far as I am concerned, I asked the House to set up this tribunal because of a combination of two reasons &mdash; not, may I emphasise, because of either one by itself but the combination of the two:</P>
    <P>First, that there were in existence certain statements that had been made by members of the Hayes family confessing to involvement in a crime, statements which the evidence strongly suggested could not be true; and</P>
    <P>Second, that various members of that family had said, and said publicly and on more than one occasion, including notably on the occasion of a television programme, that they had made those statements against a background that included physical assaults &mdash; in other words, criminal misbehaviour &mdash; by various members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> The situation was one where grave and specific allegations against identifiable gardaí were made against a background of what seemed to be potentially supportive independent evidence in the form of the signed statements, evidence that, on its face, was sufficient to make it both possible and necessary to have the matter fully investigated.  Thus, the issue that faced the tribunal cannot be reduced to a question of how the statements came to be signed.  The accusations that were made about assaults were at the core of the matter and one of the central points, and in many people's eyes the central point, that has emerged from the tribunal is that those allegations were shown to be unsustainable.  Indeed at least one of the most serious ones was effectively withdrawn even in the course of the giving of evidence.  So the fact is that on this, the original core of the case for the tribunal, the gardaí were vindicated.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to recognise, therefore, that that public vindication of the gardaí was made necessary as a direct result of the actions of people who, for their own reasons, chose to make such allegations, though they may well have had no real appreciation of the seriousness of what they were doing.  The vindication of the gardaí in relation to those allegations was, of course, made possible only through a public investigation and disclosure of the extraordinary background which explained an otherwise inexplicable set of developments.  Whatever views one might have as to whether certain lines of questioning were at all necessary, it is clear that the tribunal would have faced serious difficulty if it had insisted on imposing restrictions on what counsel could pursue and, on a more general plane, it is, I think, unfortunate that there should have been public criticism of the tribunal for decisions that were unavoidable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that, despite the obvious fact that the key to the riddle emerged only as a result of protracted cross-examination of witnesses under special legal powers given by law to a tribunal of this kind and the equally obvious fact that no other lawful way of <Col N="51" /> approach would have produced it, we still have people making critical references to the fact that an internal Garda investigation armed with no legal powers whatsoever was unable to do so.</P>
    <P>Although I have stressed that the accusations of assault that were made against members of the force were central to the decision to set up the tribunal, I am not in any way to be taken as accepting suggestions that have been made that the tribunal's report did not address the question of how in fact statements that contained large amounts of material that was both wrong and damaging to the person concerned came to be made.  Far from accepting such suggestions, I feel obliged to ask if the people making them read the report at all or, if they did, did they make any attempt to understand it.  The report addresses precisely that question at considerable length and in relation to different witnesses and it offers conclusions.</P>
    <P>Of course, anybody is free to disagree with the conclusions &mdash; but not to say that the questions are not addressed.  And I would suggest that, if a person is being reasonable in approaching such an issue, certain points should be kept in mind. First, the judge heard all the evidence, saw all witnesses, whereas it is obvious that some of the people disagreeing have not even read the report.  Secondly, and particularly to those who have read it, I would commend a dictum of another famous investigator, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, to the effect that when the impossible has been excluded, that which remains, however improbable it may seem (to some), must contain the truth.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the gardaí have been vindicated on the major issue.  The report, nevertheless, discloses very clearly that there were serious deficiencies in the investigation.  Those deficiencies manifested themselves not only in things done or not done, as the case may be, but in attitudes of members at various points.  The Commissioner has informed me that, in the interests of the force, he has considered it right and indeed necessary to transfer from their present <Col N="52" /> posts most of those who were assigned to the investigation from the technical bureau.</P>
    <P>In case what I have said might be misinterpreted, may I emphasise that that is not a disciplinary decision, though I would equally emphasise that decisions on discipline, as on transfers, are made by the Commissioner and not by me.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner has further informed me that his decision is fully in accord with a policy that he has already for some time now been implementing in relation to specialised units generally. With the exception of a small number of jobs involving very specialised skills that require a long period of training and probably unusual aptitudes, it is and for some time now has been his policy to ensure that members are rotated at intervals. Thus, for instance, specialised training on drug abuse is now widely spread among the force and there is now no question of people being left for many years in special drug squads.  I may say that I am entirely happy that that is the right policy.</P>
    <P>There is one other substantial point that has caused some public comment. Part of that comment has taken the form of a suggestion that the report puts forward a double standard of truthfulness expected of witnesses, with a lower standard being acceptable from gardaí.</P>
    <P>I as Minister cannot, of course, lay claim to any special competence as compared with anybody else in the matter of interpreting a report which is there for all to read, but I must say that I do not interpret the report as being in any way an acceptance of a lesser standard from the gardaí.  As I see the situation, the judge was dealing with the credibility of various witnesses in the situation in which they found themselves and the distinctions that are now being attributed to the judge do not take account of the contexts in which he was speaking.</P>
    <P>The evidence from members of the Hayes family to which he was referring concerned straightforward objective issues of fact about which there could be no doubt.  For instance, was the baby <Col N="53" /> born in the house or in a field?  Did gardaí punch members of the family or not?</P>
    <P>However, while the gardaí similarly had to give evidence of matters of objective fact, that was not the evidence the judge was speaking of.  The evidence he was speaking of was basically of two kinds, namely, what was the state of mind of members of the force at various points of an investigation that took place a good part of a year earlier or, alternatively, which particular hypothesis out of several possible ones members of the force believed to be the true one and how firmly did they believe it.  In both types of situation there is a substantial subjective element and what I believe the judge was indicating was said solely in relation to an area where there is inherently a fair measure of subjectivity rather than what one might call a black or white choice.</P>
    <P>It is, in my view, plainly wrong to try to interpret a report from a High Court judge in a way that involves attributing to him unnecessarily a view which it is inherently improbable that he would hold and which I personally have no doubt whatsoever that he does not hold.  Equally it is, I believe, unnecessary for me to labour the point that neither the Commissioner nor I would accept for a single instant any suggestion &mdash; if such were to be made &mdash; that members of the force could be entitled to treat their sworn evidence otherwise than with the utmost seriousness.  Indeed the only problem I have about saying that at all is that I would not be prepared to accept that any member of the force, acting as such, would be entitled to disregard the truth even if what is being said is not on oath but only in the normal course of duty.  I do not think that we need &mdash; or should &mdash; accept any less strict approach than that and I am glad to say that I am wholly satisfied that the Commissioner is equally committed to that view.</P>
    <P>Once again, I express my thanks to the judge for his report.</P>

Detailed population counts by District Electoral Division/Ward were published in volume I of the census report in September 1982 while, as indicated in that volume, population figures at townland level were available on request.  Further small area statistics containing classifications of the population by sex and five year age <Col N="59" /> groups to the level of District Electoral Division/Ward and also towns of 1,000 population and over were furnished, in response to planners requests, from July 1983.

      <P>In the absence of comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movements of persons into and out of the State, there is no way of determining the actual number of inward and outward migrants in any period.  The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration (i.e. the difference between the inward and outward flows) between successive censuses of population. The estimates for these periods are obtained by relating the intercensal population changes to data for births and deaths in the same period.  In this way the following estimates of net migration for the intercensal period between 1951 and 1981 were derived:</P>

    <P>A minus signifies a net outward movement.</P>
    <P>For the post 1981 period, pending the availability of the results of the 1986 census of population, only very tentative estimates of net migration can be made based on the annual mid-April provisional population estimates.  The provisional mid-April 1985 population estimate at 3,552,000 is 109,000 above the 1981 census figure.  The natural increase (excess births over deaths) in the same <Col N="61" /> period was 141,000.  Thus for the four years April 1981 to April 1985, it is tentatively estimated that net migration was 32,000 outwards.  A firm estimate for the five year 1981-1986 period will be available after the 1986 census.</P>

      <P>My Department has been aware that on occasions members of the Irish travelling community in Britain claiming social security benefits have had difficulties in establishing their identity or family status to the satisfaction of officials.  The most common problem that has come to the attention of my Department relates to claims for dependent children, where the travellers have been unable to produce birth certificates in a form which would establish the relationship to the parent.  My Department is not aware of discrimination against Irish citizens, whether travellers or others in this regard.</P>
      <P>A birth certificate is not in itself evidence of the identity of the bearer.  Irish people in order to enter Britain do not need passports which would help to provide such evidence.  Social security officials have to satisfy themselves about the identity of claimants and the number of their children so as to avoid the possibility of double claims.  As regards children, while the &ldquo;short form&rdquo; birth certificate may be acceptable in many cases, only the &ldquo;long form&rdquo; shows the parents of the child.  My Department will continue to provide assistance and advice to Irish people who find themselves faced with problems of this sort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh):</NameTxt>
      <P>An EC Council Directive of 7 March 1985 on air quality standards for nitrogen dioxide which comes into force on 1 July 1987 fixes a limit value and guide values for nitrogen dioxide emissions. Member states are obliged to establish monitoring stations in zones where the limit value is exceeded or likely to be exceeded.  The Air Pollution Bill which is being drafted at present will include appropriate provisions for specification of the standards laid down by the directive and for the establishment of a monitoring regime, as required.  In the meantime, An Foras Forbartha, on behalf of the Minister, have purchased a mobile monitoring unit to pinpont where limit values may exceed or be likely to exceed the values specified in this directive. There is, however, no reason to believe, <Col N="70" /> on the basis of available information, that existing levels of nitrogen dioxide would exceed the standards set down in the directive.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of their efforts to improve air quality generally the EC Council of Environment Ministers have also recently reached agreement on new limit values for, <i>inter alia</i>, nitrogen oxides emitted from motor vehicles and on a timetable for their introduction. Work on transforming this agreement into Community law is continuing. Despite the relative scarity of epidemiological data specifically showing the effect of nitrogen oxides alone on respiratory diseases it is understood that they do have a part to play in the severity of attacks. Any lung disease, including asthma, is likely to be exacerbated by the intake of air which is not pure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together.  Layout and house plans for a 43 house scheme at Ardara were approved by my Department in March 1985.  In May 1985 I approved an amended preliminary report for the Ardara sewerage scheme as submitted by Donegal County Council and requested the early submission of contract documents for Stage I of the scheme which will cater for the proposed housing scheme.  The further planning of the housing and sewerage schemes is now a matter for the local authority.</P>

      <P>Section 32 of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985, which is at present before the Dáil, empowers the Authority, subject to my approval, to direct a road Authority, part or all of whose functional area is within the Authority's functional area, to provide road ramps on a roadway for the purpose of restricting the speed of mechanically propelled vehicles.  A direction issued by the Authority may be for a specified period or without any limitation as to time.  The section also provides for the making of regulations by me prescribing the procedures for the issue of such a direction and requirements as to the installation of ramps.</P>
      <P>Consideration is also being given to the inclusion in a Road Traffic Bill, which I hope to bring before the Dáil in 1986, of appropriate provisions governing the installation of speed control ramps by road authorities in areas outside the functional area of the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of new house grant applications refused since the scheme was inaugurated due to the CRV specification; and, in view of the fact that this clause was subsequently abolished, if he will reconsider payments to applicants who were refused on this basis as in the case of persons (details supplied) in County Wexford.</P>

      <P>As records of refused applications are not segregated on the basis of the grounds for refusal, the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The payment of the grant in particular cases is subject to the conditions applying at the time.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, a grant cannot be allowed as the statutory condition which then applied in relation to Certificates of Reasonable Value was not complied with.</P>

      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985 and its effect in extending the Dáil franchise entitlement to British citizens resident here has received wide publicity.  This is supplemented by the annual publicity campaign in which electors are encouraged to ensure that their names are correctly entered in the register. The registration claim forms issued for the purpose of enabling persons to have their names included have been amended so that British citizens may indicate their nationality.  Detailed guidance has been given to registration authorities to ensure that in the Register of Electors for 1986-87 the appropriate identification letter will be placed opposite the names of British citizens to indicate their entitlement to vote at Dáil elections, as well as at local and European Assembly elections, with effect from the date of coming into force of the Register, namely, 15 April 1986.</P>

      <P>Under the remedial works scheme for local authority houses which was introduced last year, capital moneys, subsidisable at a rate of up to 80 per cent may be made available to local authorities to fund essential repairs of a structural nature to &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; houses and certain older houses suffering from structural deterioration.</P>

    <P>I have received proposals from Tipperary (SR) County Council and Tipperary UDC seeking assistance under the scheme in respect of houses at Woodview, Castlequarter and Carronreddy.

I am awaiting the <Col N="81" /> receipt of further technical details from the local authority in regard to the Carronreddy proposal.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh):</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 583 put down by the Deputy on 23 April 1985, I explained the legal position generally in regard to endorsements on driving licences.  On the basis of information supplied by the licensing authority, I indicated that the person involved, who was granted a three year licence on 30 September 1982, would have satisfied, by 29 September 1985, the particular legal requirement that an endorsement be carried on a licence for a continuous period of three years and could then be granted a licence free from that endorsement.</P>
      <P>However, arising from a difficulty created by the fact that a copy of the original endorsement was not entered on the licence in question when it was granted, the licensing authority considered that he was not entitled to a licence free from endorsement when renewing his licence on 10 October 1985.  The matter has now been resolved and arrangements are being made for the granting of a licence free from endorsement in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Longford town and its environs will be served by the Longford main drainage scheme.  The eastern and north-eastern sections of this scheme have been constructed and the contract documents for that section which will complete the sewering of the town were approved by my Department in May 1983.  The council's proposal for the acceptance of a tender is awaited in my Department.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Longford central regional water supply scheme will provide a new and improved network of mains in Longford town.  I approved the preliminary report for this section in August 1984 and the submission of contract documents by the council is awaited.</P>
      <P>Both the Longford central regional water supply (other than section 6) and the Longford main drainage schemes have been the subject of grant applications to the European Regional Development Fund.  Section 6 of the Longford central regional water supply scheme has not yet reached the stage at which it can be included in such an application.  Other infrastructure projects in County Longford submitted for EC aid in 1985 are the Clondra-Ballyminnion road improvement scheme and the Granard water supply scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> The present position with regard to the Abbeyshrule group water schemes is that officers of my Department met group representatives on 18 September 1985 to outline the action required to bring this large scheme to the construction stage. My Department is in correspondence with the group about particular issues which arose at this meeting and will write again to the group shortly.</P>
    <P>ERDF aid is not avaialble for private group water schemes, but 50 per cent of my Department's grant expenditure on eligible group water schemes in County Longford is recoupable from the European Commission under the FEOGA western package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.  The primary responsibility for the preparation of proposals for national road projects rests with the road authority concerned.  In the case of the Oranmore by-pass, the proposals submitted by Galway County Council and approved by my Department did not make any provision for pedestrian overbridges at the intersections of the by-pass and existing roads.  I am committed to financing the cost of the scheme, as submitted and approved.  The council subsequently sought finance for the provision of overbridges at Frenchfort, Glenascaul and Moneymore and requested a meeting to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>The question of pedestrian and cycle movements across the by-pass was considered at the public inquiry related to the by-pass project and was taken into account by me in taking the decision to confirm the compulsory purchase order for lands required for the by-pass.  I am advised that there appears to be no grounds for considering that the proposed junctions are substandard from a safety point of view.  I am also advised that, based on present pedestrian movements, there are no grounds for suggesting that pedestrian overbridges are justified.  I informed the council accordingly and told them that, in the circumstances, I did not see how the reception of a deputation would serve any useful purpose.  There is no record in the Department of a request for a meeting with parents' representatives from the area of the by-pass.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to reconsider the matter on receipt of evidence, including technical reports, from the council outlining any shortcomings, from a safety point of view, in the event of implementing their original proposals together with recommendations for appropriate remedial action to minimise these.</P>

      <P>The design for phase 2 of the mid-Galway group water scheme is being examined in my Department following the recent commencement of phase 1 of the scheme.  According to the proposals submitted, phase 2 of the scheme will serve an area abounded on the west side by the Monivea-Athenry Road but crossing this road to serve the Mountain North and Park area north of Athenry.  The Monivea-Menlough Road is just to the north of the area and the extent of the scheme on the east side is Cloonkeen and Gurteen.  The Galway-Dublin railway line will form the southern boundary of the scheme.  To date the group has canvassed the following townlands within this area: Cloonkeen, Toorkeel, Ballyboggan, Cahertubber, Ballydavid, Bengarra, Cappamoyle, Newcastle, Cormacoo, Derrough, Lenamore, Woodvillage, Laughatora, Tiaquin, Coodoo, Tysaxon and Mountain.  It is not possible at this stage to say when grants will be allocated to enable phase 2 of this scheme to proceed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 114 together.  Following representations in 1983 by local fishermen, certain improvement works at <Col N="104" /> Brandon pier, which involved the filling in of concrete steps, the provision of a recessed ladder and mooring rings, were carried out during 1984.  I understand that the fishermen may now be seeking the provision of another recessed ladder at the head of the pier but as yet no proposals on this has been submitted to me. When it is, I will have it considered by my Department.  Apart from the foregoing I am not aware of any other requests from local fishermen for improvements to Brandon pier.</P>
      <P>Brandon pier was one of a number of fishing harbours in the Corca Dhuibhne area which were examined by an <i>ad hoc</i> committee in 1983 with a view to selecting one for development in the context of a scheme for the general economic development of Corca Dhuibhne.  The committee, which was representative of all the main organisations concerned, selected Dingle as the harbour most suitable for development and the commitee's recommendation for its development is being pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell):</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P> (a) The board of Irish Shipping Limited petitioned the High Court to appoint a liquidator to the company on 14 November 1984 following a decision by the Government not to provide any further financial assistance for the company.</P>
      <P>(b) The chairman and board of Irish Shipping Limited submitted a report to me dated 24 September 1984 on the financial position of the company which identified the immediate winding-up of Irish Shipping Limited as one possible course of action.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions on 20 February 1985.</P>
      <P>(c) The Government did not take the decision to wind-up Irish Shipping Limited. At an extraordinary general meeting of the company called by the board of directors of Irish Shipping Limited on 14 November the Minister for Finance, as principal shareholder, agreed to a resolution by the board of the company to petition the High Court for the appointment of a liquidator on the grounds of insolvency.</P>
      <P>(d) The liabilities of Irish Shipping Limited at the date of liquidation which were guaranteed by the Minister for Finance amounted to £39.5 million.  By virtue of an understanding between the Government and Irish Shipping Limited the company's liability in relation to the acquisition of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> by Verolme Cork Dockyard was £8.5 million at the date of liquidation.  The acquisition of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was funded by a consortium of Japanese leasing companies and the vessel was operated by Irish Shipping Limited under a bareboat charter which was fully guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The total amount guaranteed by the Minister in this connection at the date of liquidation was approximately £39 million, of which £8.5 million represented the Irish Shipping Limited liability.</P>

      <P>There is only one such project falling within the ambit of the Deputy's question, particulars of which are as follows:</P>
      <P> (1) Extension to the Aer Lingus cargo terminal at Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>(2) Alterations to the existing cargo terminal, provision of additional accommodation of 21,000 square feet and consequential minor alterations &mdash; rearrangement of apron facilities.</P>
      <P>(3) £592,000 (at 1979 prices).</P>
      <P>(4) Two consultants were appointed, viz.  Rooney McLoughlin Associates (Structural Engineers) and Mr. F. J. Horne (Quantity Surveyor).  Fees amounting to £16,461.63 were paid to Rooney McLoughlin Associates and fees amounting to £9,308.11 were paid to Mr. F. J. Horne.  Aer Lingus recouped the Exchequer cost of the consultants' fees.</P>
      <P>(5) In December 1980 it was decided not to proceed with the project because of the financial position of Aer Lingus at that time.  Consideration is now being given to the question of proceeding with the project. </P>

      <P>The information requested is set out in the following tabular statement.  In general it has not been possible to proceed with the projects in question because of the limitations on the funds available for capital schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning was completed on a major development for Castlebar Hospital in 1981.  Due to limitations on funds it was <Col N="131" /> not possible to proceed with full development. The development has been phased and tenders for the most urgent part of the development are being considered to enable it to proceed to building without <Col N="132" /> delay.  That work will, it is estimated, cost £11 million.</P>
    <P>The Merlin Park scheme is under discussion at present with the Western Health Board and it is hoped that this scheme can proceed in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Health (Flouridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, requires the health boards to meet the cost of the installation and maintenance of flouridation equipment and the running costs of flouridation. The costs are normally met from the health boards' revenue allocations. An application for a special grant to cover the flouridation of Lough Egish water supply has been made by the North-Eastern Health Board and is under consideration in my Department.</P>

As final payments are not normally made for some time after the end of the year to which they relate, and may differ from the amounts originally allocated, the amounts stated for 1984 and 1985 have not yet been paid in full. The 1984 figures are the total amounts for which final claims for payment have been lodged with the European Commission.</P>

The committee submitted its report to me in May 1985 and I am considering it at the moment. Copies of this report have been made available to interested parties involved in the day care area.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory regulation of day care services at present.  However section 9 of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, provides for the introduction of regulations governing such services for children.  Regulations can only be introduced after the enactment of the Bill which is currently on Second Stage in the House.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the urban fuel scheme administered by local authorities in 17 cities and towns (including Dublin city), unemployment assistance recipients with dependants have automatic entitlement to fuel vouchers. Recipients of short term social welfare payments such as unemployment assistance are, in general, excluded from the national fuel scheme administered by the health boards.  I would hope to rationalise these schemes when circumstances permit but the scope for extending the coverage of the schemes to categories who are not covered under either scheme is limited in view of the significant costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of benefit at the weekly rate of £107.05, being £70.25 flat rate unemployment benefit and £36.80 pay-related benefit, when he exhausted maximum entitlement to benefit of 390 days on 12 June 1985.  He then applied for unemployment assistance and was assessed with means of £19.80.</P>
      <P>He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £44.80 being the appropriate rate in his case of £64.60 less means of £19.80, increased to £49.05 from 3 July 1985, that is, £68.85 less means of £19.80.  He appealed against the amount of the means assessment and an oral hearing of his case took place on 21 October 1985. The rate of unemployment assistance payable to him will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer. Weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at £27.80 weekly being the appropriate rate in her case of £32.80 less means of £5 up to 3 June 1985 when it came to light that a further increase in means amounting to £15.20 were derived from the value of board and lodgings in her parent's home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her unemployment assistance claim was rerated at the appropriate correct rate from 27 July 1983 and an overpayment occurred which the person concerned agreed to refund by deductions of £1 weekly from the amount due to her. Deductions to recover the overpayment commenced on 4 June 1985.  She was, therefore, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £17.60 from 4 June 1985 being the appropriate rate in her case of £32.80 less means of £15.20, increased to £19.75 from 3 July <Col N="143" /> 1985, being the appropriate rate £34.95 less means £15.20.  The sum of £1 weekly was deducted from both these weekly rates to offset against the overpayment. A total of £9 was deducted when she ceased signing at her local office on 30 July 1985.</P>

      <P>He was accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £47.40 from 16 October 1984 increased to £52.40 weekly from 3 July 1985.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 174 and 197 together.  It is presumed that Deputy Bell's question refers to the fact that pre-1953 social insurance contributions are not reckonable for purposes of the average condition for assessing entitlement to old age contributory and retirement pensions. The contribution old age pension was introduced in 1961 and the retirement pension was introduced in 1970.  The social insurance contributions paid before the commencement of those schemes did not contain any contribution elements in respect of them so that the present conditions are already substantially concessionary.</P>
      <P>The general position in relation to the average condition was dealt with in the replies to Questions Nos. 8, 10 and 11 on 1 May 1985.  The Social Welfare Acts provide that one of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of contributory old age or retirement pension requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 qualifying contributions from 5 January 1953 or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.</P>
      <P>The cost of modifying the law to give pensions to persons who failed to satisfy the average condition because of breaks in their insurance records or non-reckonability of pre-1953 contributions would be substantial, it would create further inconsistencies in relation to persons who maintained eligibility for pension by becoming voluntary contributors, and such action would divert funds from more urgent social welfare needs. Anyone who fails to qualify for an old age contributory pension may, if his circumstances warrant it, qualify for a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the qualifying conditions for old <Col N="148" /> age contributory and retirement pensions are being examined by the Commission on Social Welfare and the case for a general restructuring of qualifying conditions, including the average condition, will be reviewed in the light of the Commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>It has been decided that the person concerned was entitled to old age pension at the weekly rate of £14.05 from 13 July 1984.  This rate included £3 over 80 allowance and £3.75 adult dependant allowance.

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The person concerned does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of 304 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only nine and, <Col N="165" /> therefore, he does not qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  Neither will he qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66; a yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
      <P>He was insurably employed in Britian from 1963 to 1985.  Under EC Regulations on Social Security a person who has been employed in another member state can qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension on his combined Irish and other EC country records, the amount payable being based on the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total.  The person concerned has a total of 304 Irish and 765 British contributions in the relevant period.  This entitled him to a <i>pro rata</i> pension of £13.10 per week with effect from 25 April 1985, increased to £13.95 per week from 11 July 1985.  A book containing orders payable at the latter rate to cover the period from 1 August 1985 to 26 September 1985 was issued to the designated post office on 7 August 1985 for collection by him and a further book containing orders payable from 3 October 1985 was issued at the end of September.  The arrears payable from 25 April 1985 to 31 July 1985 were issued to him by payable order on 14 August 1985.  He is also in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>

      <P>Panels of assessors are appointed under the Social Welfare Acts to assist appeals officers at oral hearings about entitlement to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. <Col N="169" /> The panels are composed of persons nominated by local employer and trade union bodies and are constituted at intervals of five years.  The Mayo area is at present served by the Ballina and Claremorris panels.  The Ballina panel was set up on 13 June 1983 and is due to expire on 12 June 1988.  The Claremorris panel was set up on 12 December 1982 and is due to expire on 11 December 1987.  The employer and worker bodies represented on the panels are as follows: Tuam Chamber of Commerce; Claremorris Chamber of Commerce; Ballina Chamber of Commerce; Irish Farmers Association; Macra na Feirme; National Vintners Association; Irish Transport and General Workers Union; Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians; Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers; National Association of Transport Employees; Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staff; Electrical Trade Union; Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks; National Graphical Association; Trades Council Ballina; Trades Council Castlebar.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 6 April 1984 to 4 May 1984, from 19 June 1984 to 6 January 1985 and again from 13 March 1985 to date.  In addition he claimed disability benefit from 7 January 1985 to 12 March 1985.  He was in receipt of the maximum rate of flat rate unemployment benefit to 22 November 1984 when he exhausted 156 days of benefit. <Col N="170" /> He did not fulfil the contribution condition for continuous payment of unemployment benefit at the maximum rate and accordingly his weekly rate of unemployment benefit was reduced to £30.90 from 23 November 1984.  In line with the general increase in social welfare rates this rate was increased to £32.75 from 4 July 1985.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is based on reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year.  The two claims to unemployment benefit of the person concerned in 1984 together with his claim to disability benefit of 7 January 1985 and his further claim to unemployment benefit of 13 March 1985 were all linked claims and accordingly the tax year which governs entitlement to pay-related benefit on his unemployment benefit claims is the year 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983.  Since he had no reckonable earnings in that year he is not entitled to pay-related benefit. Weekly payments of flat rate unemployment benefit are continuing to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim and arising from contentions made in the appeal the case was returned to the social welfare officer to afford him another opportunity to disclose his means.  It is hoped to complete the inquiries this week and the case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to reply to Questions Nos. 273 and 274 together. The Commission on Social Welfare expects to have its very detailed and comprehensive examination of the social welfare system completed by March 1986.  Its findings will be fully taken into account by the Government in planning the future development of the social welfare services.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to publish its proposals for national pensions development in the form of a White Paper.  The question of the relationship between pensions and earnings will be fully discussed in this paper, together with the social and financial implications of that approach. The issue of flexible retirement age is also being examined in detail in the context of the national pension plan.</P>

Inquiries had to be made to establish if he had sufficient contributions, paid or credited, in the governing contribution year 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of an old age contributory pension requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions from 5 January 1953 or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned has a total of 103 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 6 January 1954 to 31 December 1976.  This is equal to a yearly average of only four and, therefore, he does not qualify for an old age contributory pension under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Where a person has been employed in another EC country his insurance in that country may be combined with his Irish record to enable him to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension calculated on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total in the relevant period.  The person concerned had 889 British contributions in addition to his 103 Irish and this entitles him to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension at the current rate of £8.55 per week.  He is also in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond):</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means, £90.30 weekly, with effect from 30 November 1984 derived from self-employment.  He is therefore entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £3.85 being the appropriate rate in his case of £94.15 less means of £90.30 increased from 3 July 1985 to £9.50 being the appropriate rate in his case of £99.80 less means of £90.30.  Due to an oversight however his claim was not put into payment.  The error has now been rectified and payment will commence this week at £9.50.  All arrears due from 30 November 1984 have been refunded to the health board in respect of the supplementary welfare allowance advanced to him.  He appealed against the means assessment and arising from contentions raised in the appeal the case was returned to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  When the inquiries are completed the case will be referred to the appeals officer for determination and the rate of unemployment assistance payable will be reviewed in the light of his decision.</P>
      <P>Weekly payments at £9.50 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing year.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 3 July 1985. However, as he was employed in the UK during the governing contribution year 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, his entitlement to unemployment benefit could not be established until inquiries had been made to ascertain his contribution record in that county.  These inquiries were recently completed and his claim was allowed at £85 weekly, which is the appropriate rate payable in his case.  All <Col N="221" /> arrears due were paid to him last week. Further weekly payments will be made as they become due.</P>

He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an oral appeal hearing was held on 9 October 1985.  The appeals officer also assessed his means at £26.45 weekly.

      <P>A major renovation works programme has been underway at the employment exchange, Wexford, for some time.  While a number of minor alterations have already been completed, it was not possible to complete the outstanding works until such time as the social welfare officers and customs and excise staff had been relocated from the office to alternative accommodation. These officials were recently relocated <Col N="223" /> and the Office of Public Works will be proceeding with the renovation of the employment exchange work at an early date.  When completed, accommodation should be greatly improved for both staff and public callers alike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Bovine Tubercullosis &mdash; substantial progress in bovine TB eradication was made in the initial stages of the scheme.  Since the fifties, when 17 per cent of animals were infected, the level of disease had been reduced to the point where at the end of the 1983-84 testing programme the <Col N="234" /> animal incidence stood at 0.16 per cent. However, since the earlier progress had not been maintained in recent years, the Government, in the context of the national plan, decided to launch a fresh drive against bovine TB.  Substantially increased funding was set aside for the bovine disease eradication schemes over the period of the plan (1985-87) and important improvements and new procedures were introduced.  While it is too early yet to make any definitive assessment of progress the coherent and co-ordinated approach adopted under the plan and now being implemented under the current testing programme should provide a firm basis for the successful eradication of bovine TB.</P>
      <P>Brucellosis &mdash; the position here is very satisfactory.  At present, less than 600 herds are restricted compared to 14,000 five years ago.  The significant progress achieved in recent years suggests that, barring some unexpected reversals which in disease matters cannot be entirely excluded, the national herd should soon be virtually free of this disease.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Comprehensive measures have recently been adopted to tighten controls on the availability and use of antibiotics so as to ensure that these substances are used responsibly in animal husbandry and to prevent as far as possible any detrimental residues getting into the food chain.  In general the controls provide for restricting the sale of antibiotics to prescription only sales for ensuring that those who administer such products do so in a responsible manner and observe withdrawal periods and for empowering veterinary examiners to check for residues, take samples and reject animals or carcases which may contain detrimental residues.</P>
      <P>The new measures will come into force on a phased basis.  From 1 November 1985 it will be an offence.</P>
      <P>&mdash;to sell antibiotic substances which are not properly labelled,</P>
      <P>&mdash;to sell such substances by mail order or from a travelling shop or vehicle,</P>
      <P>&mdash;to fail to observe withdrawal periods indicated on labels,</P>
      <P>&mdash;to sell or slaughter an animal or sell the produce of an animal which contains antibiotic residues of which the seller should have been aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> Furthermore, the measures will provide with effect from 1 July 1986 that injectable and oral antibiotics may only be administered to an animal by or under direct supervision of a veterinary surgeon or by a person named in a veterinary prescription and, moreover, these substances may only be supplied by a veterinary surgeon or by a pharmacist on the prescription of a veterinary surgeon.  In addition to the new measures it should be noted that a scheme introduced in early 1984 in a co-operative effort between the Departments of Agriculture and Health and farming, dairy, veterinary and research interests to monitor and penalise any incidence of antibiotic residues in liquid milk continues to prove very effective.</P>

      <P>As regards the establishment of a land registry office in Munster to serve the needs of the south, a study was completed in 1983 on the feasibility of decentralising the Land Registry.  Conclusions reached in the study were that it was not likely that decentralisation would significantly affect the efficiency of the registry and that there would be substantial additional costs involved.

They are the construction of a new prison affording a high degree of security near the present prison in Portlaoise &mdash; planned as an additional prison not a replacement for the existing one &mdash; and the construction of the custodial buildings of a prison to accommodate women at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>They have not proceeded further than tender stage because of the financial constraints which have operated since 1981. When financial resources become available it may be necessary to have a fresh look at each of the projects with a view to seeing how it measures up to the needs of the situation as it will then be in the light of all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice for security reasons to reveal the names of consultants employed.  A total of £2.17 million has been paid in fees on the new prison at Portlaoise and £1.67 million on the prison in Wheatfield.

      <P>Under the section referred to, prisoners may also be given what is called full temporary release, which effectively means that he need not, provided he abides by the conditions of his release, return to prison.

      <P>When the application for a grant for the provision of an extension to O'Callaghan's Mills national school, County Clare, arose in 1979 it was necessary that a feasibility study be undertaken to establish whether the school site was suitable.  The study disclosed that it would be necessary to acquire an extension of the site and the school authorities were so informed. Before a grant could be formally sanctioned for the project, the following matters then had to be dealt with: (1) preparation of a sketch plan and costings, (2) negotiation of a suitable local contribution, and (3) production of evidence of title to the site extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters were finally disposed of in May 1982, December 1982 and April 1983 respectively.

My Department in November 1984 agreed to the invitation <Col N="254" /> of tenders, which are at present under consideration by the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Commissioners are expected to make a recommendation to my Department in the near future, and my Department will then be in touch with the school authorities.</P>

The amounts payable from the fund are: (1) the amount deducted from the employees' remuneration in respect of contributions to an occupational pension scheme during the 12 months prior to the insolvency of an employer but which were not paid into the scheme, and (2) either the outstanding contributions due to be paid into the scheme by an employer on his own behalf during the same period, or the amount certified by an actuary to be necessary to pay the benefits provided by the scheme, whichever is the lesser amount.</P>

      <P>When the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, was being enacted, it was not considered appropriate to include within the scope of its application seamen employed under employment agreements pursuant to Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, because those seamen were already covered by agreements specified under statute with their employers.</P>
      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Acts, the master of every Irish ship is required, before taking the vessel to sea, to enter into a written agreement with each seaman in a form approved by the Minister indicating, <i>inter alia</i>, as far as practicable, the duration or maximum period of the intended voyage or engagement. The agreement must be entered into in the presence of a mercantile marine superintendent or other proper officer, and such a person must also be present and officiate at the termination of the agreement.</P>

    <P>I understand that the Employment Appeals Tribunal has issued a formal decision in only one such case to date (ref. no. M77/85).

I understand further that, in a number of similar appeals by other employees of Irish Shipping Limited, tribunal hearings have taken place but that formal decisions have not yet been issued, although in some cases decisions have been <Col N="267" /> announced by the chairman at the conclusion of the hearings.
