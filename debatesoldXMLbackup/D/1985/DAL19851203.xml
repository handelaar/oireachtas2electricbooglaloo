    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the total amount of money collected under the youth employment levy since it was first introduced, the total number of permanent jobs created through the levy and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of £253.433 million had been collected under the youth employment levy up to the end of October 1985 since its introduction in April 1982.  Under the Youth Employment Act, 1982 the proceeds of the levy may be used to fund the training and employment of young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a wide variety of programmes including AnCO, CERT and ACOT's training programmes, in addition to employment programmes such as the enterprise allowance scheme, marketplace and the scientist and technologist employment programme are funded from the levy it is not possible to say <Col N="808" /> how many permanent jobs are created through the levy in any given year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is extraordinary that we cannot get any figure for permanent jobs in the youth area?  Does the Minister agree that the youth employment levy was widely acceptable to the taxpayers because they felt that the use of this special levy would provide jobs for young people?  Is the Minister satisfied that it has fulfilled that purpose?  In his reply the Minister referred to training and employment, can the Minister say how it has done in the employment field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody could be satisfied with the present state of affairs.  We would like to see it improved dramatically. We have the highest percentage of young people in the labour force in any EC country and we have the lowest level of youth unemployment in the under 25 age group.  There are many factors that bring that about.  That objective measurement, by comparison with other EC countries suggests that the utilisation of the resources of the youth employment levy has been among the reasons for that statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the money to which he referred was already spent under other headings prior to the youth employment levy and that all that his Government did was to transfer the money collected from the youth employment levy to pay for existing schemes, that that is the reason he cannot indicate any employment level, and that the money has been wrongly used and not for the purpose agreed by the trade unions in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  Some of the schemes that are currently being funded in part by the youth employment levy did not exist before 1982.  There was a clear recommendation at the time from the board of the agency which represents the social partners, including youth organisations, as to how the funds should be allocated.  They recognised, as did the <Col N="809" /> detailed research of the YEA, done subsequently, that education and training are key components in ensuring that young people get employment and they recommended that substantial funds go into the various training programmes.  On the basis of their recommendations the Government have made the allocations for YEA over the last number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned AnCO, Manpower and Cert.  All of those agencies were formed years ago, in the sixties, so what additional schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also mentioned the enterprise allowance scheme, marketplace and the scientist and technologist employment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>How many people are employed in those areas for the amount of money that was collected in the youth employment levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to put down a question for that I will be happy to give him the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Deputy Mac Giolla's question.  I gave Deputy Mac Giolla one question and Deputy Ahern two.  I think it is reasonable that I go back to Deputy Mac Giolla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question belongs to the House and not to any Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>You will agree, a Cheann Comhairle, that it is very difficult if you ask a question and get no reply to it.  In view of the inability of the Minister to come up with a reply to my question with regard to permanent jobs, does he agree that the multiplicity of organisations as referred to by Deputy Ahern and the multiplicity of areas to which the youth employment levy was going have raised these questions about the appropriate use of the fund which might <Col N="810" /> endanger the whole youth employment scheme?  Does the Minister consider that the NESC report was as a result of this? Could he say what credence he gives to the recommendations of the NESC report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me return to the question asked of me.  If the Deputies put down specific questions to me I can supply additional information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is about the amount collected and the jobs created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the second part, I accept that the Deputies would like more specific information and I will try to make that available to them.  I am not trying in any way to conceal information. However, the bottom line statistic should be recognised and it is as follows.  Before the YEA were set up and since that time we can measure our relative performance against that of other EC countries.  While we have the highest percentage of young people in the labour force we have the lowest percentage of youth unemployment.  We have the most active employment creation measures for young people of any of the states in the EC.  I do not want in any way to give the impression to this House that we are satisfied with the current levels of achievement, but the comparison indicates that we have been successful compared to our EC counterparts, and the funding for that success has come substantially from the youth employment levy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that £253 million is an enormous sum of money by our standards and that this sum of money has been raised from the taxpayer for one specific purpose, that was, as my collegue has pointed out, to create jobs for young people, and that here in this House today after that £253 million has been raised and spent the <Col N="811" /> Minister cannot point to one single permanent job created as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  I have already given an extensive reply.  If the Deputies wish to put down detailed questions&mdash;because they are aware as other Deputies are not of the range of the thing &mdash;I can give the precise statistical information if they want it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will sanction funding from the social employment scheme to undertake schemes which can be implemented by the farming community to restore their lands to production after the recent flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the provision of assistance for farmers who were hit by the adverse weather conditions last summer is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  A number of relief schemes have been introduced by his Department.</P>
      <P>The principal aim of the social employment scheme is to help the long term unemployed by providing them with work which responds to clearly identified community needs.  The work undertaken should be non-profit orientated and should not be a substitute for existing employment or reduce the hours of work of existing employees.  It does not appear that assistance of the kind suggested by the Deputy would fulfil all of these criteria.</P>
      <P>I should add that the initiative for undertaking particular schemes is a matter for the sponsors in each case. Sponsors may be either public sector bodies such as local authorities or other voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I had a question down to the Minister for Agriculture relating to flood damage during the summer where small farmers had tracts of land wiped away and sand, gravel, bog and all sort of things taken in on their land, and that now they <Col N="812" /> are not in a position to clear the land and that there are no schemes under the LIS that they can avail of?  Would the Minister not agree that here is an area where the social employment scheme could be used for community work where small farmers could get together and avail of the scheme in order to clear their lands and make them productive once again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be sympathetic to the Deputy's suggestion, provided that the work done and the people employed under the scheme, if sponsored by a local group of farmers, was seen clearly to meet the criteria already set out in the social employment scheme.  If the Deputy wishes he can discuss the matter with officials from my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M. Cosgrave Mr. M. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make available to housewives of fishermen and small businessmen in the Howth-Baldoyle area an AnCO training course specially designed to enable these women to carry out the bookkeeping duties for their husbands' businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The AnCO Training Centre in Baldoyle which serves the Baldoyle-Howth area provides courses in office procedure, basic accounting and computerised office systems.  Women who are unemployed or who wish to return to employment can apply for these courses and, indeed, other courses.</P>
      <P>In addition, AnCO focuses on the training needs of small businesses through its enterprise training courses such as Start Your Own Business and its small business training advisory services generally.  The small business training advisory service would be in a position to advise on what training, if any, would be best suited for small businesses particularly manufacturing businesses in the Howth-Baldoyle area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been approached by a number of women in the <Col N="813" /> area who are anxious to have this course to enable them to have the knowledge to fill in PAYE forms and that type of bookkeeping.  Will the Minister approach the director in the AnCO training centre in Baldoyle and ask him to put on a course specially designed towards this kind of operation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 2 July 1982 the Government approved a proposal of the Minister for Education that a national award scheme for young people entitled &ldquo;Gaisce, The President's Award&rdquo; be established.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, on 31 May 1983 invited Dr. A.J.F. O'Reilly to act as Chairman of Gaisce, The President's Award.  This invitation was duly accepted.  An <i>ad hoc</i> management committee was established to progress development of Gaisce, The President's Award, and to launch it in pilot areas.  This committee is preparatory to the establishment by the Government to a fully fledged award authority. It is envisaged that the full award authority would be fully representative of youth serving interests, the business community, trade unions and other resource specialists, as well as being geographically representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that, unfortunately, this scheme has got off to a very bad start and that in particular the manner in which it was launched at Áras an Uachtaráin was entirely an inappropriate event?  Would he agree with me at this stage that the only sensible, rational thing to do is to ask the existing <i>ad hoc</i> committee, as he <Col N="814" /> described it, and in particular the chairman, to resign so that he may make a totally new start with the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that it has got off to a bad start.  This scheme has had quite a lengthy gestation period.  It has been considered, planned and worked for going back to the early stage of the decade and perhaps even before that.  It is now up and running and the response from the pilot areas is highly encouraging.  The House will recall that there was a degree of controversy surrounding the launch.  I regret that controversy which I do not think was helpful to the success of the scheme.  I think that when he comes to reflect on it the Leader of the Opposition may feel that perhaps his intervention was not the most helpful.  In any event, I have no desire to go back over controversies at this stage.  The Taoiseach in the Dáil on that occasion indicated that when it comes to appointing a permanent authority the Leader of the Opposition will be consulted in full and I understand that that offer has been communicated to him formally in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State not accept that there was widespread public concern at the unseemly behaviour of the present chairman of this <i>ad hoc</i> committee on the occasion of the launching of the scheme and that it is a fact that, if the scheme is to achieve what we would all like it to achieve, it must be launched and implemented in a manner which is totally removed from and above party politics?  Will the Minister of State not agree that, with the membership of the committee, it has no possibility of being regarded as non-partisan?  I should like to put my suggestion to the Minister of State again, that he owes it to the scheme and to the young people it is intended to serve, to make a totally new beginning and ask those who have totally bungled the scheme up to now to leave the scene and enable him, or the Taoiseach, to appoint a completely new committee which will be above reproach and, particularly, above politics?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very appreciative of the commitment made by those who have been involved to date. Their success in getting the scheme up and running before the end of this important year is a remarkable one given the degree of delay that has bedevilled the scheme to date.  I am particularly appreciative of the performance of the chairman to date.  In selecting a suitable person to act, great care and thought were given to the matter and Dr. O'Reilly seemed pre-eminently suitable for that position, in particular given his connection with Irish-American associations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy opposite will be aware of the fact that it has always been expected that support and assistance would be coming from the Congressional Awards Scheme in the United States and that his Minister of State, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and I have attempted to strengthen and build on those links.  Dr. O'Reilly's association with that scheme makes him pre-eminently suitable for appointment.  In addition, his status in the business community, as an international sportsman and so on, singled him out for selection but, while I have indicated that we are deeply appreciative of the support and involvement of those who have served that awards scheme so well to date, I would like to repeat that what is in existence now is an <i>ad hoc</i> committee. It is intended that there will be a permanent awards scheme and, as the Taoiseach said more than once, we are prepared to discuss the details of that committee and its composition with the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister's congratulations to the chairman indicate that he condones the sending of the invitations in the name of the Taoiseach from an office that was hard to locate in town, were not in the name of the President and could only be responded to by ringing the telephone number of an office in town?  Is the Minister of State condoning that action in the name of the President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been <Col N="816" /> through all of this before and I do not think it is helpful for those who are seeking to establish an awards scheme, who are seeking the support of the private sector and do not seek anything other than to have in existence an awards scheme that would benefit young people here, if we retrace our tracks over this controversy.  On the occasions of an Adjournment debate the Taoiseach explained in great detail the circumstances relating to the issuing of the invitations. In particular, he explained that the group organising the awards ceremony when they approached the secretariat in Áras an Uachtaráin were informed that it was in that fashion that the invitations should issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I keep the staff level in the various sections of my Department under continuous review in the light of work priorities.</P>
      <P>Staff have been redeployed from other activities in the Department of Labour to the National Manpower Service because of the high priority the activities of the service have.  In addition, I have secured from the Government agreement within the overall terms of the embargo for assignment of some additional placement and clerical staff to the National Manpower Service.  Some of these are already <i>in situ</i> and the balance are in the course of being assigned.</P>
      <P>Computerisation in the National Manpower Service in the east region has been introduced and this will be extended to other areas in the country as soon as possible.  These measures have had the effect of increased productivity and improved administrative efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since the introduction of the new schemes, particularly the social employment scheme, facilities in the manpower office serving the north side have practically broken down due to the fact that <Col N="818" /> there are no additional staff to deal with the huge increase in the workload?  Is the Minister aware that, prior to the introduction of the new scheme, the office I have referred to was so understaffed that they were unable to handle the huge number of applications received from the unemployed?  Is the Minister aware that the position is so bad that people are sent away and told not to come back for six to eight weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the staff of the National Manpower Service throughout the service have been working under difficult conditions because of the tragic increase in the number of applicants on the one hand and, on the other hand, the effect of the embargo.  I have made provision for extra staff and it will be my intention to ensure that that staff are directed to the areas of maximum demand.  In that context I agree with Deputy Brady that the north side of Dublin city needs additional assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister review the system whereby applicants for various schemes must submit their applications? In regard to one scheme, the social employment scheme, 13 forms have to be filled by each applicant.  There is a huge amount of administration involved because of the massive amount of paper work which has to be handled by about three clerical staff.  It is obvious that the system has broken down.  As far as the new scheme is concerned, will the Minister ensure that those for whom the service was established originally, the unemployed, get preferential treatment because they are not getting any at present? It is the view of unemployed people that it is a waste of time approaching the National Manpower Service.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the pressures on the National Manpower Service.  In regard to the SES I should like to tell the Deputy that the filling of forms has been considerably streamlined and, from the point of view of the participants and the placement officers, the position is not as suggested by the Deputy.  However, I will <Col N="819" /> be happy to discuss the matter with the Deputy if he has received complaints about the scheme.  I am not suggesting that the Deputy is misleading the House but that is not my understanding of how the scheme is operating.  We are trying to improve and modernise the National Manpower Service and the introduction of computerisation will certainly take a lot of the repetitive work off the shoulders of the staff.</P>

      <P>It was a condition of the establishment of Gaisce, the President's Award, that it would be financed mainly from private or business sources. The arrangements for the necessary fund-raising from the private sector are the sole responsibility of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee which is administering the award.  I am not, therefore, in a position to provide the detailed information requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I suggest that this is simply not good enough.  This is not a statutory body.  By the Minister of State's own statement, it is an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, therefore it has no particular status.  In that situation does the Minister think it legitimate of him to try to deny the House this knowledge?  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee have no particular standing or responsibility to this House and it is completely unacceptable that the Minister of State should try to hide behind them and not give us the information which was sought in Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's question. Has a professional fund-raising company been engaged, and if so, what is their name?  That is information to which the House is entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting a little carried away.  It was the hope of all sides of this House that that money would come from the private sector and that the State's role would be simply one of seed capital, if you like. The detail of that collection method is a matter for those who will be approaching their colleagues, selling to them the value and worth of the scheme.  If it is of particular significance, I understand, that in approaching that task the view was taken that it would be advisable to seek professional assistance.  On that basis a company have been approached to advise on the structure and strategy for fund raising, but I understand that is on a strictly limited basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that a professional firm of fund-raisers have been employed.  Does the Minister of State think it seemly or appropriate that this scheme, which will be concerned with young people and their endeavours, largely of a voluntary nature, should be at this early stage committed to the tender mercies of professional fund-raisers? Does he not think this a totally unsuitable and inappropriate procedure?  Will he not take immediate steps to have this matter put right and have the professional fund-raisers removed from the scene?  What purpose does that <i>ad hoc</i> committee <Col N="821" /> serve if it is only to employ a professional fund-raising company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is, and has been for many years, that there was a desire to see a scheme of this nature established.  Following the practice of many other countries, it was hoped that it would serve as a mechanism through which the private sector would invest funds on a substantial basis in the youth service.  One of the main reasons for the strategy of asking a group of people to work on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis was so that they could pursue the whole question of the viability of fund-raising.  That has been a concern of successive Governments and successive individuals who have held the office that I now hold.  In fulfilling that task they not unnaturally regard it as helpful to have professional assistance. As I understand it, their intention is that professional assistance would be required simply on the basis of advising on the approach to be taken towards the strategy and the structures that will be required for continued fund-raising.  It is a tribute to those involved that their efforts to date, I understand, have met with some considerable success.  I would like to think that the debate in this House, and in particular the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition, would not in any sense impede their activities, although I have to warn that I think there is every danger that it might.</P>

Does he not think that in this whole area where young people and their endeavours and efforts are involved, there is something entirely inappropriate and unseemly in bringing in professional <Col N="822" /> fund-raisers?

      <P>I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will not take it amiss when I say that some of his present difficulties in the opinion polls relate to this tendency to speak before thinking. When he gets an opportunity to think about those ill-considered remarks, he will want to reflect further.  This is a perfectly simple matter.  All sides of the House are anxious that this scheme should be funded on a long term, continuing basis by the private sector.  They are anxious because the belief is that the status of the reward and its structures should be such that it will provide an attractive prospect for those with substantial funds to invest and that, in particular, it will attract those who might not have been attracted by any of the existing organisations.  In order to secure that, it seems necessary to approach people on a professional basis.  As to the company that have been involved, I know little of the details except that in my work as Minister of State dealing with community groups all over the country I have come <Col N="823" /> across this same group fulfilling a similar role.</P>

      <P>This matter long pre-dates the period in office of this Government.  It has been the view of successive administrations, stretching back to four or five general elections, that what is required is a partnership between the State and the private sector whereby the integrity and status of the scheme will be attested to by the involvement of leaders of the State at the highest level and that the private sector would show their interest, support and commitment by putting their money up front.  It is to that task that the <i>ad hoc</i> committee are now addressing themselves.  I must repeat that this sort of discussion is not making their task any easier.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the net effect on staff numbers in my Department resulting from embargoes, staff levies and additions to staff.  The net effect has been to reduce the number of authorised posts in my Department by 83 since 21 July 1981.  This has inevitably caused some problems in my Department where the workload has increased significantly during the same period.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to say, however, that while we had problems we have managed to cope with them by such means as staff redeployment, improved administrative procedures, the introduction of new technology and, last but certainly not least, considerably greater effort from all of the staff involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister would agree that the prime function of his Department is to try to help alleviate the present unemployment crisis.  It seems a total contradiction that the embargo should have such a huge effect on his own Department with regard to over 80 posts.  We have already had a question concerning the long delays, with people being told to come back six weeks later.  In his role as involved in industrial relations, what action has the Minister taken to change the policy of the embargo in connection with his own Department and the public service in general?

      <P>The 40 per cent increase in expenditure on training for women in 1984 is explained by the fact that in 1984 more funds became available generally for the training of adults from the European Social Fund.  I am not sure if that fully answers the intent of the Deputy's question but, where we deem it to be appropriate, we are using funds from the European Social Fund to extend programmes in this country.

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy is the research project &ldquo;The Hidden Workers&rdquo; which was commissioned by the Employment Equality Agency and carried out by Ms. Mary Daly, Social Research Centre, Limerick.</P>
      <P>The main factors which the project concluded had an influence on the conditions of part time cleaning workers were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (1)  The organisation of the cleaning industry; in this connection the report <Col N="829" /> saw a clear role for a joint labour committee to set minimum standards and conditions for the industry outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>(2)  The nature of part time work.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a joint labour committee was established in April 1984 for Dublin city and county in response to an application from the ICTU on behalf of a number of trade unions.  I understand that union members of the joint labour committee are at present considering applying to the Labour Court for the extension of the coverage of the committee to the entire country. </P>
    <P>As regards part time work, the Deputy will be aware that in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 the hours of work to qualify for coverage of the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act were reduced to 18 hours.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the influence of the client firm.  In this connection I would like to point out that public service contracts are required to include a fair wages clause in the conditions for cleaning contracts.</P>
    <P>The report also suggests that some procedures in the contract cleaning industry may be in breach of both the Social Welfare and Revenue Commissioners' regulations. I have written to the Ministers concerned asking them whether there is anything they can do about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure everybody in the House welcomes this report because last year, during the debate on the Protection of Employees Act, there was much discussion of this matter.  Does the Minister feel that publication of this report and whatever amendments he can make will close the loopholes referred to in the course of the debate in this House last year in which it was claimed that the cleaning contract industry was notorious and has been proven guilty many times of abusing existing legislation in order either to dismiss unfairly or employ, so <Col N="830" /> that people cannot be covered under the various statutory regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in April 1984 I moved to establish the joint labour committee for the cleaning industry in the Dublin area where the largest volume of demand exists and they have established a minimum wage or rates, for that area.  We are now awaiting the Labour Court's response to the JLC's proposal in regard to the proposition to extend it to the rest of the country.  My view is that I would be in favour of it. That constitutes a massive improvement on the conditions of part time cleaning workers to date.  The second point is in regard to abuses by some employers.  We have taken steps to ensure that any contract cleaning company who tender for work in the public service, for the cleaning of Government or semi-State offices, under the terms of their contract will have to ensure that they comply with all of the statutory requirements which the industry, the Revenue Commissioners and the Social Welfare code impose on them. That would be a condition of their contract. Therefore any breach in the observation of those legal obligations would put the contract at risk.  That is in line with the action the Government have taken in regard to the new package of home improvement grants under which we are effectively trying to ensure that the taxpayers' money is not exploited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation of action and programmes to assist workers in the transition from work to retirement traditionally has been perceived as a part of good personnel management policy rather than as a function of Government. Thus, my Department have not been called upon to involve themselves in this area.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department's own staff are concerned, all officers who have reached the minimum retirement age, i.e. 60 years, or will do so within five years, are advised of the arrangements for the retirement planning courses run by the Civil Service Training Centre.</P>

All Members of this House have contact with people in retirement who are not aware of their statutory entitlements or how to find out about them.  If not an indictment of all of us, it is certainly an indictment of the personnel system.  Apart from a few major firms which are exceptions, people are not made aware of their entitlements.  Since personnel departments will not carry out this function, perhaps it could be undertaken by the Department of Labour.  It would be of great social value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A quota of 3 per cent was decided by the Government in May 1977 as the target for the employment of disabled persons in the public sector.</P>
      <P>Progress is being achieved through holding special recruitment competitions confined to disabled persons and by giving special consideration to suitable disabled people in the case of jobs not filled by competition.</P>
      <P>To date, 300 disabled persons have been recruited to the Civil Service through special competitions.  At the end of December 1984 the total number of disabled persons in the public service, including those who became disabled since recruitment, stood at 2,700 which was 1 per cent approximately of the workforce. In the Civil Service, disabled persons represent 1.4 per cent of the workforce.</P>
      <P>While I am satisfied that significant progress was made initially, I am aware that the restrictions generally on recruitment to the public service have had serious repercussions for the quota.  For my part, I will avail myself of every opportunity to encourage the public sector to increase their intake of disabled persons and I will keep the arrangement under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I am glad to say that provision has been made for 5 per cent of the 1,000 places being made available in the Civil Service for temporary clerical trainees to be reserved for disabled persons.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In deciding the criteria for eligibility for the social employment scheme, we aimed at targeting the scheme on those over 25 years who were long term unemployed as defined by an objective measure and minimising the additional Exchequer costs.  The criteria for eligibility were specifically designed to ensure that the scheme would assist those people most in need of income support and special employment measures. Under the social welfare system persons who have been unemployed for one year or over and who are receiving unemployment assistance at present are uniquely identified with this category of need. Covering the groups mentioned by the Deputy would not meet these objectives.</P>
      <P>As regards married women, the Deputy will be aware of the provisions of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.  It is hoped to introduce the relevant provisions of this Act as early as possible.</P>

      <P>I agree.  In 1974 the previous Coalition Government removed the marriage bar in the public service, a request denied on numerous occasions by Fianna Fáil Governments.  If Fianna Fáil had removed the marriage bar in the sixties we would now have far more women at senior rank in the Civil Service. However, because of the marriage bar women were forced, unjustly, to make a choice&mdash;which men do not have to make &mdash;between their career, being married or remaining single.  For that reason, inevitably the numbers of suitably qualified female staff at senior level is much smaller than the same number of females participating at lower levels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No and you will find that the Government's record in relation to promotion of females and their appointment to boards generally in areas where we have had discretion is a very positive one.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a ministerial task force was set up in 1983 to examine the problem of absenteeism.  The task force reported to the Government earlier this year.  The Government considered the report and took decisions on a range of initiatives to be pursued at national level.  Details of these initiatives were set out in a press statement which the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism released on 29 September 1985.  I will send the Deputy a copy of the statement and he will see from it that the issue of absenteeism impinges on the responsibilities of a number of Departments of State, Government agencies and other organisations.</P>
      <P>I must stress that the resolution of problems of absenteeism is primarily a management responsibility which is best tackled at the level of the firm.  It is hoped that the inititatives to be pursued by the Government will have positive effects but they are no substitute for effective action on absenteeism control in the workplace.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister's Department hope to mount a campaign to educate managers into taking positive action to curtail absenteeism in industry or indeed in the public service where it also applies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the recommendations in the report and that a special role for the Irish Productivity Centre to promote measures to reduce absenteeism has been recommended. That body are under the control of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and, from the point of view of the Department of Labour, they seem to be the ideal body to be concerned with productivity of which absenteeism is clearly a very direct relevant factor.  They are the body between the trade unions on the one hand and the <Col N="842" /> employers on the other in the private or public sector and are best qualified to deal with it.  I stress my support for the recommendation in the reply here and the report itself that absenteeism can best be tackled at management level.  They need encouragement and assistance from Government agencies and it is our intention that the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance and the Irish Productivity Centre should assist in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that we should do everything by way of encouragement and assistance in the matter.  Will the Minister not accept that it seems unfair that a person in the public sector who never misses a day's work should get the same pay, conditions and superannuation benefits as a person who misses a number of days for whatever reason?  Will the Minister consider, in conjunction with the Minister for the Public Service, having some incentive for people who do not absent themselves from work?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this dispute has now existed for almost a year and a half.  The Labour Court have now reported to me following intensive negotiations between the two parties involved.  I am at present considering whether further action can be taken with a view to bringing the dispute to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last raised this matter on 30 October the Minister said there would be some developments in the following few days and that it would be unhelpful to pursue the matter further at that point.  As a result, I allowed the matter to rest but now a further month has passed.  For 18 months this small band of workers have taken a stand against the South African regime in the way they thought fitting.  They are supported by the trade union movement, by most workers and by people in all sections of Irish society.  However, apart from finances, three or four of the people involved have severe health problems as a result of being out in inclement weather.  It is within the jurisdiction of the Government to force a conclusion in this case. The people concerned have made a stand and they deserve assistance.  It is unreasonable to expect them to go back and to handle South African goods&mdash; they will not do that.  Has the Minister any hope to offer other than to say he is considering the position?  The strikers have taken a brave stand for 18 months. Some of them are in ill-health and they deserve help.</P>

      <P>The fact that the dispute has gone on for 18 months should be an indication to him and to anyone else of the complexity of the issues involved and the obstacles to obtaining a satisfactory <Col N="844" /> solution acceptable to both sides.  Despite what the Deputy may have implied, we still live in a democratic society and one cannot force solutions on people in the area of industrial relations.  I received the report of the Labour Court some days ago.  It suggested some courses of action that might, in their view, lead to a settlement. I am pursuing these but I am slow at this stage to say anything that might prejudice the outcome of negotiations because they will have to be between both parties.  In the past I asked the Labour Court to intervene and I have followed to the letter their advice and recommendations.  In this connection, I should like to pay tribute to the work of the court in this area.  My personal position on this matter is clear and is on the record.  What is at issue is the finding of a satisfactory solution to an industrial relations problem that has defied solution for the past 18 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister given consideration to having a code of practice that would allow for people to have a conscientious objection to handling South African goods?  The Labour Court suggested this in an earlier finding on this dispute and perhaps the Minister could try to seek a settlement in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the options referred to in various reports and it is one I am looking at.  However, at this stage I am not in a position to give any indication on the course of action most effective.  I have spent a lot of time on this dispute and I am especially anxious that it be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  I recognise the commitment and courage of the individual strikers involved, as any person must, having regard to the fact for the past 18 months.  As Minister for Labour it is my desire and responsibility to try to find a solution to what has to date been an intractable industrial relations problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks in reply to the debate I adverted to the bipartisan calls for the designation of areas at many ports around the country as free ports.  I said that it would be counter-productive if there <Col N="918" /> were to be a proliferation of free ports and I am sure that there is general consensus on that point.</P>
      <P>In opening the debate I referred in general terms to the regime to be applied here and I dealt with the free port situation in the UK.  These points were also touched upon by many Deputies in the course of their contributions to the debate and I do not intend to deal with this matter at length.</P>
      <P>There are, however, two points which I wish to make.  Six free ports have been or are being established in the UK, including three airports and three ports. In Ireland, by comparison, we have one free airport and will shortly have one free port.  Having regard to the comparative size of the two economies I feel that we will have an adequate number here for the present and, as I have said, we should hasten slowly and learn along the way.</P>
      <P>I want to echo what a number of Deputies have said.  The free port regime here must conform to EC rules, and free ports in the EC simply cannot be compared with those in less developed countries such as Taiwan where cheap labour is available and concessions in other respects go far beyond what we can or would wish to provide here.  I agree that the free port should be operated in as liberal a fashion as possible and that customs documentation and control should be as simple as possible.  The customs regime, however, must be consistent with EC requirements and must ensure that irregularities will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that there was a general appreciation among Deputies on the point I made earlier that the purpose of a free port must be to generate additional economic activity, and not simply to divert activity from elsewhere in the State.  There would be little merit in improving the fortunes of one area if that were to be done at the expense of another area which, perhaps, itself was experiencing its own share of economic hardship. I agree with Deputy Wilson that the emphasis in the free port should be on manufacturing industry, although I <Col N="919" /> would be favourably disposed to any project which generated additional employment. I think that Deputy Doyle's warning against free ports as glorified bonded warehouses is apposite in this regard.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed the view that the VAT regime to be applied at Ringaskiddy should be as liberal as possible.  As I explained earlier, the VAT regime is not provided for in the Bill but rather will be applied by regulations to be made by the Revenue Commissioners under the VAT Act.  This is in keeping with the enabling nature of the Bill before the House.  I will bring the views which Deputies have expressed on this to the attention of the Minister for Finance, but I feel that the approach advocated by some Deputies runs counter to the basic objective of generating additional activity and jobs rather than diverting normal trade from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As regards the manner in which the Ringaskiddy free port is to be developed and operated, I indicated in opening the debate that I had a fairly open mind on these matters.  I referred to a number of options which could be considered and, in particular, to the possibility of a joint venture between Cork Harbour Commissioners and private sector partners which will shortly be investigated by the commissioners.  I think it entirely right that the possibility for private sources of funding should be explored as one option for financing the development of the free port.</P>
    <P>I note that this concept was welcomed by Deputy Wyse.  This is not being ideological, as Deputy Wilson seemed to imply, but simply practical.  Deputy Lyons spoke in favour of Cork County Council being involved in the operation of the Ringaskiddy free port.  I would have no objection to considering the county council or any other local body for participation in a Ringaskiddy free port company if such a concept is decided upon as the appropriate mechanism through which to control and manage the free port.  If I understood Deputy Wilson correctly, he suggested that there might be some implications of that nature in it. <Col N="920" /> We are simply being practical.  There is no question of being ideological in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out that in Scotland public authorities have taken part in a free port development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lyons spoke in favour of Cork County Council being involved in the operation of Ringaskiddy. I would have no objection to considering the county council or any other local body for participation in the free port should such a concept be decided on and involve the appropriate mechanisms to control and manage the free port.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson indicated that he would be raising some specific points on Committee Stage for which he would be tabling amendments. Other Deputies have made points about specific sections of the Bill.  I will be glad to respond on Committee Stage to any detailed points and to consider amendments Deputies may wish to propose.  I would not consider this legislation to be in any way a party matter.  All of us have a great interest in putting into existence the free port and in doing so by the best system possible. This is enabling legislation but any idea that will be put forward will be examined and accommodated should it be considered to be of benefit to the Bill.  That is the spirit in which the Bill is being presented to the House.  It is the spirit also in which it is being tackled by the Opposition and by other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can clarify for Deputy Wilson that a similar provision to section 11 applies in relation to the customs free airport at Shannon and to the land frontier.  Section 11 empowers an officer of the Customs and Excise to search any means of transport within 32 kilometres of a free port and to question the person in charge of such transport.  Throughout the State the general position is that an officer of the Customs and Excise has power to stop a vehicle provided he has due cause to consider that an offence has been or is being committed.  One may say that the difference in this case is small but it is <Col N="921" /> tougher, as it were, than the existing provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, in this case he can stop the vehicle without having any cause for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be talking about that and about interference with the freedom of movement of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention to provide for the setting up of a duty free shop at the free port.  This matter was referred to by Deputy Lyons and by a number of other Deputies.  However, the supply of stores and goods for duty free sale on board ship are the subject of existing separate legislation.  Assessment of duty is subject to EC directives.  There is provision under existing law for what is termed &ldquo;processing under customs control&rdquo; which gives a certain degree of flexibility regarding assessment of duty, for instance, whether duty should be assessed on the raw materials or on the finished product.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Bill does not address the question of the rate of corporation tax.  This is a separate issue and I will bring the various points raised to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  Of its nature, there is a good deal in this debate that is of concern to that Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney and several other Deputies referred to the possibility of sub zones.  These can be created either by extending the scope of the designated area or by designating separate areas as seems appropriate and in the light of the needs and the evolution of the free port concept.  It is very liberal in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have discretion on the question of rates in designated areas and Ringaskiddy is one such area.  It would be up to statutory authorities to consider allowing reductions in the rate of charges for services provided in a free port.  I would point out, however, that it <Col N="922" /> might be too much to expect other areas to subsidise the cost of providing services in a free port.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies spoke about the deep water berth and the provision of funds for the project.  I am pleased to point out that this Government were responsible for granting Cork Harbour Commissioners permission to place a contract for the construction of the berth in respect of which a full cost State grant is being provided.  I was present at the signing of the relevant contract.  There was a great deal of satisfaction in the area on that occasion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern has a query in relation to the treatment for customs duty purposes of goods leaving a free port for non-European Community countries. The position is that goods re-exported to non-Community countries after processing in a free port will not be subject to payment of any customs duty.</P>
      <P>As to the timescale for Ringaskiddy itself, there are a number of aspects of the free port operation which have to be finalised before the free port actually gets under way.  I have referred to these in my earlier remarks.  They are, for example, the precise area to be designated, the arrangements for development and day-to-day management of the free port, the VAT regulations and the Revenue Commissioners' procedures for necessary customs control.  I cannot be precise, as Deputies will appreciate, as to when these matters will be finalised.  Passage of the legislation is the first essential step and all the other matters are in hand. Many of these are going ahead while this legislation is being processed.  I will ensure that there is no unreasonable delay in setting up the Ringaskiddy free port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coveney put it well when he said that the acid test for the Ringaskiddy free port would be whether the area initially designated would require to be extended in a few year's time to cope with the scale of activity.  Having regard <Col N="923" /> to the extent and scale of the State-financed facilities and assistance for new industry in the Ringaskiddy area, I am optimistic that the free port will indeed pass this test.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Transport Policy has been published since I began my reply to the debate on 27 November.  As well as referring to the Bill under debate, the Green Paper touches on a number of issues raised by Deputies, namely, the constitution of Cork Harbour Commissioners referred to by Deputy Lyons, and the Shannon Ports Authority referred to by Deputy Collins.  A harbours Bill is being drafted at present which will provide for the setting up of the Shannon Ports Authority and the reconstitution of the port authorities at Dublin, Cork and Waterford.  In that connection regard is being had to the question of representation of Cork County Council on Cork Harbour Commissioners.  This was a point raised by several of the Cork Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins and other Deputies mentioned the infrastructure available in the Shannon estuary as justification for a free port in the estuary.  The existence of infrastructure does not of itself justify the creation of a free port.  I recognise that the ESB jetty at Moneypoint can accommodate larger vessels than those which can be accommodated at the new berth at Ringaskiddy but the Moneypoint facility exists to handle coal in bulk and is in the ownership of the ESB.  The deep water berth, on the other hand, is a multi-purpose common user berth.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be drawn into any controversy or rivalry, whether real or apparent, that may exist between the Shannon estuary and Cork regions and which emerged during the debate.  Shannon has a customs free airport.  That facility was provided there because the Government of the day wished to have available at Shannon the best possible facilities for international airlines with the minimum of formalities and impediments. As I said in introducing the debate, the decision to create a free port at Ringaskiddy stemmed from the recommendations <Col N="924" /> of the Task Force on Employment in the Cork area.  I reject allegations that Ringaskiddy was chosen on political grounds.  It was chosen for economic and social policy considerations and having regard to the significant State investment in the Ringaskiddy area.  The free ports idea is a good one. We must start somewhere.  Perhaps we could have begun such development earlier but we hope that Ringaskiddy will prove to be a considerable success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk asked that consideration be given to the setting up of a special development authority for the Border counties.  That matter is outside the scope of this Bill.  It would be more appropriate for the Deputy to raise the matter with the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that that point will be made strongly again, it was made during the debate by Deputy McGahon also.  No one is claiming that what we are doing by way of this legislation will provide the answer to all the problems, whether in Cork or elsewhere, but it is an imaginative step and one that has very considerable potential.  Obviously we will learn a lot from what happens at Ringaskiddy, as we are learning right now from the experience in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies pointed out, Deputy Collins in particular, that a free port must have some natural or other advantages because a free port as such is no use unless it is capable of attracting business. This is enabling legislation making it <Col N="925" /> possible to have a free port anywhere in the country.  What we will have at Ringaskiddy is a beginning.  Naturally we all look forward to it being a success &mdash; and we hope it will be a dramatic success. Experience in the United Kingdom would advocate caution but, on the other hand, we know of other free ports which were major successes.</P>
    <P>There is much optimism behind this venture in Cork, and I hope it will be a dramatic success, but we will have to take into consideration the caution expressed throughout this debate by many Deputies that there is no automatic path to success or no automatic answer to all the problems. I am extremely grateful for what has been a very good debate and I am delighted to have had the privilege of introducing this Bill.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate and I am glad of the general welcome it was given. While there may have been differences on various points, there was general welcome for the concept.  This Bill has been introduced in the spirit of getting the best legislation on the Statute Book and we will be interested in any amendments put forward.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable charges to be made by health boards for hospital inpatient and outpatient services on persons in respect of treatment of injuries received in road traffic accidents <Col N="926" /> when the injury is caused by the negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and where the person has received, or is entitled to receive, damages or compensation in respect of such accident.</P>
    <P>The principle of recovering the costs of the treatment of road traffic victims can be traced back to the Road Traffic Act, 1933, and the most recent provisions were contained in article 6 (3) of the Health Services Regulations, 1971, which were made under section 72 of the Health Act, 1970.  These regulations were challenged in the Cooke v. Walsh case and the Supreme Court judgement of 16 December 1983 declared that the regulations were <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister and were void.</P>
    <P>When the Health Act, 1970, was debated in this House the then Minister for Health made it clear that persons who received damages or compensation for injuries received in road traffic accidents would be required to pay for hospital services received in respect of their injuries. He indicated that this would be covered in regulations which he intended to make under section 72 of the Act. The Act was passed and subsequently the provisions made in article 6 (3) of the Health Services Regulations, 1971, were availed of to make such charges until they were declared <i>ultra vires</i> by the Supreme Court in December 1983.</P>
    <P>The provisions which I have now brought before the House provide specific authority to enable health boards to reintroduce charges for hospital services provided for persons who receive damages for injuries received in a road traffic accident.  Such charges will then be admissible in claims for compensation before the courts.  These will be decided ultimately by the courts and the damages awarded, which would include provision for the charges, would be payable by the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>I have made specific provision in the Bill for the waiving of the whole or part of the charges in cases where the compensation payable to the injured party has been reduced by the courts by reason of contributory negligence of such person <Col N="927" /> or where the amount of damages is insufficient to meet the charges.  This will protect the injured person from any hardship which might arise in meeting the charges.</P>
    <P>As to the detailed provisions of the Bill itself, it is a short Bill containing only four sections.  Section 1 sets out the definitions used in the Bill and those definitions are mainly contained in other pertinent legislation. Section 2 (1) gives specific power to health boards to make charges for hospital inpatient and outpatient services on persons injured in road traffic accidents who have received, or are entitled to receive, damages or compensation in respect of the accidents.  The charge payable is not specified but would normally be the average daily cost per bed day in the hospital concerned.  This will vary depending on the hospital involved.</P>
    <P>I should make it quite clear at this point that there is no retrospective provision in the Bill and consequently these charges will arise only for cases where the injury occurs after the enactment of this legislation. Services provided in respect of injuries received prior to the enactment of this legislation will be dealt with in accordance with the existing provisions of the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) allows health boards to waive the whole or part of the charge raised where the amount of damages received is either insufficient or has been reduced by virtue of contributory negligence of the injured person.  This provision is necessary in order to prevent hardship on the injured party.  Sub-paragraph (b) of this subsection is a technical provision which enables the courts to disregard the discretion of the health board to waive charges in determining the amount of damages to be assessed.</P>
    <P>Section 3 simply provides for recovery of sums due under section 2 and, as many of the court cases on road traffic injuries take a considerable time to resolve, it also provides that charges shall accrue on the date on which damages are paid or on the date on which the services were provided whichever is the later.  Section 4 provides for the short title, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> In recommending this Bill for a Second Reading I want to emphasise to the House: (1) charges have been levied in these circumstances since 1933; (2) insurance companies have been paid premiums to underwrite these risks; (3) the Exchequer should not be called upon to bear the costs of negligent drivers, and (4) adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that no hardship will accrue to the injured party.</P>
    <P>Loss of income from charges in respect of road traffic accident cases since the Supreme Court decision has aggravated the difficult financial position of health agencies.  The reimposition of these charges is therefore essential.  It is currently estimated that the charges to be levied could provide income of up to £4 million per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this legislation was introduced because of a decision of the Supreme Court in 1983 in the Cooke v. Walsh case brought by the father of an infant who was injured and damages amounting to £757,538 were awarded to the child out of which health board expenses amounted to almost £100,000.  The High Court decided in favour of the insurance company and then the Supreme Court took the view that it was <i>ultra vires</i> for the Minister to impose these charges under the various health Acts between 1947 and 1970.  The plaintiffs in the case also maintained that this law was unconstitutional and that was not tried in the court because they succeeded on the <i>ultra vires</i> claim, so now we have this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are not opposing the legislation it is disappointing that the Minister has not looked at the area of the health services and their relationship to insurance companies and the question of payment in this type of case, to see if some other way might not be found to cut the cost to the citizen.  Irrespective of whether the health services or the insurance companies pay the cost, it is always the citizen who pays through higher insurance premiums or through <Col N="929" /> higher taxation to provide the health services. The Minister should have sought another way in which to deal with the more trivial accident cases than through the courts.  While I accept that the Minister arranged that the charge may be waived in certain circumstances, it is interesting that the Minister did not stress that, where a claim is not made, there would not be a charge.  I presume that would still be the case; that where a claim is not made the health board will not insist on claiming a charge for treating an injury.</P>
    <P>Under the last legislation, where there was a trivial injury, say, for instance, a head injury where a person had to be detained overnight for observation and came out the following morning with a bill for say £300, nobody would have told him that he did not have to claim and that in that case they would not have to pay the charge.  In that instance people who were worried about how they would pay the £300 would go to a solicitor for advice and a claim would be initiated. That involved a lot of expense to the insurance company which was passed on to those who paid insurance premiums. This put up the cost unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have tried to amend this legislation so that insurance companies would give, without admission of liability, a grant to the health boards to pay some of the cost of treating people injured in road accidents who, because of the triviality of the injuries, would not normally take out a claim.  What will happen as a result of this legislation is what has happened in the past.  People who receive a bill from the health board for hospitalisation will go to a solicitor and litigation will ensue, at great cost all round.  The Minister missed an opportunity to negotiate with the insurance companies to try to keep costs down.  I accept that the health boards lose over £4 million per annum as a result of the Supreme Court case but another way might have been found to resolve cases rather than the long tedious court procedure.</P>
    <P>In relation to injuries, the cost to the <Col N="930" /> State and to the health services and medical profession in time and money should have been looked at by the Minister when drawing up this legislation.  This is very important in times of recession and when there is a cutback in manpower.  In conjunction with the Minister for Justice the Minister should have considered the court procedure in relation to road accidents and compensation claims.  I will not go into whether or not a jury award or a judge award is appropriate.  That is a matter for another Department.  However, the Minister for Health should try to ensure that expensive consultants do not have to spend days at a time in the High Court.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is nothing in the legislation, or in the Minister's statement, to indicate his concern about the question of litigation and compensation involving the health services and consultants.  The involvement of consultants in court cases disrupts the normal administration of the health services. There should be another way of dealing with such cases.  It does not make a virtue out of the situation that it has been in operation since 1933.  That is a good reason why it should be considered to see if it still serves the interests of the people, or if a more practical or a simpler method can be devised to do justice to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>Another area which should assume major priority in the Department of Health is the question of the implication of so many accidents for the health services. We are all concerned with the human suffering caused to themselves and their families when individuals are injured or killed in road accidents.  In 1984, for example, 465 persons were killed on the roads and 8,210 persons were injured.  Of these 8,210, 1,000 suffered permanent disability.  The cost of those accidents as estimated by An Foras Forbartha in their report for 1984 is £220 million.</P>
    <P>The Minister must interest himself in this whole area of the prevention of accidents. I know other Departments are involved, but he must take a special interest <Col N="931" /> in it because of the impact and implications of these accidents for the health services generally.  You have only to look at any hospital at the moment and particularly the orthopaedic hospitals because bone injury is the commonest injury in road accidents.  In the orthopaedic hospitals, approximately one third of the beds are taken up by accident victims.  Consider the misery for those people, the suffering for their families, the cost to the health services, and the hidden factor in which the Minister for Health should take an interest, that is, the number of people on the waiting list for hip replacement surgery particularly in the orthopaedic units.  They are suffering pain and are on the waiting list for well over a year and, when their turn comes, their bed may be taken up by the victim of an accident.</P>
    <P>Many of these accidents could be prevented. One difficulty we have in legislation where a number of Departments are involved is that very often the legislation gets lost between the various Departments of State.  Because of the responsibility on the Minister for Health to ensure the best public health service for the people, he should initiate a programme of prevention of all accidents. This legislation deals exclusively with road accidents and, for that reason, we are confining ourselves to road accidents, but the Minister should initiate a programme to try to ensure that we will prevent as many of these accidents as possible.  He should initiate a comprehensive prevention plan involving all the Departments that should be involved.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education would have a major role to play here in that they cannot start too soon to teach young children about the dangers, the road code and how to avoid accidents.  The Department of the Environment have a major role to play and they have introduced some very good legislation, for example, the seat belt legislation.  There is no doubt that that has saved numerous lives and prevented serious injury in many cases. It is encouraging to find that 70 per cent of the people have been wearing their <Col N="932" /> seat belts over the past few years, but still we are not near the 90 per cent who wear seat belts in other European countries. The Department of Justice have a major role to play in implementing the laws and, as I have said, the number of persons wearing seat belts has increased.  The drunken driving legislation has been good, but it is disappointing that we are still allowing persons to drive cars with alcohol levels in excess of those in any other European country.  As long as we have the number of accidents we have and the number of persons injured, we must take the necessary measures to ensure that we will reduce accidents to the very lowest level possible.</P>
    <P>The loss to the Department of Social Welfare in terms of the social insurance fund through disability benefit for persons injured in road accidents is another area that the Minister should be concerned about, as the same Minister has responsibility for Health and Social Welfare. I am sure he is concerned about it but, if we could cut down on the number of persons who lose work as a result of injury, we would be making a major contribution to the people by preventing the accidents and also a major contribution to the social insurance fund by saving unnecessary drawings from it.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen this legislation embodying a legislative package including a number of areas where we could deal with the very serious problems that we have with 465 persons killed and 8,210 injured in 1984.  I am disappointed that the legislation is not more comprehensive and that a greater effort was not made to see if some solution could be found other than a very cumbersome method whereby the injured party must go to court to face long drawn out proceedings.  In his opening address the Minister of State recognised that the health board charge will not become due until the case is settled, which may take years and longer again if the treatment takes longer than that.</P>
    <P>On that point I ask the Minister if that means that a person who is awarded compensation must pay unforeseen health charges arising out of unforeseen <Col N="933" /> complications of the accident.  The Minister said that charges shall accrue on the date on which damages are paid or on the date on which the services are provided, whichever is the later.  If somebody is injured in an accident, the claim is settled in three years' time and the person is awarded compensation, and in five years' time he has to get treatment for some unforeseen complication of the accident, will he be obliged to pay for that out of the compensation?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister another question.  He stated in his press release on 2 July 1985 that the effect of the proposed legislation would be to restore the position which obtained prior to the Supreme Court judgment.  Is that the case?  Is the position restored to that which obtained prior to the Supreme Court judgment?  In other words, are voluntary hospitals affected by this legislation and, if so, how?  The legislation refers specifically to health boards.  In the Cooke case which was responsible for this legislation coming before the House, the damages were divided.  Some of them would be hospital expenses and others would be consultants.  Under the legislation will there be a charge for hospitals and consultants or just for hospitals? While we are not opposing the Bill, we are disappointed that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to take a radical look at what is necessary in 1985.  He should not have come into the House and given us the impression that the charges proposed were correct because the system has operated since 1933.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was introduced to take account of a decision of the Supreme Court which arose following a challenge by insurance companies.  It is worth recalling that in the debate on the relevant health service regulations in 1971 the then Minister, the late Erskine Childers, when asked about road traffic accidents, felt he had power in section 72 to permit health boards to charge as proposed in the Bill before us.  The problem arose because insurance companies took advantage of a loophole in the law.  They <Col N="934" /> welched on the people who paid them premiums.  Those who pay premiums to insurance companies should be able to rely upon them when they are faced with difficulties.  Insurance companies got away from their responsibilities and exploited the law.  They are engaged in a bizarre practice of preying on the taxpayer. I do not understand why they abuse the taxpayer and the person who pays the premium.  In this instance they sought to renege on their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The legislation before us is timely and insurance companies now have an opportunity to negotiate.  In my view insurance companies contribute to the delays; if they think they will get away with something they keep at it for as long as possible. For many years we have witnessed abuse of those paying the premiums and taxpayers who pay for institutions like health boards and hospitals.  Before the decision of the Supreme Court was announced health boards did not know where they stood in regard to road traffic accidents.  Irrespective of what Deputy O'Hanlon has said, the system being introduced has stood the test of time since 1933, although it may have operated on a slow, lazy and uncontrolled basis on occasions.  Other professions, such as the legal profession, take advantage of long delays and they are there to take advantage of road traffic accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's problem was in regard to charges.  He has now signalled that it is the intention of the State to levy negligent drivers for the cost of road traffic accidents.  The Minister has told us that it is currently estimated that the charges to be levied could provide income of up to £4 million per year.  That money should be used to improve facilities in our hospitals.  We all accept that the quality of service for those in need of orthopaedic treatment has improved enormously in recent years.  The orthopaedic hospital at Croom has three excellent orthopaedic surgeons and the success rate there is very high, although accommodation is limited.  The Mid-Western Health Board, who have had a shortfall in finance, have improved conditions at that hospital and it is hoped that by the middle of next year <Col N="935" /> they will have a second theatre in use.  A lot of people in my area with arthritic complaints must suffer because of the 30 per cent planned admission rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the planned admission rate is limited to 30 per cent, therefore the other 70 per cent must be for road traffic accidents.  I do not see why those who subscribe to the Mid-Western Health Board area either as taxpayers or through health board levies should suffer because insurance companies want to take advantage of a weakness in the law. Those companies have been paid a premium by their policy holders but they want to continue welching on their responsibilities.  I mentioned Croom hospital because the threatre capacity is limited there.  Had the Mid-Western Health Board been receiving £500,000 in charges prior to the Supreme Court case conditions there would have been improved and bed numbers increased.  We must remember that we are here to improve the quality of the service.  I have great admiration for those who work in Croom hospital and I am pleased to be able to report that, although all concerned work under terrible conditions, the success rate has been very high.</P>

I have great admiration for the Minister who has introduced this measure.  Deputy O'Hanlon put forward <Col N="936" /> some laudable proposals to improve on the provisions but in my view the Minister acted properly in bringing in a short Bill to deal with this problem.  I could say a lot more about insurance companies and road traffic accidents, but the Chair might rule that I was acting <i>ultra vires.</i> I commend the Minister on his alacrity in bringing this legislation before the House.</P>

I am very glad that the Bill is finally before us because in a press release on 2 July the Minister promised it to us and we are only getting it on 3 December.  We are all aware that the health boards have been awaiting this Bill anxiously for well over nine months in the hope that it would go some way towards correcting the underfunding being experienced by them, due to the failure of the Minister for Health and for the Minister for Finance to provide sufficient funds to run the services.

      <P>I shall come back to the Bill in deference to the Chair.  As a result <Col N="937" /> of the Supreme Court decision of Walsh v. Cooke in December 1983, health boards have since then not been in a position to charge for inpatient and out-patient services in respect of certain injuries caused by mechanically propelled vehicles.  As a result these boards have found themselves in a serious situation because of the loss of additional revenue.  This amounts to quite a sizeable sum.  The Minister of State earlier referred to a sum in the region of £4 million per year.  In the South Eastern Health Board a loss has been experienced in the region of £200,000 in 1984 and the projected loss for 1985 will be in excess of that figure.  This is a very significant sum when one considers the present under funding of the health boards.</P>
      <P>The Midland Health Board will have suffered the loss of something in excess of £150,000 each year for the past two years and the other health boards have experienced comparable losses over that time.  Everybody on this side of the House considered that this was a very urgent Bill and should have got priority over a number of the issues that have been presented.  When I see the nonsense that has gone on on occasions, when Bills of this nature are being postponed, I wonder what role this House has to play in the day to day running of the country.  The Bill deals with the issue of charges and their recovery only.  It entitles health boards to charge for inpatient and out-patient services in respect of certain injuries caused by mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that we on this side of the House will not oppose this measure. However, I do feel, like Deputy O'Hanlon, that a great opportunity was missed by the Minister and his Department in dealing with this issue.  The whole situation of road traffic accidents and insurance claims could have been rationalised here to the benefit of the health boards, the insured and the insurance companies.  The definition of inpatient and outpatient services is that assigned to them by sections 51 and 56 of the Health Act of 1970.  This means that the cost of vocational assessment and training <Col N="938" /> is neither chargeable nor recoverable. It can be argued that a person injured in a road traffic accident here has an incentive not to avail fully of rehabilitation services, which we all agree are among the best in the world.  The greater the recovery from an accident, the less the injured party will receive by way of compensation.  There is an argument, therefore, for deferring calculations of compensation until the injured party has availed himself or herself fully of whatever rehabilitation programme has been recommended following medical and vocational assessment.</P>
    <P>It would be of financial benefit to motor insurers to fund a rehabilitation programme in the case of road traffic accidents. A health board may charge in respect of services which are being, have been, or will be provided.  The trouble with the latter is that they can only be estimated.  Will the recipient be required to pass to his health board whatever moneys he is awarded to cover the services that he will require in the future to treat his injuries?  This is a matter which has not been clarified in the Bill.  If that is to be the case, what will become of this money if the anticipated need does not materialise or, God forbid, the individual dies without being able to avail of the services to the value of the compensation awarded?  Will the health board be entitled to be heard in court and involved in out of court settlements?  If not, what redress will be open to them where a claimant has understated his or her claim with regard to medical expenses?</P>
    <P>The Bill provides only that a health board can make a charge.  In the case of patients being treated in public voluntary hospitals, will these hospitals be obliged to notify, and supply the necessary information to, health boards to facilitate the making of a charge?  Public voluntary hospitals are not referred to in the Bill, which is a glaring omission.  Will a claim fall to be made by the health board in whose area the patient is being treated, or that in whose area the patient normally resides? There is confusion on this.  Will the income received by health boards in respect of patients treated in public voluntary <Col N="939" /> hospitals be retained by the health boards or collected by them on behalf of the hospitals concerned?  I do not know. Will consultants be entitled to charge a patient whose income at the time of receiving the injury did not leave him or her liable to pay consultants' fees for ordinary hospital treatment?  There is no reference to that in the Bill.  Is it intended that these charges will be included in the health boards' claims and paid by the health boards to the consultants?</P>
    <P>An alternative and more administratively convenient method of financing medical and vocational rehabilitation costs in respect of road traffic accidents would be to require motor insurers to pay a percentage of their premium income to the health boards.  The percentage figure could be determined periodically by the Government.  The advantage to insurers would be that they would no longer have to reserve funds to make provision for future claims under this heading, by having available to them a known fixed provision.  The insurance principle of spreading the cost and risk would be adhered to also in this matter.</P>

      <P>While the Bill before us today is purely to allow the health boards to levy charges for admissions due to road traffic accidents, it is salutary perhaps to dwell on the present situation with relation to the health boards, if only with a passing reference.  We are now at a stage where there are 162 admissions per thousand head of the population.  That has increased over the years from 106 to 125, to 162 in the last ten years.  Despite ever-increasing amounts being spent on our medical services we are not improving the rate of admissions to our hospitals generally.  The percentage of these statistics that deals particularly with road traffic accidents is not really at issue. What is at issue is that, despite huge, increasing demands by the health boards, demands which have to be met by the taxpayer and the Government, we are not seeing any returns in terms of a better service.  Where the blame should be laid, <Col N="940" /> what questions should be asked or who should answer them, we cannot go into today.  I appreciate that fully.  But we must keep that paramount in any discussion. We must ask, do we need eight health boards?  Could the health boards become districts as in England and could one health board run the whole lot? These are questions that will have to be answered on another occasion.  But we must bear them in mind in any Second Stage debate in relation to the health boards generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined clearly and briefly the exact contents of the Bill before us.  The pertinent point is that the Exchequer should not be called upon to bear the costs of negligent drivers.  The Minister also underlines that no hardship will be caused by the implementation of this amending Bill.  We can rest assured that this will be the case because all our health boards have always exercised sufficient discretion in trying to extract moneys for services rendered.  Indeed perhaps they have not been sufficiently successful in this regard in various ways because they have borne in mind hardship or potential hardship in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When talking about road traffic accidents the critical position of non-consultant hospital doctors comes to mind particularly.  I might refer to the South Eastern Health Board which, by virtue of the fact that I come from that area, I know a little more about than other areas. We all know the general story of casualties when people are admitted to hospitals, the difficulty that is experienced, how this particular group of doctors are expected to work long hours and, in their opinion, are not adequately remunerated for the work they do.  Certainly if one is to draw a comparison between them and other medical people in the health boards, they have a case.  But more particularly, what can we do to increase the numbers to look after admissions from road traffic accidents and others who come into our hospitals?  This is an area that perhaps we should address immediately &mdash; I do not know how long this can wait &mdash; because no matter what a health <Col N="941" /> board can levy on charges for treating road traffic accident cases, if they have not the manpower and the back up staff to treat these cases adequately, they are not really fit to charge for the service.  I might expand somewhat on that particular point.  In the South Eastern Health Board area we have the lowest ratio of non-consultant hospital doctors.  That is appalling when one considers that we have the highest dependency ratio of any health board, the dependency categories comprising those aged under 14 and over 65, the two groups who demand most of our health services and health care generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  With the highest dependency ratio and the lowest ratio of non-consultant hospital doctors in the country relative to our consultants, what sort of service is the South Eastern Health Board fit to give these accident cases?  We may well charge for them, and rightly so, particularly those who can afford to pay.  But I ask: what sort of service will these people get?  We must address this question immediately as it is one of urgent importance in many areas, particularly in the South Eastern Health Board area where little account is taken of the population structure when we talk about charges generally for the health board and their services.  Indeed, when one considers allocations given we must be reasonable and remember that, whereas the real rates of payment to the health boards have decreased over the last few years, the actual moneys they receive have increased.  That fact is usually lost in discussing health board charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please believe me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am back to the Bill.  Nobody in the House could but accept the Bill before us today.  The Minister has closed a loophole brought to light during the Supreme Court case in late 1983 in the Cooke versus Walsh litigation. The question of actually levying charges against any accident case cannot be doubted or debated at all.  The whole question of the health boards, their handling of it, the number of radiologists, the number of orthopaedic consultants in the various hospitals, the staffing of our out-patients and casualty departments all come within this area of road traffic accidents. I do think passing reference is indeed in order.  When we are talking about charging people for a service we should be sure we are in a position to give that service to the people when they reach our hospitals.  It is in that context that I am making passing references to some of the facts and statistics that face us today on this issue.</P>
      <P>Certainly since the last full year in which the South Eastern Health Board were in a position to levy charges for road traffic accidents, we will now be in the position that in the next full year &mdash; which would be 1986 &mdash; £200,000 should become available to the South Eastern Health Board as a result of the provisions of this Bill.  This would compare with approximately £153,000 which was gathered by the health board in 1983 prior to the legislation.  That £200,000 in itself could constitute a tremendous input to the services of all casualty patients, particularly road traffic accident cases.</P>
      <P>The south east, having almost the lowest number of consultants per 100,000 of the population, also has the lowest ratio of non-consultant hospital doctors in the country to the number of consultants. Therefore, with the highest dependency ratio in the country, the South Eastern Health Board deserve particular attention in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appreciating the Minister's need to maintain strict control in the public sector <Col N="943" /> and on pay in the public sector, I would urge him to find a formula whereby proportionately the population can be treated equally in relation to the capital allocations to the health boards, that those health boards with a high dependency ratio will get their fair share&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief and I hope, to the point.  I do not support this Bill for the simple reason that I consider it anomalous to introduce a situation in which a person, because they have been injured in a car accident, is then billed for a service which, had they entered hospital because they were suffering from pneumonia, appendicitis or any other ailment, they would have received free of charge.  Except in certain circumstances, when people are obliged to pay for consultants, anaesthetists and so on, they are entitled to enter public hospitals free of charge and to receive care there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill re-establishes the position that obtained up to two years ago when people entering hospital as a result of car accidents, were obliged to pay for the care and service they received.  It is my belief that we should not attempt to differentiate between one person and another entering hospital simply on the basis of the type of illness from which they are suffering.  In fact we should be moving in the opposite direction.  We should be extending the availability and range of hospital services free to our citizens. It is quite conceivable that the Minister could have made up the shortfall which arose because of the court case of two years ago by levying a fee on the motor manufacturers or motor sales organisations, such as Fords, Toyota and others who manufacture cars and sell them to the Irish public.  As was suggested by Deputy Ormonde, they could have imposed a fixed levy on insurance <Col N="944" /> companies.  I do not consider the making of a particular regulation concerning people who enter hospital as being a correct or adequate response to the costs arising from road traffic accidents.  That is not to say that the cost of road traffic accidents in terms of hospital care and other services is not too high.  Steps must be taken to reduce these costs.  An improvement in the condition of our roads would have a significant effect on the number of accidents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the condition of drivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to refer to the fact that the condition in which we allow many people to drive cars is a disgrace.  The laws concerning drunken driving are not enforced strictly enough. The proficiency of some drivers also leaves a lot to be desired.  It is totally insufficient and unsatisfactory to have a test for persons aged 17 or 18 in order to determine whether they should receive a licence while they are never obliged afterwards to do another test.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a Bill which will ultimately have the effect of hardening the trend of spiralling insurance costs is not a solution to the problem which the Minister faces in funding the health services. The people who are to be asked to pay as a result of traffic accidents are those least culpable in the misfortune which they have met.  It is clearly stated in the Bill that, where a person has some liability in the accident and compensation is consequently reduced, he or she will not be required to pay for hospital services. There is a double discrimination against the person who is innocently involved in an accident while walking, cycling or driving.  That person will have to bear the full cost of the hospital services provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the fundamental reason that I oppose this Bill.  It is a totally inadequate response to the funding of our health services and to the whole question of traffic accidents and the results of same. It is also totally unfair that people who have no culpability in an accident in <Col N="945" /> which they are involved will be obliged to pay the full cost.  In the normal course of events these will be people who have paid their health contributions and will presumably be in a hospital bed beside a person who will have the service free because he or she was not involved in an accident.</P>
    <P>I oppose the Bill.  It is a mistake and the Minister should have exercised a bit more imagination before introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on the basis that it merely returns to the position that obtained prior to litigation.  It gives the health boards an opportunity at least to get cover for their involvement in cases where very considerable claims are made following accidents.  It would be only natural to assume that in such cases the health boards and hospitals concerned, having been called upon to provide a very important service, should get some kind of remuneration.  For that reason this legislation is progressive.  A point I would make is that the victim in an accident case could be confined to hospital for a considerable time and perhaps a greater proportion of the compensation than anticipated in this Bill could be utilised by the hospital service.  I wonder if this might lead to an increase in insurance premiums to cover this eventuality.  The citizen might get off a little bit lighter on the one hand, but might be penalised on the other hand.  In some cases the citizen could be penalised on both counts if he incurred hospital charges in respect of the accident and also had to pay higher insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>It can be a little distressing for people involved in an accident to find the attendant problem of a bill hanging over their heads.  Very often such people can be the victims of tragic circumstances.  This charge could be a considerable problem for people in unfortunate circumstances. It undoubtedly improves the situation for the health boards and returns to what was the <i>status quo.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charge payable is not specified <Col N="946" /> but would normally be the average daily cost per bed day of the hospital concerned.  This will vary depending on the hospital involved.</P>
    <P>It would be better to have a set fee. This point should have been more firmly nailed down because it enables health boards to reintroduce charges for hospital services and I cannot understand why the charge could not be specified.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to enable charges to be made by health boards for hospital inpatient and out-patient services on persons in respect of treatment of injuries received in road traffic accidents when the injury is caused by the negligent use of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place....</P>
    <P>That could have some interesting connotations at a later stage.  I am not legally minded but I know that some of my colleagues will have something to say about it.  There could be contention as to whether a vehicle was used in a negligent fashion.  One has to presume that only the courts can decide whether the vehicle was used in a negligent fashion.  Perhaps it could be determined by the degree of liability accepted on behalf of one or either party by an insurance company. I should like this point clarified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like to give a specific instance and ask how this amending legislation would affect it.  A person driving his father's car &mdash; this happened &mdash; was crashed into by a stolen car.  The innocent driver was in hospital for more than six months, his car was wrecked and he was off work for almost nine months.  He did not receive any compensation.  The driver of the stolen car absconded and the insurance on the vehicle did not cover the accident.  The insurance on the car driven by the victim did not cover it either and no State, semi-State or other organisation accepted liability in that case.  How will this legislation affect this individual having regard to the fact that he was a <Col N="947" /> long time in hospital and suffered considerably as a result of his injuries?  To this day he has not received compensation from any quarter.  Indeed, this person's case might be exacerbated by this legislation.  Obviously claims will be made and the insurance companies should at least assist the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The most remarkable thing about this Bill has been the delay in producing it which will cost the taxpayer about £10 million.  In December 1983, as the Minister pointed out, the Supreme Court, in the case of Cooke v. Walsh, decided among other things that hospital and medical fees incurred by a person in a road accident could not be recovered against the negligent driver who caused the accident because the injured party was entitled to these hospital services free under the Health Acts.  Of course &ldquo;free&rdquo; is the wrong word to use.  Nothing is free whether it is the abolition of rates, car tax, hospital charges or whatever.  All these services have to be paid for.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Supreme Court decision in 1983 was that these hospital charges were paid for out of public funds, in other words by the taxpayers, rather than by the person obviously responsible, the negligent driver of the motor car which caused the accident.  The suggestion that these hospital charges should be paid for by the taxpayer, rather than by the negligent car driver, is just not tenable. There are many thousands of taxpayers who do not own a motor car and clearly there is no reason why they should have to contribute, through their taxes, to provide hospital services which are needed as a result of negligent drivers. There is no reason to expect people who cannot afford cars to pay for expensive hospital services caused by negligent and dangerous driving of motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people may think that the amounts involved here are trifling.  They are not.  I recall raising a question with the Minister for Health on this subject quite a long time ago and I was told, as far as I can remember, that the cost of providing these hospital services up to <Col N="948" /> that time as a result of the Cooke v. Walsh decision was about £5 million.  It could well have doubled by now and that is why I asked about the unaccounted for delay in bringing this Bill forward.  It is a very short simple Bill running only to four sections on two pages.  Surely when economies are sought it should have been possible to have produced the Bill within a week or two after the decision in Cooke v. Walsh and to have had it passed through both Houses as an emergency measure within a couple of weeks after that.  If this had been done, there would have been a saving of millions of pounds to the taxpayer.  We are entitled to an explanation of the inordinate delay in introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the Bill which I find strange and which also requires an explanation.  The Bill confines itself to providing for charges by the health boards for hospital services for injuries arising out of road traffic accidents only.  There are other accidents, also caused by negligence, namely, industrial accidents caused to workers in the course of their employment in factories, warehouses and so on.  Many of these accidents unfortunately involved serious injuries to workers and long and expensive hospital and medical treatment.  If such an accident is found to be due to the negligence of an employer in failing to provide a safe system of work, the question follows as to whether the hospital costs, which in cases of serious injury could involve, even in a single case, many thousands of pounds, should be borne by taxpayers generally or by the employer whose negligence was responsible for the accident.</P>
    <P>The negligent employer should be liable rather than taxpayers generally and their insurers no doubt pitch their premiums at a figure that takes account of this potential liability and are permitted to do so by the National Prices Commission who control these matters.  Yet, for some reason which for the life of me I cannot understand, the Bill only allows health boards to recover hospital costs for road accidents.  This has the effect of putting industrial accidents into a different <Col N="949" /> category for which I can see no basis. Both categories involve accidents resulting from the negligence of one party against another.</P>
    <P>The Bill confines a health boards's right to make a charge for hospital services, either inpatient or outpatient.  The health boards are not given liberty in the Bill to make a charge for the services of doctors, registrars, consultants and so on who are employed by the health boards at great public expense.  It would seem to be a logical provision to say that, if the hospital boards may charge for hospital services, they should also charge for the medical services provided to persons injured in accidents so that these heavy costs will fall on the parties responsible for the accidents, road or industrial, and not on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that perhaps higher insurance premiums would be involved if that were done but, if one wanted to avoid this, one could say that the taxpayer would pay the full compensation for anybody injured in an accident and have no insurance premiums. Insurance companies pitch their premiums to take account of hospital and medical charges and it is appropriate that they should pick up the tab for the damages awarded to an injured person.</P>
    <P>I can foresee some difficulty in the administration of this Bill, particularly with regard to the provisions dealing with contributory negligence.  Many cases are settled on the basis of a reduced amount of damages by reason of the contributory negligence of one party but this is not always specified.  I can foresee that in many cases there will be difficulty in fixing the proportion of the hospital charges to be paid by an injured party to the health board.  In some cases, to contributory negligence, an injured party may obtain only one-half or one-quarter of the damages to which he would otherwise be entitled.  In such cases the intent of the Bill, as I read it, is that they would pay only the same proportion of hospital costs.  However, the Bill deals with the matter by giving a discretion to the health board to reduce the hospital account in any such case.  This should be more in the <Col N="950" /> way of an obligation on the health board, rather than leaving it to the discretion of the board.  I ask the Minister to consider some amendment to deal with this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa said he would oppose the Bill and I must confess I heard him say that with some degree of mystification. I can only conclude he has not followed the purport of the Bill, because to oppose it will have the effect of leaving the liability for these hospital charges with taxpayers generally, many of whom do not own cars, rather than putting the responsibility where it lies, namely, on the person who drove a car in a dangerous or negligent way and caused serious injury to another.  If there is any fault to be found with the Bill it is that it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>Within those constraints, I welcome the Bill.  As I did at the beginning, I express surprise it has taken two years, at a cost of approximately £5 million per year of taxpayers' money, to bring this measure forward.  That requires an explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Taylor with regard to the length of time it took to introduce this measure.  I understand quite well the point made by the Deputy regarding the cost which must be met by the citizens.  Another speaker mentioned that the existing services were not adequate to meet all the demands made on them.  I can talk only of the regional hospital in my area that has to deal with many accident cases.  These accidents cause a considerable amount of disruption and confusion, particularly at night time when doctors and nurses have to be called in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad we are getting to the point where people will have to account for and pay for their mistakes.  All of us make mistakes and this happens to drivers of cars.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Taylor that it is unfair to ask taxpayers, many of whom do not own cars, to meet the costs.  Very often people have to stay in hospital for a long while after an accident and in many cases <Col N="951" /> the person responsible for the accident could afford to make a contribution towards the costs involved.</P>
    <P>I am rather worried that the Bill deals only with mechanically propelled vehicles.  What is the position in the case of an assault on a person?  If a person who qualifies for free hospitalisation has to spend three or four months in hospital, if he takes an action on his release from hospital and gets a large sum of money, will he or the person responsible for the assault be obliged to pay?  I do not think that is provided for in this measure but I should like it to be included.  Our health services can use all the money that is available.  In my area we were confined to a limited amount of money but there is an improvement at the moment. Nevertheless, we can always use more funds.  I welcome the legislation and I hope that the Minister in his reply will clarify the position with regard to cases of assault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is welcome, but it is long overdue.  The health boards were faced with a serious situation following the Cooke v. Walsh case two years ago.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Taylor, namely, that this was a minor Bill but one that took a long time to come before the House.</P>
      <P>Road accidents have serious implications for all the people involved.  In my area we have an orthopaedic hospital that has a long waiting list.  Some people have to wait up to five years for hip replacement operations.  Those delays are due entirely to the amount of orthopaedic work that must be undertaken as a result of road accidents.  The Minister should have taken acount of this burden on hospital services when he was considering this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Insurance companies have got off fairly lightly in the past few years.  Section 2 provides that a health board may charge for hospital services provided for a person injured in a road accident and it also provides that the board may waive the whole or part of a charge under certain circumstances.  That is an important consideration <Col N="952" /> because we do not wish that hardship be imposed on any person.  The ratepayers should not have to carry the liability for the insurance companies, as has been the case in the past few years. It is essential that the people who benefit from insurance premiums should pay the costs involved.  I should have preferred the Minister in drafting this legislation to have looked at the whole situation, with particular regard being taken of the health services, of those maimed in road accidents and of the economic situation. This reduces our budget for hospital services but the reduction is not easy to arrive at.  We are examining the geriatric, psychiatric and general hospitals and better community care facilities.  Accident cases have been imposing a heavy burden on the health services and this Bill was long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak until I heard some of the contributions and the naivety of the points of view expressed.  If people believe that these charges will be passed to the insurance companies, they are making a serious mistake.  I have no doubt that the insurance companies will not pay, that the hard-pressed, under-privileged and deprived people will be the major victims.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at how quickly the establishment, in the name of the insurance companies, can get this House to act when they want something done.  It is unbelievable, when one thinks of the battles we have to engage in to get civil liberties and easement for hard-pressed people who are under-privileged, suffering from lack of educational opportunities and careers, how the establishment can come in here and with a wave of a wand within a few weeks can get legislation through the House to ease any pressure on the insurance companies so that they can make more profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second time in a short period that this has happened.  The other is the promise to remove civil juries, which will mean that again the winners will be the insurance companies.  Apparently, the 12 men and women, good and true, cannot <Col N="953" /> be trusted to make awards to people badly injured in car accidents.  The awards they are making, only in the eyes of insurance companies, are far too high. The guise in which they suggested such legislation is that it would reduce premiums. Now that the legislation has been promised, the companies say it will not affect premiums, that they will remain the same.  We have peers of the establishment, namely judges, who are better trusted to make sure that under-privileged people will not get too much money, perhaps because they might not know how to spend it, or because they are not entitled to it because of the standards of living they have been accustomed to.  Therefore, smaller amounts of compensation will suffice in the future.</P>

      <P>These points are not in order in this debate.  References to the jury system are not in order because the scope of the debate is very limited.  It is a question of whether health boards can charge for services rendered and maintenance provided for people injured in road traffic accidents.  That is the only issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That was by way of preamble&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing will happen through this measure.  I ask the Minister to think very carefully when he introduces this Bill in this form.  He should consider the consequences.  One of the points I want to make is on the suggestion that hospital charges are too high, that the insurance companies are getting off scot free and that the charges are falling back on the taxpayer.  The hospital infrastructure is there.  We have basic overheads which will not change regardless of who foots these bills.  The buildings and the staff and the beds are there and if they stay unused the charges will still be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because people are not able to look <Col N="954" /> after themselves through lack of education or other circumstances, they are given awards but they are not fit to judge whether the awards truly compensate them.  When hospital charges are deducted from such awards they eat into the compensation and people are likely to end up with very little and may have to carry bad injuries for the rest of their lives.  Perhaps their lives are shortened or they may not be able to work but will not have enough money left to enjoy the standards of living they had before the accidents.</P>
    <P>A person may have been on disability benefit before the accident.  Then an award is made, and the disability benefit paid in the interval between the accident and the payment of compensation is removed totally because of the award. Such unfortunate people are told that when they use up the compensation, which does not take very long, and they are impoverished again, they can reapply for disability benefit.  They are told: &ldquo;We will allow you to keep the money you were awarded, which was to do you for the rest of your life because of disability caused by the accident.  You must use that money first, and then we will consider giving you disability payments.&rdquo; That is unfair.</P>
    <P>Most insurance claims for accidents are sorted out out of court.  Settlements are made because people cannot afford to take on the insurance companies.  Settlements are made which do not allow, for example, persons to make claims for medical or hospital expenses in the future.  The insurance companies offer the money now with the stipulation that they will not pay for future medical or hospital expenses.  Does the patient, in such circumstances, have to come up with the money himself?  Insurance companies have the power and the means to force people to accept settlements out of court. They can drag the cases out for four or five years, with the help of our system, and people are waiting five, six or seven years for settlements.</P>
    <P>What happens in the case of a quadriplegic, a person who is paralysed from the neck down following serious injuries? <Col N="955" /> Such a patient may have to lie on his back for 20 or 30 years.  We here decide to remove the jury system because such a person is awarded £200,000.  Awards of £200,000 or £250,000 or even £300,000 are based mainly on the need for care and attention because of terrible injuries. I do not know whether it is known here, but the maximum amount payable to a quadriplegic is £100,000, comparatively a tiny amount of money.  If the award is greater than that, say, £100,000 or £150,000 more, it will be in the nature of special damages for care and attention. It is an outrage and a scandal that people should complain about the high awards granted to those unfortunate people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very serious about this.  I have had the experience of having a father-in-law who for five years was a quadriplegic as a result of a road accident, so I know what I am talking about.  I have undertaken a lot of research in the area of injuries.  There is no service anywhere in the country provided free for quadriplegics. I am aware of the suffering of those people and I know from my experience of courts that there is a great lack of understanding in regard to the awards made.  Very often those who regard awards granted to road accident victims as being huge do not realise that the award is made up of a special damage award and a general damage award, the general damages being the award for the injury and the special damages being for care and protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are providing here will rebound on the shoulders of the unfortunate victims.  By this legislation we are not letting the taxpayer off the hook in any way.  The insurance companies will be well able to adjust their figures in such a way that the victim will be the one disadvantaged.  I am trying to save the Minister the embarrassment of having to take court action against these unfortunate victims.  Spread over a number of years, the amounts of the awards do not compensate for injuries, because very often these people become very sick as a result of the accidents they have suffered. Deputy O'Hanlon may be able to support me on this when he is contributing to the Committee Stage debate.  While a person may suffer only a broken leg, he may become a sick person later because of the accident.  Deals are done in most cases in the courts by the insurance companies, but when agreement is reached the accident victim must sign to that effect that he will not qualify for any future payment. That means that, as happens frequently, if the victim must be hospitalised later in life because of the effects of his accident, he cannot claim any more <Col N="957" /> money from the insurance company. What we are providing here is that if in such cases the accident victims have any money left from the award the health boards will be in a position to seek moneys from them.  Why should we be doing what is the job of the insurance company?  Why should we be providing for the health boards to chase the unfortunate victims for money?  I am not sure that the Minister is providing the answer in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I understood it to be the intention of the Minister and of the caring parties who make up this Government to provide the best possible service for the people.  In the past few days I have heard the suggestion that there should be a free GP care service, with the doctors being paid a salary. This Bill is not in the spirit of any such suggestion.  Neither is it a move in the direction to provide free hospital care.  A former leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Brendan Corish, put forward the suggestion a long time ago that free hospital care be provided for everyone.  What we are doing here is a retrograde step.  The only people who will benefit from the provision will be the insurance companies, who do not have to take into consideration the profits they make from their property portfolios or other areas of business in order to seek an increase in car insurance premiums.  They can isolate motor insurance and, in the event of that area not showing a profit, they continue increasing the premiums.  I am as opposed to this provision to the same extent as I am opposed, and opposed irrefutably, to the removal of juries in civil cases.</P>
    <P>In many of these accident cases the people concerned are not clever enough or well off enough to have separate insurance cover that would help them in these sorts of cases.  We are somewhat naive in moving in this direction quickly in the belief that what we are doing will help reduce the bill for the health services. For the past ten or 15 years it has been my understanding that our intention was to provide a first class hospital service. It must be said that we have a very <Col N="958" /> good hospital service and also an excellent service from the medical profession. As I have said before, that profession shame the legal profession in terms of the reasonable fees charged compared with the astronomical fees charged by the legal profession.  A highly qualified medical person is prepared to attend at a person's home day or night at a very reasonable charge while no service from a solicitor would be provided for less then a few hundred pounds.  That profession failed to respond to the invitation issued to them to help us in another area of legislation. The medical profession, too, will be winners in terms of what we are doing now.  We are helping this wealthy, privileged and elitist profession to extract huge fees, but at the end of the day the unfortunate accident victim is the one who will be paying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if that is the case but I am trying to remain within the ambit of the Bill.  I consider that the proposal that the health boards charge accident victims gives rise to the points I am making because the victim will be the one to be at a loss.  Compensation will be shared in such a way that both the insurance companies and the lawyers will be paid but the victim will have to pay the medical services that have been provided by all his willing and co-operative fellow citizens in the past decades.  He will not be in a position now to avail of his rightful share of those facilities.  Those facilities are there for him and he is entitled to them.  I do not think we should help the insurance company in this way because they are the people who will avoid this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to put sections into this Bill which will guarantee that the insurance company cannot compel a patient to accept an award which will not fully compensate him for his injury.  Let the Minister put into this legislation the true rate of compensation and not allow the <Col N="959" /> insurance company to play with the lives of the disadvantaged in our community. What is the state of mind of a person who has been involved in an accident, who has a plate in his head or has had serious operations?  How can he defend himself?</P>
    <P>We must try to help him.  I do not believe he is being protected in this legislation and much more work will have to be done on Committee Stage.  I beg the Chair's pardon for raising this matter in this way but, as I always say when short Bills are introduced, it terrifies me to see short Bills going through the House because very often their results can be very damaging.  Only last week a two page Bill &mdash; £300 million &mdash; went through this House and I had the same difficulty in trying to get my point across.</P>
    <P>I want to bring this to the Minister's attention because it is of the utmost seriousness.  Deputies have welcomed this Bill because they believe it will do a lot of good, especially for the hard pressed hospital boards, but I beg them to think again.  Admittedly their intentions may be well meaning but I do not think they have seen the danger, although Deputy De Rossa has and I agree with him.  The people this legislation is meant to help will be victimised by it instead.</P>
    <P>Why does the establishment always win, and win so easily?  The individual may be used as a guinea pig in drug tests and if he meets with an accident he will suffer the indignity of a wrangle about money.  If he is a member of a family who are hard pressed, and they have to look after him while he is sick, he can unwittingly be putting extra pressure on his family.  The monetary compensation award will be mitigated as a result, and we are helping that process.  If the person involved is a child, it is even more tragic because a child does not want to inflict hardship on his or her parents.  If the person involved is an adult, he will be humiliated.  Has anybody in this House, other than Deputy O'Hanlon, witnessed such cases?</P>

      <P>According to the Explanatory <Col N="961" /> Memorandum the purpose of the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1985, is to enable health boards to make a charge for inpatient or outpatient hospital services on a person who received, or is entitled to receive, damages or compensation for injury caused in a road traffic accident. The example I was giving related to a person involved in a road traffic accident. If the health board are entitled to make a charge for inpatient or outpatient services and as a result that causes hardship on the victim's family, be he a child or an adult, the health board are helping to increase the financial hardship suffered by that family.  I submit that that is very relevant.  If the person involved is a child, he is an innocent victim but if the person involved is an adult and as a result of his injuries is a quadriplegic, he will be lying in a bed able to move only his head, although he is <i>compos mentis</i> and he will have to suffer the humiliation of being looked after by his family, knowing they will not get adequate compensation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will and I want the Minister also to consider them.  I am trying to point out the immeasurable hardship that will result if this point is not cleared up. It is the Minister's good intention that health boards should not put extra pressure or burdens on another taxpayer, because the policy of the health boards and the hospital services is to help as many people as possible.  But there is a danger that we are going down the wrong road with this legislation because the people who will come out at the wrong end will be road accident victims, and the charges will come from the compensation paid and that compensation will not necessarily be adequate to cover the person's injuries.</P>
      <P>That is my main point.  In the case of the compensation not being adequate the victim is pauperised and if he gets disability benefit he will depend on a pittance to survive.  He will be humiliated and his dignity will be destroyed.  In many cases his standards of living will be destroyed as will that of his wife and family.  On that basis this Bill is not properly thought out.  It will have the opposite effect to that which is intended.  I am highlighting this for the benefit of other Members.  If compensation is to be paid it should be a separate payment by those who have to pay the compensation, and not by the victim.  It should not be taken out of the award to the individual.  There should not be a restriction on future claims.  Has the Minister considered this? If it turns out to be impossible to put that stipulation in, hardship will occur and the Bill will not work out as intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill any sum due to a health board by a person is recoverable by the health board from the person as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Does the Minister really want to be involved in the health boards suing people for payment of compensation?  All of us who hold clinics know of people in that situation, except that they cannot be sued.  They are constantly begging the Minister and his officials for disability benefits or supplementary benefits because they cannot afford to live.  The Minister's Department <Col N="963" /> are asking these people to pay from the compensation they get, and when it is used up they can come back to the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered that?  This will put more pressure on people who have injuries or who become sick as a result of injuries.  The health boards can now sue them.  What happens to the people who pay the compensation? They are free.  They are not being sued.  I am asking the Minister to take into consideration the state of mind of the person who is suffering injury and paid who will end up in this situation just to save the health boards a few bob.  The Minister is doing a fantastic job and has made a lot of progress, but he should look at areas other than this one to effect savings.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (2) says:</P>
      <P>Without prejudice in Part III of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, a cause of action against a person in respect of a charge under section 2 (1) of this Act shall be deemed to accrue on the date on which damages or compensation are paid by the person liable to pay such damages or compensation or on the date on which the services to which the charge relates are provided, whichever is the later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is frequently the case that when a settlement is made it is a full and final settlement which does not allow a victim to make a claim at a future date for medical or other expenses.  Perhaps Deputy Andrews would enlighten me from his experience as to the percentage of accident cases settled out of court.  I am sure it is a very high proportion.  If a person who is half dead agrees to a settlement, <Col N="964" /> he has no comeback.  We meet these types of people at our clinics and they have no recourse except to apply for disability benefit or supplementary welfare benefit &mdash; they can get no other monetary satisfaction.  The Minister is saying that these people will have to pay and under section 3 (2) of the Bill we can sue them. Does the Minister really want to get into that area?

      <P>I am trying to put the case for the disadvantaged individual.  Over 70 per cent of my constituents are disadvantaged, so I am not unfamiliar with the problems.  I am alerting the Minister to this because I know he would not dream of inflicting hardship and that he would amend this legislation if he thought that as a result of this measure hardship would be created for people.</P>
      <P>There is another point in relation to car owners.  Perhaps the well-heeled car owner is separately insured.  People are inclined to take the awards granted at a given date and think of the value one would get if it were spent immediately without bearing in mind that it has often to compensate a victim for the rest of his life, or it may have to provide extra facilities, extra nursing, extra home care and so on.  There is tremendous pressure on that victim to spend some of that money.  He would not be human if he did not offer to do so by helping out his poor family, because he is not used to having such an enormous amount of money, and that means that he is short changed from the beginning.  If a settlement is made and the Minister can sue him on the charge by the health board, then probably he will be in no position to pay.  We should not come down heavily on those whom we have been trying to help over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> Finally, a sad note to end on.  The insurance companies are in business, very big business.  They are not worried about minions.  When insurance companies are involved in claims, in order to try to mitigate the amount they have to pay they are not above dragging out a claim for as long as possible, and those involved, even on the periphery, often in a case of serious injury, will wait to see if the person will die.  That can go on for years.  A person might have only a short time, a year or two, to live after a serious accident and the insurance company will, without any qualms, try to drag out that claim beyond that time so that the person will die and, as a result, they will have to pay no or very little compensation.  They are the people who will benefit from a Bill such as this.  It makes one think very carefully before one would bring in a Bill such as this or would dare to tamper with the civil jury system.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Carey for his complimentary remarks, Deputies, Ormonde, Avril Doyle, De Rossa, Durkan, Taylor, O'Brien, Leonard and, last but by no means least, Deputy Skelly, who indicated that he may try to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  He is quite welcome to make an attempt anyway. Perhaps, if he puts down amendments in relation to compensation, on which he made very strong points, the Minister may find some way to accommodate them, although I must point out that they have nothing to do with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All others supported the Bill wholeheartedly, with an odd reservation here and there, except Deputy De Rossa, who opposed it totally.  As a man who represents The Workers' Party, I cannot understand his stance.  This Bill is putting the responsiblility back on insurance companies to pay for the medication and so forth of people involved in road traffic accidents on the responsibility of the <Col N="966" /> driver of the mechanically propelled vehicle.  If it is left as it has been for the last two years, it is the responsibility of all the people and I presume that The Workers' Party, by virtue of their name and the category of people from whom they look for support, would be less inclined to own MPVs than other sections of the community.  Therefore, if they are opposing this Bill they are saying that they want the community at large to pick up the bill.</P>
    <P>I refer to a couple of points in my opening speech.  The Exchequer should not be called upon to bear the cost of the results of negligent driving.  Insurance companies have been paid premiums to underwrite these risks and up to two years ago they were reponsible.  For the past two years, since 16 December 1983, they have not been responsible; but as a result of that we saw no drop in insurance premiums. The companies call for this, that, and the other; and, because of the no claim bonus, if you have a claim they will up the premium.  Surely the Deputy will change his mind in view of what I have quoted to him.  Basically he wants to put more taxation on the people he purports to represent.</P>
    <P>We believe that this measure will save the State something in the region of £4 million per year.  A point made by a number of Deputies here was that it will mean extra cash for all the health boards. I am sure they can use it.  This is the first time they can say that because of legislation by this administration extra cash will come into their hand, and they should welcome that.</P>
    <P>People talked about the large number of accidents.  They thought that the Department of Health should be involved in trying to prevent these accidents.  We will co-operate with any other Department, but this really refers to the Department of the Environment and possibly the Department of Justice.  We regret that there are so many accidents.  If we in the Department of Health can help in any way to ensure that fewer accidents occur, we will certainly do so.  Other people complained about the condition in which drivers are allowed to drive.  I <Col N="967" /> presume that means the alcoholic condition. Certain laws govern that and it is not the responsibility of the Department of Health to operate these laws.  As far as I am aware, they are operated quite effectively by the Department responsible for their operation.  If people think that drivers are allowed too much alcohol in their blood at the moment, then Private Members' Time or other opportunities in this House may be availed of to bring in a Private Members' Bill to remedy that.</P>
    <P>Other people talked about the loss of life.  I more than anybody else regret the loss of life.  Deputies O'Hanlon and Ormonde talked about the voluntary hospitals and how the charges work in relation to them.  Voluntary hospitals provide services on behalf of the health boards under an arrangement entered into under section 26 of the Health Act, 1970.  We have been advised that the power to raise charges should rest with the health boards, who can also recover sums due under section 3 of this Bill.  In practice, where the treatment has been received in a voluntary hospital, the bills will be issued by the voluntary hospital on behalf of the health board.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised &mdash; I do not know whether I should refer to them &mdash; about the amount of awards. Deputy Skelly in particular referred to the amount of awards in accident cases. We have nothing whatever to do with what the courts do.  The Department of Health have no input into that.  If there are certain charges the health board can look at the circumstances of the individual in question and impose charges or part of a charge.  If there is not an award there will not be any charge.  There will not be any charge by a health board until such time as a decision has been announced.  Deputy Skelly and others asked about people who may suffer an injury which may necessitate treatment a number of years later.  I should like to tell those Deputies that health boards will look at all circumstances in such cases and will take into account the fact that an award may or may not have been made and the circumstances of the individual.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, the debate on which we are now opening is a wide-ranging and significant piece of housing legislation.  I shall start by summarising briefly the main objectives of the Bill, these are,</P>
      <P>&mdash;to establish a new statutory framework for the local authority housing programme so as to ensure that it caters adequately for the housing needs of particular categories of persons such as the homeless, travellers, the aged and so on;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to give additional responsibilities for the housing of homeless persons to housing authorities and to increase their powers to enable them to meet these new responsibilities;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to provide statutory backing for a number of schemes of grants and subsidies which were introduced in recent years including the mortgage subsidy scheme, the £5,000 grant scheme for persons surrendering local authority or Army accommodation to build or buy a private house, the scheme of assistance for the provision of housing by voluntary organisations and the reconstruction of defective low cost and other rented local authority houses;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to make a number of other amendments to housing legislation and to other codes in matters relating to housing. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is, therefore, the most far-reaching housing measure brought forward since the Housing Act, 1966.  That Act has served us well but it is inevitable that after almost 20 years a substantial recasting of its provisions should have <Col N="970" /> become necessary in the light of the changes which have taken place in the housing situation.  Happily the priority of our housing programme is no longer that of clearing extensive areas of unfit housing and relieving acute and widespread overcrowding.  The primary concern and direction of housing policy must now be to ensure that categories of persons such as the homeless, the aged, the disabled, travellers and single parent families, etc. have access to housing suitable and adequate for their needs.</P>
    <P>The emphasis placed by the Bill on the provision of housing for those in need is the most fundamental restatement of the objectives of housing policy since the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, and the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.  The Housing Act, 1966, repealed more than 50 earlier Housing Acts and replaced the separate rural and urban housing codes based respectively on the Labourers and the Housing of Working Classes Acts, with a uniform housing code.  However, it retained in many of its provisions the primary concern of the earlier housing codes namely the elimination of slums and overcrowding.  Many of the provisions of the Act reflected this emphasis.  I instance in particular sections 53, 55 and 60 imposing respectively duties on housing authorities to prepare estimates of housing needs, building programmes and schemes of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill which replaces section 53 reflects the broader objectives of housing policy which have emerged in more recent years and which it is fair to say have, in many cases, been acknowledged in practice by local authorities in advance of any revised statutory provisions. Under section 8 a housing authority may, as they see fit, and shall if requested by the Minister, prepare an estimate of the existing and prospective housing requirements of their area.  The authorities are required in making these estimates to have regard not only to housing conditins in their area but also to the number of persons living in temporary accommodation; expected changes in the size and structure of the population of <Col N="971" /> the area and, to the extent they consider appropriate, the housing requirements of persons residing outside their functional area.  These estimates relate to the overall housing requirements of an area and not solely the needs to be met by local authority housing.  The provisions of section 8 of the Bill and the broader perspective it embraces are good illustrations of the wider horizons of housing policy in the new Bill.</P>
    <P>I now propose, rather than considering the Bill on a section by section basis, which we shall be doing in any event on Committee Stage, to address in some detail the main impact of the Bill on the local authority housing system, in regard to the homeless, the voluntary housing movement and the travellers.  I will then deal with the other significant provisions in the Bill more or less in the order that they occur in the Bill.</P>
    <P>On local authority housing the provisions in the Bill relating to management and letting of local authority housing are designed to meet the commitment contained in paragraph 5.88 of the national plan and I quote:</P>
    <P>The statutory provisions on the management and letting of local authority housing are being reviewed to ensure that the needs of particular categories of persons, such as the homeless, the aged, the disabled, travellers and single parent families will get due priority in the formulation of building programmes and the allocation of tenancies. </P>
    <P>Successive Governments have committed enormous financial resources to the local authority housing programme over the years.  It is necessary, therefore, for the Government to ensure as far as possible that these resources are used in an efficient and cost effective manner and they are distributed fairly having regard to the type and severity of the housing need in each local authority area.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an annual assessment of the housing needs in each area which are to be met by the housing authority. An important aspect of the new <Col N="972" /> arrangements is that housing authorities will be required to notify certain other housing authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies providing accommodation, shelter or welfare of their intention to carry out the assessment.  This will enable those bodies to bring to the attention of the authority persons, in particular homeless persons, who are in need of accommodation but who may not have applied to the local authority for housing.</P>
    <P>In carrying out their annual assessments the authorities will be required specifically to have regard to the needs of the homeless, members of the travelling people, persons living in unfit or overcrowded accommodation, persons sharing involuntarily their accommodation, elderly or disabled persons or persons in need of housing for medical or compassionate reasons and also of persons who may be living in adequate accommodation but simply unable to reasonably meet the cost of that accommodation. These are the target categories of need which the local authority housing programme will address in future.  Persons in these categories who reside outside the functional area of the authority may be included in the assessment.  This latter provision meets the objectives of the Housing Act, 1984 which was enacted following a Supreme Court ruling to restore the power of local authorities to house persons from outside their functional area and allows the Housing Act, 1984 to be repealed.</P>
    <P>The annual assessments of housing need are to be submitted to the Minister so that he has available to him the most up-to-date assessment of housing needs in each local authority-in advance of the determination of the annual capital allocation for the construction of local authority housing.  This will help towards a fair and equitable distribution as between local authorities with due regard to the different categories of need, and its extent, in the different areas.  In looking at the provisions of section 9, I would also direct the attention of Deputies to section 17 (1) which requires local authorities to reflect in their building programmes the range of needs and the <Col N="973" /> different requirements of the various categories included in an assessment under section 9.  Under section 17 (2) a county council shall be deemed to have and always to have had, power to provide dwellings and sites in a town commissioner's area; this provision is doing no more than putting on a definite footing what has in practice been happening for many years.  Section 17 (3) enables a county council and town commissioners in their area to enter into an agreement that the county council will be responsible for the management and control of any or all of the town commissioners' houses. This power will be particularly useful where the reconstruction of town commissioners' houses under section 12, to which I shall be coming to later, is proposed.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities will be required within one year of the commencement of section 11 to make new schemes to determine the priority to be afforded to persons in the letting of local authority dwellings.  These new schemes will address the categories of housing need identified in the annual housing assessment under section 9.  They will also provide that the housing authority may from time to time set aside a particular number or proportion of the houses becoming available for letting for particular categories of need and that priority shall be given to persons in those categories in the letting of the dwellings so set aside.</P>
    <P>An important new provision of the schemes of letting priorities will be that where a housing authority have reason to believe that an applicant has deliberately depressed his housing conditions in order to improve his prospects of obtaining local authority housing, the authority may disregard the present housing conditions for the purposes of determining priority.  The making or amending of a scheme of letting priorities or the setting aside of houses for particular categories of housing need are functions reserved to the elected members.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the scheme, announced in paragraph 5.91 of the national plan, of assistance to housing authorities for the reconstruction of &ldquo;low <Col N="974" /> cost&rdquo; and other local authority dwellings which have suffered serious deterioration due to design or construction defects or because of their age.  I am optimistic that this initiative on the part of the Government will have a major impact in helping housing authorities to overcome the problems of these estates and ensure that the houses continue to provide good accommodation.  Houses on the estates concerned which have been sold by the authority may be reconstructed as part of a scheme to improve dwellings still owned by the authority.  It is envisaged that this power will be used where it is necessary to achieve satisfactory rehabilitation of the estate as a whole.  In such cases the owner of the house will be expected to meet half the cost of the works to his house.  Loan charges subsidy will be provided to cover 80 per cent of the cost of the works to rented houses and 40 per cent in the case of houses which had been sold by the authority.</P>
    <P>Where a housing authority reconstruct houses under section 12 they may also be required to carry out environmental and other improvement works to the estate. Section 19 will provide for greater flexibility in the ways that housing authorities may, with the approval of the Minister, use their housing capital receipts.  I envisage that this provision will be used to assist housing authorities in meeting the cost of these environmental and other improvement works to local authority housing estates which are suffering from anti-social behaviour, vandalism and other community problems.</P>
    <P>Section 24 amends the existing statutory provisions regarding local authority housing subsidy.  In addition to the loan charge subsidies now in operation, and those for the reconstruction of houses under section 12, subsidy may also be paid in respect of the provision of hostels by local authorities, which could be of importance in the context of accommodating the homeless, and in respect of the provision of sites and ancillary facilities for travellers.  I will refer again to these latter aspects.</P>
    <P>While on the local authority housing <Col N="975" /> programme I would like to refer to section 4 which deals with the £5,000 grant scheme announced by the Government in <i>Building on Reality.</i> The concept that a grant should be provided to assist better-off tenants of local authority dwellings to provide their own accommodation by building or purchasing a private house was an imaginative and, I am pleased to say, highly successful initiative.  It has long been recognised that the financial circumstances of very many local authority tenants can improve considerably over time compared with their circumstances when they were first given a house by a local authority.  The fact that over 175,000 dwellings provided by local authorities have been bought by tenant purchasers is testimony to this fact.  However, the purchase of a rented dwelling by the tenant removes that house from the local authority stock whereas those availing of the £5,000 grant release a vacant dwelling for reletting to persons on the local authority waiting list.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been very widely welcomed and has been even more successful than we had anticipated.  In 1985, I expect that over 2,000 houses will be surrendered to local authorities under this scheme and I anticipate that the number in 1986 will be greater still.  The combined effect of the high level of local authority house building pursued by the Government since we took office in 1982 and the dramatic impact of the £5,000 grant scheme has reduced significantly for the first time in many years the waiting lists and the pressure of demand for local authority housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It has also given local authorities considerable flexibility in arranging transfers and the more effective and suitable use of their housing stock.  It has also allowed local authorities to offer accommodation to significant numbers of single homeless persons who would otherwise have had relatively low priority on the local authority waiting lists.  Finally, the grant has provided a <Col N="976" /> welcome stimulus to the house building sector of the building industry as up to half of the grants paid are in respect of new private houses.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the grant in October 1984 the Government have extended its application to certain members of the Permanent Defence Force vacating Army accommodation and this aspect is also provided for in section 4.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (3) provides effectively that where a tenant purchaser surrenders his house to the local authority, the authority may pay the conveyancing costs, no stamp duty will be payable on such a conveyance and, if the tenant purchaser has received a subsidy under the former &ldquo;low rise mortgage scheme&rdquo;, he will not have to repay this subsidy despite any condition to this effect contained in the original transfer order vesting the house in the tenant purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Homelessness is the most glaring and distressing of all the special housing needs which have come to the fore in recent years.  However, remarkable progress has been made by local authorities and to a lesser extent by voluntary bodies in providing decent accommodation for homeless persons.  In other countries whose legislative provisions we are encouraged to emulate, there are proportionately far higher levels of homelessness than in this country.  The problem of homelessness in this country is most acute in the case of single homeless persons and it is primarily to alleviate their position that the Government have brought forward the proposals contained in this Bill.  The fact that the number of homeless persons is relatively small is not an excuse for leaving the existing system as it stands but deserves mention as it reflects the considerable achievement of local authorities and of successive Governments who have financed a large scale social housing programme over the years.  This programme has ensured that relatively few of our population will suffer the hardship of homelessness. However, there has been genuine and legitimate concern that single homeless <Col N="977" /> persons were being afforded a relatively low priority for housing which effectively, in periods of high demand for local authority housing, meant that such housing was unlikely to be offered to them.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in this Bill are designed as a response to this problem and to ensure, simply and as far as humanly possible, that if a person is unfortunate enough to become homeless that accommodation will be made available to him.  The Bill will assist homeless persons in two main ways:</P>
    <P>&mdash;first, the needs of homeless persons will be fully integrated and recognised throughout all stages of the local authority housing programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;second, specific new responsibilities and powers are being entrusted to housing authorities in relation to the accommodation of the homeless. </P>
    <P>I shall deal in more detail with these two aspects but before doing so I feel it would be helpful to review some of the background to these proposals.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that for many years there has been a debate whether local authorities or health boards were primarily responsible for providing accommodation for homeless persons. Section 54 of the Health Act, 1956, in fact placed a statutory duty on health boards to provide shelter and maintenance to homeless persons.  Such shelter was usually provided in county homes or similar institutions.  However, the distinction between the need for shelter, which was the responsibility of the health board, and the need for housing, which was properly a function of the housing authority, was never clear in practice.  With increasing concern at the existence of homelessness in a society with relatively high standards of housing and material well-being, it was clearly unacceptable that a small number of the most deprived persons in the community should appear to fall between the limits of the responsibilities of the health boards and the local authorities.  It was to resolve this, that the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Group on Homelessness were established with representatives of a <Col N="978" /> number of Departments including my own and representatives of the health boards and the local authorities.  The report of the <i>ad hoc</i> group was published in December 1984 and copies of the report are available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill follow the main recommendations of the <i>ad hoc</i> group and, in particular, that primary responsibility for the housing needs of homeless persons should reside with the local housing authority.  This is not to say that housing authorities will be responsible for all homeless persons no matter what their circumstances.  In accordance with the recommendations of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, local authorities will not have responsibility for homeless young people, those incapable of living independently in a dwelling or for homeless persons who are in need of institutional care or other support.  These categories of persons must necessarily remain the concern of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee's report my Department wrote to local authorities requesting the establishment of liaison arrangements between local authorities and health boards.  These arrangements should be such as to ensure that one or other of those bodies would accept responsibility for each individual homeless person coming to their attention or that a person is referred from one to the other only with prior agreement.  The majority of local authorities are, I am pleased to say, having regard to the recommendations of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee in their dealings with the homeless in advance of this legislation. This brings me to the final general point which I would wish to make regarding homelessness before returning to the specific provisions contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been repeatedly alleged that the Government were indifferent to the plight of the homeless or were doing nothing for the homeless because we could not lend support to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill introduced in the Seanad by Senator Brendan Ryan. Senator Ryan's Bill contained a number of serious shortcomings and its enactment would not have solved the problem <Col N="979" /> of homelessness.  It would rather have created more problems by artificially and arbitrarily dividing the housing problem in a way that would not reflect the relative patterns of need of families and individuals. The allegation that, in the absence of legislation, nothing is being done for the homeless is false and unfounded.  For example, local authorities have, particularly since the introduction of the £5,000 grant, been in a position to offer accommodation to increasing numbers of homeless persons.  In addition, the Government completely revised the scheme of assistance for voluntary housing organisations providing accommodation for certain categories of housing need.  The scheme which offered a £1,000 grant per unit with a discretionary and uncertain level of annual subsidy was replaced with effect from 1 March 1984 with a scheme offering 100 per cent subsidised loans of up to £16,000 per unit &mdash; effectively a £16,000 grant per unit of accommodation provided.  In addition, the Government extended the scheme to include, for the first time, the provision of accommodation for homeless persons. While a considerable number of voluntary bodies have provided accommodation for elderly persons under the scheme, I would like to see more voluntary bodies bringing forward projects to assist homeless persons.  I shall later be announcing further improvements to this scheme designed to enhance the contribution the voluntary housing organisation can make to the accommodation of disadvantaged categories of persons.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill defines a homeless person.  The definition is quite straightforward and does not seek, for example, to establish grades of homelessness or particular priority needs etc.  Basically, a person who has no accommodation available to him or who lives in a hostel, night shelter or other such institution because he has no other available accommodation is regarded as homeless.  To extend the definition to include, for example, persons living in unsatisfactory accommodation could only obscure the great need of those who are actually without <Col N="980" /> shelter and impede an appropriate response to their acute plight.  Some criticisms have also been voiced at the provision of section 2(2) that a person is not to be regarded as homeless if his lack of accommodation is due to a deliberate act or omission on his part.  This is simply a necessary and reasonable precaution against abuses.  It is not intended nor can it be applied by housing authorities to avoid their responsibility in ensuring accommodation is made available to persons who are homeless as a result of a genuine lack of foresight or capacity.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to request the Board of Siúicre Éireann Cpt., to review its decision to close Erin Foods at Mallow, County Cork in view of the loss of employment involved and the serious consequences for the whole horticultural industry and the future of food processing in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> The decision of the Government to close the Sugar Company plant in Mallow, County Cork, is a scandal that reflects badly on the Government and on the board of the Sugar Company.  Allowing another 164 people unnecessarily to join the dole queue is yet another example of the lame duck approach of this Government. It is typical of their casual approach to employment and agriculture.  Money is required to keep the Mallow plant in operation but they say it cannot be found or justified, yet money will be found to keep those workers on the dole, some of them for the rest of their lives.  Is it not a damning indictment of this Government that they can find all the time and all the money they require to press forward their liberal crusades, yet they casually allow the livelihood of hundreds of workers to go down the tubes?</P>
    <P>It is not just the fault of the Government that the Mallow factory is to close. Much of the blame lies with the board of the Sugar Company who have allowed the plant to become run down.  They have stubbornly persisted in producing dehydrated vegetables in Mallow while the consumer is seeking fresh or frozen foods and there is a glut of dehydrated products in Europe.  It would not have taken a genius to see the writing on the wall for Mallow and its products.  It was obvious for all to see.  Why then did the board of the Sugar Company not take action before it was too late?  Why did they not move with the times?  These are the questions I am posing to the Minister, and which I hope he will answer when replying.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Mallow workforce recognise that the plant is in need of modernisation, rationalisation and investment and that this would more than likely lead to some of their jobs being shed.  They would be prepared to go along with this in order to <Col N="982" /> keep the plant in the town.  The Sugar Company board and the Government are not responding to this willingness to help the plant to survive.</P>
      <P>It is the conventional wisdom that Ireland's agricultural future lies in the processing and added value of our basic farm production, yet the Sugar Company, who pioneered food processing, are being allowed to close their Mallow plant and throw away many years of experience in this sector.  Surely it makes more sense for both the Government and the Sugar Company to provide the necessary capital investment to modernise the Mallow plant in order to produce processed foods in the manner sought by the consumer.  To start another plant from scratch &mdash; and it is inevitable that new plants will be set up as the processing industry gets into its stride &mdash; will cost as much or far more than it would cost to revamp the Mallow plant.  Why close it? Why throw the workers who have given their lives to the Sugar Company on the scrap heap?  It makes very little sense to me but then much of what this Government do makes little sense to me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Erin Foods' plants provide major employment and a focus for the development of the food industry in the Cork area, particularly in the horticultural sector.  The performance of the existing plant could be dramatically improved if a number of initiatives were taken.  I hope the Minister will reply to the suggestions I will make and that the plant will be given a reprieve.  Firstly, the whole management structure needs to be looked at carefully and greatly improved in efficiency and cost effectiveness.  Secondly, I understand that if the plant maintenance <Col N="983" /> was carried out on a joint co-operative basis between the sugar plant and the food processing plant major economies could be realised.  From a cost cutting point of view it would be useful to look at the possibility of supplying the plant with natural gas.  This would result in significant improvements in energy efficiency and the cost of energy utilisation in the plant.</P>
    <P>One has to look also at the possibility of developing new products for a market that is constantly changing.  There is no doubt that Erin Foods when started 25 years ago introduced a brand new technology. I give them credit for that.  They were then a world leader in accelerated freeze drying of vegetables.  Unfortunately, the leading position they held has been eroded over the years by competitors. Erin Foods have not kept up to date and have not introduced the new products necessary to maintain their leading edge in this highly competitive market.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the whole area of imports of dehydrated vegetables into the EC.  This party call on the Government to look more closely at the regulation of these imports which are causing major cost competitive problems for Erin Foods.  It is possible for them, operating within their present parameters, to considerably improve their cost competitiveness. Accordingly, we urge the Government to provide a stay of execution for a year so that Erin Foods can look seriously at this possibility and come up with a plan which would make the operation cost effective and profitable.</P>
    <P>I wish to broaden the argument now by looking at the Government's food policy. One of their difficulties is that responsibility for food policy is divided among the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment. One of the reasons for cheap vegetable imports from outside the EC is the failure <Col N="984" /> of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to liaise effectively with the Department of Agriculture in this context.  Two years ago this party suggested that the Government should integrate the various activities of these Departments so that a co-ordinated approach could be adopted towards the development of our greatest natural resource industry.  I understand that the food committee under the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, recently suggested the appointment of a Minister of State for Food who would be responsible to the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and to the Department of Agriculture.  This is a bad idea because the Minister would be ineffective and would not have a good liaison with these Departments or power to implement progressive policies to revolutionise the food industry, which are urgently required.  The food committee have now been sitting for nigh on two years and all they have done in that time is to come up with this suggestion while companies like Erin Foods are threatened with closure.  The Government are in serious derogation of their duty and commitment to the food industry by failing to implement adequate policies for it. The food committee should be abolished if their only function is to come up with a suggestion which has little chance of implementation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil recently suggested that all the components of the Departments involved in food policy formulation should be brought together in a coherent unit.  We suggested the formation of a Department of Agriculture and Food to control and administer all aspects of the food industry from production to processing and marketing.  Such a Department would represent a coherent approach to the development of the agri-food industry and would have the potential to increase our food exports, seek new markets and compete effectively with food imports. The import of foods is one of the reasons for the poor performance of Erin Foods and the difficulties in which they now find themselves.  If this type of policy had been <Col N="985" /> implemented sooner Erin Foods might not now be experiencing their present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I also wish to criticise the Government's policy on horticulture and horticultural foods.  Some time ago a horticultural development advisory group were established and they came up with many admirable proposals for the development of horticulture in relation to rapidly expanding imports of horticultural produce, including fresh carrots, onions and so on.  Regrettably, the horticultural development group had no power and have now been disbanded. They have not been replaced by any comparable body with the necessary experience and expertise to develop this vital area of the food industry.  At present our party are working on a major policy document on the development of horticultural production and the food processing industry.  This policy will clearly signpost the future role for the development of companies such as Erin Foods and others involved in horticultural food processing.</P>
    <P>If Erin Foods cannot be made viable, even with the improvements which I have suggested, there should be an alternative approach to establishing a major new initiative for them.  They initiated accelerated freeze drying for vegetables 25 years ago but that market is now in decline, whereas markets in vegetables, fruits and other horticultural products are expanding.</P>
    <P>There are four possible areas I should like to recommend to the Minister and to the board of Erin Foods for their consideration. The first is frozen food products. There is major expansion in this area, both internationally and in Ireland. We are importing a considerable amount of frozen food products and this represents an opportunity for Erin Foods to get into an expanding market that is appropriate for them.  The technology is well established.</P>
    <P>Another rapidly expanding area is that of convenience, pre-prepared and prepacked foods, including vegetables.  Consumers now can buy ready-to-cook potatoes, carrots and onions.  Erin Foods <Col N="986" /> should carry out a feasibility study with regard to these products.  Controlled atmosphere packaging of vegetables is receiving attention internationally.  This ensures a longer shelf life for vegetables, either fresh or pre-prepared.  This is proving a major attraction for consumers.</P>
    <P>Food aeration has been applied to a variety of foods, including mushrooms and strawberries.  Admittedly it is highly capital intensive but it is a possibility worth considering.  Other countries are moving in this direction and sooner or later we will have to come to grips with this possibility.  I will give the House an example of what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I am advised by experts that coastal Cork is ideal for the production of winter cauliflowers.  At the moment we are importing these vegetables at a cost of £500,000 and if we could produce them in coastal areas in Cork, Erin Foods could undertake that project.  In north Cork seasonal cauliflowers can be grown.  In all, there is a market of approximately £3 million in the Cork area for the fresh and the processed vegetable market.  In the processed market I include frozen cauliflower florets, a highly attractive product for consumers.  As the Minister of State knows, coastal Cork is suitable also for the growing of early carrots and potatoes and other horticultural products. This is an under-utilised area of the country in so far as horticulture is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have made many suggestions that Erin Foods could consider and I ask that they be given a year's reprieve to consider them.  The revolution in respect of frozen foods did not take anyone in the food industry by surprise.  Yet, companies such as Erin Foods did not rise to the challenge by investing in the required technology. That is why they and so many Irish companies are in trouble today.  Food technology does not stand still.  What is acceptable to the consumer today may not be acceptable in five years time.  The food industry is vital and it should be encouraged with State aid to keep up with the changing times.  In that way we can lead the world in food production <Col N="987" /> and processing because no country can match us in raw materials.</P>
    <P>I call on the board of Erin Foods to review their decision to close the factory in Mallow in view of the loss of employment, the serious consequences for the entire horticultural industry and the future of the food processing industry.  I request the Minister to ask Erin Foods to give the company at least a year's reprieve to look at the suggestions I have put forward.</P>

      <P>It is with sadness that I speak to the motion before the House when I consider the excellent record of the Irish Sugar Company in Mallow.  It was Eamon de Valera who turned the first sod for that great industry that has given so much employment and generated so much wealth in the area.  The development of Erin Foods 25 years ago was a major boost to the area in creating employment and in development at farm level.  The reason for failure was that they failed to adjust with the times.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have spoken about the food industry and its development but the attitude of this Government has been one of retreat and they have adopted a defeatist approach.  I am glad to see that the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, who is responsible for the food section in the Department and also the Minister for Agriculture are present in the House.  In my constituency Midleton has gone into oblivion and possibly never again will it return to its former level of prosperity.</P>

      <P>Mallow is now for the gallows.  At least that is the attitude of the Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, is continually making speeches about the food industry and its potential.  On television he talks about <Col N="988" /> fresh vegetables and potatoes but what he says is fiction so far as the food policy of this Government is concerned.  They are failing to develop our greatest natural resource.  Over two years ago the Government set up a committee of Ministers and Ministers of State to examine the food industry.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, referred to this in a report dated 12 July 1984 but the report of the committee has not yet come to hand.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Irish Sugar Company to close the factory at Mallow is a major defeat for the Irish food processing industry.  It is a serious indictment of a semi-State body to go in this direction. The closure of Erin Foods at Mallow will mean there will be no semi-State involvement in the manufacturing of food products.  Some 160 jobs will be lost and the factory at Thurles will have to import carrots, peas and swedes for the manufacture of soups.  It will be a strange scene in shops to find under the Erin Foods brand products such as carrots from Israel and cabbages from Cyprus.  We never thought we would see Erin Foods importing products when these commodities could be grown in Mallow where there is the finest agricultural land.  We will spend £1 million in importing foodstuffs to add to the shameful food bill of £800 million and foreign vegetables will be sold under the Irish brand name.</P>
      <P>Erin Foods were outstanding and were far-seeing when established.  However, they failed to modernise.  Air dried foods were on the way out because the procedure was expensive in energy consumption and from the point of view of housewives.  They preferred canned or frozen products.  There is a good market in Europe for the right kind of product. Frozen and tinned foods seem to be the order of the day, with canned foods reasonably acceptable.  Dried foods are at the bottom of the European consumption rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vegetable consumption across Europe is on the increase but acreage will decline further in Ireland if the Government do not take a serious look at the state of our food industry.  If the food industry can <Col N="989" /> expand on the European mainland it is hard to understand why we cannot have a growing food industry here.  We have one of the mildest climates in Western Europe.  We could compete with the best in north France, Brittany, one of the finest food producing areas in western Europe.  It is a disgrace that we have let our food industry decline to such a level. The technology is available in County Cork within 20 miles of Mallow.  We have the expertise of UCC.  We have bio-technology, we have Moore Park, a vast area of development in the chemical field.  We have failed to exploit that technology. We have the best graduates coming on stream and the best educated workforce in western Europe.</P>
    <P>Erin Foods have failed to use the technology that is available.  That is the cause of the present problem.  I do not know whether there is lack of finance or of Government commitment, or a vested interest by the board of the Sugar Company to try to get rid of that industry.  If this motion is defeated our food industry will be eroded and its development potential lost for all time.  There will be lack of confidence among people to get involved.  The private sector will shy away: because they see a semi-State enterprise failing they will lose confidence in investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to invest in Erin Foods substantially in order to enable the industry to modernise in the interests of our greatest natural resource. This failure will make 160 people redundant in Mallow at a cost of £2 million in redundancy payments.  The Exchequer will have further loss because £1.5 million will be lost in social welfare payments and there will be a loss of contributions in PAYE and PRSI which I am not able to quantify.  If that money were reinvested in this industry the Mallow undertaking would be viable and be there for all time, a model for generations to come.</P>
    <P>The workforce at Mallow are blameless. They have been dedicated, hardworking and forthcoming.  The factory has been strike-free for 25 years, further proof of their great commitment to the <Col N="990" /> industry.  Mallow has a history of food processing and if we are to lose this fine industry it will be a sad scene.  Many of the people who work there have given a lifetime of service.  I know the Minister will vote with us tomorrow night because I know of his deep commitment to the food industry.  He has always spoken of the potential of that industry because as a farmer, like myself, he has given a lifetime to it.  I believe he will walk into the Opposition lobby tomorrow night and vote to keep this factory in operation.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have such a fine audience on the Government benches.  It is obvious that they will support our motion.  The Labour benches apparently have gone into decay.  The cost of this closure will be £5 million. Even £2 million for a start would give us an opportunity to save this industry, to modernise it technologically.  We have an industry there which is 25 years out of date and it was never updated.  The machinery would fall apart if it were moved out of there.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege to meet the four worker directors and I have nothing but praise for them, for their knowledge, their outlook and the concern they have shown.  They were treated shabbily by the board of management.  They were told at 10 o'clock in the morning that there was a proposal to phase out Erin Foods in Mallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farming community who have been benefiting were always helpful. They will be at a loss of about £1 million. <Col N="991" /> Approximately 100 farmers will be affected. They supplied peas, carrots, cabbages and other vegetables for the production of which they had to develop an expertise.  I have been told that about one and a half acres of peas at maximum output would give employment to one and a half workers in processing for a 12 month period.  We must look at the consequences for the north Cork farmers. Already they are seriously affected by the milk super-levy because they were paying in the region of 60p per gallon produced over and above the quota. Prices for cereals have been reduced because of over supply.  Farmers now find themselves without a means or an outlet for their produce that would maintain their income.  They invested heavily in new machinery for vegetable and fruit production.  All that capital will go to waste.  All they can do with that machinery is to put it in sheds and let it rot, because there is no hope.  Garages, hardware shops, the entire service side will be affected seriously.  Hauliers will be affected.</P>
    <P>Mallow has now the highest unemployment rate in its history with one in three young people under 25 years of age out of work.  There is serious unemployment in Cork.  The three employment offices in the region have 3,500 signing on.  That is alarming.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is coming on stream and it is regrettable that the Minister for Energy took so long to make up his mind in regard to supplies, which would have been helpful in food production.</P>
    <P>I sincerely appeal to Deputy Hegarty to vote with the Opposition.  He will be voting to reverse the decision at Mallow. He will be voting for the continuation of Erin Foods and he knows he will be doing what is right because he has seen the fair at Midleton.  The food section of the IDA are openly committed to the development of our food industry.</P>

Erin Foods carry an unfair burden in terms of costs. Head office structure in Dublin must be taken account of in this regard because the costs are appallingly high.  That imposes a further burden on Erin Foods. Perhaps the time has come for a decentralisation programme that would result in the head office of the Sugar Company being located in Mallow.</P>

As we have pointed out repeatedly, foodstuffs to the value of £200 million of that £800 million, could be replaced by growing similar products here.  It is totally erroneous that most of the imports could be produced here because the bulk of them are tropical or semi-tropical.  There has never been more processed food exported from this country as is the case this year and last year was a record year.  The value of our exports of processed foods is well in excess of £1 billion.</P>

      <P>This represents a huge increase over previous years especially those years when Fianna Fáil were in office.  There are difficulties in some sectors but other sectors, such as the beef sector, are thriving.  Increasing numbers of people are being employed in the beef <Col N="995" /> sector in particular.  In addition, tremendous work is being done in the milk processing sector.  There are difficulties associated with the horticultural industry. Deputy Noonan accepted that the problem in regard to Erin Foods goes back to the inception, 25 years ago, of the company.  Erin Foods have never been a total success.  There have been some difficulties always and those difficulties have been present, regardless of what party or parties were in power though Fianna Fáil were in office for the greater part of that time.  During their terms in office they have seen fit to close down Erin Food plants in places such as Fastnet at Skibbereen, Glencolumbkille in County Donegal, the potato processing plant in Tuam and more recently the vegetable processing plant at Carlow.  It was the Fianna Fáil proposal at the end of 1982 which led to the closure of the plant at Midleton and also to the closure of the Mattersons plant in Limerick.  The then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, said that if the Sugar Company were to retain viability and were not to endanger their whole structure and financing future, those plants would have to be closed.  We all regret the proposal from the Sugar Company regarding the plant at Mallow but that operation has been a very heavy lossmaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far back as 1980 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, comprising Members from all sides of this House and including Seanad representatives, pointed out that it was no longer possible for the company's sugar activities to carry losses on their food activities.  The sugar activities are increasingly vulnerable to the pressures of the relatively high overheads and the competitive threat of more efficient continental production.  The committee pointed out also that many industrial food producers had gone out of business and they saw the need for the Sugar Company to reduce their food operations.  The committee indicated that if financial targets were not met, the food operations should be disposed of.  That committee which consisted of 11 Members of the Dáil and <Col N="996" /> Seanad had a majority of Fianna Fáil members.  It is pertinent to remember their words.</P>
    <P>It is worth drawing attention to the observation in the committee's report that they had serious doubts that the company would be able to achieve an economic return in the near future from their food division as at present constituted. The committee recognised clearly the many difficulties facing the company in the food area and emphasised the need to regain commercial viability.  Continuous efforts to achieve that viability have been made in the five years since then but, unfortunately, instead of an improvement there has been a deterioration.</P>
    <P>In the industrial foods area a competitive market position is vital to survival, especially at a time when profit margins on the world markets are pared to a minimal level.  The situation internationally in the food processing business, and particularly in the industrial food processing sector, is one of intense competition. Profit margins are being constantly squeezed and companies in the business have been forced to turn to third countries as sources of cheaper supply.</P>
    <P>The vegetable dehydration industry suffers under a further disability in that it must pay growers prices which make the production of vegetables competitive with other commodities protected by the Common Agricultural Policy whereas the final output of the industry does not benefit from CAP protection or support. In fact, the price of dehydrated output is determined by the level of competition from external suppliers whose supply to the Community is virtually free of levies and taxes, whose input costs are far lower and whose level of production is geared to a far wider international market.  No food processing industry in Ireland or in the Community has protection from outside imports.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company have been getting the best price available for the Mallow product whose quality was excellent and dependable.  However, the outlets have been limited.  With the level of competition and the level of losses, and with no hope of an improvement in the foreseeable <Col N="997" /> future, it has to be accepted that there is no realistic way in which the plant could continue to operate at anything approaching an economic level.  The Mallow operation has never been profitable and the possibility of closure has already loomed very large on a number of occasions.  Since 1982, the company's involvement in the food business has undergone major rationalisation, and they have made great efforts to achieve viability.  However, in 1983 Mallow losses were in excess of £800,000.  Nevertheless, the board of the company reviewed the situation again and despite the high losses decided that the rationalised business should be given an opportunity to progress towards profitability.  There was a slight improvement in 1984 in that Mallow losses came down to slightly over the half million pounds mark.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, this upturn was due to temporary factors such as a favourable sterling exchange rate at the time and the adjustment and revaluation of stock.  The upturn was not sustained unfortunately.  This year the situation for the plant has greatly deteriorated and losses of about £1 million are projected. The level of these losses is turning out to be even higher than the company's most pessimistic projections, and there is simply no way that any company, irrespective of whether it be a State company or not, could continue to sustain an activity which generated continued and increasing losses of this level, with no propect of viability.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the company made every effort to keep the plant operating and to get it viable.  Their decision now must also be seen within the context of their other operations and the knock-on effects which such substantial losses in Mallow could impose on their total viability.  That is terribly important for everybody to understand.  We must look at the total viability of the Sugar Company. The main activity of the company remains, of course, in the area of sugar manufacture, which accounts for the bulk of the 2,400 workforce and which has not been without its own difficulties.  Because of our sugar industry's small size relative <Col N="998" /> to the position of other processors within the EC, we have to be always vigilant in regard to the sugar sector and its vulnerability from outside influences.</P>
    <P>The company's responsibility to their thousands of beet growers must also figure largely in their concerns.  This indigenous industry manufactures £150 million worth of product each year.  Up to a third of this is exported to Northern Ireland, to Britain and to third countries. It is an industry which is of vital national importance and we cannot afford to take the risk of placing it in jeopardy.  We must at all times keep this in mind and make it very clear that the overriding priority activity for the company is still their beet sugar operation.  The company must be continuously protective of their hard-won achievements and must be concerned at all times to see that this main activity is not exposed to serious risks.</P>
    <P>Circumstances have changed very much since the period when profit in sugar activities could be utilised for investment in other areas of activity.  In other words, the sugar side of the company has been sustaining and subsidising the vegetable side of the business.</P>
    <P>The pressures on the sugar sector worldwide are now enormous.  Several countries, many of them less developed Third World countries, but also including, for example, Australia, which traditionally has had a very strong sugar industry, have been forced to retrench and reorganise their native sugar industries &mdash; in some cases with very considerable structural repercussions.  Within Europe the sugar industry has effectively been reorganised over the past decade and competition is razor sharp.  The Irish sugar industry must remain competitive if it is to survive.  The Sugar Company no longer have the flexibility to divert excess sugar earnings to other activities.  Indeed, they no longer have excess earnings of any kind.</P>
    <P>Capital requirements for sugar beet processing are extremely high and are measured in millions of pounds annually. The company have already had to reduce their planned capital investment in the light of their real financial circumstances. <Col N="999" /> They must, however, continue to invest in their sugar operation if that is to continue. For any operation to be economically viable it must generate sufficient profit to cope with its capital requirements. These requirements apply not only to sugar but also and independently to food.  It has been alleged that the lack of capital investment in Mallow prevented that factory from keeping up-to-date in its technological operations.  The fact is that failure to generate profit on the food side inevitably resulted in an inadequate capital base with the result that the food division did not have the financial capacity for any necessary re-equipment.</P>
    <P>I must point out that at the present time sugar is once again a subject for consideration at the European Community level.  I am at present engaged in the renegotiation of the Community's sugar régime in which the Commission have proposed leaving the sugar quotas at their present levels while increasing the production levies so that the sizeable deficit in the régime can be cleared over the next five years.  Negotiations are still in progress and it is not yet possible to indicate the likely outcome.  However, given the scenario on the international sugar market where very low prices obtain, given the need to meet the definite deficit which has built up since the principle of financial neutrality was set in the 1981 negotiations, and given the scale and climatic and other factors under which the Irish sugar industry operates, there are considerable difficulties for their company, even within their main sector of interest.  What I am saying is that if the Sugar Company were dealing solely with sugar production, they would find it difficult to keep their heads above water, but when they have other activities which are losing money hand over fist then the viability and the future of the Sugar Company are gravely at risk.</P>
    <P>That is recognised by this Government, it was recognised by the previous Government, and also by previous Governments, many of them Fianna Fáil, <Col N="1000" /> when they chose to trim the extent of the activities of the Sugar Company, particularly the extent of their activities in the food processing sector.  It is no good coming here tonight saying that this Government are to blame for the closing down of this or that factory.  There has been a very steady reduction in the level of food processing, other than sugar beet, by the Sugar Company over the past 15 or 20 years.  As I pointed out, since Fianna Fáil Governments were instrumental in closing six plants throughout the country, they can hardly come in here and start pointing their fingers when the future viability of the Sugar Company is threatened by operations such as that referred to now.</P>
    <P>It should therefore be apparent to all that the company are facing pressures on a number of fronts which force them to protect their place in the sugar market and to seek greater efficiency from all their activities.  The hard fact of the matter is that Comhlacht Siúicre Éireann cannot be expected to operate the sugar division successfully and commercially or to hold their markets against stiff competition from other countries if they are forced to keep in production uneconomic activities which are uncompetitive and a constant drain on the total performance.</P>
    <P>As everyone knows and appreciates, economic barriers to trade are not permitted within the European Community and in this context a Common Agricultural Policy is vital for us since it provides unrestricted access for agricultural exports to the large Community markets. But trade involves free movement in both directions.  We have Deputies from the Opposition benches who occasionally &mdash; not so much lately, because the message is getting home &mdash; come in here and declare that we should stop vegetables coming into this country, that we should not allow them to be imported.  We import them because overall we are huge net importers of food and we are a member of the EC and operate by the rules of the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We export and import within the EC.  There are no trade barriers within the EC, but overall we export much more than we import in the food sector.  This applies to sugar as to other products and so imposes limits on the price which the Sugar Company may charge here for their sugar.  The limit is not fixed by the Government but by the price at which sugar may be imported into Ireland from other members states of the Community.  Under these conditions the company must keep a constant watch on their overheads, production and employment costs and the limitations laid down in the sugar regime itself or suffer the consequences of being unable to compete on the home market with imported sugar.  It is clearly no longer possible for the company's sugar activities, which are themselves increasingly vulnerable to the pressures of relatively high overheads and to the competitive threat of more efficient continental production, to carry the losses being incurred on their food activities.  The company have been facing up to their difficulties but survival ultimately depends on their ability to compete successfully with sugar producers in other member states.  That is the essential element in this entire issue.  Unless we can produce and market our goods competitively, then obviously we will be in danger of losing out heavily to the more efficient producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a measure of commitment to Siúicre Éireann from this Government and the previous Government &mdash; equity investment amounting to some £50 million has been made in the company in recent years.  One of the conditions attaching to that equity was that the company would undertake necessary rationalisation and reorganisation to improve profitability <Col N="1002" /> and efficiency.  A capital injection of public funds on such a scale has to show results and must be accompanied by a strengthening of the company's operational base.  This has been going on and there has been a reduction in the numbers employed by Siúicre Éireann in recent years.  Food plants have closed and redundancies have taken place.  The decisions to close operations were harsh ones for the Government to go along with but it does mean that we have a company who, if they are able to put into effect essential rationalisation plans, are in with a chance for survival.  In regard to the decision to close the Mallow factory, I would like to emphasise again the importance of Siúicre Éireann being restored to full health.  They are one of our most important national industries and the efforts they are making for a balanced future development must not be impeded.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any apprehension that closure of Mallow poses any threat to the Erin Foods branded operation at Thurles, I can assure Deputies that the company are satisfied that the fall-out effect will not be such as to interfere with the viability of the Thurles food operations.</P>
    <P>To make the position clearer I believe it will be helpful if I spell out the precise nature of the involvement of the Mallow production in the branded end of the company's food division.  At the present time some £900,000 worth of product is supplied by Mallow to the Thurles activity.  The breakdown of these figures is important and will help dispel many of the exaggerated claims made to me since the company's decision was announced. Of this total £300,000 represents meat products which will continue to be supplied by Irish manufacturers; a further £350,000 represents no-cook rice and marrowfat products which are already imported by the Mallow plant and the remaining £250,000 comprises raw material, which will have to be met by imports following the closure.  It goes without saying that we all support the use of native raw materials instead of imported products but it is also necessary <Col N="1003" /> for us to examine the type and quality of the home-based supplies, together with their suitability and cost.  Import substitution cannot be considered in a vacuum without any regard to the costs of replacing the imports by domestic production. The company are satisfied that they can supply the Thurles end of the business, without any further cost penalty to the company.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that Deputies should be aware of the efforts of all concerned to avoid this closure becoming necessary. Following their review of the industrial food situation and while they were undergoing rationalisation, the company sought additional activities which might have helped to bring the plant to profitability. The Industrial Development Authority were asked to assist and they continue to be active in the search for another enterprise for the factory.</P>

      <P>While, unfortunately, nothing concrete has emerged from all these efforts as yet, we are continuing and, indeed, intensifying, the search.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce, and Tourism regarding the possible involvement of the NDC in a project based in Mallow. I would not decry the value of the NDC. They are capable of doing wonderful work in areas like this.  With their assistance we may be able to find a substitute industry for Mallow in the present factory. The criteria have already been devised for the corporation's activities and once a suitable enterprise is identified there should be nothing to prevent the NDC from considering it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that as soon as the corporation are properly established they could have a role to play in getting an appropriate undertaking for Mallow.  I know the Minister for Labour, <Col N="1004" /> who is concerned with the NDC, is working to ensure that we can use that corporation to help projects such as the one needed for Mallow.  I readily appreciate and understand that my comments do not alleviate the hardship and worries which closure involves for the workers and their families.  Nevertheless, I hope that what I have said has helped to put the unfortunate situation into better perspective.  I fully appreciate the reality of the situation and again wish to assure all concerned that every relevant agency will be involved in our attempts to get an alternative enterprise for Mallow.  The difficulty is that the plant has been a very heavy loss maker in recent years.  The machinery has not been modernised over a 25 year period.  That applies to all of the Erin Food plants.  Machinery of that age is obviously using techniques not really suited to modern conditions, particularly if one is to be competitive.</P>
      <P>While we would all like to see the food industry thriving, if sections of it are ailing, we need new and better plants and not just to keep the existing ones running at a loss.  The losses, when the company are attached to the State, accumulate at an enormous rate and jeopardise the future of the parent company.  A Government who did not take action in those circumstances would be failing in their duty.  The board have recommended the action.  They are the people closest to what is happening.  They see that the whole activity in Mallow is in jeopardy unless remedial action takes place.</P>

      <P>The last few words by the Minister sums up his attitude.  The Minister, as the Minister responsible for the development of our food industry, has blandly accepted those figures.  The figures put out here tonight would not convince me or anybody else that the Erin Foods Company in Mallow are endangering the whole operation and viability of the Irish Sugar Company.  If they were I would be the first to say that the Minister is abolutely right to let events take their course.  It is quite clear from the very few facts that he has thrown out here tonight that, first of all, he is not interested.  Secondly, I never thought that I would see the day when any Minister for Agriculture would stand up in this House and declare openly to the people that because we are exporting more food than we are importing we should not bother to do anything about the imports. Any stupid fool would know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the agricultural exports of this country of meat, beef, and pork will always outweigh by far the imports of vegetables and other areas of food with which Erin Foods are concerned.  Do not come with that bloody nonsense here.  It is purely a demonstration of what the Minister said on the night he was made Minister for Agriculture. He said on a radio programme late at night, with me present, that he could not understand why the Taoiseach in the <Col N="1006" /> first instance put him into the Department of Agriculture, that he knew something about health because he was a member of a health board, he knew something about education because he was a teacher, that his family had never any connection with agriculture&mdash;</P>

But from listening here tonight it is obvious that the same Minister for Agriculture has not a bull's notion of what the food industry is all about.  The north Cork region and the farmers down there have a long tradition of growing vegetables for contract, which we would love to have in our part of the country and have not got, and we would be delighted with a commitment of the farming community to that.  That is the first asset the north Cork region have in relation to it.  If the Minister does not want to listen to something about the food industry.

I am glad to say in this House tonight that I welcome the decision of Pascal Phelan and Master Meats to set up a further link in this chain of value added food processing in Ballymahon, County Longford, to employ 166 people.  I welcome his decision to do that only this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will play against the Munster lads any day of the week.  If I cannot have the opportunity of saying a few words it is a poor day for this country. I am talking about what should be our prime national industry.  As I said to the Minister and the House, progress is being made in value-added beef processing. There is a long way to go to get at the bottom of all the opportunities that exist there, but I am glad that it is taking place and that my constituency is playing a role in that.  I will say no more about that except there are many other areas in which progress can be made.  If this House, especially the Deputies opposite, do not want to listen and hear a little about the developments that are taking place in the marketplace &mdash; that is what <Col N="1009" /> it is all about &mdash; for a food industry, then they are closing their eyes to reality.  In <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i> their answer to the food industry was to establish an international marketing consultancy. This Government seem to be obsessed with committees, task forces, consultants and international consultants. We do not need them.  We have only to go to Superquinn, Quinnsworth, Tesco and Gold Cross and spend a day around Sainsburys, ASDA and all the major groups to see the opportunities that exist there for convenience foods and new type products.  A whole change is taking place in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>I will not accept defeatism in relation to the food industry in Ireland any more than I accept the basis for this decision. But if this was to threaten viability and it was not possible to make it right, I would be the first to recognise that.  All the Fianna Fáil Front Bench are saying here tonight is that the Government should evaluate that decision over a year.  Their losses have been £500,000.  Strangely enough, the workers in Mallow produce a different figure for what the losses this year will be.  Which is right?  I am also aware that there is a head office transfer of £0.25 million from that lovely building we have up here in Dublin back to a small plant in Mallow.  Will the Minister justify that?  He should.  I do not think on the basis of a set of figures presented to him any Minister should write off a factory without satisfying himself, especially in the food industry, as to the viability of the concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not looking back 25 years.  The decision to open the factory 25 years ago was an imaginative and creative step but, looking at the Erin Foods operation, it is clear what has happened in the meantime. Successive Governments have not given the industry the capital injections required to help it modernise its plant. Technology in the food industry today is a very expensive commodity despite what my colleague from Clare thinks.  It is his belief that if one gets £1 million it is the end of the story.  For his information I <Col N="1010" /> should like to state that my total investment in that plant was almost £4 million and unlike him, I do not think it was overpaid with an investment of £1 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Deputy.  He is being constructive now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We must have more investment in the food industry if we are to avail of the markets in the EC.  In the Mallow area farmers are accustomed to supplying the factory on a contract basis. That is not an easy system to find in other parts of the country, as Deputy Paul Connaughton will appreciate.  If I tried to get that type of commitment in my area tomorrow morning, I would find it very difficult and that is why I consider it very foolish of anybody on being presented with a set of figures deciding to destroy a factory.</P>
      <P>It is worth analysing the figures.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies I would be prepared to request the management of the sugar company to appear before us to evaluate their decision.  A cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken with a view to continuing the operation for a further 12 months.  We should not blandly accept the defeatist attitude that we cannot do anything here.  Our technology in regard to the food industry is as good as in any other country.  That did not exist some years ago.  In the sixties Irish agriculture did not have an opportunity to break out of the strait jacket in which it found itself in regard to the London market.  We are in a marketplace of 250 million people with Spain and Portugal yet to join.  Is it realised that when Spain and Portugal join the EC that market will be greater than that of the United States?  Why is it that we have a defeatist attitude in regard to the food industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate to think the Minister accepts that we cannot do the job better than others. We have proved our ability in other areas.  We should make use of the technologists who are leaving our thrid level <Col N="1011" /> institutions annually.  They are the brightest young people available.  We need product development and a recognition of what the market wants.  Within Erin Foods there is a mass of expertise, people with food processing technology, something that is very scarce here.  We should not destroy that or scatter it to the four winds.  Management have not been able to produce a way forward for the food industry.  For far too long they have concentrated on the area of dehydrated foods.  The market moved away from that area a long time ago.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the mushroom operation in Mallow closed down some years ago.  I do not know what Minister was in power at the time and I am not interested, but the decision was a bad one.  In my county mushroom growing is a good source of income to many small farmers.  Those people do not have any other opportunity to supplement their income and must now cope with no extra production in the milk or cereal areas.  Indeed, I would welcome the introduction of a scheme to increase the national herd.  Mushroom growing started in Monaghan, spread to Cavan and is now very popular in Longford. Market research has shown that we cannot satisfy the demand for that product, even in the next 20 years.  Why is it that we cannot take a radical decision in regard to the food industry?  That industry will never prosper until some Minister decides to get rid of all the bureaucracy that has riddled our food industry.</P>
    <P>In the short time I was a Minister I suggested that SFADCo should be taken out of the mid-western region where they have done a marvellous job and be engaged full time on a three year pilot scheme in the food industry.  Were I in charge of the Department today I would have implemented that suggestion.  One of the best compliments I can pay to SFADCo is that they have little regard for bureaucracy.  I take off my hat to them for that.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies would be delighted to have a look at the <Col N="1012" /> facts and figures involved in the Mallow factory.  The basis of a food industry should not be thrown to the four winds &mdash; the livelihoods of 167 people are also being done away with &mdash; on the basis of information on a few sheets of paper. It is unlikely that many of the people involved will find alternative employment because of their age.  They have a big contribution to make in the development of a food industry but not in the area of dehydrated foods.</P>
    <P>The food industry will change dramatically in the next ten years and those in the marketplace can verify that.  The buyers of the hypermarkets and supermarkets will confirm that there is a move back to fresh foods and nothing symbolises fresh foods more than green fields. We have the best marketing tool to launch our fresh vegetables into the German or UK markets.  The most quality conscious people buying on the UK market are now moving back towards fresh vegetables.  Thankfully, we have not totally destroyed our environment and we should stop any steps in that direction because in the long term our best national asset will be an environment free of pollution.</P>
    <P>The future in the food area will be in small units specialising in the growing of high quality products.  If the Minister is serious about developing the food industry he should get involved in product development.  We have the expertise in third level institutions and elsewhere and we should start producing the products that the marketplace wants.  Rather than being a production orientated food industry we should be market orientated.  That represents the real way forward.  I cannot understand why the Government decided to disband the Irish Land Commission because thousands of acres of land owned by the State remain undistributed.  At the same time we have young people leaving third level institutions and agricultural colleges looking for land to try to earn a living for themselves.  Should we not decide to give them 70 or 100 acres, or whatever is considered a viable unit, to give them a start?  Those young people <Col N="1013" /> should be given an opportunity to work the land.  Why do we permit 700 graduates to go abroad when their expertise is needed at home?  We will be looking for such people in the near future if we are to develop our economy.  We have a growing population and we must do something about creating employment for them.</P>
    <P>There are many opportunities for development in the food industry.  When I was Minister I had occasion to have a conversation with the Prime Minister of New Zealand and I asked him what his strategy was in regard to industry.  He told me they were involved in various industries they could not hope to survive in, but the one area they should be involved in &mdash; as far as he was concerned all national resources would go in this direction &mdash; was agriculture.  The New Zealand economy is built solely on agriculture and they have to survive in a tough area.  Here we are looking for the easy way out, as usual.  There is nothing simple about establishing a food industry but, until we take the first radical decisions at administrative level, we will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister not mind the various pressure groups that will build up from various Departments.  I know from my short experience in that area that everybody sees himself as his own little republic. This country cannot afford that type of insular republicanism which exists within Departments at present.  We have a national job to do to build the food industry.  I hope the Government will do it, but if they do not, it will not be too long before they are making their confession to the electorate.  I can tell the Government that I am prepared to do the job if given the opportunity.  I know it can be done.  The important thing is, first, that you convince yourself that it can be done and then you can bring people along with you and anything is possible.  There is too much defeatism about.</P>

The Minister should remember that they are still owed £18 million for further development, an amount which was never handed over to them.  He is talking here about £250,000 that might bankrupt the company.  I cannot accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, pursuant to the provisions of section 2 (6) of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (No. 17 of 1978), hereby confirms the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 (Section 2) Order, 1985 (S.I. No. 230 of 1985), made under section 2 (4) of that Act. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the resolution is to confirm an order which the Minister has made under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978 relating <Col N="1015" /> to the financial criteria which apply to mergers, take-overs and monopolies for the purposes of that Act.</P>
    <P>Under the 1978 Act, any proposed merger or take-over which meets certain financial criteria must be notified to me. These criteria, which are specified in section 2 (1) (a) of the Act, are, where the value of the gross assets of each of the two or more of the enterprises to be involved in the proposal is not less than £1,250,000 or where the turnover of each of those two or more enterprises is not less than £2,500,000.  In addition to requiring notification, a proposed merger or take-over may be the subject of a reference to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices and, ultimately, may become subject to an order prohibiting it absolutely or conditionally.  Different provisions apply to monopolies under the Act.  These do not require notification but may be the subject of an inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission and, subsequently, may be prohibited or broken up by order.  The provisions of the Act relating to monopolies apply where a single criterion is met, that is, where the annual sales or purchases of the monopoly of the goods or services concerned exceed £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>The 1978 Act made special provision, in section 2 (4), for increasing, by order, the amounts specified in the financial criteria relating to mergers, take-overs and monopolies.  Any such order also requires confirmation by both Houses within 21 sitting days after presentation.  The present order, which is the first order providing for any increase in those amounts, was made by the Minister on 8 July 1985 and was laid before each House on 11 July 1985.</P>
    <P>When the limits were fixed, by statute, in 1978, the intention was to exclude from the scope of mergers and monopolies control small to medium-sized enterprises. Those limits reflected that approach.  With the passage of time, however, those limits were affecting a considerable number of enterprises in the small to medium-sized sector.  One indication of the position may be obtained <Col N="1016" /> from the number of firms to which, by virtue of the limits, the provisions of the Mergers Act applied.  At the time of enactment in 1978 it was estimated that the Act would have applied to about 200 firms in total.  At present, it is certain that at least the 500 top firms in the country &mdash; and probably more &mdash; as listed some months ago in a business magazine, would, by virtue of those limits, be subject to the Act.  Another effect of the lower limits was to cause an increase in the volume of administrative work involved in dealing with merger/takeover notifications.  The number of formal proposals notified under the Act each year increased from 45 in 1978-79 to almost 80 in 1984.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it was, in my view, necessary and desirable that the limits fixed in the 1978 Act should be increased and I made the order accordingly. The new limits, as set out in the order, are £5 million and £10 million for gross assets and turnover respectively in merger/take-over cases and £6 million in the case of the sales or purchases of a monopoly.  It is estimated that the new merger/take-over limits would apply to about 300 enterprises at present.  The figure of £6 million in relation to monopolies is also a reasonable one.  The new limits proposed in the order generally should ensure that the provisions of the 1978 Act apply only to the types of enterprises for which it was intended and therefore I commend the motion to the house accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As is the case with regard to so many things that this Government do, they have not really sought to get to the nub of the business at all.  They have not moved far enough this time either in dealing with the thresholds as outlined in the 1978 Act.  It took long enough to get that Act on the Statute Book in the first instance, seeing that it was considered by a Coalition Government in 1974 and had to be withdrawn some years later, never having completed its Committee Stage. It was then introduced in 1978.  It is a pity that some of the matters indicated at that time in so far as thresholds were <Col N="1017" /> concerned could not have been taken on board even at this late stage.  There should be no obstacle placed on desirable mergers which will help to maintain and expand employment in industry.  That is what it is all about.  We must not do things which are, or might be, restrictive in so far as ordinary development of employment in industry is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is different from what it was in the early seventies in so far as this type of legislation is concerned.  We must take into consideration that we are now a full member of the EC and this legislation was initially considered immediately after our accession to that body.  There are different attitudes now towards the free movement of goods, of capital and of labour.  The industry of this country is under quite severe competitive pressure from imports from foreign companies which have no base here.  The Minister should have considered that when contemplating a movement in the thresholds in section 2.  The numbers of cases referred to the Examiner, or to the Minister and subsequently to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, have grown, but the delay factors have not been considered at all by the Minister.  If amending the legislation, and that is in effect what the Minister has done, whether by order or by amendment in the House, the Minister might have considered bringing in a short Bill whereby the decision period would have been substantially reduced from that in the legislation to about three months from date of notification.  He should have taken note of the position which applies in other jurisdictions, now that we are a fully fledged member of the EC.  That is the market about which we are talking.  That has not been reflected in the Minister's attitude and it is regretted that he did not do a more sizeable job, seeing that he tinkered with the legislation. He might have taken on board a practice that exists in Germany whereby after date of notification a decision on the application is available to the promoters inside one month.  We shall not speculate on how long it might take in this country, but certainly it is disadvantageous to people seeking an early decision in so far <Col N="1018" /> as proposed mergers are concerned.  I would have thought that the Minister might have gone that far.</P>
    <P>On the question of monopoly, that monopoly is coming direct from foreign suppliers.  There is no restriction whatsoever on the Irish market in so far as industries supplying into this market are concerned.  Here we are talking in grandiose terms about restrictions on monopolies and mergers when we should be talking about the situation obtaining here at present, that if a foreign-based company, with no establishment base here, are introducing a product here there is no restriction at all on them whether they be supplying 1 per cent, 50 per cent or the whole of the market.  The native company is not on a par at all with its counterpart in other EC states.  One week we are here introducing legislation resulting from an EC directive and the next week we are imposing restrictions which are incompatible with the situation which obtains now in so far as our participation in the EC is concerned.</P>
    <P>One might take the example of the supply of food into this country where upwards of £800 million of food is imported here.  There was talk of that in Private Members' time.  A considerable proportion of the sale of that food in the retail sector is controlled by a very small number of multinationals that are not Irish-owned, they are foreign-based.  The three major ones between them have in excess of 55 per cent of the total retail sales of food here at present.  One of the companies involved has a turnover in the United Kingdom of £3 billion.  That company has a market share here of 10 per cent.  But what is that in relation to its overall operation?  If one were to apply mergers and monopolies legislation to that situation, these people would not be allowed to operate in this economy at all. We now have a situation in which 80 per cent of the food trade in our capital city is controlled by these three or four multinationals, the majority being foreign-based, foreign controlled, who do the vast majority of their purchasing outside this State.  The Minister might have considered the pressure these multinationals <Col N="1019" /> are putting on our suppliers, native industries, who find themselves at the begging bowl when it comes to dealing in the share of market controlled by these multinationals. Yet the Minister seeks to put restrictions on the Irish company trying to survive here, introducing threshold increases that are laughable, to say the least.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the number of applications notified to him and the increase therein over the past year or two.  But there is no talk whatever about the number of applications notified to him and how many were reported on by the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  I should have thought the Minister might have taken the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission of last year and given us a treatise on how this legislation was actually operating in the national interest.  Companies with 50 per cent of the Irish market in internationally traded goods can hardly be termed to be monopolies.</P>
    <P>Irish industry manufactures less than 1 per cent of the total industrial output of the EC.  And we are here talking about thresholds of £10 million turnover and £5 million assets when Irish industry has such a minimal share in the overall industrial market of the EC.  Direct imports, accounting for 50 per cent of the Irish market, cannot be controlled.  The Minister cannot persuade me that this legislation is effective in controlling foreign-based companies selling directly into this economy and supplying 80 per cent of the market in certain items.  There is no control at all unless such companies have an establishment base here.  They are not now doing so; why would they?  This is restrictive control specifically on Irish industrial output and contrary to the spirit we thought would exist following our entry into the EC.</P>
    <P>Much of the turnover of companies trading in Ireland includes trade outside the European Community as well as within it.  Therefore, when the Minister talks about companies here with a turnover of something like £10 million, one must ask: how much of that £10 million <Col N="1020" /> is sold into the home market?  A lot of that turnover will be sold in Third World or EC countries.  Here there is a restriction being put on the home market base when we should be talking about the EC market and what percentage they would have of that market, if we are to talk of freedom of establishment and freedom of services rendering the whole system a European one.  Here we are slavishly following criteria that apply in a restrictive way to Irish industry.  Using the turnover yardstick is a very simplistic way of doing it, but it gives little indication of market power, particularly for multi-product undertakings.  Using that yardstick it has no relevance at all.  In view of the outturn taking place over the past few years, I should have thought we might have realised that, that we might have moved away from that base in ascertaining whether mergers and monopolies legislation should use as its base the question of turnover at all, particularly in the case of the multi-product undertakings.</P>
    <P>The limits as now envisaged by the Minister are demonstrably too low.  They were too low in 1978.  That was pointed out then by interested parties, by concerned people in industry here.  There was not an open mind on it at that time; but, seeing the outturn that has taken place, one might have expected a greater degree of entitlement as far as the thresholds were concerned.  The Minister says there might be up to 500 firms affected by this resolution.  I should like to think that there might very well be up to 1,000 companies that would come within the limits now specified by the Minister.  The figures relate to small companies with less than 100 employees.  The spirit of that 1974 drift-on-to-1978 legislation was never intended to be applied to the small and medium-sized industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity to depart from that now, but he did not take it on board.  He is still confining it to the small company.  That is a burden that could easily have been lifted by the Minister in a generous way at this time.  When the Minister talks of £10 million turnover, I would put it to him that a small supermarket in his own town would have a <Col N="1021" /> turnover per annum in excess of that figure.  I made an inquiry today as to the turnover of a supermarket in my town and I learned that last year it was a staggering figure of £14 million &mdash; one shop in a town in the west.  A turnover of £14 million represents a lot of loot.  But it is an indication of the amount of money we are now talking about as against that in 1974 when these limits were devised, not in 1978.  Taking modern capital flows, labour situations and so on into consideration I should have thought that a figure of £10 million would have been seen by the Minister at this time as too small.  If we are talking about a dominant position in so far as companies that might be involved in mergers are concerned, then we should be talking about much larger amounts of money.  If we are to consider manufactured products alone we should be concerned only with the creation of dominant positions on the Irish market in the provision of goods and services which are sheltered from international competition.</P>
    <P>International competition constitutes the critical point.  If the Minister says to me that companies with a turnover of £15 million, £20 million or £30 million were insulated against input from international industries, then I would say he has a point.  There is no cover whatsoever against foreign-based industries selling directly into Ireland and putting Irish industries at a disadvantage.  Arguably it is not a major disadvantage and will not affect that many industries but that is not what legislation should be about.  It should be seeking to free Irish industry from restrictions, not place any further burden on it.  It is restrictive to think of any company's share in the Irish market being brought into line by this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is very narrow and does not take into account the reality of our being members of the EC market. It should be looked at in the global sense. There are German and French companies which are much larger than our biggest Irish concerns and it is against their products that Irish industry is competing both at home and abroad.  They <Col N="1022" /> have no restriction in selling into this market or other markets since their legislation is much freer then ours.  We are trying to compete against them while at the same time restricting companies from merging to provide better administrative arrangements to compete not just on the international market but also on the home market.  Irish legislation cannot control direct sales by firms outside the State on the Irish market if the firm do not have an established base here.  Certainly none of these large conglomerates will be setting up Irish-based companies following last week's introduction of legislation in relation to the Fourth Directive. That has made it final and forever that no multinational or major company will consider taking limited status liability. They will be coming here as subsidiaries of EC-based companies.  They will be coming as branches and taking unlimited status and limited partnerships in the German sense.  The whole range of options will be open to them.  All this is by way of being good Europeans and doing everything requested and demanded by Europe.  I have yet to see the <i>quid pro quo</i> in so far as the protection of Irish industry is concerned from that quarter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so because the thresholds here apply in a restrictive way to the modern development of Irish industry, which is also being curtailed by legislation such as we considered last week, as well as by the type of legislation which is being considered regarding the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services.  This is putting the insurance companies under enormous pressure and there are possibilities of substantial losses of job opportunities in that industry because of draft directives which are being taken on board without consideration of their impact on the Irish scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand the Minister's concern about monopolies but I would have preferred him to apply the principles in this order in the way Article 86 of the <Col N="1023" /> Treaty of Rome spells it out.  It does not see thresholds of the kind the Minister envisages being applied in this legislation. I will paraphrase Article 86 for the benefit of the Minister.  It states that it would be incompatible for one or more companies to exploit in an improper manner a dominant position within the Common Market.  That is the point I am trying to put across.  If we could escape from insular thinking and apply ourselves to the new situation of being full members of the EC we would not have that type of suggestion.  I would much prefer this legislation to consist of arrangements which would prevent unfair purchase and selling prices throughout the Common Market.  I should like to see the Minister more concerned about the issue of limitation of products to the prejudice of the consumer.  I should also like to see more concern about unequal conditions in like transactions.</P>
    <P>One merger application before the Minister was the subject of an in-depth inquiry.  I understand from a reply by the Taoiseach last week that a report on this matter has been to hand since 25 October.  It concerns the Committee of Inquiry into the Building Societies which resulted from the notification to the general public 31 July-1 August that it was considered that there might be a major merger between two of the largest building societies here.  I take it that this is the legislation under which that merger is being considered, not that the threshold of £10 million turnover will mean anything to the Irish Permanent Building Society or the Educational Building Society.  They are in a different league, since they control about 60 per cent of all mortgages and have a gross asset base of about £1.7 billion.  The Minister has the report of the committee of inquiry but there is no way he will let me have a glance at it, not even in the silence of Leinster House or the Library.  He is determined to keep it from the general public and I wonder why.  There was a great flurry of announcements by the Taoiseach and Ministers that there was <Col N="1024" /> to be an in-depth inquiry and the Government of the day were prepared to take measures to achieve the desired results. The word is that the committee of inquiry reported that things were pretty well all right in the building societies.  That was not the result the Minister wanted from Mr. Honohan and his cohorts and consequently the report will be left on the shelf gathering dust until the Minister has departed from office and some other more gentle-minded and more public-conscious Minister comes in and releases it to the general public.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister hiding?  If the Minister thinks they should not be merged, especially in the light of mergers taking place in the UK, why not say so? Perhaps the position is that if these building societies do not get the opportunity to do something by way of merger they may be overtaken by the advent here of a major British building society as soon as the draft directive on the freedom of services is in place.  As soon as the necessary legislation to implement the directive is passed, some of the biggest British building societies will be setting up offices here.  They will not be setting up an established base but will put in a computer terminal in some office under the new arrangements whereby you do not have to have an establishment here or leave your investment income in the country's economy.  They will be soaking up the mortgages which are catered for by our building societies at present.  The Minister should be doing something about that instead of introducing emergency legislation as he did on two occasions in the past few years.  If there is something which the public should know concerning the building societies' proposed merger, then we should hear about it.  We should be told what the inquiry had to say about competition and accountability, how they set their interest rates, how they elect directors and about the relationship of their solicitors doing conveyancing and the insurance companies which they mandate to write their cover.</P>
    <P>We were told on 1 August in a flurry of major press releases that the general <Col N="1025" /> public by the end of September would be entertained to an in-depth examination of the current position in so far as the development of building societies as quasi-banks are concerned in the foreseeable future.  However, silence has reigned supreme in the Minister's Department since.  A little of the dust should be shaken off that report and it should be published either as a White Paper or put in the Library of the House so that the general public could get a glimpse of what was solemnly promised to them on 1 August in so far as that examination is concerned.  Will the Minister utilise the powers of the mergers and monopolies legislation against them?  I do not think the Minister is entitled to do that but this had led to a destabilisation of investors as to what they might expect following that report and other matters which the Taoiseach says will be before the Government at some future date.  That is the kind of destabilising talk that the financial institutions here can well do without.  Do the decent thing as far as that report is concerned, let the public see what it is all about before any legislation is contemplated regarding any of the recommendations contained in it.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister could not find it in his heart to take the opportunity which was nicely afforded to him to do more than just amend section 2 of the 1978 Act by increasing the threshold to the miserly sums of £5 million assets and £10 million in turnover base.  We had an opportunity to do something much more substantial and to take away one further restrictive practice which is encumbering industry at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with monopolies concerning the operation of companies operating here.  Foreign companies operating here, especially in the food industry, have formed a cartel and are using outside law in order to set up here and take a major share of the market.  When they squeeze out the small shopkeepers and retailers here what will the position be then?  Many of these large companies offer a certain price to the suppliers and they can take it or leave it. <Col N="1026" /> They might offer £1 million for a container of tea or some other commodity which is damaging small businesses.  This practice is very worrying because when these large firms secure a monopoly will they then call the tune and increase prices?</P>
      <P>One company operating in Britain and other countries have 10 per cent of the food market in Dublin and are able to get around the law and use it to their advantage.  An Irish owned company operating here is not in a position to do that.  As I stated last week, the Government like to be regarded as being on the ball in relation to legislation controlling monopolies.  However, compared to other countries we are very hesitant in relation to this legislation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the proposed merger of the two largest building societies, when it was mooted that there would be talks the Government were very quick to move in to examine these companies.  That was no harm, as depositors, mortgage holders and the people generally would be interested.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be too restrictive because I allowed Deputy Flynn a certain latitude.  However, the only question here is whether ceilings of £5 million and £10 million respectively are too high or not high enough.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to make things difficult.  The thresholds are very low and should be much higher.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not increased them.  Perhaps there is a reason and, if so, I would be very glad to hear it.  Under this merger, Irish based companies are greatly handicapped compared to their foreign competitors using their <Col N="1027" /> subsidiaries to come in here when it suits them.  Many of these companies operating here are purchasing millions and millions of pounds worth of goods from outside this country and there is nothing we can do about it.  There is one chain operating here who are totally foreign orientated in regard to the goods they supply.</P>
      <P>In view of the remarks of the Chair I cannot deal with some of the matters in which the public are interested.  What worries me is the type of merger that may take place from now on.  The Companies Bill discussed in this House last week has worried many companies.  It is my view that multinational companies operating here have a total monopoly over Irish companies.  I am very worried with regard to cartels.  There is a danger that a foreign company could force Irish firms out of business and thereafter other major multinationals from EC countries could move in.  In time they would have a total monopoly of the Irish market and would be able to dictate prices and other policies. This danger must be considered by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have always had reservations about cartels, which I consider dangerous. Profit is the only criterion of multinationals and we cannot forget that these companies export their profits.  That is a most worrying aspect.  It is my opinion that the figures mentioned by the Minister should be increased substantially and I shall be grateful if he will consider that matter.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Flynn and Deputy Connolly for their contributions to this motion, although some of their remarks were aimed at wider legislation.  The purpose of the motion is to remove a hardship and responsibility from the smaller businesses.  The readjustment now proposed has been generous because it is in excess of inflation.  Therefore, more small and medium-sized businesses will be excluded than was the case under the 1978 legislation.  That is right and proper. <Col N="1028" /> Reference has been made to foreign companies operating here.  The Act dealing with mergers applies to foreign companies in business here.  The threshold figure is being increased to the point where it will be in excess of the inflation rate.</P>
      <P>Most other countries have legislation to deal with the control of mergers and in some cases the period for giving a decision is longer than is the case here. In Great Britain it is six months.  Deputies have spoken about the danger of monopolies. No one here wishes monopolies to become a threat or to impose hardship on consumers.  The EC is a safeguard against such a threat because if one monster multinational attempts to set up here it will be followed very quickly by another company anxious to capture the market.</P>
      <P>I accept that possibly this review should have taken place earlier.  It is my intention to have a review within five years to ensure that the smaller Irish-based companies are protected.  It is our duty to give every encouragement to Irish companies. My Department encourage mergers with Irish companies because we realise that to be successful an undertaking must be competitive.  No matter how viable or competitive small companies may be it is a case of the survival of the fittest.  For that reason we encourage mergers and all the aids of the IDA are readily available to help in this matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the way they have co-operated in this debate.  It is a simple motion aimed at removing hardship and responsibility from a larger number of small and medium-sized firms. I trust it will not take seven years for the next review.  We must monitor the situation to ensure that every assistance is given to traders.  The question of a merger of building societies was mentioned by Deputy Flynn.  As of now no formal application has been made to my Department in respect of a merger in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the following regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Registration of Electors (Amendment) Regulations, 1985 a copy of which regulations was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 31st day of July, 1985. </P>
      <P>These draft regulations are being brought before the house in accordance with section 7 of the Electoral Act, 1963, which provides that when regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations make certain technical amendments to the regulations relating to the registration of electors.  Section 7 of the 1963 Act authorises the Minister for the Environment to make regulations providing for such matters as the procedures to be followed in the registration of persons as electors and the format of the register.  Regulations were made under that section entitled the Registration of Electors and Juries Acts (Specification of Dates) Regulations, 1963. These regulations were amended in 1977 to provide for the separate identification in the register of the new category of European assembly elector.  The regulations which are the subject of the present motion will further amend the 1963 regulations to enable the provisions of <Col N="1030" /> the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985, which granted the Dáil vote to British citizens, to be given effect.</P>
    <P>Under the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985, British citizens resident here are now entitled to be registered as Dáil electors.  They are not, however, eligible to vote at Presidential elections or referenda and they must, therefore, be distinguished separately from Irish citizens in the register of electors.  The Act provides for this by creating a new category called &ldquo;Presidential elector&rdquo; which is to be confined to Irish citizens.  The draft regulations make the necessary arrangements for the separate identification in the register of the various categories of electors in the light of the new provisions.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is a technical measure and the changes being made are designed to accommodate the new category of Presidential elector within the 1963 regulations; there are no changes of procedure. Accordingly, I do not intend to go through the draft regulations in detail. However, I would like to deal briefly with the new lettering system which will, under the regulations, be used in the register of electors.</P>
    <P>The different categories of electors are identified in the register of electors by the placing of certain letters opposite their names.  At the moment, the letters &ldquo;LE&rdquo; are used to identify European assembly electors.  The letter &ldquo;L&rdquo; identifies local electors; these are persons from outside the European Community who can vote at local elections only.  The letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; identifies postal voters.  Irish citizens, who alone can vote at all elections and referenda, do not require a distinguishing letter.  Under the draft regulations, the letters &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;P&rdquo; will apply to the same categories as before and Irish citizens will not have a distinguishing letter.  The letter &ldquo;E&rdquo; alone will identify European Assembly electors who are eligible to vote at both European Assembly and local elections, and the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; will identify persons eligible to vote at Dáil elections as well as at European and local elections.  This later category is, of course, confined to British citizens at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> I do not think it is necessary to say any more about the regulations at this stage. There is, however, one important point I would like to make.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985, confers on British citizens the right to be registered as Dáil electors.  However, whether a person can vote or not at an election depends entirely on being correctly included in the register of electors.  Registration authorities are at the moment publishing the draft of the 1986 register and it will be available for inspection at local authority offices, post offices, Garda stations and libraries.  Claims for corrections to the register must be made before 15 January.  An enormous amount of work goes into compiling the register every year and my Department, the registration authorities and public representatives make every effort to ensure that the register is accurate.  However, the individual electors themselves should make sure that they are on the register. I would, therefore, urge not just British citizens but every individual to check that he or she is correctly registered in the draft register.  I ask the House to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the regulations being proposed following the passing of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1985.  We had a number of debates here on the extension of the vote to British citizens, and these regulations are necessary to give effect to the decision of the House which implemented the decision of the people in a referendum.  I do not see any great difficulty in operating the regulations proposed by the Minister. The Act provides that British citizens living here will be included in the register of electors and that they will have the identification mark &ldquo;D&rdquo; in front of their names signifying that they are qualified to vote in Dáil, European and local elections but not in Presidential elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compiling of the draft register is of great interest to Members of the House. When the matter came before the Seanad the point was made about the time of the year when the register is available for <Col N="1032" /> amendment.  I support the view expressed in the Seanad that the review occurs at a most inappropriate time. Some Senators pointed out that the review occurs when political parties were not active on the ground because of the Christmas and New Year holidays.  Here and in other places I have suggested that it would improve matters if we were to get away from that time of year, and I ask the Minister to agree to change it.</P>
    <P>At election times we get complaints about mistakes through which people are omitted from the register while others are included who should not be.  The principal complaints come from people who go to polling stations to find that their names have been omitted.  They are puzzled about why their names are omitted though they had voted in all elections since they reached voting age.  Though they had not changed their addresses, they suddenly found themselves unable to vote.</P>
    <P>The introduction of computerisation may reduce the number of mistakes because of continuance of the names on files rather than having to include each name separately every year.  This may reduce the number of mistakes but there will still be some, and we here should try to arrange for the best conditions for reviewing the register.  I suggest that the period be brought forward from January to November so that a proper review could be carried out in September, October and November.  At present the review commences in December and must be concluded by 14 January.  I agree that the review commences with the rate collectors from 15 September, but the draft register is not available until early December.  The Christmas and New Year holiday period intervenes and all political parties will agree that it is not the most appropriate time to involve themselves in thorough checks of the register.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister to amend the regulations so that the beginning of the review could be brought forward and the register confirmed on, say, 14 November instead of January.</P>
    <P>We debated the issue of extending the vote to British citizens on two previous <Col N="1033" /> occasions and we had a referendum on that issue.  There was unanimity here that votes should be extended to British citizens. I would hope that some other European countries would be interested in a reciprocal arrangement with us to avail of the provisions in that Act and to extend the vote to Irish citizens in some of the EC member countries and that they could vote in our general elections.</P>
    <P>So far Britain is the only member of the Community which has extended that right to Irish citizens.  They did so for historical reasons and we are now reciprocating by granting that right to British citizens living here.  I trust that those British citizens who have settled in Ireland, who are as much part of our community as is any Irish person, will ensure that their names are on the register of electors and will avail of this right.  We are talking about a very precious right but one that has not been extended to foreign citizens in many parts of the world.  Despite our history we have decided to extend this right to British citizens living here.  I hope all of those concerned will be fully aware of this and will take measures to ensure that their names are included in the register that is being compiled.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the Minister arranged to have special advertisements placed in the media by way of informing those people that this right is now available to them and that it is for them to ensure that they avail of it and that their names are included on the register.  As the Minister has said, they can check the register at any post office or Garda station or with any of the local authorities. The draft register should be available within a week or so.  If a name is found not to be included, the person concerned has only to fill in a form in order to have the matter put right.  I support the resolution as put by the Minister to give effect to regulations which will enable the provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985 to be implemented.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one or two comments arising out of Deputy <Col N="1034" /> Molloy's contribution but first I thank the Deputy for his contribution and for his continued support for the measure.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, this is a technical measure but a very important one.  It is the last step in a process which began several years ago to grant to British citizens resident here the right to vote in Dáil elections.  Once these regulations are made there will be put in place the whole machinery that will enable those British citizens to be included in the 1986 register, the draft of which is being published just now.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress, as many Deputies stressed also, that there is a need for everyone, but especially British citizens resident here, to check the draft register in order to ensure that their names are entered correctly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy mentioned the registration period and the period for compiling the register.  He suggested that the register might be compiled a little earlier so that the checking of it does not clash with the Christmas period.  This point was raised in the Seanad also and I am considering the matter.  However, most elections take place in early summer and our objective is to ensure that an accurate register is available for that period.  That is why April 15 is the operative date. However, the point should be looked at again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred, too, to the matter of the accuracy of the register.  All of us who are candidates at election time are mystified and annoyed by the inaccuracies that become apparent at election time.  Usually these are brought to our notice only on election day.  The need to ensure a more accurate electoral register is of the utmost importance.  My Department take every opportunity to stress this point to the registration authorities.  This year we decided also to undertake a much more aggressive publicity campaign to encourage people to check the draft register.  When people arrive at the polling stations and find that their names are not on the register they tend to blame some of us rather than to accept any blame for not having checked the draft <Col N="1035" /> register themselves.  The problem is considered to be one for the public representatives or for the political parties, but it is the responsibility of the elector to ensure that his name is included on the register. This will be stressed in the publicity campaign which will begin shortly.</P>
    <P>The campaign is being aimed specifically at those most likely to be omitted from the register.  The view of most people in the House would be that people who have just reached the age of 18 are the most usual casualties in this respect. Other casualties are those who have changed address.  We will be aiming at them, too, in our publicity campaign as well as at those people who will have the right to vote as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The only real measure the Department have of the accuracy of the register is the number of complaints reaching us in that regard.  After the last local elections only a handful of such complaints reached us so I hope the present register has proved to be a more complete one than those of the past.  It is an indication, too, that the process of publicity is beginning to pay off.  It is in the interest of all of us to ensure that the register is as accurate as is possible though we are hardly ever likely to have 100 per cent accuracy. However, the publicity campaign we are embarking on should ensure that the register will be more accurate for future elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for affording me the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment.  I regret that I was not allowed to raise the issue today by way of Private Notice Question, but we must accept the ruling of the Chair.  I thank the Minister for being here at this late hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post office at Killinarden, Tallaght, was opened two or three years ago. <Col N="1036" /> Last night two families were held captive throughout the night and this morning the postmistress was instructed to collect the money, take it to a certain place and hand it over.  While she has been released she had not returned home up to a very short time ago.</P>
    <P>In raising this matter I am not offering any criticism of the Garda in the Tallaght area.  They are doing a good job despite very difficult conditions but I wish to make it clear that the residents associations in the Killinarden-Knockmore area, the Killinarden community council and all the other representatives of the area, have been making representations for the past few years regarding this post office and pointing to the dangers in regard to it.  In the past I made recommendations to the local superintendent to the effect that there should be more security in the area.  In the Killinarden area there is a high rate of crime, of drug abuse and so on.  We always felt that post office would be open to this type of abuse. This was not the first raid on that post office.  It has been raided four if not five times.</P>
    <P>We have recommended that gardaí should be on duty, particularly on the first Tuesday of every month.  The amount of money stolen this morning was approximately £70,000.  We also recommended that the Army should be on duty.  No matter how well I put it, I will not be able to explain the anxiety felt by the law abiding people in the area.  I appreciate that this is an area with a high crime rate, but that is not to say that nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>For a number of years we have been asking for changes to be made as regards paying large sums into sub-post offices. We were all very pleased when Killinarden got the post office because we felt it would serve the area very well, but now this has happened.  I make a special appeal to the Minister on behalf of Killinarden and Tallaght to do something about this.  There is no point in the Minister saying there is ample Garda activity in the area.  There may be sufficient Garda activity throughout the day in parts of the Tallaght area, but in this area, and <Col N="1037" /> particularly on the first Tuesday of the month, greater supervision is needed.  I have been a representative for this area for many years and know the area very well.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this.</P>
    <P>I hope we will hear tonight that changes will be made, that sufficient gardaí will be on duty on particular days and, if necessary, that the Army will be called in.  I want to refer to another post office in the Tallaght area, Glenview post office. This area too requires some protection especially now when Christmas is coming.  What I am saying applies not only to the Tallaght area but to the rest of the country as well.  Again I appeal to the Minister to do something about these areas.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Killinarden post office has been there for only three years but it has been raided four or five times already. Last night two families were held hostage and the postmistress was released this morning and instructed to collect the money and place it in a certain spot.  The Minister will have to accept that there is something wrong here and it is up to him to do something about it.  I do not want to be too critical of the Minister but, as a public representative for this area, I consider it my duty to speak out about this.  For a long time we have been making representations to the superintendent of the Garda in the area but I am sorry to say our representations have gone unheeded. The time has come for something to be done.  I am anxious to hear what the <Col N="1038" /> Minister has to say and I will appreciate it if he comes to the aid of the people of Killinarden, the people of Tallaght, the people of Dublin and the country generally.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Twice in the past week, the second time as recently as this afternoon, I answered Parliamentary Questions concerning banks and employment exchanges as being places which are susceptible to attack by persons anxious to get their hands on substantial sums of money.  What I said about them obviously applies also to post offices, namely, that comprehensive advice is provided by the Garda Síochána both in relation to premises themselves and to procedures relating to the movement of cash.  In addition, of course, the gardaí take such protection measures as they judge useful and as their resources permit.  All those measures are relevant, directly or indirectly, to the protection of members of the public and of the staff, as well as to the protection of cash and the whole situation is kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, provides that certain outstanding entitlements may be paid from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund where the employers concerned have become insolvent, for the purposes of the Act, on or after 22 October 1983.  Lemon and Company Limited was put into receivership on 5 September 1983 and under the terms of the Act the company must be deemed to have become insolvent on that date. Accordingly, as the date of insolvency was prior to 22 October 1983 I regret that it is not possible to consider applications <Col N="846" /> for payments under the Act to the former employees of the company.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider conducting a sample survey of people one year after they first became unemployed, examining their employment experience and the effect of age, training, employment schemes on success, with the objective of improving our knowledge of the problems of the unemployed and thereby better tailoring policies to meet their needs in much the same way as the school leaver survey by the National Manpower Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy is obviously aware that there is already a range of information available to policy makers on the characteristics of the unemployed the extent and detail of that information does not provide us with an adequate profile or statistical analysis of the exact location and nature of employment and unemployment within our society.  In addition to developing the information resources required for policy formulation, the Government have also been examining the scope for initiatives to provide the long term unemployed with the opportunity of reintegration into the active labour force.</P>
      <P>With regard to our current sources of information, there are two principal sources of statistical data: the information on age by duration analysis of the live register which is published twice a year, and the annual labour force survey. Both studies are conducted by the Central Statistics Office.  In addition, a number of specific analytical and research studies on the long term unemployed have been carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are considering further possible measures to assist the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Manpower Policy.  The White Paper will also deal <Col N="847" /> with the question of monitoring and evaluation of existing manpower programmes. It is possible that a survey along the lines suggested by the Deputy could most appropriately be undertaken within the framework of manpower policies as set out in the forthcoming White Paper and I am accordingly having the suggestion looked at within the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if as a matter of urgency he will amend the conditions of participation in the enterprise allowance scheme, in particular, the clause which states that a person continues to sign on the live register until accepted in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The enterprise allowance scheme was designed as an incentive for the unemployed to establish new business.  The scheme is also intended to be, to a larger extent, self financing.  The scheme would not meet these objectives if the present conditions were not complied with.</P>
      <P>Applications to participate in the enterprise allowance scheme require careful examination by the National Manpower Service to assess the eligibility of applicants including the viability of proposed enterprises with reference to the applicant's skills.  Control of induction into the scheme, offsetting Exchequer saving and budgetary control would be at risk if persons were at liberty to sign off the live register and proceed independently with their enterprises without regard to the placement officer's views and decision in each case.</P>

      <P>Persons moving into and out of the State are not subjected to comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures in relation to their movements.  There is therefore no way of determining the actual number of inward and outward migrants in any period and the destination of outward migrants.  The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration (i.e. the difference between the inward and outward flows) between <Col N="849" /> successive censuses of population.  The estimates for these periods are obtained by relating the intercensal population changes to data for births and deaths in the same period.</P>
      <P>For the post-1981 period, which was the most recent census year, very tentative estimates only of net migration can be made until the results of the 1986 census of population become available. These estimates of net migration are based on the provisional mid-April population estimates which are compiled annually and which in turn are subject to revision on the availability of the 1986 census results.</P>
      <P>The provisional mid-April 1985 population estimate is 3,552,000 which is 109,000 above the 1981 census figure of 3,443,000.  The natural increase in the population (i.e. excess of births over deaths) in the same period was 141,000. Thus in the four years April 1981 to April 1985 it is estimated that there was net migration outward of 32,000 which is an average of 8,000 per year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Irish Jurong Limited commenced the manufacture of polyethylene in Kilcoole, County Wicklow in August last and 120 people are currently employed.  The establishment of this company was negotiated by the IDA with Lamipak Industries Private Limited, Singapore, and the Irish company was, until earlier this year, a wholly owned subsidiary of that company. As regards financial transactions affecting the company, I presume the Deputy is referring to the transfer in ownership from Lamipak to the Cua family. The IDA were aware of this transfer.  I am aware that a provisional liquidator has been appointed to Lamipak Industries Private Limited and I understand that the Irish company do not consider that they will be affected by this.</P>
      <P>The company's jobs and exports targets for 1985 are being met and the indications are that the longer term targets for the company will be realised.  Irish Jurong Limited have not been grant assisted to manufacture products for sale on the home market and, accordingly, should not adversely affect the domestic plastics industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the directors and share <Col N="851" /> capital of Irish Jurong Limited may be obtained from the Companies Registration Office.  It is not normal practice to publish details of grant assistance to individual firms in advance of publication in the IDA's annual report.

      <P>I understand that the recent decisions to which the Deputy refers related solely to cases involving illegal parking and failure to display current tax discs.  Uninsured vehicles were not involved.  The dismissal of certain cases related to the certification of registered ownership of vehicles where errors of certification were established in a small number of cases.  Occasionally, the particulars furnished by the authorised officer may not be up-to-date, particularly <Col N="854" /> where a change of ownership of a vehicle has not been notified to the relevant motor taxation office.</P>
      <P>Steps are being taken to remind vehicle owners and garage owners of the statutory requirement in this respect and to improve the processing of vehicle records and the provision of certificates.  A change in the existing legislation does not seem necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="857" /> Nos. 44 and 45 together.  I am aware of the statistics quoted by the Deputy which were derived from Table 12 of the Foras Forbartha report referred to by him.  The table in question is designed to provide a breakdown of road casualties (killed and injured) by road user type, both in terms of numbers involved and as a percentage of total casualties.  Thus, for example, the table shows that 55.2 per cent of all road casualties in 1984 were users of cars.  The information provided in this table forms only a small part of a comprehensive analysis of road accidents carried out each year by An Foras and published annually by them in the report Road Accident Facts.</P>
      <P>The nature and extent of this analysis and the subsequent publication of the results are dependent on the availability of relevant data in the first instance and on the accuracy of such data.  I understand that it would not be possible to express road casualties, classified by road user type, as a percentage of the total number of users of the mode of travel concerned.  A breakdown by vehicle type of the number of motor vehicles currently licensed is available (through the annual census of motor vehicles) but comparable information is not available for non-motorised travel.</P>
      <P>In this connection, it is not possible to provide any meaningful estimates of the total number of pedestrians or other forms of non-motorised travel.  Neither my Department nor An Foras have access to information which would be sufficient to provide a reliable estimate of the number of pedal cycles in use in any particular year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, arising from their ongoing research into road accidents, An Foras comment from time to time in Road Accident Facts report on various aspects of the road accident problem, including the relative risk of accident as between one mode of travel and another, relative risks for different age groups, etc.  For example, reports in recent years have pointed to the fatal accident rate for motor cyclists, at four to five per 1,000 licensed motor cycles, as being four times <Col N="858" /> that for cars.  In the case of pedal cyclists the 12-15 age group is at highest risk; where pedestrians are concerned it is four-six years olds who are at greatest risk.</P>

      <P>The request received from Longford County Council in March 1985 was that I meet a deputation to discuss the provision of additional funds by way of road grants and rate support grants to enable improved maintenance of county roads to be carried out.  I informed the local authority at that time that, due to pressure of commitments, I was unable to accede to their request.</P>
      <P>The new road plan which was published on 29 January last, indicated that, in accordance with the practice of successive Governments, State road grants would not be made available for county road maintenance and that expenditure in this area would continue to be met from local authorities' own funds (which include rate support grants).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional rate support grants were allocated in April of this year to local authorities, including Longford County Council who received an extra £52,000. The present position is that all rate support grant moneys have been allocated <Col N="862" /> for this year and accordingly a meeting with the local authority at this time would not be productive.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Note:</i> Because of the transfer from January 1984 of responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the postal and telecommunications services to An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, the estimate and outturn figures for 1984 are not directly comparable with those for 1983 and earlier years.</P>
    <P>The budget estimate for the current budget deficit for 1985 was £1,234 million, equivalent to some 7.9 per cent of GNP.  Assuming no unexpected developments over the remainder of the year, the outlook is for a current budget deficit of the order of ½ per cent of GNP above the budget estimate.</P>
    <P>It is to be expected that there will be a variation between the estimate for the current budget deficit prepared at budget time and the eventual outturn, as the deficit measures the difference between two very large flows.  It will be noted that the variations in 1983 and 1984 and the expected variation in 1985 are well within normal estimating bounds.  Control over the management of the annual budget has, therefore, been firmly restored.</P>
    <P>The consequence of any budget deficit, whether planned or otherwise, is that the level of borrowing increases and that the onus of paying for the services so financed is transferred from the year in question to later years.  The present level of taxation, as well as the present level of budget deficit, are to a significant degree determined by the large increase in debt service costs which has resulted, <i>inter alia</i>, from high levels of annual borrowing in the past.  Debt service charges have increased from £418 million, or 6.4 per <Col N="871" /> cent of GNP, in 1978 to an estimated £1,991 million, or just under 13 per cent of GNP, this year.</P>

      <P>Poulnabrone Dolmen is not in full State care and accordingly the Commissioners of Public Works are not empowered under the National Monuments Acts to undertake its conservation.  Conscious that the monument was deteriorating and failing to make progress on the acquisition of the site the commissioners placed a preservation order on Poulnabrone Dolmen on 21 November 1985 as a necessary preliminary to their appointing themselves guardians of the monument under section 9 (2) of the National Monuments Act, 1930.

      <P>There are 32 national monuments in County Clare for which the Commissioners of Public Works have a maintenance responsibility.  These range from single structures such as megalithic tombs and stone crosses to larger medieval sites. For the most part these monuments are in a reasonably satisfactory state of preservation. Megalithic tombs, stone forts, crosses and other like structures do not require regular maintenance.  The main body of monuments requiring attention from time to time are the abbeys, churches, round towers and castles in full State care.  Conservation works are programmed for these monuments as resources permit and having regard to the needs of the monuments in the region as a whole.  Major works have been carried out in recent years at Inishcealtra and at Ennis Friary where a guide/information service is now being provided each summer.  A sum of £41,238 was expended on the preservation of monuments in County Clare in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> There are 13 preservation orders in force in respect of monuments in County Clare.  Further preservation orders will be made if and when it appears to the commissioners that such action is required to safeguard particular monuments in the circumstances laid down in section 8 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended by section 3 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954.</P>

Before the entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance could be determined it was necessary to have his means investigated by a social welfare officer.

His entitlement to unemployment assistance will then be determined in the light of the amount of means assessed against him.</P>

Counted for this purpose are any weeks of employment since the date on which she received 156 days of unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The person concerned made a repeat claim to unemployment benefit on 4 February 1985.  According to the Department's records, while she had 13 contributions paid, these were not at an appropriate class providing cover against unemployment and consequently her claim was disallowed.</P>

      <P>Following a review of the prescribed relative's allowance entitlement of the person concerned, it has been decided that she is no longer entitled to the allowance on the grounds that she does not fulfil the statutory conditions.  A condition for receipt of the allowance requires that the pensioner must be receiving full time care and attention from a prescribed relative who is residing with her for that purpose.  The prescribed relative who farms a holding is not <Col N="884" /> deemed to be in a position to provide full time care and attention.  In the circumstances it was decided that the allowance could not continue in payment in this case.  The appeal of the person concerned against the revocation of this allowance is with the appeals officer for determination. The person concerned will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>The conditions for payment of fuel allowances by health boards under the national fuel scheme are prescribed by regulations.  Under these regulations a person in receipt of long term social welfare or analogous payment may be eligible for fuel allowance provided that he is considered by the board to be unable to provide for his heating needs and is living alone or only with certain excepted persons.</P>
      <P>Persons who are not in the categories specifically provided for in the regulations but who received a fuel allowance under the arrangements which existed prior to the regulations, may, if their circumstances have not changed, continue to be entitled to an allowance.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the urban fuel scheme, administered in 17 cities and towns mainly along the eastern and southern seaboards by local authorities, persons in receipt of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, widow's pensions (contributory and non-contributory) and unemployment assistance recipients with dependants have automatic entitlement to fuel vouchers.

The appeals officer has decided that the assessment of her means, comprising half the weekly value of capital and profit from a holding (the transfer of which is not acceptable for old age pension purposes) only entitles her to a pension at this rate.  An overpayment on her late <Col N="888" /> husband's pension resulted from non-disclosure of means and she is liable to repay this as the legal personal representative.

      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all persons aged 66 and over, blind persons aged 18 and over and to persons receiving social welfare type payments as permanently incapacitated persons. There is no provision in the scheme whereby a person other than a spouse may travel free when accompanying the pass holder.  Extension of the scheme to provide free travel for persons who are not spouses of pass holders would have considerable administrative and financial implications which require detailed <Col N="899" /> examination.

      <P>To qualify for a free telephone rental allowance a person in receipt of a qualifying payment must be living alone or only with children under 15 years of age or other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon aid in an emergency. Both the person concerned and his son with whom he resides are in receipt of qualifying payments.  Either of them could therefore qualify for the allowance provided the other is permanently incapacitated as above.  The medical evidence furnished in support of the application is insufficient to enable a decision to be given in the case.

      <P>The processing of appeal cases is not administered on a county basis.  In the normal course formal submissions of appeals are made to the chief appeals officer who makes the necessary arrangements and determines the number of appeals officers to be assigned to deal with the appeal hearings in the particular areas involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 17,500 appeal cases are received yearly and the time factor varies in accordance with the nature of the <Col N="904" /> decision under appeal and whether or not the case is dealt with summarily or is the subject of an oral hearing.  It is accordingly not possible to furnish the information required in the absence of statistics compiled on a county basis. There has been a considerable increase in the number of appeals in recent years which has led to a deterioration in the times taken to process certain appeals.  It is relevant to note, however, that two additional appeals officers were appointed at the end of 1984 to help deal with the increased workload and that in mid-1985 a number of temporary appeals officers were appointed with a view to affording oral hearings to smallholders who apply to have their appeals heard orally.</P>

The student did not pursue such a course and did not seek a deferral of scholarship in accordance with the terms of the 1981 scheme which allowed for a deferral period not exceeding two years except in exceptional circumstances. County Tipperary (North Riding) Vocational Education Committee sought sanction recently of my Department to approve of the award of a scholarship to the student to pursue a course in environmental economics in 1985-86 at the College of Technology, Bolton Street.  This sanction was not given as it was not considered that the circumstances of the case have been shown to be such as to warrant the award of a scholarship at this stage under the 1981 scheme.</P>

      <P>Replies to various representations received on behalf of Coolock youth project were held by my Department pending a response from the sponsoring organisation to an invitation issued by the Department on 8 November 1985 to arrange a meeting to discuss the proposed project.  The organisation finally contacted the Department on 28 November and a meeting between the Department and the organisation concerned was held on 29 November.  As a result, the organisation has been requested to furnish additional information and, on receipt of that information, the project will be considered for assistance in respect of 1986.</P>
