      <P>As from today, the new procedure for dealing with parliamentary questions will apply.  With considerable confidence I appeal for co-operation in improving Question Time from the point of view of everybody.  I would suggest that we do that by refraining from making introductory speeches to or statements on questions and that Members would accept the exercise by the Chair of his discretion as to supplementary questions.</P>
      <P>Finally, I propose to terminate what I might call valid questions on the dot of 3.30 p.m. and the priority questions at 3.45 p.m.</P>

      <P>I welcome this new departure.  It carries great potential for improving our procedures here.  I am not going to make a speech; I just want to endorse your own few words.  I assure you that we on this side of the House have every intention of making the new procedure work satisfactorily.  I have only two reservations about that &mdash; one is that we would expect Government Ministers <Col N="946" /> to give us the right answers to our questions and, second, I just wonder, when you are going to end promptly at 3.30 p.m., Sir, by which clock will you decide?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I shall attempt to endorse your words by performance.  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 19 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the UK Government withdrew unilaterally from the Memorandum of Understanding entered into in October 1983 I have had no discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on the sale of gas to Northern Ireland.  At the time of its withdrawal the British Government invited the Northern Ireland gas industry to consider how it might operate in future.  I am aware of the report referred to which has been prepared for the gas industry to assess the feasibility of a natural gas project in Northern Ireland.  I have not had made to me any other specific proposals on the terms of a gas supply.  I have seen from newspaper reports that the Northern Ireland authorities have not accepted the Coopers and Lybrand-Congas proposals but since the matter was considered by them earlier this year there have been substantial changes in oil prices and currency exchange rates which <Col N="947" /> would favourably influence the cost of gas supplied to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state what steps he has taken to impress on the British Government the feasibility of this study and to what effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>To impress on the British Government the feasibility of this study and with what effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I have not had any discussions either with the British or Northern Ireland authorities since the British withdrew from the Memorandum of Understanding in October 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at that.  Is the Minister aware of the vital necessity for a supply of natural gas for the development of industry and horticulture in the Border County of Louth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it would be of interest to the County of Louth and surrounding counties in the Border area if a supply of gas was provided to them.  I am well aware of that and, as I have said many times in this House, I will do everything possible to facilitate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, besides considerably improving job prospects in County Louth a supply of natural gas to the North of Ireland would also save thousands of jobs of Irish men and women north of the Border?  Would he agree that the British Government had no justification whatever for the harsh decision they took which will deprive these people of their employment and that that decision portrays a lack of interest by the British Government in all of the people of Northern Ireland, whatever their tradition? Would the Government and the Minister himself &mdash; as the responsible Minister &mdash; make further efforts to have the British <Col N="948" /> Government reverse their decision in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously a supply of natural gas would ensure the possible continuation of the gas industry in Northern Ireland and preserve jobs in Northern Ireland but, of course, this is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities and indeed for the British Government.  In October 1983, when the Memorandum of Understanding was entered into, it seemed there was a willingness to go ahead and to save the Northern Ireland gas industry.  That does not seem to be the position at present but obviously I cannot speak, nor would I attempt to speak, for the British Government.  I have maintained my position.  I have been willing to ascertain if we could arrive at a situation in which we could provide gas in Northern Ireland, and that is still my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that until such time as the Northern Ireland authorities agree to accept natural gas, County Louth will be deprived of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not stating that. As I stated in this House on another occasion, a review is taking place to assess the feasibility of having a supply of gas to the eastern seaboard and, indeed, to the Border counties on a stand alone project.  That review has not been completed.  On completion I will be informing the House of its feasibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if the Government, through the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have had discussions with the British Government since the collapse of this deal and would he agree that this was the best flagship of North-South economic co-operation which apparently has now been abandoned by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any <Col N="949" /> discussions or negotiations since the collapse of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>So it was not raised at any of the Prime Ministers' meetings, summit meetings or Foreign Affairs meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would be aware if they took place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is amazing.  It is an extraordinary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds and myself were in accord with our decision not to reduce the price to the British and there has not been a change in that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am keeping the £5 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is keeping it, because the Taoiseach said he will not keep it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is money available from the EC to help finance a cross-Border gas pipeline from Dublin to Belfast?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment there is not a cross-Border project for which money can be made available.  We were confident that money would be forthcoming from the EC in relation to developing a cross-Border pipeline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>One final supplementary. While the original negotiations were going on was the question of EC finance discussed and what percentage of the cost was to be covered from the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question starts with the breaking of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> The Deputy is now going beyond that. Question No. 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question starts with a survey that took place subsequent to the breaking down of negotiations. This breakdown of negotiations was dealt with in the House and the Deputy is now re-opening the whole thing.  I will not allow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite willing to answer and he should be allowed to do so.  The discussions on the financing of the North-South gas pipeline and the sort of money involved is of paramount importance to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit sought by the Leader of the Opposition I will try to be helpful.  At the time of the negotiations we were confident that substantial aid would be forthcoming from the EC.  That position has not changed.  At present we are assessing whether or not we can get aid from the EC to have a pipeline going up to the Border counties irrespective of the cross-Border element.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if any discussions or negotiations are taking place between his Department, Bord Gáis and Cork Gas Company with a view to a private consortium taking a majority shareholding in Cork Gas Company; and if he will sanction such a proposal or, if not, if he has plans for Bord Gáis to take a majority stake in Cork Gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in a recent statement, I have authorised Bord Gáis Éireann to proceed with an offer for the acquisition of all the shares of the Cork <Col N="951" /> Gas Company.  This followed the withdrawal from negotiations of a private sector company.  The purpose of this offer is to enable BGE, as the supplier of gas to Cork Gas, to control the company, improve their management and restore them to a viable state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Are Cork Gas Company to be wholly taken over by An Bord Gáis, and if they are not, what is to be the future structural breakdown of Cork Gas?  When will the exact terms of this proposal be laid before the House, as I am not satisfied with contradictory statements to the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what contradictory statements Deputy Lyons is referring to.  I made a clear statement on Thursday last to the press in relation to Cork Gas.  It is the only statement I made to the press.  The procedure is that Bord Gáis Éireann are in the process of acquiring shares in Cork Gas. That will take some time because of the complicated acquisition of shares by An Bord Gáis Éireann.  When the shares are acquired by An Bord Gáis Éireann, in a matter of weeks, I will be in a position to lay the order before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not have an offer from a private consortium to take over Cork Gas?  Is it intended that An Bord Gáis will take up all the shares and the full equity of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is intended that BGE will acquire the Cork Gas Company. I am sure the Deputy is well aware that negotiations have been taking place for a considerable period because it became obvious in 1984 that the Cork Gas Company were getting into an untenable financial position.  A number of factors contributed to this position, their poor performance which resulted from excessive overheads, poor management, <Col N="952" /> overmanning, excessive debt and inadequate equity.  BGE, as the supplier of gas who were owed a considerable amount of money, were involved in negotiations over a period as the basis of which an agreement was formulated involving a majority shareholding by a private consortium and minority participation by BGE and the existing shareholders. The obvious things to be done would have included a rescheduling of the debt, the restructuring of overheads through redundancies, and so on.  On 16 May 1985 the private consortium withdrew.  On their withdrawal I had responsibility to the 25,000-plus gas consumers in the city of Cork and I decided, with Government approval, that BGE should make an offer for the shares in Cork Gas.  I did that in the knowledge that every day the existing situation continued there would be an increase in the State's exposure and that any further delays probably would have jeopardised the redundancy package which had been put together by the previous agreement. That is what led to the announcement on Thursday last which was greeted with relief by the Cork Gas consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the anouncement that this Cork Gas Company would now be a semi-State body due to the take-over by An Bord Gáis, how does the Minister reconcile that with his reply to a question in relation to the removal of the meters and so on that he was concerned at the high-handed fashion but that they were still a private company? Are they a private company or a semi-State body?  What exactly is the Minister proposing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has clarified his lack of understanding.  The Cork Gas Company are still a private company and will remain so until BGE acquire the shares and then it will be the property of An Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the first step in the nationalisation of the gas industry?  Was the fact that Bord Gáis allowed the Cork Gas Company to run up their debts to approximately £4 million part of the strategy for nationalising this company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the banks allowing a £3.8 million debt to accumulate was not part of their strategy to nationalise the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds, former Minister for Energy, has asked two questions, the first in relation to the first step in nationalisation.  I made and got Government approval for decisions on the Cork Gas Company in order to ensure <Col N="954" /> continuity of supply for gas consumers in Cork city.  That was the basis of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, as I said, I will accept any credit the Deputy gives me for political strategy.  It sounds quite clever in retrospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <P>In relation to the location of stocks at home, oil companies are not required to supply this information and it is therefore not available.  It is not possible to provide the location of stocks held abroad as this would involve disclosing information given in confidence to me.</P>

      <Col N="956" /> As regards the second part of the question, it is necessary to distinguish between stocks which are held in compliance with a legal obligation and other stocks.  The stocks at Whiddy were maintained under an agreement on which serious doubts as to enforceability existed; the arrangements relating to them were, in fact, unilaterally terminated by Gulf in 1978.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is aware that there appears to be an over-rigid assessment of the rights of applicants for ESB connection in rural areas to payment of EC grants towards installation costs, resulting in their being denied these grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The western package electrification scheme is governed by Regulation (EEC) No. 1820/80 and is in accordance with the programme approved by the EC Commission in April 1981. Determination of eligibility must be in accordance with the EC Regulation and the programme.  Assessment of applicants' eligibility must be on a basis which <Col N="957" /> will ensure that both State and EC funds are directed into those areas of agriculture which the scheme is designed to assist.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is not an over-rigid assessment of applicants' eligibility for grant aid under the scheme.  However, my attention has been drawn to two areas of difficulties which arose in the operation of the scheme over the past four years.  One of these is certain cases where a second dwelling house is built on a farm which already has an electricity connection and the second is cases where the owner of a farm has his sole income from the farm but is in receipt of &ldquo;farmers' dole&rdquo; or other social welfare benefit.  I am putting forward proposals to the EC Commission which may enable such applicants to qualify for benefit in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When an application for a supply of electricity to a second family dwelling arose in the past did the people &mdash; mainly young people &mdash; not qualify? Why was there a change in this regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy says is correct.  Up to the end of 1983 a new supply was considered to be supply to any previously unsupplied building on the farm, so as the Deputy is saying, in the case of a new house, a second house on the farm up to 1983, grants were given. However, in April 1983 a team from the EC Court of Auditors examined the scheme and, following their visit, they stated in their report that the allocation of funds for a new supply was not fulfilling the objective of the scheme.  In response to that, the supply of electricity to second homes on farms was not grant-aided subsequently. As I said in my reply to the question, I have applied to put proposals to the Commission so that such applicants may qualify because of the obvious hardship being caused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the person who occupies the second family dwelling is as much engaged in agriculture as his parents if he is living on <Col N="958" /> their farm?  Will the Minister not agree that this should be speeded up to allow any person engaged in agriculture to avail of the subsidy for electricity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with the Deputy and being, like him, from a rural constituency, I understand the difficulties which we are having with the implementation of this scheme.  That is why I have put proposals back to the EC Commission so that the second house belonging to a family on a farm will qualify for a grant on getting a new supply of electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he intends to publish a national energy policy to cover the next 15 to 20 years; if so when; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strategy in relation to energy policy has been spelt out by me from time to time, for example, in the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department.  The objectives of that policy, and strategies to achieve them, are set out in the Government's programme <i>Building on Reality.</i> Furthermore, each of the State-sponsored energy bodies have been asked to submit a corporate plan covering their activities for the next five years.  These will be reviewed by me, and following discussions with these bodies, will provide a basis for development in the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Past experience here and abroad suggests that, given the volatility of energy markets, 20 year plans have limited usefulness, especially if they have the effect of imposing unnecessary rigidities.  It has to be borne in mind in this connection <Col N="959" /> that energy consumption is strongly influenced by movements in GDP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me that there is a need for new and very clear policy directions in relation to what is going to happen to three of the semi-State bodies he is talking about, Bord Gáis, the ESB and Bord na Móna? Surely because of the expansion of the natural gas industry Bord Gáis come in direct competition with the ESB who in turn are complaining about their dependence on Born na Móna.  Is it not time that we had a clear policy direction in relation to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with a certain part of what the Deputy asserts.  Since I became Minister for Energy I have attempted to bring about a better co-ordination between the bodies in question than was there previously.  It is not in the best interest of the State resources that the bodies in question be in conflict with one another.  Certain conflicts will arise in relation to the energy sources which the companies are providing, and I am trying to the best of my ability to make sure that they are not tripping over one another.  In that respect I agree with the Deputy.  As regards the long term, we have attempted in the past 12 months to ensure a co-ordinated development of energy policy so that these companies work in co-ordination rather than in conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the total energy policy for this Government represents what is written in <i>Building on Reality?</i> Is he not saying that?  Then are we to have any new addition to the energy policy from the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be coming before the House in the very near future with the Estimate for the Department of Energy and in the course of that I will outline existing energy policy and how I see the near future developing.  As I said in my reply to Deputy Cowen's Question, <Col N="960" /> we have to work within a relatively foreseeable time limit because of the volatility of the whole energy sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister intend to approve the five year corporate plan for Bord Gáis which was submitted to his Department last July?  What is the position in relation to the five year plans for Bord na Móna and the ESB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At present we are examining the day to day implementation of those plans to see how we can co-ordinate all the corporate plans rather than having any one of the semi-State areas developing a corporate plan which is not in tandem with its counterparts.</P>

      <P>Exploration for oil and gas <Col N="962" /> in west Cavan is being carried out under an exclusive exploration licence, which covers a large part of the North West Carboniferous Basin, including 252 square miles in County Cavan.  Under the terms of this licence two exploration wells were drilled in 1984, one at McNean, County Cavan, and the other at Drumkeeran, County Leitrim, but only minor indications of gas were encountered in each case.</P>
      <P>These two wells were part of a four-well exploration programme relating to the entire North West Carboniferous Basin, which extends to areas in County Fermanagh.

The project under the auspices of Bord na Móna in Clonsast in County Laois has been a failure more or less, due basically to lack of growth.  I am considering re-locating the project in County Leitrim under the auspices of the National Board of Science and Technology. The reason seems to have been lack of growth of the hard wood species there. We are still in the experimental stage. We have not yet reached the commercial stage.  I cannot express anything other than disappointment with the experience at this time.</P>

      <P>I should state quite clearly that we are at the experimental and demonstration stages.  The Deputy is probably aware of the windmill in Inishere.  At the moment a new diesel generator is being installed which will allow the windmill to interlink and supply power to the island.  Not all of our windmills have been a success.  We have had a number of technical problems.  This <Col N="964" /> area is in the experimental stage.  As regards small hydro schemes, I am more encouraged.  We have run a successful demonstration programme and we will be monitoring a number of these small hydro schemes.  I hope the monitoring will be completed by the summer of 1986 and we can then assess the results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the plans he has to reduce the lead content in petrol both produced in Whitegate and imported; and if he is aware that new legislation specifying lead-free petrol will come into force in Britain in 1986 and the EC in July 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that Whitegate refinery will be in a position to produce petrol with a maximum lead content of 0.15 grammes per litre, as against the current maximum of 0.4 grammes per litre with effect from January 1986.  The necessary investment decisions to enable it to do so were taken some time ago and the work is proceeding.  I understand that the British Government are to specify a maximum of 0.15 grammes per litre for all petrol marketed in the UK with effect from 31 December 1985 and, since almost all of the balance of our petrol requirements is imported from there, I would expect that this measure, combined with the adjusted lead level of Whitegate petrol, will give rise to a very significant general reduction in the lead content of petrol marketed in this country from early 1986.  The making of regulations which will prohibit the sale in Ireland of petrol with a lead content of above 0.15 grammes per litre is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and I am aware that this issue is currently receiving his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent EC Council Directive on lead content of petrol requires that member states take &ldquo;the necessary measures to ensure the availability and balanced distribution within their territories of unleaded petrol from 1 October 1989&rdquo;. However, it is open to any member state <Col N="965" /> to facilitate the introduction of unleaded petrol onto its domestic market from a date earlier than that and in this regard I understand that the British Government intend to make it possible for any oil company which wishes to do so to sell unleaded petrol in the UK from January 1986 onwards.  That is already the position in this country.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, while member states may facilitate the introduction of unleaded petrol on their markets before 1989, just as the UK are doing, this does not of course guarantee that there will be a significant demand for such petrol in the short term.  The transition of demand for leaded to unleaded petrol will take many years as there is turnover in national vehicle fleets and as vehicles capable of running on unleaded petrol grow in numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply.  Would he agree that, now that the decisions and plans are in place, there should be similar co-ordination with the motor industry for the importation of motor fleets so that their engines will be geared to ensure that the maximum amount of lead free petrol will be used when it comes into operation in 1989?  If we do not take action we may find ourselves with a dirty environment for a few more years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct when he says we should try to monitor the lead in time to ensure that there is maximum use of unleaded petrol. There has been exhaustive technical interplay between the refining, car design, manufacturing and consumer interests, all with a view to making unleaded petrol the main vehicle fuel as quickly as possible.  The car manufacturing member states have been aware that Germany has been forcing the pace in this regard and quite rightly so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the reason he is refusing to sanction a supply of natural gas to Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not refused to sanction a supply of gas for Clonmel &mdash; quite the contrary.  In August 1984, I secured Government approval for a supply of natural gas to Clonmel.  This was based on proposals submitted by Clonmel Corporation.</P>
      <P>In subsequent discussions with Bord Gáis Éireann, the corporation made substantial alterations in their proposals for financing the project.  Further negotiations between the parties have not so far resolved one important aspect of the financing proposals.  I have asked BGE to pursue the matter with the corporation. I am confident that agreement can be reached quickly and that gas can be brought to Clonmel without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread disappointment in Clonmel because they have been waiting so long for a supply of natural gas?  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that the demand by Bord Gáis on Clonmel Corporation has been excessive &mdash; a huge <Col N="967" /> amount of money.  Perhaps the Minister has the figures available.  That is the reason the project is not going forward. This situation has existed for quite some time.  If it is not resolved, is the Minister prepared to allow private enterprise to come in and take an interest with Clonmel Corporation to resolve the financial problems which apparently Bord Gáis are not prepared to resolve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident that the matter will be resolved without further delay and that it will not be necessary to look for any other partners in the Clonmel Gas Company.  I reject any implication that I caused the delay since the original agreement was sanctioned by me and approved by the Government in August 1984.  Subsequently Clonmel Corporation came back to the Government with figures different from those contained in the original agreement.  That is what has caused the delay, but I am confident that we can reach agreement within a matter of days or weeks.</P>

The problem is the huge amount of money being demanded by Bord Gáis, not that there was a change of plan.  The Minister makes a big point of stating that the Government decision was made in August 1984.  I would remind him that the Government decided in October 1982 to give Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford a gas supply.  That was two and a half years ago but it has not happened yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals for a supply of natural gas to the Kilkenny Gas Company and a substantial industry in that area have been under consideration for some time.  The parties have so far failed to produce agreement on the possible supply of natural gas at a price which would be consistent with Government policy.  As I indicated on 13 March 1985 in reply to Questions Nos. 377, 378 and 379, by Deputies Aylward and De Rossa, my responsibility is to ensure development of the natural gas grid in accordance with sound commercial principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Kilkenny Gas have indicated their intention to close, I have no information to suggest that failure by the industry concerned to procure access to <Col N="969" /> natural gas would jeopardise them and their workforce.  They have consistently maintained that in the absence of agreement on a supply of natural gas, they would have a viable alternative in a switch to coal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate with whom negotiations are continuing for the supply of natural gas or could he confirm after such a long period whether he intends to grant a supply of natural gas to Kilkenny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Government policy is that the price of gas must reflect its inherent value as a substitute for imported oil and that is the basis of negotiations with any of the gas utilities, either public or private, in relation to the supply of gas for their area.  Obviously there is a difficulty in relation to the project by the Kilkenny Gas Company and the large industrial user in that area.  Discussions have been going on for a considerable time and I have made every effort to bring discussions to a satisfactory conclusion from the point of view of the Government and the taxpayer.  Any subsidies must be borne by the taxpayers in every area of the country, not just the Kilkenny area. I have tried over the past 18 months to bring the negotiations to a conclusion but unfortunately that has not been possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last Wednesday week the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies met representatives of Bord Gáis?  In reply to a direct question by Deputy Reynolds the chief executive of Bord Gáis indicated that the provision of natural gas to Kilkenny was finished and that no further negotiations were taking place.  He confirmed that position twice when the subject was pressed.  I have the transcript in front of me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the transcript but the reply is correct.  Many months ago I informed the proprietor of <Col N="970" /> the Kilkenny Gas Company at meetings I had with him of the difficulties we were encountering.  I have maintained Government policy in relation to the sale of gas.  Only within that framework can a satisfactory agreement be reached.  If the proprietors of the Kilkenny Gas Company and the substantial private commercial company which could have had a possibility of using gas wish to renegotiate, then Bord Gáis Éireann and the Department will try to facilitate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister is not in contact with members of his own Department since the assistant secretary was also represented at the meeting.

      <P>I am entitled to know once and for all whether Kilkenny city and Smithwicks Brewery are to get a supply of natural gas.  Will the Minister indicate with whom negotiations are taking place?  Is it between Bord Gáis and Smithwicks?  The chief executive officer has said that negotiations are no longer taking place.  Will the Minister confirm that?

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the first part of the question and said that if Kilkenny Gas Company and the industry in the area which has expressed interest in acquiring a supply of natural gas can reach agreement with Bord Gáis Éireann and the Department of Energy in relation to a pricing structure which will fit into the guidelines for the distribution of natural gas, there will not be any difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in reply to a previous question from the Deputy, the State mining lease granted to Tara Mines Ltd. on 19 September 1975 provides for the payment of a royalty of 4½ per cent of the profits of the company as assessed by the Revenue Commissioners for purposes of corporation profits tax.  The profits of the company for tax purposes since the commencement of trading have not yet been agreed with the Revenue Commissioners and consequently no payment of royalty have been made.  The computation of the profits is a complex exercise and is still the subject of correspondence between the inspector of taxes and the company's accountants.</P>
      <P>I do not at this stage have any plans to renegotiate the Tara mining lease, the effect of which was to provide for a total State take of about 66 per cent as compared with about 8 per cent from earlier leases.  The Deputy may be assured that the State's rights will be enforced to the full and in this connection he may recall the vigorous action which was taken last year to prevent the issue of redeemable preference shares which would have seriously prejudiced those rights.  The delay in the receipt of payments by the State has been due to the very heavy capital cost in getting the mine into production and the severe financial losses sustained in the initial years because of low metal prices, industrial relations problems and other factors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC) were established as a limited company in 1979 the then Government decided that they should not be empowered to engage in any kind of exploration activities.</P>
      <P>Recently, certain companies involved in exploration offshore Ireland have sought the INPC's participation, on a carried basis, in their exploration efforts. I have considered this matter carefully and am of the opinion that the INPC should be permitted to accept these invitations, on condition that the interest is small, that it is carried and that the corporation are not liable for costs if no development takes place.  Furthermore, in the case of a development any such interest would be subsumed into the overall State participation.  Arrangements for the necessary amendment to the memorandum and articles of association will be completed over the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> The purpose of the amendment of the INPC's memorandum and articles of association is to provide a mechanism whereby the State may accept offers to participate in the exploration phase of the search for hydrocarbons.  Once a commercial discovery has been established, the State already has the right provided for under the 1975 licensing terms, to participate up to a maximum level of 50 per cent in the development.</P>
    <P>At this point in the exploration of our offshore I consider it appropriate that a State entity should acquire first hand experience without cost to the Exchequer. Furthermore in the case of licences to be awarded under the third licensing round, which closes next Saturday, the criteria for allocation of acreage will be the extent to which consortia are prepared to enter into firm geophysical and drilling commitments in respect of the blocks for which they apply, the consortia's technical competence, financial resources, experience both inside and outside Irish waters and the extent to which they are prepared to commit to the use of Irish goods and services.</P>

    <P>As indicated in reply to a previous question, agreement in principle was reached some months ago between all parties concerned, including the State, in relation to the purchase by Tara Mines Ltd. of all the existing shareholdings in <Col N="978" /> Bula Ltd.  The deal in question has not yet been completed and I am not, therefore, in a position to give the full details.</P>
    <P>Following agreement in principle, the preparation of the necessary contract documents and an examination of certain financial details were put in train.  A number of significant problems emerged in the course of these exercises, which necessarily took some time to resolve.  I am now hoping to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future on the basis of the representations which were made towards the end of 1984 by the parties concerned.  If that should prove possible, I will then make a statement on the details of the transaction.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is merely a repeat of what he said in January. Last December he put on the mantle of Santa Claus and announced the creation of 300 jobs for County Meath by the finalisation of this deal.  He said that details would be announced in a matter of weeks.  Could the Minister say why he failed to reach final agreement, state the problems involved and if he has considered the possibility of appointing a receiver, which may be the only way to sort out the problem?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the number of exploration wells which will be drilled offshore and onshore during 1985; the number drilled in 1984 and 1983; the number of commitments to drilling for 1986; and if he will make a statement of his Department's results and evaluations on the up-to-date position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1985 it is expected that at least six exploration wells will be drilled offshore Ireland but there are no plans for drilling onshore.  In 1984 six exploration wells were drilled offshore and two onshore, while an appraisal well commenced in November 1983 was also completed in 1984.  Six exploration wells were drilled offshore in 1983, and there was none drilled onshore.  For 1986 a number of contingencies, associated with the conditions attached to licences issued in earlier rounds, could affect the precise number of commitment wells which will arise that year.  It is not possible, therefore, to say at this stage what the precise level of drilling will be, as it is also likely to be affected by whatever work commitments may be negotiated in connection with third round bids.</P>
      <P>Exploration offshore has been maintained at a reasonable level to date. Nonetheless, I would like to see the level of drilling increase, especially in view of the very great extent of our offshore area. For this reason I initiated last year the third licensing round with the object of achieving a thorough and expeditious programme of exploration in the Celtic Sea.  Applications under this round are due to be received not later than 15 June 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things involved. First, we have to be very careful in making any comparison that we compare like with like.  The UK offshore area is an established oil producing area.  Our problem at this stage is that we are not and, obviously, until the Irish offshore becomes an oil producing province we are not comparing like with like. Secondly, the clarification of taxation announced by the Minister for Finance last January, and the clarification of State participation by myself, were designed to stimulate interest in offshore Ireland and at this stage one can only forecast that we will have a reasonable response.</P>

At present, I can truthfully say that there has not been a definite taking of a position in favour or against early production systems.  Many people speak of the dangers of early production in relation to the possible damage to the oil fields and all those things are taken into account by us in any consideration in due course.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he accepts all the findings and the recommendations included in the report of the inquiry into Electricity Prices published on 18 January 1985; and, if so, the action both he and the ESB have taken and are taking to implement those recommendations in order to stabilise and reduce the high cost of electricity to domestic and industrial consumers.</P>

      <P>In a press release which I issued announcing the publication of the report of the Inquiry into Electricity <Col N="985" /> Prices on 18 January 1985, I pointed out that the report is comprehensive and covers many complex issues relating to the cost structure, organisation and operations of the Electricity Supply Board.  I also stated that I had referred the report to the ESB for consideration of the recommendations of the inquiry and that the board will be asked in six months time for a report on progress in implementing the recommendations of the inquiry.  That report on progress will be due from the ESB in mid-July next and this will obviously have its effect on the timing of any statement about the implementation of the inquiry's recommendations.</P>
      <P>In regard to action I have taken to reduce the cost of electricity, I announced in the House on 31 January 1985 a reduction in electricity prices charged to industry, ranging from 2 per cent for the smaller users to 6 per cent for the larger users in the ESB's maximum demand customer category.  As the Deputy will be aware the inquiry found that, while Irish electricity prices for industry are higher than those prevailing generally in Europe, domestic prices compare reasonably well with the rest of Europe.</P>

      <P>Apparently we are still awaiting a response from the ESB in regard to this.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to a comprehensive document on rationalisation in the ESB, changes in regions and so on, which was mentioned by a deputation of the staff associations I met last week.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that the ESB will be prepared to discuss this document with the staff associations?  I should like to bring it to the notice of the Minister that various semi-State bodies are creating new regions for themselves which will make nonsense of regional planning in the country in the long term in regard to the ESB and Bord Fáilte.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment of the debate I was referring to the fundamental need to support vulnerable families.  A healthy, well supported and adequate family means that we do not have to have recourse to a lot of the legislation dealt with in the House. We all agree that the ideal is that children be permitted to stay within their own families but that will not come about unless we provide the proper resources to support such families.  I drew attention to the evaluation report on the Wexford Family Centre which was co-sponsored by the Irish Society for the Prevention <Col N="1056" /> of Cruelty to Children and the South Eastern Health Board.  Many of the reports on children and their rights have regretted that we lack research in this area.  I paid tribute to the information and research produced by this evaluation report.</P>
      <P>One of the points raised in this report is in line with the Minister's thinking of getting as many of our health and welfare services into the community rather than institutionalising and centralising them.  I pointed out that the cost of keeping one child in residential care and one teenager in Loughan House, which was open at that time, would have been greater than the entire cost of running the ISPCC family welfare centre in Wexford in 1981. The figures showed that such a centre gave value for money and that even on the economic front the work of the family centre made sense.  The final sentence of the report said that the work of the family centre in Wexford epitomised the type of community based service that recent Ministers for Health had advocated as they endeavoured to shift the thrust of our health and social services from institutional to community care.  This is very much in line with the Minister's statement that the aim would be to bring about a redistribution of resources away from institutionalised towards community services, particularly those of disadvantaged groups.  The Minister might give further study to this evaluation report and have such a service provided on a national scale.  Most of society's ills stem from a background of deprivation and inadequacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter dealt at length with custody and he concluded that there might be a need for a referendum because of constitutional difficulties that might arise under the guardianship legislation. The thrust of this legislation is that the rights and welfare of children will be paramount and that any obstacle, whether constitutional or otherwise, will have to be looked at and firmly dealt with.  I have already asked if our Constitution as it stands will serve the needs of the people for the eighties and the nineties. Rather than having an endless number <Col N="1057" /> of referenda at great expense, we might consider a debate on a bill of rights which would be enable us to have a society based on justice and individual civil rights without having to constantly look over our shoulders or having the Constitution challenged in the Supreme Court by privileged interest groups who have the time and the money to constitutionally obstruct the equalisation of society which we are attempting.</P>
    <P>Again we come back to the need for resources and the back-up needed so that the families at risk, and particularly their children, will be supported and that intervention will be there when it is needed, and not when it is too late.  I have dealt with the urgent need for day care facilities and I have given some idea of how that can be done at little cost to the taxpayers. This could be done by making sure that developers provide facilities when building housing estates.  Another area where help is needed is in home help services. This hits the poorer and more deprived families.  We might consider how effective the rural home help scheme has been in allowing farming families to take time off and having a rota of skilled people who are willing to take over when the farming family wish to take time off or when a member is sick.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's attention the pressure which can be brought on a parent, be it a single parent family or a mother in the home where the father cannot take time off from work.  Regardless of the mother's help or her need for a break, we do not have the network of services to help her.  I realise that I am appealing to a Minister who is committed to community care, but I hope we will be able to set up a similar home help scheme in urban areas to facilitate parents who are under pressure.  This could be done on a sliding scale of payment.  The training of the home help service should not be undervalued, as work in the home is at present.  For families who can only afford to pay part of the cost, we might be able to set up a sliding scale of payments. Those who could afford would pay the full cost but the poorer families would only pay what they could afford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> The Council for the Status of Women explored the possibility of getting money from the European Social Fund to train people to provide this type of scheme. Their idea was to provide a service which would provide social help but would also create employment.  Unfortunately the guidelines were too rigid to allow money to be made available from that fund, but I wonder if the Minister would explore this matter once again to see if we might get this funding now because there are many people who would be keen to have such a scheme and to provide the training for those involved in home help services.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 57 which says that a child care advisory committee under each health board area should be set up.  The Minister said that persons who are not members of the health boards would be members of such a committee.  I welcome that too because the expertise and the experience of these people will add to the value of the board.</P>
    <P>As well as welcoming the regional child care advisory committees, as Deputy Shatter mentioned, we would also welcome an overall national children's council to co-ordinate, standardise and keep in communication with such regional committees.  This national council would be a base, not only for the input from such committees but also for information, providing, perhaps, workshops relating to research.  There is a great need for such co-ordination, particularly having regard to the number of voluntary and statutory organisations working towards the same end but very often in a disparate fashion.</P>
    <P>At a poverty council held in Kilkenny some years ago, Ms. Noreen Carney, who had done some research into the available social services, came to the conclusion that there was a great amount of goodwill and a certain amount of resources, but sometimes these were not effectively used through lack of co-ordination. She instanced a case of a child from urban Dublin attending, in progression, three or four different hospitals where the file would not be transferred from one hospital to another but each hospital would set <Col N="1059" /> up the bureaucratic administrative work. Not alone did that mean incomplete information because of lack of the background to the case, but a huge waste of time and investment at administrative level.  I am sure the Minister and members of his Department are examining that matter.  One would expect the National Children's Council to effectively deal with such cases.  The Kennedy Committee as far back as 1970 recommended that there should be such a national council and stated that not much research was entered into with regard to child care and the need for facilities for children.  Since then, many reports have been published and we are all trying to use the information received from such research to bring about a good Bill, and it is hoped, the necessary resources to back it up.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the type of continuous research referred to by the Kennedy Committee would be part of the work of the national council.  It is through research that our learning becomes complete, our mistakes are eradicated and that a tremendous amount of cross-fertilisation of ideas, sometimes from other countries and from other structures, comes about.  Year by year, more is found out about the development of children, their place and their rights in society and research is of paramount importance here.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with the role of the courts in this legislation.  It is a little depressing that at present the District Courts would be the courts mostly dealing with these cases.  We have research and the experience of other countries to show that District Courts, as now run, are not appropriate or adequate to deal with the whole area of child care and children's rights.  Even as recently as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, a strong recommendation was made for family courts to deal with children in a non-threatening, flexible, fluid fashion, where not alone the children's rights but their welfare would be paramount. It was advocated that they should not be dealt with by a judge who might not particularly be a specialist in that <Col N="1060" /> area.  In other countries, judges for the specialist children's courts, as well as having legal training must have some insight, experience and expertise in child care.</P>
    <P>Such a family court should have not alone the proper back-up welfare system but should allow for all kinds of evidence to be given by social workers, guidance counsellors, psychiatrists, psychologists and any group that could contribute to the welfare of the child and the family. Deputy Shatter suggested, because of the amount of tension, pain and conflict arising particularly with regard to the custody of children, the presence of an independent advocate in such cases, not to take sides but to ensure that there would be the least trauma and pain inflicted on all involved.</P>
    <P>We note the Minister's serious consideration of the effect of volatile substances on youngsters, particularly the dreadfully destructive effect of glue sniffing on very young children.  In section 83 the Minister has brought in legislation to deal with that.  I am sure that other Deputies as well as I would ask that substances which are equally destructive, if not so volatile, such as the early addiction to alcoholic drink and tobacco, be tackled. There is a problem in preventing young children from having access to these substances.  We need to highlight not just the responsibility of persons who would sell such destructive substances to young people but the need for an educational awareness on the part of older people of the harm done, even in goodwill, by purchasing such substances on behalf of those children who cannot obtain them themselves.  There is a certain lack of awareness of the total irresponsibility of so doing and that is the main source of access of young people to alcoholic drink and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Addiction to these substances may not quite so quickly or painfully effect young children as glue sniffing which leads to drug abuse, but there is a huge problem involving rehabilitation for the rest of the children's shortened lives or terrible problems to be overcome in later years at tremendous cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> One matter which has surfaced, of which we must all be aware, is the danger to children from sexual abuse.  This has received far less consideration and there have been far fewer speeches on it than on the ills of drink and drug addiction for young people.  Last week Deputy Ormonde said it was estimated that one in six adult women were sexually abused or assaulted as children.  That is a horrifying figure but in all countries, and particularly in Ireland, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.  We know from the experience of the Rape Crisis Centre that many women have blocked the crime from their memory because it has been so painful and traumatic for them or because they have felt so guilty about it. For far too long in Ireland it has been a taboo subject.  We need to carry out far more research on the subject and I compliment the Minister for giving some funds towards this end.</P>
    <P>We must show openness, honesty and total compassion not only towards the victims but also towards the perpetrators of that kind of sexual abuse.  The crime is so sick and tragic that help is needed certainly for the child and the victim. There is also the need to remove the child from a family when this crime begins.  We must also, with compassion and help, look into the kind of help that needs to be given to an adult who is so perverted and sick that he carries out an act of sexual assault or abuse on a young person.  The intimacy and sacredness of the family has allowed incest within families to continue for far too long with tragic, dreadful results.  A point I welcome very much is that all of this has been brought out into the open.  The Minister has given us statistics but the Members of the House know that the figures are small in comparison with the reality.</P>
    <P>We will have gone quite a way when we have completed the debate on Committee Stage of this Bill.  It is essential that the resources be given to enable us to have the necessary back-up system to help the families at risk, namely, the vulnerable deprived families who will have a sense of guilt and inadequacy <Col N="1062" /> when their children are taken from them. That aspect must be considered very seriously and we must set up the network of support that is necessary.</P>
    <P>We have to make a start at second level education in our schools.  We expect that the resources will be given to back up this legislation and we will also expect that the necessary information and education be given so that we will not have the same number of casualties or the same painful cases coming forward each year.  If all this help is given, fewer families in the future will have to be subjected to measures like this.  The necessary supports must be given to ensure that children are not at risk and that families will not find themselves at the point where their children have to be taken into care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for an updating of legislation to deal with children has been widely acknowledged for a long time by various Ministers and by almost all groups concerned with the welfare of children.  This Bill has been promised for many years by successive Governments but I suppose it is better late than never.  While I welcome the fact that the Bill has been brought before us at last and that even in its present form it will improve the situation, there are many shortcomings in the Bill and many areas that have not been dealt with properly. This is one of three Bills that were promised.  Probably it would have been better and more satisfactory for the House if all three had been brought out together so that we could determine the overall strategy being pursued by the Government in dealing with the problems of neglected children.  Before dealing with the details of the Bill, it is important to put the problems which this Bill sets out to deal with in an overall context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the explanatory memorandum, the Bill sets out to deal with the care and protection of children, particularly those who are neglected, ill-treated or otherwise at risk.  The many good ideas and progressive proposals in the Bill will have little effect if Government policies in other areas lead directly or indirectly <Col N="1063" /> to children being neglected, ill-treated or put at risk.</P>
    <P>Child neglect and ill-treatment are problems found in all social groups but there is no doubt that the incidence of these problems is greatest in families who are under pressure as a result of low income, inadequate housing and general social deprivation.  I maintain that as long as we have poverty and deprivation in society there will be problems of ill-treatment and child neglect.</P>
    <P>Since this Government came back to power tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs.  Unemployment is at an unprecedented level and over 60 per cent of the unemployed are on unemployment assistance, the lower level of payment. Literally hundreds of thousands of children are living in such families and it is reasonable to argue that very few people can manage a family effectively and lead any kind of decent life on that kind of money.  Many of the families concerned simply cannot cope.</P>
    <P>There have been cutbacks in a number of important areas that normally would have assisted families in that category. Last year, for instance, there was a cutback in the clothing grants for children. There has been a cutback in the fuel vouchers scheme and there has been a general tightening up of money available under this supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  All of these factors lead to greater pressures on families already at risk.  Some families simply cannot cope, with the result that children are either neglected or ill-treated.  I would not like it to go out from here that I am suggesting all children who are neglected or ill-treated are the children of the unemployed. That is not the case.  The vast majority of the unemployed succeed in coping with their children and caring for them despite the deprivation in which they find themselves but the reality is that the greater the pressures in terms of finance, bad housing and so on, the greater is the likelihood that children will suffer.  Until we have a society in which poverty and deprivation can be eliminated, children will be neglected and ill-treated.  Those <Col N="1064" /> who determine the economic conditions in which these people have to live must bear some of the guilt for this situation. The Bill will have little impact on the overall problem unless the necessary staff and resources are directed towards implementing the various measures.  In many areas Government services, including the health boards who will have responsibility for administering most of the provisions of this Bill, are suffering as a result of the embargo on the recruitment or the replacing of staff.  The health boards are already stretched to the limit and will clearly not be able to administer this legislation without a massive increase in financial and staff levels.</P>
    <P>We are disappointed that in so many sections of the Bill there is an option for the Minister by the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  For instance, in part 2 in relation to regulations concerning child care, we read that the Minister may make regulations.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is repeated all through the Bill.  This means that the implementation of many of the most important sections of the Bill will depend on the will of the Minister and on his ability to wring the necessary money from the Minister for Finance.  I am not implying that the present Minister is not willing in any sense to introduce these regulations but we have had experience here on other occasions of regulations not being implemented for up to two to three years after the passing of a Bill.  I refer specifically to the legislation relating to private rented dwellings.  That Act was passed in 1982 but some of the regulations were not brought into effect until early this year. Therefore, one realises that there is a need to ensure that in this important area of child care, the regulations are brought into effect within a short time of the Bill becoming law.</P>
    <P>In some respects the priorities in the Bill seem to be wrong.  While four and a half pages are devoted to the custody of a child outside the natural family, there is no reference to the support needed by families to look after their children properly and therefore to ensure that it <Col N="1065" /> does not become necessary for them to be taken from the family.</P>
    <P>There is a general welcome for sections 9 and 10 which deal with the registration of day care service though one can visualise problems in regard to the implementation of these provisions.  We are pleased that the Minister has acted on the recommendation of the Working Party on Child Care in regard to facilities for working parents and for a scheme of registration in respect of day nurseries, crèches and child-minders but it is most regrettable that he has ignored totally the key recommendation of the working party in this area.  On the provision of day care facilities for children, the working party state in their report that day care needs of working parents should be regarded as an aspect of the totality of local community needs and that as such any measure designed to meet these needs should also form part of the total network of community based services which are intended to cater for community needs on a co-ordinated and integrated basis.  The working party went on to recommend that all child care services should be provided through or under the aegis of the community care programmes administered by the health boards.  Section 24 provides that a health board may make available services for the care of children on a daily basis but it is not clear that this is intended to be a fire brigade operation or whether it is to be a regular service.  I trust the Minister will clarify that point when replying.</P>
    <P>The whole usefulness of registration depends on the ability to supervise and enforce it but how are those providing day care services to be made aware of the need for registration?  Obviously, a wide scale and expensive publicity campaign will be required in this respect.  The next question is, who will supervise registration? If the health boards are to perform this task they will need many more personnel than they have now.  Many children of working parents are looked after by child-minders on an informal or a one to one basis.  A working mother may arrange to have her child looked after during working hours by a friend but that <Col N="1066" /> friend will have to register in accordance with the terms of this Bill.  There is the question, too, of the payment of tax. Many child-minders, especially those caring for only one or two children, are not paying tax.  The amounts they earn are quite small.  They should be paying tax if they come within the tax bracket but in many cases if they were to pay tax their earnings would be reduced to such a low level that the effort would not be worthwhile.  One step that should be considered in this context is to render tax deductible the amount paid by the parent to the child-minder.  If working parents could claim tax relief on the money paid to the child-minder it would then be realistic to expect the child-minder to pay tax.</P>
    <P>Regarding private fostering arrangements, this form of child care ideally should be abolished but if it is to continue the controls set out in the Bill are appropriate. Many of those who must avail of foster care for their children are people for whom day care facilities are not practicable, for instance, single parents working on a shift basis and who may have to travel some distance to work or a single mother who is a nurse and who is likely to have to do night work.  In that case normal day care facilities for her child would not be practicable.  Special attention must be given to such categories of persons.  I am sure the Minister is concerned about the number of children who are taken into care but in this regard we must consider the question of financial help in respect of day care facilities.  A high proportion of children in care are the children of single parents but this could often be avoided if there was assistance in respect of day care services.  I am aware that in certain circumstances money can be made available for this purpose but there is a need for broadening the base and for increasing the levels of payment.  If the ideal is that children are looked after in their own homes, section 23 is most disappointing.  This seven line section in a 45 page Bill is the totality of the effort to deal with preventive measures. Having regard to the existing pressures on health board staffs, what <Col N="1067" /> additional resources are to be devoted to them to enable them to comply with section 23 in terms of advice, guidance services and so on?  Will the section mean merely that there will be more children in care?</P>
    <P>Section 29 bestows important powers on the Garda in relation to the taking of children into places of safety.  This raises the whole question of the training of gardaí to deal with these situations, a type of training which I understand is almost non-existent.  On some occasions it may be necessary for the Garda to be involved in these matters.  It is important that it be only those members of the force who have received the necessary training to enable them carry out their functions without causing further distress to what is probably already a very distressed and upset child.</P>
    <P>The question of school attendance is not dealt with at all in the provisions of the Bill.  I understand that it is only in Dublin and Cork cities that there are school attendance officers and that in other parts of the country it is technically a function of the Garda.  This is not an appropriate area for Garda involvement and I am disappointed that the Bill has not tackled this problem at all.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with the question of children who may by the subject of &ldquo;care proceedings&rdquo; and also raises the question of the right of legal representation for parents who may want to contest such proceedings.  The present system of legal aid in civil cases may involve several weeks in order to obtain an interview with a solicitor and is quite unsatisfactory. There is a need to establish the right of parents to adequate legal representation in these cases.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with deals with children who are or who have been in the care of health boards and is welcome.  However, section 45, which requires a review of the progress of each child in the care of a health board every six months would appear to be too long should things go wrong.  Section 47 gives health boards power to assist those who have reached the age of 18 in relation to education, <Col N="1068" /> training and accomodation and is especially welcome.  I hope this provision will be implemented and will not remain just a pious aspiration.</P>
    <P>Part VII in regard to offences in relation to children is welcome in that it constitutes an attempt to deal with the problem.  If we eliminate glue-sniffing &mdash; unless we deal also with the factors leading to this problem &mdash; children will find something else from which to get their kicks.  We know there are stronger, more potent drugs and substances available to them.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the Bill and hope we shall have a fruitful discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members of the House would agree with me that children need love, care and security if they are to develop into full, mature persons. For most children these are provided by a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with their parents, brothers and sisters.  Unfortunately, there is a small minority of children who do not have the benefit of this care, love and attention.  The purpose of the Bill is to update and extend the laws in relation to the care and protection of children, particularly those who are neglected, ill treated or who are otherwise at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should first look at what are a child's needs.  Everybody has certain basic physical and psychological needs &mdash; the need for food, shelter and companionship. Children have special needs in two ways.  First, they have needs similar to those of adults but different in degree and importance.  A child needs food and clothing in the same way as does an adult. But children have certain needs adults do not.  For instance, practically everybody can appreciate the benefits of loving care, but to a child they are of vital importance. A child who is not loved can be irrecoverably damaged.  These needs have been defined and classified by Kemmler Pringle. For practical purposes a four-fold classification would appear to be sufficient &mdash; the need for love and security, for new experiences, for praise and recognition and for responsibility.  These <Col N="1069" /> needs must be met from the beginning of life and continue to require fulfilling throughout adulthood.</P>
    <P>A vital factor in the health and development of a child is the requirement of love and security.  There is a good deal of evidence of the ill effects on a child of their lack, such deprivation in infancy being particularly serious.  Children brought up in families where relations between the parents themselves and between them and the children are disturbed may encounter many problems in relation to personal development and social adjustment.  It is important to the child that people who relate to him or her should relate in a positive way to each other.  Often a child's experience of family life affects his or her experience as a spouse and parent, so that family disturbance in one generation if allowed to remain unresolved will lead to family disturbance in the next.</P>
    <P>The models parents present to their children by their standards, values and their behaviour towards their children have a significant effect on their children's morality and eventual conduct. The provision of love and security for a growing child also involves consistent and intelligent guidance and discipline by its parents in relation to its behaviour so that he or she has clearly defined standards by a reference to which he or she can develop.</P>
    <P>As a prerequisite to mental development a child also needs new experiences. Children who are not sufficiently stimulated because of a restricted and uninteresting environment or lack of incentives to play and talk will fare badly in school and in dealing with new situations they will encounter continuously as they grow.  A child's need for praise, recognition and for responsibility is important also.  He needs to be encouraged, spurred on, by reasonable expectations of his capability.  An unfortunate mistake being made in society today is that more often than not that praise and recognition is given to a child on his or her achievements and not on the effort he or she makes.  Such emphasis can have <Col N="1070" /> adverse effects on children less capable than others.</P>
    <P>Children are expected to grow into responsible adults but they can do so only if given responsibility together with some practice in decision-making.  From an early age children should be encouraged to take decisions for themselves, and in this respect responsibility for decision-making should be encouraged both in the home and the classroom.</P>
    <P>If a democratic society such as ours is to fulfil its obligations to children implicit in its basic ideals then that society must undertake certain functions in respect of children.  While the family has the primary responsibility for the care of children, that does not relieve society as a whole of its overall responsibility for the well-being of its young dependants.  Like other members of society, children have rights, the protection of which ultimately is the responsibility of the whole of society.  In our society certain human rights are specified and guaranteed in our Constitution.  Under our Constitution the State is obliged to respect the rights of all citizens.  This means adverting to the rights of significant minorities such as children.  The State has an obligation to give support to families who have not the ability or the financial means of bringing up their children as they would wish.  At present intervention in the lives of many families comes too late to help with the family.  In the past there has been a tendency to rescue children from inadequate parents with a consequent weakening or a severance of the bond between child and parent, even where that bond was strong and should have been maintained in the interests of the child.  Because of their composition, some families will need extra support &mdash; large families or single parent families.  I am pleased to note that the Minister is strengthening the power of the health boards to provide child care and family support services.  I was pleased to note also that the Minister in his opening remarks said he was particularly anxious to avoid increased costs for parents, something which is vitally important.</P>
    <P>I might turn now to two sections of <Col N="1071" /> the Bill in which I am most interested. Society has the important function of ensuring that alternative care is provided for children who have no family or whose family cannot or will not look after them. Such children are the most deprived. Under present law a health board has the power to take children into voluntary care without recourse to the courts, which is limited to those whose parents are dead, those who have abandoned their children or whose parents are destitute. Section 25 extends the power of health boards to cover many situations in which parents may need to place their children in voluntary care.  Section 33 causes some concern.  This section updates the Children Act, 1908, and extends the grounds on which the courts may place a child in the care of or under the supervision of a health board.  According to this section a child may be the subject of care proceedings under several headings. While I agree with most of them, including ill treatment, neglect, assault or sexual abuse, I have some difficulty in accepting all the grounds specified in the Bill.  The task force in its report on the child care services have differing views in relation to care proceedings.  We are acutely conscious that under existing legal provisions in the Children Act, 1908, the competent authorities are precluded from taking action on some occasions where action is clearly required.  We must find a formula that is not so wide or general as to justify too extensive State intervention.  Two recent authoritative discussions of this issue have led to simliar conclusions.  I refer to Goldstein, Freud and Solnit, 1980, chapter five, and Morris and others, 1980, page 132.  They outlined three grounds for state intervention &mdash; where a child has been abandoned, physically injured or neglected, or where a child has been sexually assaulted.  In both discussions there was concern to provide tangible material to guide the actions of social workers, lawyers, judges and other agents who may be involved.</P>
    <P>Section 33 (b) and (c) are far too vague. Attempts will be made to extend the grounds to justify State intervention.  The <Col N="1072" /> grounds for State intervention are described as inadequate care, likely to cause injury to health, or unreasonable suffering which would substantially impair proper development.  Subparagraph (c) refers to the guardian who is not capable of exercising proper guardianship.  What is proper guardianship?  These definitions are too imprecise.</P>
    <P>Care proceedings should only be initiated if a child is abandoned, physically injured or neglected, or if a child has been abused.  However, there are rare cases of children who should be protected from their parents which are not included in the listed categories &mdash; children who are severely damaged emotionally or mentally by the behaviour of erratic, unstable or uncaring parents.  In these cases the circumstances should be specific and the terms restricted.  I would be glad if the Minister would take into account my anxieties about these sections and have another look at the sections.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which strengthens the law in relation to children who have been compelled to sleep rough, to beg on the streets, to live as vagrants side by side with incapable parents, often as not beyond the reach of State agencies. I am glad to note that penalties will be provided for parents who force their children to beg and that heavy fines will be imposed on persons who sell solvents in certain circumstances to glue sniffing youngsters.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5, which provides new procedures to enable people rearing a child apart from the parents to obtain a custody order to grant them legal custody of the child where the parents are shown to be incapable of providing proper care.  Each year scores of children are confined to a limbo-like existence in which they are separated from their natural parents and sent to live with foster parents with the option open to the natural parents to retrieve the children.  The aim of this section is to protect the interests of the child by affording legal recognition to the relationship of the foster family and securing the child against automatic or hasty interference.  Under the present law a child placed by his <Col N="1073" /> parents in foster care or in the care of a relative may be removed by the parents at any time regardless of how long the child has been in care and regardless of how attached the child might become to his foster parents.  The consequences for many children have been traumatic and the pain for foster parents has been considerable.</P>
    <P>The review committee on adoption services stated that, while they considered adoption to be a beneficial arrangement for a child who lacks the security of a family, it was quite inappropriate in some circumstances.  A generally available means short of adoption by which persons who are bringing up a child apart from natural parents could obtain a legal status in relation to the child would, according to this committee, have considerable merit.  I am pleased that the Minister, in the Bill, took note of these recommendations. I congratulate the Minister for Health on bringing this Bill before the House.  This is a reforming measure which stands to the credit of the Minister and his officials.  It puts children first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general provisions of the Bill.  Sections 23 and 42 give the philosophy behind the Bill in relation to care and protection.  They draw attention to the fact that there is an onus on the health board to identify those who would be at risk and to provide facilities for families to support them and to prevent the risk from becoming a reality and eventually leading to children going into care.  These positive elements of support to families of children who would otherwise be at risk is something that has been overlooked in the commentaries and responses to this Bill.  They are an important element of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is welcome that in section 42 there is a clear statement that when in care there is an onus on the health board to promote the welfare of the child.  This means in the first instance that being with his own family is best and that it is only when that fails that care proceedings should come into play.  In section 42 there is a clear statement that the health board should have regard to the wishes of the <Col N="1074" /> child in choosing the most appropriate system of care.  They are welcome principles. As the Minister pointed out, in this respect we are breaking new ground.</P>
    <P>I question why it is in these sections that the onus being put on the health boards is covered in phraseology such as &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.  It would be preferable to set out positive rights for children and duties on the health board without providing loopholes through which health boards who are less eager in the provision of this sort of service could avoid facing up to their responsibilities. That is important in the light of the fact that already there is patchiness in many of the health boards in the way they respond to child care and protection. Some health boards are far better than others.  In giving a loophole the Minister would avoid his responsibility to provide a national standard for the care and protection of children.</P>
    <P>The Minister, dealing with health boards in other areas where he saw fit to implement a certain national policy, has had quite a degree of difficulty in getting a single standard of behaviour or a single policy implemented.  I would have thought that this was the opportunity to strike a legislative blow for getting a national policy and getting coherence between the health boards in the area of community care.  This is a most outstanding case of community care, where we are seeking to provide care outside of institutions and where we wish to see the health boards beefing up the services they provide to families at risk, just as in the strict health area we are looking for them to beef up the services they provide to families trying to cope with illnesses outside of institutions.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which the Minister could have strengthened the provisions.  He has declared the primacy of retaining children within the family, and it is most welcome to see that he is pledged to supporting the family and sees it as the best place for children.  However, section 23 is the only place where specific mention is made of what could be done. I would have liked to see far more in this Bill about the sort of support service that <Col N="1075" /> could be provided for families.  The Minister listed the sort of things that an innovative health board could do and those ideas are obviously the path to go with providing home help and so on for such families, but it is regrettable that that has not got any expression in this Bill.  I know the Minister would say that footage of print in a Bill will never create resources or direct them into this area, and that is true.  On the other hand, I have seen in many other types of legislation provisions such as requiring that a health board would draw up a plan or programme for the execution of these duties.  I have also seen rights of families to certain support expressed more explicitly.  The Minister drew attention to the fact that 40 per cent of the children coming into care are from one-parent families, and I would have thought that we could have made more explicit in this Bill the sort of additional services we would like to provide for one-parent families and that we would look to the health boards to provide some sort of programme where year on year they would execute that responsibility.  It would have been welcome to see a more definite onus put on the absent parent in the case of one parent families, and I am surprised that this Children (Care and Protection) Bill did not attempt to put a greater onus on the other parent particularly in the case of unmarried mothers where in many cases the father has evaded his responsibilities altogether. Perhaps this Bill is not the area or place to do that, but I would like to see that sort of positive approach to how we can support the families that are at risk, and one way is to have more explicit onus put on the parent who has departed in these cases.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk briefly about the powers in this Bill to take children into care.  The section in which the Garda are given powers to take children who are at risk for their safety is most welcome. Previously the Garda could go in only where an offence had been committed and where there was absolute evidence of abuse, so to speak.  It is welcome that <Col N="1076" /> the Garda should be able to go in the cases specified in the Bill.  I would go even further.  Quite apart from the immediate safety of a child being at risk, where there is gross neglect the Garda should be able to act immediately, particularly since the Bill is very careful to make sure that where the Garda act immediately there is a maximum detention period of three days and that after that they must establish clearly the proof of their case.  There may be a case for extending in that area the cases where the Garda can go in and act as a matter of urgency, otherwise gross neglect can persist and you have to wait for the health boards to come to grips with these issues.  In many cases the Garda are in the front line and they should have the powers if they see fit. Obviously, the Bill will already prevent abuses by the Garda of those powers.</P>
    <P>The question which raises itself here is whether there are places for the Garda to commit these children to.  Many people have drawn to my attention the fact that in Dublin city it is very difficult to find places to which to commit such children who would be victims of gross neglect or whose safety is at risk.  I know that that is not a question for legislation, but perhaps the Minister will deal with that concern which has been expressed to me by people who are working in the field if only to lay at rest fears that the welcome provisions of this Bill can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The other provisions relating to safety orders and the power to delay for up to 14 days the withdrawal of children from voluntary care pending safety orders are all very welcome as is the range that the Minister is offering to the courts of not solely having care provisions but having the possibility of supervision orders or interim care orders.  It is welcome to see that in the first instance people do not have to be committed to long term care where in many cases supervision would be a practical alternative.  One thing that strikes me as anomalous about the Bill is that, while the health board is the person applying in these cases for the orders, it will also be the health board who decide <Col N="1077" /> which types of care are the most appropriate. I know that in the past that has been decided by the District Court, and the Minister said rightly that it is hardly appropriate for the District Court to decide on what is the best type of care, but it seems a little questionable that if it is a case of the health board going for care proceedings against a family, it should be then the health board who decide whether it is to be supervision or care.  I would have thought that there was room for some disinterested adviser to give the courts some steer on what is the most appropriate.  This is not an area in which I have expertise, but I understand that in other countries there are such people, guardians outside of the two people directly involved in the proceedings, who would give some advice.  It would be fairer in this area, where the health boards are being given extra powers to take children into care or to provide the option of supervision, that there should be some outside arbiter to see what would be the most appropriate.  Obviously, the parents would probably prefer to see supervision in those cases if they were contesting, and they should have some outsider who would be holding the ring and seeing that fair play was occuring.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Doyle, I was struck by the fact that the provisions of section 33 which give the instances in which people can be committed to care are very broad indeed.  They are in many ways very subjective, as Deputy Doyle said, and again I feel some worry about not having pinned down to a greater degree words like &ldquo;parents not being capable&rdquo;. Perhaps the ideal response would be to have some sort of disinterested group who would advise the court on what was involved apart from the two parties to the proceedings.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has deliberately framed these provisions very widely in order to give expression to the child's rights as against the rights of the parents. I can understand why he would wish to do so.  I wonder are the provisions very loose.  It might be decided to prevent the release of a child from a maternity unit <Col N="1078" /> and not allow the child to go home to the parents on the grounds that the parents were not capable.  That would be desirable in some cases, but I wonder whether in the interest of civil liberties the law should be a little more explicit about what incapability means.  Like Deputy Doyle I should like the Minister to pin that down because the power will be so wide.  As I said, a child might not be allowed home from a maternity hospital.  That is possible under the provisions of this section. I should like the Minister to tighten up the section.</P>
    <P>There is the possibilty of friction between a long term care institution to which a child was committed under a care order and the social workers who were working with the family before the care proceedings were taken.  The Bill has not addressed this question to any great extent.  When a child is committed to care and goes to a private institution not directly under the health board, is there a problem about who has custody of the child?  Is it the social worker working with the family or is it the institution where the child is in care for the time being?  The social worker working with the family is bound to feel that the child can be taken back by the family.  The thinking of the social worker is bound to be coloured in that way.  Perhaps there are some cases where family support will not work.  The Minister may have to decide whose word will be taken if there is friction between somebody acting on behalf of the family within the health board and someone acting on behalf of the institution.  I do not know how serious the possibility of friction is.  I understand some institutions are concerned about not being able to retain custody of the child in these cases.</P>
    <P>I may not be doing justice to the Bill but on reading it I did not see that a great deal of attention was given to children wandering about on the streets.  The bulk of the Bill seems to be devoted to children who are attached to families who are found wanting in some way.  What does the Bill do about children who are wandering on the streets?  Does it force them to accept some form of care?  I should like the Minister to spell that out.  Many <Col N="1079" /> children are not even loosely attached to families.  A Bill dealing with the care and protection of children should address itself to this issue.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the area of care and homes in which children might be placed, I want to say I am surprised and a bit disappointed that, in setting standards for such homes, the Bill excludes health board homes from the ambit of such regulations. Perhaps health board homes are always exemplary but there should be inspections to ensure that they are up to the standards in the legislation.  I do not see why any public institution should necessarily be excluded from the sort of standards which will be imposed on private institutions.  It would be to the benefit of all if health board homes were included in the section.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the area of fostering and custody.  It seems reasonable to remove the requirement for the consent by parents to fosterage.  Under the present legislation consent must be obtained from the parents before children can be fostered.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is changing that and making the security of a home more accessible to children.  When a child has been in care and for some time it becomes obvious that the natural parents are not in a position to provide a home for the child, the requirement for consent could go.  We may be going too far by waiving the obligation to get the consent of the parents from the first day the child goes into the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>Another very difficult problem is the question of arbitrating between foster parents and natural parents in the event of a dispute.  The problem is made more complex than it need be by the fact that at present adoption is not possible in the case of legitimate children.  Probably children are being fostered in Ireland in many cases where adoption would be the more correct procedure.  Presumably the Minister will get to grips with that problem in the next Bill.  I am not sure that what he has provided in the Bill locks in adequately with what will happen in future on the adoption side.  There is a <Col N="1080" /> danger in this Bill that it may become the norm for foster parents to seek custody orders to make a fostering arrangement into something closer to an adoption arrangement.  I am a little concerned about that.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the whole idea of fostering is to retain a close link with the natural parents and to retain access to children with the ultimate objective of returning the child to the natural parents. We may be standing the issue on its head if, in order to prevent the arbitary removal of children from foster parents, we set up this custody order procedure which may become the norm for fostering arrangements and may be used by foster parents who see the natural parents as interlopers to squeeze out the natural parents.  It would be most regrettable if this custody order procedure became used in that way.  I know that is not the intention of the Minister and that he sees this custody procedure as a normal occurrence. As it is now framed, I am worried that it might become quite typical in foster arrangements.  I would ask the Minister to look at that danger.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that in this section there is no presumption of access for the natural parents stated.  It is left to the court's discretion, entirely without an indication in the law that it is the view of the Oireachtas that the natural parents should have such access.  It is more appropriate that the law should clearly state that we see access as being the norm, even in cases of custody orders.  It should only be in very exceptional circumstances that there should not be access.</P>
    <P>I am also surprised that in this section there is no explicit recognition of the interests and the wishes of the child.  The Minister hammered in that provision where he was dealing with care but it is not provided here where we are dealing with custody.  An explicit recognition of the interests and the wishes of the child could avoid some of the worst cases that this custody order procedure is designed to meet.  I understand that children are sought by their natural parents when they come near to earning age, despite the fact that they have shown no interest up <Col N="1081" /> to then.  An explicit recognition of the interests and wishes of the child which would gain force as the child grew older would be a very effective way of dealing with the case of a natural family who sought back their child only when they thought they would get a few bob out of his pay packet.  Is this custody order not going a bit too far and why are these points absent?</P>
    <P>An issue I raised on section 33 arises again in relation to this provision, where the grounds for custody are the incapacity or unwillingness of natural parents to retain a child.  In legal terms I understand that &ldquo;having the wish&rdquo; would mean that they would have to have shown practical evidence of their wish over the years by being close to the child and taking an active interest.  Are those grounds for custody a little bit loose?  Is there the danger that the foster parents might see the natural parents as interlopers and go to court, showing that they &mdash; the foster parents &mdash; were able to provide a far better home and education for the child than the natural parents?  Could the court under the terms of this legislation grant a custody order in that case and effectively close out the natural parents, even though they might be able to provide in time quite adequate home circumstances? Once the custody order is granted the supervisory role of the health board is wound down and no longer operates. I would be somewhat concerned about that.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains many welcome features in its provisions for the care and protection of children.  I am glad that in dealing with the problem of abusive substances the Minister has not fallen into the trap which exists in the case of alcohol abuse.  It will not be the case that prosecutions cannot be brought against anybody for supplying solvents.  That is a welcome provision.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill and hope that on Committee Stage he will look at some of the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Children Bill.  It has been long awaited.  While it <Col N="1082" /> certainly has its merits, it also has its limitations.  These limitations are inherent in the structure and composition of the Bill itself.  I would have preferred to see on Children Bill dealing comprehensively with children's rights and issues.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to speak solely and exclusively of the care and protection of children without speaking about the retention of children.  Deputy Bruton raised the question of where children are to be retained when they are taken into care without warrant by the Garda. These issues are closely interwoven and interconnected and one Children Bill dealing with all the issues would have been more worth while.  It must be remembered that we have not had a Children Bill since 1908 and this would have been an ideal opportunity to give clear evidence of our commitment to a charter of children's rights.  There seems to be much ambiguity in the matter.</P>
      <P>I came into this House nearly five years ago and I believe the House has not been very concerned with children <i>per se.</i> I have often been baffled and bemused as to the reason.  The only conclusion I can come to is that children do not have votes and do not warrant vital attention.  That is evident here today.  The local election campaigns are taking place and Fianna Fáil have not put even one speaker forward on this Bill today.  That is an appalling situation.  This is a vitally important Bill which has not received the attention and recognition it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has its merits but it leaves me somewhat perplexed.  It goes some way down the road but always seems to stop short.  The Minister said in his speech that a child should be kept in the family as far as possible or alternatively in a substitute family.  In regard to section 16, he went further to say that it is in line with the policy of promoting foster care as the first option in caring for children apart from their families and preventing unnecessary or inappropriate use of residential care. I am in favour of a policy which tries to steer away from institutionalised care for children.  The Minister emphasised the need for institutionalised homes.  We can see the need for a small number of such <Col N="1083" /> homes to deal with cases of emergency or short term crises but the 41 homes we have for children are far too many.  In 1985 we should not have 1,100 children in residential care.  I know that in an ideal world there would be no need for residential care.  However I do not believe in a policy which advocates long term institutionalised care for children. That cannot serve the best interest of any child.  All children would benefit from being brought up in a family or substitute family.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister move further away from the concept of residential homes and institutionalised homes. There are plenty of adults who would be willing, if given an opportunity, to bring up children and give them the care, protection and education they need.</P>
    <P>I welcome the standardisation of day care services for children such as crèches, pre-schools, playschools and so on but the Bill is too vague in this area and merely states that the Minister will set the standards and see that people are suitably qualified.  Here was an opportunity to set out in detail the standards and qualifications that would be required so that those operating pre-schools, playschools and so on would be able to prepare and plan for the new standards which would be laid down by the Department. I hope these standards will not be introduced overnight.  As we know, many people are unemployed and the husbands of those who run playschools and so on might be out of work, so the financial resources that would be necessary to bring schools up to the required standard might not be available for some time. Those who run the schools would need to plan and budget in order to bring them up to the required standard.  I ask the Minister to set out standards as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we do not deal with the nitty gritty in Bills that come before the House.  For example in this Bill there is reference to the health boards and they are given great power.  Who are the health boards?  Are they the managers, social workers, doctors, psychiatrists or <Col N="1084" /> solicitors of the health boards?  We need to know this before we can thrash out the various sections of the Bill.  Different standards operate in the eight health boards.  There should be a uniform standard of operation in order to enact the provisions of the Bill properly.  The health boards can play a tremendous role but they must be given the personnel and financial resources to do so.  It is easy to say that our function is to legislate but there is little point in legislating if legislation cannot be implemented.  We have had experience of health boards in the past and at times they left much to be desired.</P>
    <P>In relation to fosterage the Bill goes half way down the road and then stops. The only new measure in the Bill is that health boards do not need the parents' consent to place children in foster homes. However, there are problems when the children are in the homes.  One can take out a custody order but this can be challenged. I know of a case recently where foster parents had children for three years.  Their mother was a schizophrenic and their father an alcoholic.  When a High Court action was taken the natural parents were given the two children even though the mother's psychiatrist made the case that she was incapable of looking after them and all the evidence pointed to that but the judge said the natural parents had a primary right and the children were placed back with them.  This creates tremendous heartbreak for the foster parents.  If a child has been in foster care for six or seven years foster parents should be allowed to adopt him or her. Children have their rights as well as parents.  Children should be entitled to the security of a family home.  There are not enough children available for adoption. Many parents who foster children would be delighted if they could adopt them but at present there is no provision for that.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling that foster children should have access to their natural parents but I wonder about the merit of this, particularly in the case of a young child.  A young child of two or three years cannot cope with having two mothers and <Col N="1085" /> two fathers.  None of their friends would have two sets of parents and they could be confused as regards their own identity and sense of self.  That is a reason why I believe adoption is a better alternative to fosterage.  I know there are legal difficulties attached to many aspects of fosterage. The Minister pointed them out in his speech and said it was a delicate issue. I am not a legal expert but I am sure that if there is a will then there will be a way.</P>
    <P>The sections of the Bill relating to the sale of solvents is disappointing.  The Bill increases fines and terms of imprisonment for those who sell solvents but more needs to be done.  Just as in the case of drugs or contraceptives people will get their hands on them regardless of whether there is a restriction on their sale.  The same applies to glue.  The problem lies in trying to prevent children from engaging in glue sniffing.  It is very hard to get across to an eight or nine year old through advertising and so on that they should not sniff glue.  The child will want to belong to the group who are sniffing glue, regardless of any warnings they may have been given.  During a by-election about two and a half years ago we visited St. Michael's flats in Inchicore where all the children were glue sniffing.  I do not think that the answer to the problem is putting them in jail.  Deputy Bruton mentioned children wandering around the streets at night and the same applies in that case.  The Bill does not seem to cover these two categories, so I ask the Minister if something could be done.  Perhaps there could be specially trained gardaí to cope with children in areas of delinquency. Our children are the basis of the nation and if we had laid good foundations at an early age the problem of crime would not be as bad as it is today.</P>
    <P>More money should be directed into personnel and staff, facilities and voluntary organisations who deal with young people and who are prepared to give them direction in their lives.  Social workers in the health boards and other areas do a great job in assisting families with problems, but when it comes to the crunch the social worker does not take the final decision in regard to the welfare <Col N="1086" /> of the family even if he or she feels that certain children should be put into care. Everybody tries to help but nobody wants to take a harsh decision.  Those who are professionally employed should never give up on cases, even if they think they are hopeless.  They should indicate that, although in their opinion it is a hopeless case, there must be an alternative.  Social workers should have to make final decisions. There is provision in the Bill for intervention by the Garda in a family crisis, but I am sure that social workers would be in a better position to cope with crises than the Garda.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage and I hope there will be more details then in regard to créches and to the authority of the health boards in the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, as we have waited a long time for it.  We are over 80 years into this century and it is only now that we are attempting to update legislation in relation to children. The Bill is very important; and in the process of this legislation and the two Bills which are to follow we should achieve major reform which will stand the test of many decades.</P>
      <P>There are many welcome provisions in the Bill including the area dealing with the registration of crèches, pre-school play groups and so on.  These are massive growth areas, and many young people attend unsupervised crèches and play groups.  I also welcome the improvements in the potential of the health boards to intervene and to act where children are in danger of serious neglect or abuse. This should ensure that children who might have been neglected and abused in the past will now be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as other Deputies said, the Bill does not go far enough.  It falls short of being a full charter for children and establishing fundamental rights for children because it treads warily in regard to the Constitution.  This issue cannot be avoided forever.  The Constitution strongly favours the rights and privileges of the family and the rights of the child are regarded as secondary by the courts. <Col N="1087" /> Even in a recent court case the rights of the family superseded the rights of the child and Deputy Shatter referred to this in his long and excellent contribution. The attempt to produce this legislation without facing up to the need for a constitutional referendum to establish the fundamental rights of children has led to a deflection of the potential impact of this legislation and pussy-footing around the problem.  Although it improves legislation in regard to children, it stops short of a total statement on the primary rights of children and, in cases of conflict, it undermines the ability of the Bill to do what it set out to do.</P>
    <P>The task force, in preparing for this legislation, wondered whether our existing law in relation to the custody of infants was constitutional.  This issue should have been faced and it may yet have to be faced.  We should have framed a Bill which openly established the rights of children to basic standards of life, happiness and opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Bill outlines the instances where children may be taken into care and, in a negative way, hints at a positive statement as to the opportunities children should have in society.  Those of us who care cannot close our eyes to the number of children for whom the quality of life is very inadequate.  At the early age of six months they do not receive much of an opportunity to thrive and succeed.  Perhaps, even in the womb they are given in inadequate opportunity to thrive.  Three or four years on many children are seriously neglected.  It is unsatisfactory that society, and politicians, stand back and allow that to continue.  I am afraid we have not gone far enough in the legislation to minimise those problems.</P>
    <P>Recommendations in the report of the task force formed the basis for a lot of the provisions before us, but it is clear that there has been a significant stepping back from the commitments demanded by the task force.  The area of school attendance is not dealt with in the Bill, although this is the appropriate legislation to deal with that matter.  A failure to attend at school is often one of the <Col N="1088" /> early warning signs that a child is being neglected, abused or not being supervised adequately.  That early warning signal is only available in certain urban areas. The fact that it has not been included in the Bill means that an important opportunity has been missed to maximise this important early warning system in the case of children at risk.</P>
    <P>The Bill is largely about children at risk, apart from the provisions in regard to pre-school and other child care services. There should have been a positive statement on the needs of children and the necessity for a certain quality of life. The only statement about the type of life children ought to be entitled to is in the negative, where we indicate the circumstances in which children can be taken into care.  There should have been a positive statement of the needs of children. Deputy Doyle spoke of the need for security and the need for love, but another important one is the need for discipline.  An important element of caring for any child, as I learned in two years, is the need for discipline and direction in a loving environment.  That whole area of caring, loving and disciplining a child is something a large section of our population never experienced.</P>
    <P>While the pre-school child care area is regulated in the Bill, it is not identified as something of significance.  Health boards are encouraged to develop pre-school facilities in areas of deprivation but a commitment in regard to that should have been written into the legislation.  I know that in making that statement I am re-echoing the views of many Members. There should have been an indication of responsibility to provide certain minimum services for the general body of young people and the deprived.  The Bill fails to acknowledge what is being done in this area.  I accept that the legislation states that the health boards may provide certain services, but many Members hold the view that there should be an obligation to provide support services for families in need.  There should be an obligation on health boards to provide special fostering and care services for those who are not being cared for <Col N="1089" /> adequately by their families.  There should have been a positive comment on the right of a child to have a certain quality of life, to thrive, develop and mature and not just a statement that a child should not be abused.  I welcome the fact that many of the areas where children may be deprived of their rights are dealt with in the sections on care and custody, but a positive statement would have been better.</P>
    <P>The foster care services are rightly given great emphasis in the Bill.  I should like to express my appreciation of the commitment of the small and overworked section dealing with child care in the Department of Health.  They have done tremendous work developing that service. There is no doubt that the developments changed the way we cared for children and ensured that children who cannot be cared for at home are given an opportunity of being looked after in another family setting.  That is desirable and fits in well with the great Irish tradition of foster care.  It was not the deprived but the most privileged in society who for a variety of reasons took advantage of the potential of foster care.  For our needs a fostering service has great potential.</P>
    <P>From my experience as a representative for an area where there is a lot of deprivation, many single parent families and a big number of children in need of special support and care, I am aware that the fostering service is a very flexible and varied one, whether we are talking about day, short term or long term fostering. All credit must be given to the Department of Health for developing that service. It is a sensitive, flexible and human way of dealing with the many children who need occasional or long term care. We must continue to develop it.  However, we will still have a need for specialised residential units for young people.  I have the same difficulty that Deputy Barry had in trying to separate that from the care of children who fall foul of the law.  The Bill before us should impose an obligation on health boards to provide child care services.  There is no doubt that there is a need for residential units whether they are for custodial or care <Col N="1090" /> reasons.  In the future we hope that any custodial units where children are held will involve care.  Any child who comes into custody clearly has not been given an opportunity to thrive in our society and the majority of those between the ages of 14 and 16 who may be in need of custody are clearly in that category.</P>
    <P>While there is a great need for services for those in need of emergency or special care, there is also a great need to help people under stress.  This was recognised in the task force report and this Bill is totally inadequate because it does not provide support for families who are likely to be under stress.  The task force report identified the potential of neighbourhood resource centres as support for families offering a range of services from crèches, to drop-in centres, advice groups, and so on, a full range of services which would meet the needs of families identified as most likely to have been at risk for neglecting or abusing their children.  These centres were a desirable development but the Eastern Health Board purchased two premises, one in Ballymun and one in Finglas.  The first was acquired at some expense three or four years ago and has been allowed to lie idle all the time while there has been a great need for such a service because there were very few buildings which could be put to such a use.  I appreciate the economic times we live in but in that community there is a fund of local commitment and goodwill which, if harnessed, could be utilised to develop the centre with the support of the health board.  It is totally unsatisfactory that that resource was left idle by the Department with only a caretaker there and this building is deteriorating day by day.  The task force and every organisation involved in the care of children pointed out that tragedies could be averted if families were supported in time, and these resource centres have been recognised as a way of providing that support.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to impose in this legislation more specific responsibility on the health boards to provide a full range of services, including family support services and other care units which may be <Col N="1091" /> necessary to develop a system of fostering. Such a system involves a commitment from the health boards &mdash; which may be excellent in one area but not in another &mdash; to develop flexible fostering services, which may include day fostering or short and long term fostering, and that involves a commitment to identifying, recruiting and training potential foster parents.  This legislation is not sufficiently demanding of the local health boards to develop these services so that the needs of families before and after the crisis are met.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the needs of the family, which is an integral part of dealing with the needs of children, I believe the Government's progress on the child benefit proposal will be extremely important.  The level of payments to mothers to care for children in the form of children's allowance is clearly inadequate. Most European countries have moved a great distance beyond us in acknowledging financially the importance of children.  We have been more casual about our children because we have had an expanding birth rate, unlike many European countries, but the time will come when we too may have reason to value our children and the role of parenting in the only way which can be identified and that is by adequate financial recompense.  The child benefit proposal &mdash; a substantive £30 per child per month &mdash; which is to come into operation next year will be a help in this direction. This was identified by many who had studied child care as one way of ensuring that the level of deprivation which could encourage an atmosphere in which children could be abused or neglected would be removed.  This is to be welcomed.  This Bill should include a recognition of the need to deal with the social circumstances in which there might be a tendency towards abuse or neglect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter dealt with an area which is missing from this Bill but hopefully will be included in the final Children Bill.  There is no doubt that our children's courts are inadequate and we need a proper family court structure and a proper children's court structure in an <Col N="1092" /> environment that will minimise the trauma for children who are already suffering too much.  This is extremely important.  The task force report recommended the establishment of a national children's council.  In this Bill the Minister provides for a local advisory committee. This too is to be welcomed but he might consider establishing a national children's council because it would be unsatisfactory if we closed the pages on this legislation and another 80 years elapsed before anybody thought actively about the needs of children and before legislators again looked at the needs of children.  To ensure that this does not happen, it is important that such a council be established.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for health boards to identify situations where children are like to be at risk.  I welcome the principles on which this Bill is established.  Children should be maintained in their own families where possible, but if that is not possible, children should be maintained in families.  We must face up to the fact that there are many children who are not given the opportunity of a proper family life.  We have seriously neglected these children.  We have allowed them to live in circumstances which provide them with very little opportunity of having a happy and constructive life.  I believe this Bill is the place to face up to this problem.</P>
    <P>While we absolutely support the desirability of children being reared in their own families, we must accept that in many situations if this were to happen a great injustice would be done to the individual child.  We must accept our responsibility to that child and we can only do so if we establish in this legislation the right of the child to certain basic opportunities which can best be defined in the phrase &ldquo;the right to thrive&rdquo;.  It is not enough to say that children must not be abused or neglected.  We must say that children must be given the opportunity to develop and mature and have the love, security and discipline that they need if they are to have an equal chance, or some chance, of being happy children and happy adults.  Society needs this and the <Col N="1093" /> children need it.  We must take courage and act for those children and face up to the fact that there are parents who are seriously neglectful of their children.  We should not be afraid to ensure, where those circumstances prevail, that the rights and needs of the children are protected.</P>
    <P>It is my experience that, perhaps due to lack of adequate legislation, the social services go too far in supporting families who are seriously neglectful of their children in so far as they prop up and maintain situations in which there is clearly danger to the child developing mentally and, in extreme cases, danger to life or of physical or mental injury.  I hope that this legislation will tip the balance a little more in favour of that child and ensure that the sad cases referred to by Deputy Shatter will be less likely to occur.  The health boards should have more opportunity to intervene.  In so far as it goes some distance alone that road, this legislation is welcome and will have honoured, to a significant degree, our commitment on entering Government, as early as 1981-82, in all our legislative programmes, to major reform of children's legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill has not gone as far as other Deputies and I might have liked, but I hope that its progress through the House may see it develop and perhaps strengthened in some way.  I hope that the Minister will reply to some of the points that I and other Deputies have raised and will be open to including some of these matters in the later stages of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other speakers, I welcome this Bill, which is being introduced to update legislation which originally was very far-seeing in its own way. However, as the Minister said, many changes have come about since then in the whole structure of our society and it is not before time that we are dealing with the first of three Children Bills relating to that section of our community which is the most vulnerable by age and innocence and must be protected very carefully by the laws of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> I am deeply disappointed that members of the Opposition have not been offering as speakers on this very crucial Bill.  It is one which will be widely welcomed by all Members of the House.  I am sure it is disappointing to the Minister that he is not getting some of the views of the people on the Opposition benches. If he would privately admit it to me, I am sure that Deputy O'Hanlon is also disappointed not to have the views of Members from his own back benches, so that these may be incorporated into any changes that might be required in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are shortcomings in the Bill, but I have sat behind this Minister on Committee Stages of a number of Bills introduced by him into this House and I am sure that he will be willing to listen to Members who have experiences they wish to share with him and wish to see reflected in this Bill.  That is why it is so disappointing that very few of the Fianna Fáil Members have been willing to share their experience in this matter.</P>
    <P>Let us face facts.  As public representatives for a number of years, we are very well equipped with experience relating to drawbacks and legislative failures which have affected children.  All too often, sadly we have seen the results of the lack of legislative powers on the part of the Garda and our health services to save young children from battering, or at times from death.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to share some of these experiences.  It is the first of three Bills promised by the Minister, which I would see as an effort to tackle a number of the areas of child care.  There is almost a hierarchical structure in the area of child care and no uniformity.  We cannot say that we will have to deal with children from a certain deprived area.  Through all the social strata of our society, there are children in need of care and attention and these can come from the most opulent of homes and from the poorest.  To tackle the area of children who appear to us to be most deprived, from the homes of unemployed, from the itinerant sector of the community, children who have been <Col N="1095" /> abandoned, is not to tackle the whole problem.  Children from very well off families can badly need care and attention from the State and the structures of the State should allow entry to their homes to save them from harm.</P>
    <P>The stresses and strains of the society in which we live have increased the dangers attached to the upbringing of some children.  The stresses of unemployment, the desire to have much more material wealth and of increased alcoholism have added to the problems of the health boards.  This Bill certainly is a first step and will go part of the way to improving the services which are now available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment, although I am disappointed at the length of time taken to get this first Bill before the House.  However, I recognise that the area is very complex and complicated and many reports have been prepared which the Minister must examine, with his advisers and his staff, to ensure that this Bill has addressed as many problems as possible which need addressing.  I welcome his commitment and that of the Government to introduce two further Bills, one dealing with the whole area of adoption and one dealing with juvenile justice &mdash; two areas in which all Members of this House have called for changes over the years.  I hope that we shall see those two Bills coming on to our Statute Books as quickly as possible in the next session of this Dáil.</P>

The Minister pointed out it is estimated that about 20,000 children are attending pre-school crèches or day care centres.  I suggest that many of them are attending such centres out of sheer necessity and nowadays it is essential that such services be available.  We have equality legislation that ensures that women have a right to employment and to equality of employment. We must have available to parents services that will allow them to share in employment if that is what they wish.  Not every parent or mother will wish to work outside the home but those who wish to or who are compelled to should have available the necessary services.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that at the moment 230 voluntary day care services were being financed by health boards.  They cater for about 6,000 children at a cost of £1 million per year.  That works out at about £170 per child and it is very good value for money.  Section 24 provides for health boards to set up day care centres. I hope the Minister will do his utmost in the Cabinet to get money for this purpose in next year's budget.  Those centres are of crucial importance in society today in the light of the increase in one parent families and of the pressure on women to work where the spouse who was formerly the chief breadwinner is out of work. In many instances women get jobs to support their families.</P>
      <P>Section 9(1) states as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may make regulations <Col N="1098" /> for the registration by each health board:</P>
    <P> (a)  of premises in its area, other than premises wholly or mainly used as private dwellings, where children are received regularly to be looked after for reward for such periods of the day as may be prescribed; and</P>
    <P>(b)  of persons in its area who for reward regularly receive into their homes children to be looked after for such periods of the day as may be prescribed.  </P>
    <P>The section provides for the regulating of the premises and also refers to the person involved but it does not say what kind of qualifications such a person should have. I hope the Minister will confirm that some standard will be set down for the persons who will be registered and allowed to run day care and crèche facilities.  It is a huge responsibility to take children into one's care and it is essential that people should know what qualifications are necessary. We have to be careful that we do not set out all kinds of academic qualifications and training as being necessary because this would put it outside the reach of many kind and loving people who could provide this care.  However, minimum standards should be set down so that a mother can be confident that the person in a day care centre who is charged with the responsibility of looking after a child from 9 a.m. until noon or 6 p.m. is competent, caring and able to do the job.</P>
    <P>I did some research before I came into the House to speak on the Bill and I came across the <i>Irish Journal of Sociology,</i> Autumn-Winter 1983, volume 7, No. 4. In that publication there was an article by Dr. Denis O'Sullivan, who is a statutory lecturer in Sociology of Education, in the Department of Education, UCC.  He carried out a survey of pre-schooling as a community resource in the Cork area. A plebiscite of parents in the area was carried out of people who were sending their children to pre-school education, asking them to set out what they hoped to get out of the pre-school system and what they wanted for their children.  They <Col N="1099" /> were given a number of choices.  More than half the parents ranked as most important the developmental function of the child.  They were seeking a place where their children could meet at an early stage with children of their own age group so that they might relate to others of their own age and grow up to be well balanced human beings.</P>
    <P>A number of other areas were categorised to varying degrees by the parents.  If the Minister has not read that article I suggest that his staff give it some consideration. It sets out the expectations and the aspirations of parents in the Cork area in regard to pre-schooling.  In recognising the expectations of parents in this matter, the Minister will be able to assess the kind of qualifications I spoke of earlier in the context of persons wishing to provide pre-schooling facilities.  Some parents regard as very important the provision of pre-school facilities in order to give a busy mother a break from her children while others regarded the playschool as important in the context of it being a place where children could play safely and be looked after.  To those, it was seen simply as a basic child-minding service.  Each parent or group of parents have different ideas both in terms of what they require of the State and what they wish for their children.  Another section of the parents surveyed considered that the playschool ought to be a place where children are given a good start for regular school.  All these criteria should be examined so as to ensure that, in devising the regulations both in respect of individuals and premises, the function of the day care centre be taken into account with the Minister applying relevant qualifications to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>For a relatively small expenditure a number of the problems of the less disadvantaged children, but children who need some care, should be tackled.  I am thinking of the provision of good and relevant day-care services.  In this way we could minimise the number of children coming in at the lower end, those who need a lot of care and protection.  If we could cream off, as it were, some sections of those <Col N="1100" /> children who require attention by way of the provision of a better day care service, we would be helping greatly parents who are experiencing stress within the family. By reason of some relief being available the stress factor could be dissipated instead of reaching catastrophic proportions as often happens when there is no help available.</P>
    <P>In the light of the controversial areas that the Government have been dealing with so courageously in the past few years I become very upset and disappointed when I hear remarks to the effect that some of the moneys being paid by the State are anti-family or anti-Constitution and are devices to undermine the family. Obviously, payment is not made directly to children; but when we provide moneys for deserted wives and unmarried mothers we are helping and protecting the children concerned.  These payments must be seen as a means by which the State assumes the responsibility for children who have no jurisdiction as to what form of family unit they are born into. I am saddened when very often I hear otherwise concerned people referring to these benefits are anti-family.  These payments are pro-children, pro the most vulnerable section of the community.  For so long as we continue to have these social problems the State must ensure that the children concerned are assisted in every way possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have spoken at length about that section of the Bill which deals with foster care, both in the private arena and in the context of the health boards.  The whole area of child care was treated for far too long as something kind of sissyish, something that should be left to the women; but in recent years there has been a much more enlightened approach by all sections of the community and by all Departments of State to this area.  There is now much more recognition of the effect of children on people's lives.  There is a greater recognition by employers, for instance, that there are problems in families who have difficulties with children and that sometimes this will affect people's availability for employment and will therefore cause them to be <Col N="1101" /> absent from work.  Therefore, employers should be more understanding in regard to the problems experienced by parents who have difficult children or by parents who have difficulties apart from those caused by their children and who consequently may have difficulty in coping with their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Because of the more enlightened view in this whole area the stigma that attached to fostering has been removed.  Fostering is now a much more recognised and respected area of child care than was the case before.  It would be a sad day that we would see the demise of fostering. I welcome the Bill, particularly in terms of its laying down the format that will strengthen the position both of children who are fostered and of the people who foster them and, of course, of natural parents, too.  However, I am concerned that the Bill ought to go a little further. The main thrust of the Bill is the protection of children.  Its purpose is to ensure that children will not suffer because of their circumstances.  While I accept that certain rights must be respected in so far as natural parents are concerned, the right of the child must be paramount. Because of that I, too, welcome the Minister's comments, but I would like to see included in the Bill some mechanism whereby a couple who had fostered a child for, say a minimum of six years, those years being the formative years of the child, would find it easier to adopt the child if they so wished.  A case was brought to my attention recently in which the whole saga of a child almost broke up the fostering family.  That case concerned a couple who already had two children and who fostered a little girl of four.  When the child was put into their care she was in extremely bad condition. She was totally uncared for, very backward, when she went to school she was at the bottom of the class &mdash; a very frightened, unloved child.  Those people fostered that child until she was 13.  In those seven or eight years the child's natural ability was displayed because of the nurturing and love she got in that home.  She progressed to being at the top of the class and became a respected member of the <Col N="1102" /> school she was attending.  In those seven or eight years the natural mother paid no attention to the child, never visited her and had no interest in her well-being. When she reached the age of 13 the natural mother claimed her and, with the law as it obtains, she was returned to her natural mother and was put on the streets.  She is now approximately 17 years of age and is on the streets.  The foster parents of that child had to sit back, seeing seven or eight years of love, care, work and responsibility go for nothing, seeing a child's life ruined.  Our laws appear to be more orientated to the rights of a natural parent, who in this case did not care tuppence for her own child.  I am not condemning that natural mother; there may have been good, valid reasons she gave that child up for fostering.  But it is pathetic that that young child of 13 could be returned or revert into a hopeless situation and that the law was helpless in getting her back to her foster parents.  The effect on the growing children of the foster parents was devastating. It was a couple of years before that family settled back into their own way of life again.</P>
    <P>I hope that this and future Bills will ensure that that type of situation does not happen or recur.  Goodness knows, that cannot be said to be child-orientated legislation.  We must face up to those kinds of realities.  An appropriate clause should be inserted somewhere in the Bill to ensure that such does not happen. Before the publication of the Adoption Bill, the Minister might indicate, for the sake of parents who have fostered children over a long period, whether he is thinking in terms of rendering adoption easier for such parents.  There are many concerned foster parents who are terrified that the children they have loved and cared for for many years will be allowed slide back into a situation in which they will become delinquent, prostitutes or generally less effective members of society.  The Minister might make his intentions known when replying.</P>
    <P>I note the provision for the taking back by the natural parent or parents of a child who has been in foster care, taking into <Col N="1103" /> account the rights of both categories of parents.  I notice that the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; means a person under the age of 15 years other than a person who is or has been married.  I should like to see some provision in the Bill &mdash; perhaps it is included and I have not found it &mdash; allowing a child a say in its destination. A child of 15, 16 or 17 is old and mature enough to have some say in its destination. If they have been brought up and have not seen their natural mother or father for ten to 12 years, having built up a home life with foster parents, those children should have some say in what happens to them.  I hope their views would be taken into account.  Obviously, a child of five, six or seven would not be sufficiently mature to make any such decision.  But there should be some mechanism by which older children or young people, certainly those between the ages of 15 and 17, can express some wish with regard to their destiny.  My eldest boy is 13 and he is already sufficiently mature to have some say in what is to be his destiny.  He happens to be an adopted child.  He would be sufficiently mature now to decide whether he wanted to stay with his present parents or go to somebody he had never known or met in his life.  Perhaps the Minister would also let me know what are his intentions in that regard.</P>
    <P>Section 23 says:</P>
    <P>A health board shall, so far as practicable and subject to the provisions of this Act, promote the welfare of children in its area by &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  identifying children who are receiving or are at risk of receiving inadequate care and protection, and</P>
    <P>(b)  providing such advice, guidance, services and facilities as may diminish the need to receive such children into care or keep them in care.  </P>
    <P>Obviously, prevention is better than cure.  I know the Minister is deeply concerned about some unfortunate cases that have arisen in recent years.  If one were <Col N="1104" /> to examine a number of them, where death occurred, it would be found to have been known to some people in the health services that a problem obtained in certain families; but existing structures were not adequate, so that some few children slipped through the net with some distressed parents in need of help themselves being allowed to remain in charge of children they should not have been allowed have responsibility for.</P>
    <P>There is a heavy onus on health boards to ensure that the structures within which they operate can adequately identify those children most in need, anticipating where problems may arise.  It is too sad, awful and late when a health board discover the dead body of a small child, a badly beaten child or a sexually abused child.  All the symptoms and indications may have been there, but perhaps nobody recognised them.  We must have a preventive service rather than a fire brigade type moving in after the damage has been done.  I hope the money will be found for all of these provisions. Obviously the implementation of the provisions of this Bill will entail a great deal of money.  But such expenditure will be seen as an indication of the caring concern of this Government in updating very outmoded legislation such as the Children Act of 1908.  I hope the Minister will receive the support he needs from the remainder of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Section 27 gives a member of the Garda Síochána power, without warrant, to take to a place of safety a child where he has reasonable grounds for believing and so on.  This relates to what I said earlier &mdash; the need to anticipate problems, to anticipate danger to children, to anticipate an area in which children might be abused and be either physically or mentally badly treated.  The phrase &ldquo;without warrant&rdquo; will need to be carefully monitored and it is here the general public have a part to play.  Too often we members of the public tend to turn our backs or be somewhat shy in becoming involved in problems.  Nobody likes to interfere in another family's circumstances. But if we are aware of children under threat, who are being maltreated. <Col N="1105" /> malnourished or whatever, then there is a responsibility on us of making that fact known to a qualified, trained person who can take over.  The manner in which one interferes in somebody's else's private family life is a matter of considerable delicacy.  One cannot just break down somebody's door and accuse them of maltreating their child.  In a case in which I was involved in my constituency there was no doubt but that some neighbours were aware that there was something amiss <i>vis-á-vis</i> the treatment of a certain child.  That child subsequently died but none of those neighbours felt they could report it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is something in the Irish psyche that makes us not want to be accused of being a snoop or an interfering busybody.  In that instance, if some of the neighbours had the presence of mind to inform the local district nurse that they were concerned about the crying and screaming of the child in the house next door, that child would now be aged five or six and would not have died at the age of two.  In this whole area of the place of safety covered in sections 26 to 32, the general public would have to take an interest in ensuring that the children close to them are safeguarded just as we must have concern for the elderly to ensure that they are receiving the care and attention they need.  Very often parents are under terrible strain and it would be a kindness to alert the authorities that the parents cannot cope.</P>
    <P>I welcome the whole thrust of the Bill and look forward to the Committee Stage.  This Minister has shown himself willing to listen with care and concern and accommodate amendments which Members recommend if he hears a better suggestion from his backbenchers or from the Fianna Fáil back benchers.  The Minister has done that in both the Nurses Bill and the Dentists Bill and he has shown that he is not afraid to alter sections of the Bill.  This Bill will go a long way in upgrading the general commitment of people in the area of child care.  It will give child care a higher status.  It will take it out of the realm of women's work.  We are now legislating for the care of the <Col N="1106" /> children.  This is the first opportunity for a long time that we have had a public discussion on child care and to consider the tremendous work that has been done by a number of bodies in preparing reports which have been used in formulating this Bill.  Obviously sections of the reports from the Child Task Force and the Adoption Board were not used by the Minister but he went a long way in incorporating some of the suggestions put forward.  Before the Bill is passed the Minister will continue discussions with some of the groups such as the Irish Foster Parents Association and people involved in day-to-day care of children, so that having waited 80 years for a new Bill we will have a Bill that will stand the test of time, we hope for another 80 years.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the efforts being made in this Bill to redress some of the problems with regard to child care. However, I am disappointed that the Bill does not appear to deal with aspects of child care relating to handicapped children. I welcome the regulations for the day care centres for the mild and moderately handicapped.  I compliment the many voluntary organisations who are playing a tremendous role in providing day centres for the mildly handicapped.  I pay tribute to the group in Cork, the After Care and Rehabilitation Association which was born out of a polio epidemic there.  But what about the severely and profoundly handicapped children?  Are the Minister, the Department and many of the people who have already spoken, aware of the situation with regard to severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children? In the Cork area a number of severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children can be accommodated in buildings for the moderately handicapped only until such time as a mildly handicapped child wishes to be admitted. Then the severely or profoundly mentally handicapped child will be taken out of the school as the place must be given to the less severely handicapped child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Association for the Severely and Profoundly Mentally Handicapped <Col N="1107" /> Children divide mental handicap into four categories &mdash; mild, moderate, severe and profound.  Mildly and moderately mentally handicapped are catered for by the Department of Education.  They are entitled to full training, educational and transportation facilities.  The task force recommended that child care should be dealt with by the Department of Health and that recommendation has been ignored. The moderately and mildly handicapped children are entitled to training, educational and transportation facilities and these are provided for them but the severely and profoundly handicapped children do not have these facilities which are available to every other child.  An association has been set up to create an awareness in the Department of Health and in people who are decision makers, that proper facilities for the care of severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children must be provided.  Traditionally, mentally handicapped children in that category were put into residential care.  I support the request of the parents in that association that such children should be kept within the family unit.</P>
    <P>Keeping children such as this at home is a trend which must be commended.  Of course, it stems from a growing awareness of those children's needs.  It is also a practice that is very widely encouraged by people in the medical profession.  It is only natural that the care, love and affection of parents for children cannot be replaced in residential care, particularly for those who are severely and profoundly mentally handicapped, I accept that facilities for the mild and moderate categories have been developing steadily, but it is regrettable that the severely and profoundly handicapped have no facilities available to them except, of course, St. Michael's House in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I support the parents' request for the setting up of a day care centre for the severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children in Cork and I am talking here about the need for such a centre immediately because no such centre is available there.  St. Michael's House is the type of day care centre that I am <Col N="1108" /> talking about for Cork, but consider that the approximate cost for this unit as far as my information goes is £2,445 per child per year on a basis of a 50 child unit. In contrast to this, residential care for similar children based on a three roster day seven days a week would work out at £17,865 approximately.  One does not have to be a marvellous mathematician to take the difference into consideration, and obviously it represents a substantial saving to the taxpayer.  More important, the children who have benefited from the day care centre will be a lesser burden on the State in the first instance, and the training programme would be to the child's advantage and further development. Severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children are children with all the needs of childhood, family love, stability and education, so these children's future outlook has been very bleak.  I hope that the Minister will see to it that that bleakness does not continue and that day care centres will be provided for the severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the recommendation of the task force that the Department of Health be the Department responsible for the care and protection of children.  I am sad at having to say that this Bill has done nothing whatever to implement that recommendation.  Another aspect of the recommendation was that a national children's council be set up, and they said &ldquo;as a matter of urgency to ensure the attainment of the highest standard of child care&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in its efforts to update many of the aspects of child care that needed to be updated.  Goodness knows, the Bill on child care has been long enough from us and has been sought for many years, but all in all it must be said that this Bill is very limited.  We support it even in its limited form, and I regret that it is not broader to cover the many aspects of child care needing such consideration.  For instance, we are all aware of the need for the advice and counselling for many parents.  I know it is a child care Bill, but surely advice and counselling for parents to assist and guide <Col N="1109" /> them and to help them in the care of their children is required.  Regrettably, no provision is made for such in the Bill.  I have outlined in particular the very serious omission of any consideration for or reference to the four categories of handicapped children, mild, moderate, severe and profound, but I am particularly concerned that no consideration seems to have been given to making provision for day care centres for profoundly mentally handicapped children.  I hope that the Minister for Health will see this contribution from me as a positive, constructive suggestion and ensure that the aspects of the task force's recommendation which I have outlined will be considered before this Bill is finally passed through the Oireachtas, and I ask him please to give instructions or commitments or indications to health boards around the country to see immediately to the need for day care centres for severely and profoundly handicapped children because provision has not been made for them.</P>
    <P>I said initially that I welcomed the efforts being made in the Bill to bring into the latter half of this century and, it is to be hoped, into the next century, with some additions, legislation that will see to it that the children of our nation are, in the words of the Constitution, treated equally.</P>

Before I became a politician this was the one issue that came up constantly.  It is deplorable that there is such a lack of contribution from the Opposition benches, considering the procession of speakers we had in here not long ago on the pro-life amendment debate.  By all means, it is important that people can contribute to something about which they feel strongly, but this makes <Col N="1110" /> a laugh of it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for their failure to provide adequate and secure prison accommodation to meet the present needs.</P>
      <P>The very fact that the House finds it necessary to debate this motion is, in itself, an indication of the very serious social and economic conditions prevailing in the country for some time.  I understand that this is the first time the House has found it necessary to debate a motion of this nature.  The need for this debate arises from the growing level of public unease and concern about the serious deterioration in law and order over the past two years in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence of this deterioration is reflected not only in the statistics of crime but also in a more tragic and vivid way in the trauma, misery, fear and insecurity on the part of many citizens who have been the victims of this wave of violence which many people believe is unprecedented in the history of the State.  There is no other area of national administration where the State is bound and expected to play a more major role than in protecting the lives and property of our citizens. Regardless of living standards and other social problems, if citizens cannot feel secure in their homes, if they are not free to walk the streets in safety, if they cannot leave their cars in safety outside their homes, if our banks and public buildings are under attack and if old people feel at risk particularly in rural areas, we in this House must take serious note, because our reason for being here, which is to create a social order in which people can <Col N="1111" /> work and live in a peaceful and contented environment, is put under attack.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to make political capital out of a very serious challenge to all of us at this time.  To the extent that the Government of the day are responsible for the social and economic environment in which we live, I hope this debate will stimulate the Government into action and warn the Minister that he and his colleagues are playing with a time bomb because of the unacceptable level of unemployment which, of its very nature, is a breeding ground for crime.  While I do not and cannot condone crime in any shape or form, it is easy to understand why young people will rebel against a system which denies them their legitimate right to a job.  It is easy to understand why people rebel against a system which contributes to widening the gap between those living in affluence and those living in relative poverty.</P>
    <P>It is sad that we must talk about the provision of additional prison accommodation in those circumstances.  I hold the view that imprisonment is no substitute for our failure to order a fair and just society.  There are those in society who show a total disregard for life and property.  We have a duty to protect society from those people.  The answer to our social problem is not to be found in the provision of additional prison accommodation, but rather in the creation of a social and economic environment where prison accommodation would need to be reduced to the minimum.</P>
    <P>This debate does not provide an opportunity to analyse Government policy on social and economic development.  If it did, we would find part of the cause of our social unrest deep rooted in this area. The public need to have confidence in the administration of justice.  They need to have confidence in this House in the first instance.  They need to feel we are capable of legislating and, more important, capable of implementing legislation in the area of law enforcement.  They need to feel secure in the knowledge that people apprehended and convicted of serious crime are made to serve their <Col N="1112" /> sentences.  They need to feel secure in the knowledge that the full implementation of the law is not restricted in any way by the inadequancy of places of retention.</P>
    <P>They certainly need to feel secure in the knowledge that the conditions for the discharge of prisoners on parole or on early release are in accordance with recognised, long-established and accepted procedures.  It is an established fact that, in the past few years, there were periods when our courts were inhibited from dealing adequately with offenders because of inadequate prison accommodation. The fact that district justices found it necessary to comment was an indication of the frustration of the courts and the people who were expected to administer justice on our behalf.</P>
    <P>It is also an established fact that in recent years the Garda were totally disillusioned and frustrated when they found offenders they had apprehended and brought to justice back on the streets after relatively short periods of time. Those who wanted to make a career of crime were given a new lease of life during that period.  They knew that if they continued to embark on their escapade of law breaking, there was no place in which they could be detained.  I submit that these are areas of concern which have been agitating the public mind for some time.</P>
    <P>I will refrain from making unfair accusations against the Minister.  This is far too sensitive an area for political point scoring.  While he is the person directly responsible to the House for law and order, he is a prisoner in a Cabinet who have refused to face reality in relation to law and order and who are responsible for the seriousness of the present position.  It is a well-established fact that, if the prison system in any country is inadequate or insecure, the whole process of law enforcement is undermined and put at risk. I do not think there is anybody in this House who would not admit that there has been a very serious deterioration in that area during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is also an established fact that the awareness of inadequate prison accommodation provides a psychological boost <Col N="1113" /> for the potential lawbreaker who feels free to break the law in the knowledge that he will not have to serve a prison sentence if convicted or, at worst, will be released long before he has served his full term.  Confirmation of my argument, if confirmation be needed, is the very welcome decline in the number of car thefts and incidents of joyriding in recent weeks and months.  Apart from the work of the Garda in this area, the most significant factor was the opening of the prison on Spike Island, Fort Mitchel.  I should like to pay a well deserved tribute to the Garda Síochána for the very courageous part they played in helping to combat what was for a time a very serious wave of violence in relation to car thefts and joyriding.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that I welcomed and supported his efforts to open Spike Island.  I have already said that it was a reactionary measure, a decision which was taken in panic with no advance planning or preparation, as was proved subsequently by the escape of six prisoners and the almost farcial situation in which prisoners were being entrusted with the task of securing their own detention. While I can appreciate that in certain circumstances that kind of rehabilitation would be useful and beneficial, it was a reckless decision in relation to a new prison and was proved to be so.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on the record of this House the level of co-operation which the Minister received in this exercise from the prison officers who under difficult conditions for themselves displayed their concern and responsibility.  Their willingness to co-operate with the Minister in opening this prison was very much to their credit and should not go unrecognised in this House.</P>
    <P>It should be said that the decision posed a serious threat to the ten civilian families residing on Spike Island.  While I acknowledge that the Minister eventually took some action, it was some time before gardaí were allocated to the island to protect the families there.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair to ask the Minister why he did not make the necessary preparations for the opening of Fort Mitchel two <Col N="1114" /> years ago when the Government decided to abandon &mdash; the Minister prefers to use the word &ldquo;postpone&rdquo;&mdash; the phased building programme which he inherited from the previous Government.  Whether we use the words &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; or &ldquo;postponed&rdquo;, the reality is that the shelving of that plan was totally irresponsible, a further example of the kind of monetarist decisions which this Government have been taking, regardless of the consequences for the public.  It will prove more costly in the long term.  What is the additional cost of this reactionary policy in providing short-term prison accommodation? Time will tell whether my prediction is right that the additional cost of providing short-term prison accommodation will far outweigh the financial merit of the decision to postpone progress on the building of new prison accommodation. I put it to the Minister that it would have been cheaper in the long run to forge ahead two years ago with the planned prison accommodation, particularly at Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>The Minister complained during a recent debate about the amount of money spent by Fianna Fáil in planning new prisons, yet he told the House recently that the plans were being revised and redrawn.  At what additional cost? Why has he found it necessary to alter the plans prepared three years ago?  He might tell the House whether there has been a change in emphasis in future prison development and why the change is taking place.  If new prison plans and designs were acceptable three years ago, surely it should not be necessary to have them redrawn now.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to tell the House the time scale for the proposed new prison development programme, particularly in relation to the Portlaoise prison and his plans for the new officers' accommodation there.  I have no doubt that he will agree that the decision to transfer prisoners into this modern complex in a highly residential area of Portlaoise town is both undesirable and dangerous and a very unfair imposition on the people of Portlaoise, particularly <Col N="1115" /> those in the large number of houses surrounding that area.  Perhaps he would tell the House why he has proceeded with this building.  Work was commenced only during the past 12 months.  It would have been wiser and fairer to the 50 families of prison officers residing in the new estate and to those living in the large number of private houses in the area if the building of this block had been deferred until the new prison was provided.  The money so saved should have been put into new accommodation for prisoners within the existing complex.</P>
    <P>I have no idea what this new building cost.  It is situated in a new housing complex and is a modern purpose built structure for the housing of prison officers following the completion of the proposed new prison.  That prison development was postponed and it would have been logical to defer the building of the single officers' accommodation and use the money to provide additional secure accommodation which is urgently needed.  That additional accommodation could have been provided within the existing prison complex in Portlaoise.  Surely that would have been the sensible thing to do.  If the Government seriously looked at the financial aspect of prison security they would have abandoned that part of the development until the new prison complex at Portlaoise was going ahead.  I would have preferred to see the money being used to provide new prison accommodation in Portlaoise.  I regret that has not happened.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister who is now in the position of having as a matter of urgency to provide short term additional prison accommodation.  Some time last December he gave a press conference and indicated that there was no emergency in relation to the provision of prison accommodation.  The Minister now has to tear around the country looking for suitable buildings in which to house prisoners. Either the Minister was putting on a good show at the press conference or he was not fully <i>au fait</i> with the position at the time.  We know that he will have to get additional prison accommodation. <Col N="1116" /> The Government should have acted in relation to building new accommodation within the Portlaoise complex from the money which they would have saved. When one considers how slowly public building contracts proceed the provision of this temporary short term accommodation could turn out to be fairly long term.</P>
    <P>The recent statistics indicate a reduction in the level of car thefts and joyriding. That is to be welcomed by all sides of the House.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the Garda in their war against this challenging and dangerous form of crime. Many of them put their lives at risk in the performance of their duties.  The opening of Spike Island was a major factor in helping to bring this area of crime under control.  It proves my point that the decision not to go ahead with the prison building programme was a retrograde one. The present overcrowding in prisons presents a serious threat to the penal system. It will lead to disturbances arising from the tension caused by overcrowding and will make the task of prison officers more difficult.  It will present a threat to the security of the prisoners.  We will give the Minister our full backing in providing secure short term prison accommodation. I realise he cannot provide new accommodation with the speed which is now required.  That is not the fault of anyone on this side of the House.  In his efforts to secure such accommodation the Minister should have consultation and discussion with local communities.  This is a matter of national security and I would like to be seen to give my full support and backing to the Minister in relation to this area.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the prison officers. They deserve the recognition and thanks of the House.  They do an extremely difficult job on behalf of the nation.  I appeal to the Minister to resume normal relations with the association.  There is nothing to be gained from the cold war which has existed for some time now between the Minister and members of the association. All of us in the House, the Government, the Garda and prison officers should be united in our efforts to establish the kind of society in which people can <Col N="1117" /> live in relative security.  We never again want to experience the trauma of last winter when the wave of violence spread from the urban areas into rural areas. Old people living alone in rural areas were under serious threat and in one instance their home was set on fire.  Part of the problem arose for the fact that the Garda were beginning to defeat the wave of crime and violence in urban areas and the criminal found it safer to retreat to the rural areas.  The Government should rethink their policy in relation to rural policing.  I know that the Minister will say no rural Garda stations have been closed but we all know that the level of manning in these stations has been drastically reduced.  That is a direct result of the reduction in overtime.  It is rather pathetic that when one dials the telephone number of a rural Garda station at certain hours of the day it is not possible to get a response.  The provision of the green man, the gadget on the outside wall of the rural station, is no substitute for the local garda in terms of his involvement in the local community and his knowledge of the happenings within that community.</P>
    <P>I repeat that there is no substitute for the local garda who is known to the community, is a familiar figure to them and has built up a relationship with them.  We live in an age when all kinds of modern communications methods are available but we should not accept these methods of communication as a replacement for the effectiveness of the Garda operating on the ground.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister say how soon he will proceed with the postponed prison development programme because we are entitled to know details of any forward planning in relation to the provision of adequate and secure prison accommodation? The Minister should also indicate his views on the rehabilitation of prisoners. Far too often the prison system contributes to the hardening of the criminal regarding his operations when he gets out of prison.  There is an urgent need to increase the number of social workers employed by his Department in the counselling and rehabilitation of prisoners <Col N="1118" /> when they are released.  A prison term is supposed to be a period of correction and present overcrowding must lead to considerable frustration.  It does not equip the prisoner for life in the community outside and perhaps the Minister will enlighten us in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Minister should give some thought to educating young offenders on the futility of pursuing a life of law breaking because that cycle very often repeats itself.  We should prevent this from happening through our social and economic policies.  Crime and violence are products of the prevailing social and economic conditions and unless we tackle our present problems we will have to make increasing provision for the detention of people who come in conflict with the law.  It is extremely important to reverse the trends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes that the number of offenders accommodated in the prison system has increased by over fifty per cent since the present Minister for Justice took Office, commends the Minister for providing, despite the severe limitations in Exchequer resources, the necessary <Col N="1119" /> custodial accommodation, acknowledges the steps he has taken to develop alternative methods of dealing with offenders and welcomes his efforts to have the penal system examined and reported on by an independent committee of experts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Opposition should chose to devote Private Members' Business this week to raise this matter, particularly as last week we had the Justice Estimates debate and there were also parliamentary questions answered on the subject.  It may be that the Opposition believe that repetition makes for truth and that if they repeat something often enough &mdash; no matter how ridiculous &mdash; they might even convince themselves that they have a point.</P>
    <P>It seems that despite my previous efforts to explain the situation, the Members opposite are intent on clinging to the myth that there would be no difficulties now in providing sufficient custodial accommodation if I had spent the tens of millions of pounds which they say they would have provided over the years for the prison capital programme.</P>
    <P>That is not the case and I have explained why previously to the House. I have no option but to go over the ground again.  However, on this occasion I appeal to the Members opposite to do their best to comprehend the realities of the situation. If they can do so they might refrain from misleading themselves, this House and the country at large about this matter.</P>
    <P>I should say also to put the matter in context that I do not share the Opposition's unshakeable faith that throwing millions of pounds of taxpayers' money at a problem is invariably the way to solve it.</P>
    <P>When I came into office, the prison capital programme contained a number of major projects to provide additional custodial accommodation.  The earliest major additional accommodation which could be made available under the programme was the place of detention at Wheatfield.  I was satisfied that that <Col N="1120" /> project should proceed and obtained the necessary funding to allow this.  The project, accordingly, proceeded without interruption and design changes were incorporated to increase the capacity of the place of detention from 150 to 320. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 1987 and will provide an additional 170 places over what was envisaged in the original capital programme.</P>
    <P>As this was the project which it was envisaged could be completed quickest it will be clear that had funds been provided for the other major projects they would not be available yet to ease pressure on custodial accommodation.  To suggest in those circumstances that not proceeding with those projects has led to accommodation difficulties in 1985 or earlier is to ignore the reality.</P>
    <P>While I was prepared to continue with the project at Wheatfield and double the number of offenders to be accommodated there, the allocation of further moneys to other major projects had to be assessed in the light of a number of factors.  These included severe Exchequer difficulties, the likely time-scale in which those projects would be able to provide additional accommodation, the likely demands on custodial accommodation and the effect of the development of alternative sanctions on these demands.</P>
    <P>Prison construction of its nature has proved to be very expensive and the factors which determine custodial requirements are complex.  I was always of the view that these matters could benefit from a thorough review of penal policy generally here and such a review is now being undertaken by a distinguished committee under the chairmanship of Dr. T. K. Whitaker.</P>
    <P>I was reinforced in that belief by my concern at some aspects of the capital programme as devised by the Fianna Fáil administration.  They seek now to convey the impression that the programme was geared entirely to the provision of custodial accommodation but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil administration expenditure in the capital programme <Col N="1121" /> was committed to providing staff quarters at Portlaoise.  The work included the provision of 60 houses for married officers; a residential block for 60 single officers and certain general site works some of which would be needed if the new prison at Portlaoise was to go ahead.  I should like to tell Deputy Hyland &mdash; he may not be aware of this &mdash; that the contract for the houses and the contract for the officers' quarters was one and the same contract.  There was not an option of stoping the building of the quarters.  It was part of the contract which went hand in glove with the houses.</P>
    <P>When I came into office this work had advanced to a stage where I could not halt the project.  The Office of Public Works act as agents for my Department in the provision of accommodation and in a written reply last January Deputy Hyland was informed by the Minister responsible for the OPW that the expected total cost of this project would be £6.6 million.  I think the House will accept that the expenditure on the project was enormously high and my Department have expressed their concern about this to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The expenditure on this project was incurred as a direct result of decisions made by the Fianna Fáil administration and it raises obvious questions about their approach to the prison capital programme.  Obviously, £6.6 million has been used but not a single prisoner will be accommodated.  It could be justified if it was accommodating prison officers but it is not doing that either.  There are very few applicants for that residential building.</P>
    <P>As I will mention later, I have decided in the circumstances that the single officers' quarters at Portlaoise will now be used to accommodate offenders. There is no doubt &mdash; and I agree with Deputy Hyland on this &mdash; that the £6.6 million wasted on unnecessary accommodation by the Fianna Fáil Government to provide unnecessary facilities at Portlaoise prison would have been better spent if it had been used to provide custodial accommodation within the walls of Portlaoise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I could not.  It was gone beyond anything I could do.  The report from Dr. Whitaker's committee is expected to be available in a matter of months and I am sure all Members of the House look forward to the outcome of the first major review of our penal system since the foundation of the State.  Undoubtedly, the conclusions which the committee reaches on prison construction will be of particular interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> The House will be aware that the terms of reference are quite wide.  Dr. Whitaker and his expert committee will have plenty of opportunities to assess all sorts of things in association with prisons, whether it is the regimes within prisons, how far they are geared to rehabilitation or the sentencing policy.  They will be in a position to assess the prison building programme and the prison accommodation we will need in the future.  I am sure the House will be interested in that report when it is available.  If after reviewing the committee's report the Government are satisfied that further resources should be allocated to prison construction in addition to the project at Wheatfield then this will be done.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, of course, the Government have had to cope with the unforeseen and unprecedented growth in the numbers being committed to custody at present and this has had to be done generally without assistance from the capital programme which I inherited and which, as I explained earlier, was not geared to have new purpose-built accommodation available at this stage.</P>
    <P>I will outline in a few moments the measures which I have taken to deal effectively with this.  Before doing so, however, I wish to refer briefly to remarks which have been made about reductions in the capital provision in the 1983 Estimates.  I have already outlined the background against which that decision was taken but I have to tell the House that I have every reason to be sceptical about claims which the Members opposite make about the 1983 Prison Estimate which they had proposed.</P>
    <P>When I assumed office I found that a provision of only £4.5 million had been made for prisons overtime in 1983 although expenditure in 1982 had been about £7.4 million.  No decisions had been taken which would have led to a reduction in overtime working but the proposed Estimates could still suggest that overtime expenditure would cost some £3 million less than the previous year. That was another exercise in creative accounting, where one wins the reduction but one does not provide the means to <Col N="1125" /> spare £3 million in prison overtime &mdash; another cod figure in the 1983 Estimates. In the circumstances, I had to seek an allocation of a further £2 million so that a realistic provision was included in the revised 1983 Estimate.  I mention this not to highlight the state of industrial anarchy in the prisons which I inherited from the Members opposite whereby staff were virtually setting the level of overtime working in the service, but to illustrate that the House is entitled to be suspicious of claims which the Opposition now make about the 1983 Prison Estimate which they had prepared.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have responded to the need for additional accommodation in a responsible and effective manner.  That can be seen from the fact that in 1982 there was a daily average of 1,236 in custody, whereas this morning there were 1,936 offenders being accommodated, and last week there were 1,960-odd.  I am glad there is a reduction this morning.</P>
    <P>The increased numbers which can be held in custody have been made possible by maximising the use of existing custodial accommodation and by the acquisition of temporary additional accommodation such as Fort Mitchel on Spike Island and the education units at Cork and Arbour Hill through the relocation of the educational facilities at those institutions.  There is no doubt that coping with such a large increase in the number of offenders over such a short period would cause problems and difficulties for any prison administration, but those problems and difficulties are being faced up to so as to ensure that offenders serve to the greatest extent possible the sentences imposed on them by the courts.</P>
    <P>As I said in my Estimates speech last week, the situation requires a flexible approach which has due regard to the capacity and nature of the various institutions and at the same time the need to ensure that sufficient accommodation is available to cope with offenders committed to custody for serious offences.</P>
    <P>Problems with prison accommodation <Col N="1126" /> are not new and, in fact, in 1979 a previous administration resorted to the practice of &ldquo;shedding&rdquo;&mdash; letting people out of prison early because of insufficient accommodation.  When I came into office I was concerned at the extent of this practice and as well as providing additional accommodation to deal with the problem I introduced a system of home leave as an alternative to &ldquo;shedding&rdquo;. Under this scheme, offenders serving sentences for relatively minor offences are granted periods of home leave subject to certain conditions such as a requirement to report to the local Garda station. The nature of offences where this scheme can operate is limited and leave is granted only after consultation with the Garda.  Offenders are returned to custody should any evidence emerge that an offender is in any way abusing the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated that I am prepared in certain circumstances to grant slightly more than the statutory remission to offenders who are of good behaviour in custody.  This can be justified on a number of grounds.  Deputies often make representation on behalf of offenders where circumstances have changed while an offender is serving his sentence which could justify a review of sentence.  And, as I said last week, sentencing is not so precise a science that a reduction of, say, two to three weeks could be said to defeat the purpose of the original sentence. These forms of release might not be resorted to as much if extra custodial accommodation was available, but I believe they represent a justifiable response to a difficult situation and take into account the reality of prison administration and the need to protect society. They are certainly a far cry from the picture which some Opposition spokesmen have tried to create of serious criminals being let out early because of a lack of prison space.</P>
    <P>The message was at last getting across to people who indulge in criminal activity on a serious scale &mdash; particularly of the type which has given rise lately to great public concern &mdash; that there is prison accommodation to ensure that they will <Col N="1127" /> serve whatever sentences are imposed. People who try to convey a contrary message by making ill-founded claims about early releases and the lack of prison accommodation however well-motivated should bear in mind the consequences of their actions.  Such claims needlessly frighten the vulnerable in our society, encourage the criminal and undermine the efforts of the Garda in dealing with the crime problem.  It would be unfortunate if the community has to pay that price for the ill-informed posturing of some of the Members opposite, but I can assure the House that any criminal who found comfort in the assertion that there was insufficient accommodation in the prisons were he to be convicted would be a very foolish criminal indeed.</P>
    <P>The motion in Deputy Hyland's name refers to the need for secure prison accommodation.  There is such a need and that is why the educational units at Cork and Arbour Hill have been relocated so that the units can be used to provide secure accommodation for offenders.  In addition, work is continuing to make Fort Mitchel, which is being run at the moment as a semi-open prison, relatively secure.</P>
    <P>However, I should say a few words about the useful role which open prisons have played and are continuing to play in our penal system.  Open institutions, as a penological concept, were first introduced into the Irish penal system in the late sixties and early seventies.  They were introduced at a time when the profile of the prison population was very different from what it is today.  A high proportion of our present prison population have been convicted of serious offences and, to put it in prison terms, the number of prisoners who could be termed &ldquo;trusties&rdquo; is getting smaller.  Because of this it has become more difficult to find the type of offender who traditionally was considered suitable for open centres.  But the fact remains that prisoners, whatever their crimes, must sooner or later be released.</P>
    <P>The issue which must be addressed is whether it is better to release a prisoner <Col N="1128" /> on the last day of his sentence or, in a controlled way, to ease him back into the community before that.  I believe the latter option to be the most sensible and if I am correct then the open centres must continue to play their role in providing pre-release facilities for prisoners even if the prisoners we have to deal with now are more difficult than prisoners in the past.</P>
    <P>In addition, open centres have a major role to play in providing additional accommodation for low risk offenders so that secure accommodation is available for more serious criminals.  The use of such centres has also to be seen against the background which I outlined earlier of a lack in the short term of new purpose-built secure prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have been interested in acquiring suitable premises which can be used for custodial accommodation and that search is continuing. Deputies will also be aware of the disgraceful approach which members of the Opposition party have taken to this matter.  When it became known that I hoped to acquire a premises at James's Street that move was welcomed by the Opposition spokesman on Justice.  Some short time afterwards, however, there was a meeting of local residents who were concerned about the proposal.  That meeting was addressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who assured residents that it was official Fianna Fáil policy to oppose the location of custodial accommodation at James's Street.</P>
    <P>I think it is a bit much for members of the Opposition party to come into this House to complain about the lack of prison accommodation and then to behave in a shameless fashion for local electoral advantage and oppose the measures which I propose to do exactly what they claim to demand.  Unfortunately, the owners of the James's Street premises have now indicated that they are not prepared to sell to my Department because of the local opposition to the project.  I hope the Members opposite accept responsibility for the part which <Col N="1129" /> they played in that decision.  The two-faced approach of Fianna Fáil continues.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I do not feel the use of the single officers' quarters at Portlaoise for its original purpose is justified at present and I propose to adapt the accommodation to house offenders.  The exact nature of its future use has not yet been decided but it may be possible to use the accommodation for male offenders in need of treatment, for example alcoholics, or for low risk female offenders. Fianna Fáil have indicated their opposition to this proposal also and yet continue to complain about the lack of custodial accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil would oppose the siting of a prison anywhere where they felt local electoral advantage could be gained.  So be it, but they must realise that to behave in that way and yet expect their protestations about the lack of prison accommodation to be treated as genuine is not on.</P>
    <P>The emphasis so far in this debate has been on imprisonment, but it is important that we should provide a range of sanctions to the courts so that we can achieve a situation where people are sent to prison only where it is clearly necessary in the interests of society to do so.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, at present the courts have a number of sanctions available to them, but we think primarily of prison sentences or fines.  They can also apply suspended sentences and they can recommend that people be put on probation or avail of other schemes of that sort, but one of the most significant developments in this area recently has been the introduction of the community service scheme which I brought into operation at the end of last year.  Under the scheme the courts can sentence offenders who would otherwise be committed to prison to do work in the community instead.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report to the House that the scheme is working well.  Already about 140 orders have been made under the scheme and a further 108 cases have been referred by the courts to the probation and welfare service for assessment of the suitability of offenders for the <Col N="1130" /> scheme.  In relation to the 108 orders which have been made.  I should emphasise that these were all cases where custodial sentences would have been imposed had the community service scheme not been in operation.  So not only is the scheme of itself socially desirable, it has also had the benefit of easing the pressure on custodial accommodation.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to recommend that scheme to the House.  It is worthy of further development.  It is a scheme particularly suited to young offenders who are possibly in full time education.  It is also suitable for the main breadwinner of the family.  There are certain circumstances where the court imposes a sentence and the person is doubly punished because as a result of the conviction he or she can lose a job or be deprived of the opportunity of sitting for the leaving certificate or of completing an AnCO course, or apprenticeship, or whatever training or education course is involved.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of the community order scheme is its great flexibility.  A court has to decide, first of all, whether somebody is suitable for the scheme and that is done on the recommendation of the probation and welfare service person. The offender has to agree to engage in the scheme.  It has also to be an alternative to a prison sentence.  A district justice or a Circuit Court judge can sentence somebody under a community service order as an alternative, for example, to a fine. People can work the number of hours to which they are sentenced at the weekend, for example, or during a holiday period, or after the school closes in the evening, or later in the evening for somebody who is working, or every Saturday for, say, three months.  It has that kind of flexibility which allows a person to carry on the normal pattern of life, yet at the same time repay the debt owed to the community. That debt also is repaid in a manner which is appropriate to the crime.  Most of the work involves work within the community and it is clear to members of the community that the person is making an effort to repay.</P>
    <P>Also, the scheme obviates the need for rehabilitation programmes and lengthy <Col N="1131" /> schemes, which sometimes have low enough success rates for reintegrating prisoners into the community, because here the people are not in prison in the first place.  They live at home.  There is also obviously a great advantage from the cost point of view.  It is now costing an enormous amount of money to keep a person in prison, on average about £400 a week.  By using a community service order the cost involved is only £7 to £9 a week, which is a huge cost saving to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Whitaker committee will examine further alternatives to imprisonment, because we cannot proceed on the basis that there are a limited number of sanctions available and that for any kind of serious offence everybody ends up in prison.  That is not the full answer.  We must look at alternatives to continuous imprisonment and examine schemes in operation in other countries, imprisonment at weekends or for set periods of time.  Perhaps a short, sharp period of imprisonment might be more effective as a corrective then a long extended period of imprisonment in a gentler regime.</P>
    <P>This Government have made strenuous efforts in very difficult circumstances to deal with the numbers of offenders being committed to custody and the success of those efforts can be judged from what I have said here this evening.  We will continue to adopt the flexible approach which has been required to deal with this matter and I believe that on the basis of the measures which we have taken and the further measures which we propose, the amendment to the motion which I have put down should be supported.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I have had little support from the party opposite.  The only support so far is much lip service and many efforts to obstruct genuine attempts to deal with the situation, but that is not surprising.  Given the state of the prison service that I inherited, the Opposition are a little embarrassed about it and are trying to kick up a shower of dust to distract attention from that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In our prison system, the cases of offenders committed for long term sentences are being kept under continuous review so as to devise appropriate release programmes to reintegrate offenders into the community in a controlled way and in a manner designed to help offenders to have a useful life in the community.  Cases of this nature are dealt with by a review committee in the institutions, which include representatives from the various disciplines such as prison staff, welfare officers, psychologists, chaplains and officials from my Department.  Account is taken of the views of the Garda Síochána on particular offenders and a release programme is drawn up.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say earlier that he expected the report from the Whitaker committee very shortly.  A comprehensive report of the whole penal system is long overdue.  We have not had such a review since the foundation of the State.  I hope this committee of experts will come up with many new ways of dealing with offenders in society.  We have to look at new and imaginative ways if we are seriously to rid our society of the terrible increase in crime in recent months.  It would be wrong of us to play party politics on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having spent the last number of weeks canvassing in an urban constituency in the Dublin area, I have no doubt that there is widespread fear and anxiety on the part of all members of the community at the recent increase in the level of crime.  It is very sad, as one approaches the homes of elderly people in particular, to note the number of chains and bolts that they now have on their doors.  Even in the afternoon they are very afraid to open the door to anybody.  That is a very sad thing to see in a country where for so long people took pride in being able to wander freely and leave their doors open and so on, and not be frightened of who might call at any time of the day or evening. In very many cases elderly people are concerned not just that people are taken before the courts to serve their sentences but equally that the proper safeguards are taken by the authorities to ensure that these elderly people have in their homes correct alarm systems and easy access to the Garda and have a comprehensive and correct telephone system. Many do not have that, particularly in rural areas.  They are practical ways of <Col N="1134" /> helping to allay the fears of the public, particularly our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>The recent debate on the whole question of law and order and the need for increased prison accommodation interested me very much.  I said two years ago, during the course of the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill, that if we are to continue to deal in the manner in which we dealt in the past with those who offend against society, there will be a very serious accommodation problem.  That time has now arrived.  When the measure is implemented fully following the introduction of the complaints tribunal, we will see an increase in the number of people sentenced by our courts to places of detention.  If we do not look at new ways to deal with the matter we will have a very serious problem and one that must concern all of us.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recently I had occasion to visit Spike Island and the prison in Cork.  In relation to the latter, I was quite distressed to see so much doubling up of the numbers sleeping in cells.  Cells that normally accommodated one person are now being used to accommodate two people and cells that might have been used to accommodate three or four are now being used to accommodate up to six people.  The educational facilities available to prisoners had to be abolished in the main to improve the accommodation facilities required.  I was quite frightened to see that.</P>
    <P>Equally, when I visited Spike Island I was not very impressed at what I saw. Despite the fact that it is an open prison I was not surprised to learn subsequently that six prisoners were able to get off the island fairly easily.  I should like one point to go from this House, something that concerns the public.  People read in the newspapers from time to time, and certainly they read in the newspapers when many press correspondents went to visit Spike Island, of the very luxurious conditions that are supposed to exist there.  I should like the public to be assured that that is not the case.  Equally, I should like people in the media who have occasion <Col N="1135" /> to visit places of detention not to stir up public feeling by writing totally incorrect articles about central heating systems, video recorders and so on.  The inaccurate reports I read regarding Spike Island did not do much to make the public feel that their politicians were responding to the serious crime that is occurring.</P>
    <P>There are many people in prisons who could be catered for in a more effective way if we adopted other measures.  For example, the most recently published statistics regarding prisoners show that in 1983 there were 54 men and two females in prison for drunkenness.  I am sure there must be another way of dealing with people who commit such a crime.  There were 525 men and three women imprisoned for offences against the Road Traffic Act and, again, there are different ways of treating such people.  Six men were imprisoned for offences against the Act dealing with fisheries.  Many people are imprisoned for non-payment of fines or because they have not been able to honour hire purchase agreements.  Such people are not a danger to society and prison is not a place for them.  I should like our legislation to be changed to ensure that the courts have another way of dealing with such offences.  I understand that at the moment they have no alternative but to imprison people who commit this kind of crime.  That is a shame and is unnecessary.  If other measures were used it would provide much needed accommodation for people who commit more serious crimes and who are a real danger to society.  These people should have to serve a spell in an institution to ensure that society is protected.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that in 1983 some 55 per cent of those serving sentences were serving at least a second sentence. In relation to those in St. Patrick's institution, in 1983 some 40 per cent of those serving a sentence had served a previous sentence.  That shows that for many people prison does not rehabilitate them and it does not help to make them better able to cope with society.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed recently to hear the Taoiseach in his Fine Gael Ard Fheis <Col N="1136" /> speech dismiss the fact that there may be endemic reasons in our society why some people commit serious crime.  I know that the vast majority of people who are poor and deprived and who may have a low standard of education never commit a crime but the fact remains that the bulk of those who commit crimes come from poor and deprived backgrounds.  They have a low standard of education and in many cases they belong to families who do not care about them.  It is time we introduced some legislation to ensure that parents are made responsible for the activities of young teenagers.  I am always horrified to see in Dublin city and in the suburbs the number of very young children who are allowed to roam the streets late at night.  Nobody seems to care about them: in many cases their parents may be in pubs or are victims of broken marriages.  If we do not do something to help these children, many of them will end up in some kind of institution for a large part of their lives because they will offend against society.</P>
    <P>It is very sad to see that so many of these young people are now involved in what has become known as joyriding.  I am pleased that with the recent measures taken by the Minister that problem seems to have eased somewhat.  That is a good thing but as a person who represents a constituency that had a fair amount of joyriding I must say there are two sides to the story.  Many youngsters involve themselves in joyriding simply for the fun of it.  They endanger themselves and the people they meet and they have to be taken out of society and looked after. Equally, there are those who are unemployed and who see no possible opportunities for themselves in the future and when they see somebody driving around in a Mercedes or a BMW they have an inbuilt resentment towards such a person. While society has to deal with the joyrider who takes a car and who is a danger to himself and to those he meets, equally, society must deal with those who seem to be able to do far better than the people who grow up in the deprived backgrounds to which I referred.  Unless we as a country put greater emphasis on helping <Col N="1137" /> people in the areas that have severe social problems by providing increased job opportunities, better social services, more social workers and a better liaison with the Garda Síochána, many of the young people from these areas will be destined to spend a large portion of their life in institutions.</P>
    <P>Equally, drug-related and alcohol problems account for a significant number of those who are now in prison. These people could be dealt with in a different and better way.  Those addicted to drugs or alcohol feed their habit by committing serious crime.  In this House and elsewhere we have paid too little attention to this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the alternative he introduced to prison, particularly the alternatives for young offenders.  I was very disappointed it took such a long time to introduce the Bill dealing with community services.  I am delighted to know that 140 orders have been made under the Bill and I hope many more will be made.  Restitution and rehabilitation should be the answer rather than life in an institution.  Only those who are a danger to themselves and society should be sent away.  What is proposed in the Bill is the best way of rehabilitating a person, of making restitution to society and, in the long term, it is the best way to eliminate so many of the crimes now being committed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland referred to capital expenditure for 1983.  The Minister estimated he would spent £11.3 million on prison capital projects but he ended up spending less than half that amount.  I do not want to go into which Government did more, which Government spent more or which party are more committed.  We would not be serving the people we represent if we were to argue on those lines but within the resources available the money could be spent much more wisely. I regret that only about half of the money provided was spent.  There could be much greater utilisation of the resources available. All that is required is the application of more common sense and a greater emphasis on the real reasons for so many people committing crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> Deputy Reynolds interjected to refer to a story that appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on Sunday last.  I have no wish to play party politics with the subject involved except to say that as a female Member of the House I should be horrified to think that anyone who is sentenced for committing a serious sexual offence would be released ahead of time. I am aware of how horrific is the experience of people who have been the victims of such crimes.  It takes a long time for the victim to overcome the effects of such an assault.  Unless there is overwhelming evidence from the experts who may know better, those found guilty of such crimes should serve their full sentences.  They do untold damage not only to the victim but to her family and to everyone else who may be associated with her.  About 18 months ago I recall meeting with a woman in my constituency who had been a victim of such a crime and who was experiencing severe nervous problems as a result.  Up to the time of the crime she was a normal, stable married woman but she had become a very sick person as a result of the sexual assault.</P>
    <P>There are cases in which there is good evidence to suggest that people might be released ahead of time.  I am thinking, for instance, of those for whom the opportunity of employment arises or who may be able to embark on training courses.  If such persons are not a danger to society and have been sentenced in respect of the less serious offences, flexibility should be applied and they should be allowed return as soon as possible to society.  As public representatives there is often much pressure brought to bear on us by the families and friends of prisoners in regard to having them released.  Irrespective of which party we belong to, the criteria should be the same in all cases, that is, what in the first instance is in the best interest of society and, secondly, of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Reference is made often to the cost of keeping someone in prison.  We are told that the average cost per year is about £23,000 or more than £440 per week while the average cost of keeping a subversive in prison is in the region of <Col N="1139" /> £50,000 per year.  Undoubtedly, subversives must be kept in prison.  Unfortunately there are not more of them serving sentences, having regard to the way in which they have ruined society both North and South and have manipulated so many of our young people.  If I may make a plea in advance of the local elections it is that groups or individuals who support these people will not be given any support from the Irish people on June 20.  However, the cost involved in keeping people in prison generally could possibly be used in a more efficient and more effective way and in the long term in a better way so far as society is concerned. That is where the answer lies for the future.  Whenever there is an increase in crime we tend to make a plea for more prison places or for more gardaí and although these pleas may be responded to, crime continues to increase.  Perhaps if we considered more imaginatively some of those who offend we might be in a better position in the long term to help society.  We must consider also the provision of more semi-prison or hostel type accommodation where perhaps people might be imprisoned for weekends or in the evenings and would go about their normal business during the weekdays. That kind of prison accommodation would perhaps be a cheaper and better way of dealing with some people whom society considers should be sentenced to institutions.</P>
    <P>The whole situation is causing serious problems for those charged with the running of our prisons.  From talking with many of them I am aware that they are becoming more disillusioned and concerned with the constant pressure being put on them by reason of the increased numbers being sent to prison.  There is a difficult task, too, for those charged with the duty of deciding who should be released in order to provide accommodation for others.</P>
    <P>We must not panic in this kind of situation. In a letter to the Committee on Public Expenditure, the Department of Justice indicated that by the end of the century they expected the need for prison <Col N="1140" /> places to be of the order of 2,000.  We have almost reached that level and we are only half way through the eighties.  If we continue at the present rate the more likely requirement by the end of the century will be of the order of 4,000 places. We must ensure that we use the prison accommodation and the resources available in as responsible and efficient a manner as possible.  Because there is not adequate prison accommodation we must ensure that those convicted of the most serious crimes and who are considered to be most dangerous are given the places that are available but that there is no early release of anyone who would be considered a danger to society.  In many cases people who are a danger to society are a danger also to themselves.</P>
    <P>In the Tallaght area we established recently, in conjunction with AnCO and a number of other Government agencies, a workshop where people who had been before the courts in some instances and in other instances people who were considered at risk were taken on to follow a course or a skill for which they were considered suitable.  I am very pleased to be able to say that although in existence for less than two years, the project has been a tremendous success.  The people who work there tell me of the great enthusiasm the young people in the area have for the work.  Small as the project is those involved in running it believe it has led to many of those who have availed of it keeping out of trouble and avoiding situations which would lead to prison sentences.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country and especially in the Dublin area there is tremendous fear and anxiety among our people as a result of the present crime levels.  The public wish to be reassured that measures will be taken against those who offend, especially those who commit offences against the person.  We must reassure all our citizens, but particularly our elderly citizens, that the Government are taking every possible step to ensure that those who attack the elderly, who frighten and terrorise them, will be dealt with adequately in any legislation or in any accommodation that may be provided.  If <Col N="1141" /> people could really see that something was happening in this area, perhaps they would be a little less frightened and a little more optimistic.  It is sad that so many of our people fear that matters will become much worse.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Whitaker committee will be reporting soon.  I trust that that kind of committee which is comprised of people who are experts in their field and who are highly respected will recommend new and more imaginative ways of utilising our prison accommodation. That is what all of us require.  In the interim the Minister should make every effort to ensure that the accommodation we have at present is improved, that the refurbishment so necessary in many of our prisons is dealt with as a matter of priority so as to make them into places more humane and caring for our prisoners. Taxpayers would not be reluctant to give the type of money that might be required to ensure that we became a safer society so that in the long term we would rid our society of 90 per cent of the crime rate.</P>

      <P>Áine Fitzgerald is a 21 year old Tralee girl suffering from a rare disease which cannot be treated in this country. Doctors in Dublin have done all they can for this girl and they have now recommended that she go to the Mayo Clinic in the United States for further assessment. But her parents are faced with the task of raising £16,500 before air tickets are purchased as the Mayo Clinic have demanded this deposit before they start to assess her.  The parents have been advised that as a result of the further assessment, if surgery is necessary the cost may be as high as £100,000.  No way can the family meet this type of expense or be expected to do so.</P>
      <P>The rare condition which Áine suffers from and which has never been known in this country before, is characterised by obstructions in various arteries of the body.  Already she has had three major operations on her right leg.  Her trip to the Mayo Clinic has been made more urgent by the fact that she now believes her good leg is being affected.</P>
      <P>If the disease is active Áine's biggest fear is that the blood supply to the vital organs will be cut off.  The effects of the disease are that Áine cannot walk more than 200 yards.  She also has problems with her left arm and last week Dr. Patrick English of Tralee told her he could not find a pulse on her left leg. Áine Fitzgerald is disappointed with the response from the Southern Health Board and the Department, in particular in reference to the Minister's promise last year that no citizen of the State would suffer from inadequate funding if their condition could not be treated in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1984 the Department of Health placed advertisements in the national press regarding Colin McStay, the liver transplant patient who had to travel to Pittsburg, which stated that it is the policy of the Department of Health that all applications for assistance towards the cost of operations abroad where such <Col N="1143" /> operations cannot be done in Ireland, are examined on their individual and medical merits, that entitlement to medical services is a basic right of everybody and should not be dependent in any way on appeals to the public, however generous the outcome.  After discussions between Professor Risteárd Mulcahy, who treated Áine, and the Southern Health Board's consultants it did not appear that there was a reasonable prospect of therapeutic benefit from a visit to the Mayo Clinic. In view of this it was decided that the health board could not give any financial assistance towards the proposal.</P>
    <P>The view of the Southern Health Board consultants is disputed by the medical people dealing with Áine, in particular Professor Risteárd Mulcahy who has been involved in Áine's case since 1983. He has stated that all that can be done in this country has been done.  He would strongly recommend that Áine Fitzgerald should be referred to the Mayo Clinic for evaluation by their experts, for any special investigation which may be necessary and which may not be available to us here, and for any special treatment which may be indicated following such investigations, whether such treatment be surgical or medical.  He continued to advise that her referral to the Mayo Clinic should be arranged as soon as possible to avoid the risk of further obstructions occurring.  Professor Mulcahy made those remarks last April.</P>
    <P>Áine Fitzgerald left for America last Friday evening with her parents to fight for her life.  A trust fund has been set up in Tralee and throughout Kerry.  Already the public are beginning to rally around this very worthy cause.  This is a very emotional issue in Tralee and throughout Kerry.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to respond by way of financial support to Áine and her family, so removing some of the tremendous pressures on the family at present.  Áine speaks out about her illness and states that her one ambition is to live.</P>

      <P>The normal procedure for processing cases such as that of the young woman concerned is that, in the first instance, an application is made direct to the relevant health board including, with the application, medical and surgical evidence that the treatment is required for the patient. The health board's agreement is necessary before a patient can be sent outside the country.  If the cost of the treatment abroad is in excess of £1,000 the approval of the Department of Health is required to the health board accepting liability for the cost in excess of £1,000.  I might add &mdash; this is not germane to this case but is relevant to the overall procedures &mdash; that the amount of £1,000 is currently under review in consultation with the CEOs of the health boards in the light of the considerable increase in the number of cases submitted in the past two years or so.  But the amount in question does not arise in relation to the young woman's case because there is no recommendation whatsoever from the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>I have two observations to make on the specific case in question.  As Deputy Foley Correctly remarked, it is a sensitive issue, a highly personal issue and I think the House would wish it to be treated as-such. Having been raised on the Adjournment here, the person having been named, and so on, I want to put two very definite facts on the record. Deputy Foley said that Áine Fitzgerald was recommended by Dublin doctors for treatment in the Mayo Clinic.  I assure the Deputy that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Foley remarked that the views of the Southern Health Board consultant were disputed by a professor of cardiology, a consultant in Dublin, and the Deputy named the consultant.  I do not propose to do that.  That equally is not so.  The views of the Southern Health Board's consultants are not now disputed <Col N="1145" /> by the eminent consultant cardiologist in question.  I spoke to the consultant in question and the Tánaiste, in my presence, spoke to the consultant and we were assured that he is not making any such recommendation at this stage that the patient should be sent to the US for therapeutic treatment.  I am very much aware of the details of the case.  The Tánaiste has been in constant touch with me about the matter, as well, because it involves a local constituent, and a family well known to him.</P>
    <P>I am extremely sympathetic towards the provision of financial assistance to people who require medical treatment abroad where such treatment cannot be provided here and where it can be demonstrated to a reasonable degree that the treatment is both necessary and suitable. The surgical facts of the case have been considered in considerable detail both by the consultant medical and surgical staff advisers to the Southern Health Board to whom the application for assistance was made initially and also by the chief medical officer of the health board. On the basis of comprehensive medical advice I am satisfied that it does not appear that the young woman concerned could benefit therapeutically by being referred to the Mayo Clinic.  This is also the conclusion of the Southern Health Board.  In these circumstances I could not sanction financial assistance.   As I have already said, if there are any new reasonable substantial medical facts available I will be only too happy to have the case examined immediately.  The chief medical officer of my Department, in the light of such information being forthcoming, would be asked by me to review his recommendation that public funds should not be spent on sending this young woman to the US.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general issue there is not a shortage of money in my Department for dealing with cases of this nature. When the original case, the Colin McStay case came up, I made it perfectly clear at <Col N="1146" /> the time that it is not necessary for any family or any person to have to resort to public appeals or special requests for medical, surgical or other treatment abroad which is not available in this country. Once we get advice from a health board we are prepared to help.  Advice in this case was based on the best consultant opinion.  A number of eminent consultants were involved, a much larger number than is usually involved in a case. I would urge on parents that when such a situation develops they should come to the health board in the first instance and we can without delay facilitate people as we do every month of the year without boasting and the attendant emotional involvement.  The funds are available and we automatically authorise health boards, provided an authoritative recommendation is made, to apply for the funds.  I regret that I should have to put this on public record.</P>
    <P>I offer every support to the woman concerned and hope that she will become well.  In the event of my Department receiving further information of a medical or surgical nature of benefit to the patient, I can assure the Deputy, the Tánaiste and other colleagues, that I will immediately take action on the matter.</P>

      <P>The IIRS who have responsibility for implementing the provisions of section 62 of the offshore licensing terms, which is designed to promote participation by Irish industry in offshore exploration and development, have confirmed that Irish service companies secured 33 per cent of the total exploration expenditure offshore Ireland in 1984.  To put this figure properly into context it should be noted <Col N="987" /> that of the total expenditure offshore Ireland in that year, viz IR£55 million 63 per cent related to supplies and services which Irish industry cannot provide, e.g. drilling rigs, drill pipe, downhole logging services, etc.  Thus the 33 per cent of total market secured by Irish service companies represents 78 per cent of the available market which reflects a very creditable performance by the Irish companies and by the IIRS on their behalf.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives have recently been taken which should improve the position of the Irish service companies. These include the organisation of joint venture projects with suitable overseas firms, the arrangement of workshops and seminars to aid Irish companies in their tenders for offshore contracts and new procedures under section 62 for inviting such tenders.  Additionally, the IIRS will continue to monitor closely the award of contracts to ensure the maximum participation within the provisions of the licensing terms, of all interested Irish service companies.</P>

      <P>The CSO statistical release of 23 July 1984 dealt with output and income arising in the agriculture sector.  In deriving the estimate for income arising in agriculture which is used for national accounts purposes deductions are made for various expenses including depreciation of machinery and implements.</P>
      <P>The valuations used for determining the depreciation estimates for each year were obtained using the perpetual inventory method on a replacement cost basis. This involved combining estimates of capital acquired in the current year with the depreciated value of capital acquired in earlier years revalued using appropriate price indices.  The depreciation estimates so obtained for the years 1981 to 1983 were £171.2 million, £196.6 million and £215.9 million respectively.  The deductions in respect of depreciation do not cover farm buildings.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 to 60 inclusive, together.  The cost to the Exchequer of non-capital expenditure on the pay excluding pensions, of non-industrial and industrial civil servants in 1983 was £576 million.

      <P>The average gross pay cost of a non-industrial civil servant in 1983 is estimated at £10,600.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 to 64, inclusive, together.  The cost to the Exchequer of non-capital expenditure on public service pay, excluding pensions, in 1983 was £2,039 million. This figure covers the pay of civil servants (non-industrial and industrial), Garda, Defence Forces, teachers and health employees together with amounts for pay included in grants to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies, universities and colleges.  It includes all pay costs such as basic pay, employers PRSI contributions, overtime and allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 4 on 26 June 1984, the average gross pay of a public servant in 1983 is estimated at £11,100.  This figure was based on the pay cost of non-industrial civil servants, Garda, Defence Forces, teachers and part of the cost of health employees.  In order to produce a meaningful average pay cost related to actual numbers employed, it was necessary, for technical reasons, to exclude from this calculation the costs and corresponding numbers of certain groups such as part timers, payments to persons whose numbers would not be counted as employees <Col N="1001" /> (e.g. recoupment of fees to general practitioners in the general medical service) and amounts included for pay in grants &mdash; which reflect only part of the relevant pay cost &mdash; to grant aided bodies, industrial civil servants and staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs whose pay was partially met from capital appropriations.</P>

However, the necessary procedures under the relevant retirement scheme had to be complied with and these aspects, including sanction via the Department of the Public Service, were not completed until 16 May 1985 thereby clearing the way for calculation of appropriate pension and gratuity.  The gratuity was paid earlier this month and payment of pension, with effect from 19 February last, will commence shortly.</P>

Harvesting was to be undertaken by the Forest and Wildlife Service but some of this work has still to be done.  No timber was removed by the firm during the last week in May 1985.  All local sawmills on the Department's mailing list were advised of the availability of the material at the time it was put up for tender.  Apart from timber offered for sale under the tender system, limited quantities are made available periodically at various forests in County Donegal for local sale.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> The average tax now estimated to be ultimately payable by full time farmers in respect of 1982-83 assessment, the latest year for which such figures are available, is £570.  The actual average tax paid in respect of those assessments up to 31 May 1984 the latest date for which this information is available, is estimated at £430.</P>
    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P> 1.  The figure of 44,194 quoted by the Deputy relates to all farmers who were chargeable to tax on their farming profits in 1982-83.</P>
    <P>2.  All farmers within the charge to tax have been assessable on an accounts basis since 1980-81. Prior to that an optional notional basis of assessment was available.</P>
    <P>3.  The amount of tax ultimately payable for 1982-83 is the amount now estimated to be payable whether actually collected in that year or later.</P>
    <P>The tax is, in general, paid in consequence of assessments to income tax made by the inspector of taxes.  As the amounts so assessed are subject to the statutory appeal process there frequently are substantial variations between the amounts assessed and the amounts finally determined on appeal.  (The position may be further complicated by substantial claims for, e.g. stock relief and capital allowances of which notice had not been received when the initial assessments were being made).  Only when the appeals are finally settled will the figures for tax ultimately payable for 1982-83 emerge.</P>
    <P>4.  The figure of £570 is arrived at by dividing the total tax estimated to be ultimately due from full time farmers by the number of those farmers on record for the year of assessment 1982-83. The figure of £430 for actual average tax paid is arrived at by a similar calculation based on the tax actually paid by those farmers.</P>
    <P>5.  Income tax on farming profits is collected with schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished. Accordingly all figures for tax payments by farmers are estimated. </P>

These estimates are based on the latest comprehensive employment estimates by the Central Statistics Office which relate to mid-April 1983, and which do not disaggregate the numbers employed in agriculture from those employed in forestry and fishing, and on the level of Exchequer foreign debt obtaining at 31 March 1985 and 31 March 1983.</P>

The draft directive is concerned with seeking to abolish, in a number of stages, many of the derogations from the Sixth VAT Directive operated by member states of the Community.  Ireland and certain other member states have derogated from the Sixth VAT Directive to apply VAT to the services of dental technicians and the supply of dental prostheses, which services and supplies are to be VAT-exempt under the final tax arrangements in the Community.  The draft directive is, of course, concerned with many other issues besides and its implications for this country are currently being examined in my Department.  I have no plans at present to make changes in the current VAT treatment of the services of dental technicians or the other activities under scrutiny in the draft directive.

      <P>The allocation approved by the Southern Health Board for Valentia hospital in 1984 and 1985 was £45,378 and £55,000 respectively.  In addition funds amounting to £14,588 were made available to the hospital by the board in 1984 to clear certain accumulated deficits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise that not all the provisions in the new proposals will require additional expenditure.  There are important elements in the Bill which are concerned solely with the strengthening <Col N="1014" /> of the law and are unlikely to give rise to extra cost.</P>
      <P>As regards those aspects of the Bill envisaging improvements and extensions in the services it is not possible, at this stage, to estimate the additional costs which may arise in their implementation. The main determinant of expenditure in this area is the number of families who require support and the number of children who need to be taken into the care of, or placed under the supervision of, health boards.  It is difficult to forecast the level of need which may emerge in the future and the consequent expenditure implications for health boards.</P>
      <P>However, I expect that the implementation of the Bill will require a gradual and significant increase in staffing levels in the social work services of health boards and in other personnel who will be required to operate the new arrangements for the regulation and supervision of day care services, children's homes and private foster care.  I might add that expenditure on child care services during the current year is estimated at almost £14 million, an increase of almost £1 million on the 1984 outturn for those services.</P>

All benefit was paid including an adjustment in respect of injury benefit over and above the disability benefit paid on an interim basis.  There was, however, a delay in issuing the initial payment of disability benefit due to an earlier claim remaining open as a result of a final certificate not having been received.  Injury benefit is restricted to a maximum period of 26 weeks from the date of the accident concerned after which the claimant is considered for disability benefit.

      <P>When the person concerned made a claim for maternity benefit in January 1985 it transpired that she did <Col N="1025" /> not have sufficient contributions paid or credited on her behalf in the 1983-84 contribution year in order to qualify for payment.  However, following the submission of medical evidence in respect of three periods of incapacity in 1983 the person concerned now has the minimum 26 contributions paid or credited in 1983-84 to qualify her for payment of maternity benefit.  The claim has now been authorised for payment and a cheque for £447 covering the period 4 February 1985 to 27 April 1985 will issue to her on 12 June 1985.  Credited contributions have been awarded in respect of this claim.  The question of the entitlement to dental benefit of the person concerned was mentioned in the note submitted with the question.  The position is that persons aged 23 years or over must have, <i>inter alia,</i> not less than 156 contributions paid in order to qualify for benefit and the person concerned does not satisfy this condition.</P>
      <P>The regulations provide for an employment contribution only to be credited to an insured person in respect of any full contribution week of proven incapacity for work or employment.</P>
