      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment 1 was to deal with the nub of this whole question and it arose out of a sentence towards the end of the Minister's speech about the freedom of companies to put forward for sanction any air fares that they saw fit.  I asked the Minister at that time if that meant the substance of the amendment that I have put down to section 3 at amendment No. 11.1.  The saying has been that the Ritz is open to everybody, and that carried a great deal of meaning. The Minister's statement was that all air companies were free to put forward any fare structures and that they would be considered by him.  I repeat the wording of my amendment.</P>
      <P>In the tenth line after &ldquo;relate&rdquo;, to add &ldquo;and which tariff will not be rejected by the Minister solely on the grounds that it is too low&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That amendment again would leave the Minister with considerable powers but would take into account the kind of philosophical background or the national economic background which we have given in our contribution on this Bill.  I am strengthened in the view that I hold of this matter by the report in &ldquo;Community Report November-December 1985&rdquo; where Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, who is the relevant Commissioner, spoke about deregulation, and deregulation in a European context, needless to say.  That report on page 5, volume 5, No. 10, indicates that the Commission in looking for <Col N="1044" /> a new policy on air fares was not looking for the process of deregulation on the basis of the experience of the US.  He indicated that opponents of the proposals tended to cite the experience of the US as a kind of warning against allowing the same kind of system to obtain in Europe. Very relevantly, Commissioner Clinton Davis said that not only do the US have a single industry in a single economy but that the US administration takes a relaxed view about the fate of any one of its national carriers.  The Commissioner emphasised strongly that in Europe there were were ten industries and soon 12, ten economies soon 12, and such an attitude towards its national carriers &ldquo;is politically unthinkable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In a sense he has touched upon the problem here.  Of course, it may be said that it is not particularly or highly relevant to the Bill before the House that he should quote the US, but we must remember that the circumstances which prompted the introduction of the Bill in the first place were very closely connected with the US problem of air transport between Ireland and the US.  I see that some commentators have now switched it more towards intra-European.  Again the Commissioner is more than relevant, he is at the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>He commented on the proposals regarding the reform of the air transport sector in the Community.  In the previous debate Fianna Fáil on this side of the House referred to that 18 month old policy proposal by the Commission. Again let me quote the final paragraph in that little extract from &ldquo;Community Report&rdquo;.  It may be a help to the House: &ldquo;The 10 transport ministers have been presented with plans which will improve arrangements in the Community, in line with wider European and international systems, allow for lower fares where these are cost related&rdquo;&mdash; that would cut out undercutting cowboy operations &mdash;&ldquo;end the rights of one country to veto the lower fares of a competing airline...&rdquo; I presume he is talking in the Euro context and that everything was taken account of considering the various rights up to No. <Col N="1045" /> 5 or 6, whatever the limit is.  The report also refers to limiting the level of Government interference in capacity arrangements and the provision of guidelines for the use of State aids in the sector.  They are all highly relevant to the Bill.  I submit that the amendment is the most important one before the House and, consequently, I urge the Minister, and the House, to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much share the sentiments and motivation of Deputy Wilson in this regard.  Unfortunately, having considered the matter in great detail and following legal advice, I am told it would have the effect of undermining the provisions of the Bill considerably.  The purpose of the Bill is to be able to control affairs and not to allow them to go to a level that could be considered predatory. We have considered this matter in the two-day debate on Second Stage and on the two days already spent on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The aviation world is littered with the corpses of airlines who amidst great propaganda and hullabuloo came on the scene offering all sorts of low fares.  We had Air Florida, Laker Airways, Braniff Airways, Air National and several others who went out of business.  Every administration, especially this one, want low air fares.  As I said before a debate on air fares is not very relevant if we do not have air services.  If we have, as exists in the aviation world, people prepared to give bargain offers that may look attractive but force the regular airlines off routes, leave airports without a continuous year-round air service and, subsequently, fail that is not in the interests of the air traveller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to repeat that the first requirement of our national aviation policy is that there should be a continuity of air services from major points east and west of the country.  That is very important for industrial development, trade and tourism purposes.  We must guarantee a continuity of air services above all else.  The second most important string to national aviation policy is <Col N="1046" /> that such air services should be at the cheapest price possible.  I should like to repeat what I said in the House, and outside, on several occasions, that since I took office three years ago this week I have kept air fare increases below the rate of inflation.  We have got air fares inflation increases.  We have got air fares down in real terms for the first time in many years.  That has been achieved in spite of the fact that some of our neighbouring countries who are paraded as great liberals and advocates of low air fares approved on several occasions higher increases.  For instance, with regard to the famous Dublin-London route the British Civil Aviation Authority approved an application by Dan Air, Aer Lingus, and British Airways for a 10 per cent increase last year but I did not approve it.  I insisted that the increase should be below the rate of inflation and I got it down below that figure.  The British Civil Aviation Authority justified their approval of a 10 per cent increase by the rise in costs in the aviation world but that was not good enough for me.  That is one of many examples of where we kept down the amount of increases in aviation fares.</P>
    <P>Given that the second leg of our national aviation policy is to keep air fares as low as possible it is with some regret that I cannot accept the amendment in its present form.  However, because I support the motivation that lies behind it and that I am very much <i>ad idem</i> with Deputy Wilson in his approach to this matter, I undertake to consider this further to see if it will be possible to bring forward a suitable amendment &mdash; I cannot be sure of that &mdash; for consideration on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed, but not surprised, to hear the Minister turn down this amendment.  He concluded by trying to give reassurances of a type to Deputy Wilson which are designed at getting Deputy Wilson to withdraw his amendment and not have a division on it.  He has done so also by telling the Deputy that he will think of some way of trying to express this in another form of amendment but it must be remembered <Col N="1047" /> that the amendment has been down for more than seven months and there was ample time if it appealed to the Minister to seek to reword it in some other way and table an amendment in his name. The truth of the matter is that the Minister does not want to do that but he does not want to disagree too strongly with Deputy Wilson because Deputy Wilson has facilitated him by agreeing to a guillotine of this debate today.  It suits the Government and, perhaps, other Members of the House, to have a guillotine and to have the Committee Stage brought to an end.  We have had only a relatively short Committee Stage, part of two days, the last one seven months ago and the previous one eight months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as well to remind the House because of the long delays that have taken place that what we are debating now is what was described by the Minister as emergency legislation when it was introduced on 27 June 1984.  At the time the House was told that it had to be passed in a matter of days or there would be a calamity in the Irish aviation scene.  I pointed out some of the many defects in the Bill and, as a result of the reaction of people in newspapers and elsewhere to the speech I made at that time, the Government decided not to proceed with the Bill but to delay it for some time.  The delay has now extended to 18 months and, presumably, it will take quite some time more if it is proceeded with.  It was because of the seven month delay since we last debated the Committee Stage that I thought that the Bill had been forgotten about.  I was surprised to discover at the weekend that it was coming up again this week and I wondered why that was the case.  I came to the conclusion that it may well have something to do with &mdash; one cannot be sure of this &mdash; the success of Bord Fáilte and Aer Rianta in introducing Pan American and Delta on to the transatlantic route from next spring, a move which I welcome and which I consider will be of great benefit to our economy if they are allowed to operate in a <Col N="1048" /> way that will encourage them to continue to serve the Irish market as they obviously want to and not forced the way some of their predecessors were.</P>
    <P>The whole question of price contained in Deputy Wilson's amendment is the kernel of the Bill.  Due to the passage of 18 months since the debate on this Bill started it is well to remind ourselves what the legislation is about, it is all about pricing.  The Bill is seeking to make it a crime here to charge too little for its service.  The original intention was that if one charged too little one could get two years in jail and/or a fine of £100,000. The Minister has amendments down which are, I suppose, to liberalise that aspect and one will get only one year in jail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>No jail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the fine is being reduced to £50,000 or £20,000 &mdash; the figure is in the amendment.  We are asked to accept that that is some kind of major advance in relation to the Bill in the last 18 months.  The whole crux of the Bill is the question of price and whether people are allowed to charge the kind of fares that they want to or whether, against their will, they have to keep up their level of charges.  That is what they are being forced to do in this country if they fly into and out of it or within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson when speaking a few minutes ago quoted from an article or speech by the Transport Commissioner, Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, in what I think he said was the December edition of <i>Euro Forum.</i> I do not seem to have that edition, but I have the October one where Mr. Clinton Davis is quoted to much the same effect.  I would remind the Minister that everything that Mr. Clinton Davis said in the quotation given by Deputy Wilson and in the October issue from which I quoted the last day is countered by this Bill.  This Bill goes in every respect in the opposite direction to that in which the Commission want to go in Memorandum II and in all their various statements since then.  What in the name of <Col N="1049" /> goodness is the point of this whole effort to run counter to the entire movement going on within Europe and, indeed, worldwide?  What is the point of his taking on here repeated assertions of the Commission, not just the Transport Commissioner but also &mdash; and even perhaps more importantly &mdash; the Competition Commissioner, Mr. Sutherland, the Minister's former colleague, who has gone on record time and again this year &mdash; perhaps as often as six times &mdash; as saying that he is determined that the scandal of the present system within Europe in relation to cartels and the keeping up of air fares will be ended by him during his commissionership and that he will do so during 1986.</P>

      <P>The amendment, Sir, relates to &ldquo;which tariff shall not be rejected by the Minister solely on the grounds that it is too low&rdquo;.  The high level of fares is recognised throughout Europe as scandalous.  Some people want to defend and retain that situation, but they are a very diminishing number.  Could I draw the House's attention in this connection to the well known case which is going on at the moment in the European Court in which a court in Paris has referred five prosecutions by the French authorities against airlines and travel agents to that court to decide whether or not the French law which seeks to <Col N="1050" /> encourage airlines to fix fares at particular levels is in accordance with the competition articles of the treaty.  Within the past month the Advocate General has given his opinion to the European Court in Luxembourg in which he says that that French law, which is not very different from this law but does not go nearly as far, should be thrown out by the court. It does not necessarily follow that the court in the decision, which I understand they will not give until January, will follow the Advocate General, but it is normal enough practice that they would. I am told that in over 80 per cent of cases they do.  If they follow his opinion, where stands this legislation and this particular section?  Would it not be very much better to have this amendment but in a way which would give the Minister some grounds for trying to argue at that stage, if such a thing were to happen, that there is the possibility that because of this provision the Minister is bound not to reject a tariff simply on the grounds that it is too low, that there is some better chance that it may not infringe the provision of the treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering that court case, one does not even have to be certain, because one cannot be, that it will be decided by the court in accordance with the opinion of the Advocate General.  Even if it is not, Commissioner Sutherland has made it clear that, notwithstanding that, in 1986 the Commission has taken upon itself to put an end to this non-competitive cartel type of practice which keeps air fares in Europe artificially up, to the detriment of all European economies, and I suggest not least our economy.  For these reasons this amendment should be accepted.  I cannot see what is wrong with simply saying that a particular fare or tariff will not be rejected by the Minister solely on the grounds that it is too low.  Why is he not prepared to accept that?  Surely it is perfectly correct for him not to reject solely on the grounds of a tariff being too low?  What is his objection to fares that are too low?  If an airline are prepared to fix fares which the Minister in his wisdom considers too low that is the airline's affair.  They have to live with the possible <Col N="1051" /> consequences.  The Minister quotes various airlines which have gone out of business. American airlines and Laker to which I say &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; How many dozens more have come into operation in recent years and more than replaced them?</P>

      <P>The example that he is giving of Laker going out of business is a bad one because Laker has now been awarded very substantial damages indeed in American courts against, among others, State-owned airlines for putting him out of business illegally.  It was not the best example.  This amendment is absolutely harmless and should be accepted.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that it removes the effectiveness of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to speak briefly on Deputy O'Malley's statements.  First, why is the Deputy a lone ranger in this House in opposing this Bill?  Is he saying seriously that the other 165 Members who are supporting the Bill are supplying, or want to ensure, higher air fares?  That is manifestly and absolutely not so.  It is very hard to believe that Deputy O'Malley does not know that.  Of course, we want all air fares to be as low as possible, but the Deputy was Minister for Industry and Commerce for a considerable length of time.  He fixed minimum price orders for all sorts of goods and this is the aviation equivalent of being able to fix a minimum price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy telling me that he did not take action against below cost selling?  Is he advocating below cost selling regardless of the consequences? That is the nub of the question. <Col N="1052" /> I want to repeat that my policies have brought down air fares.  We have repeatedly forced down the level of increases in air fares over the past three years despite the fact that other countries, who have been praised repeatedly by opponents of this Bill, have approved increases twice the size of those which we were prepared to approve.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to announce now that I have approved in principle a new air service from Dublin to Luton, return, costing £99.  I have given Ryan Air the go ahead and it will be announced by my Department later today.  It will be welcomed by many people and is another indication of the policies consistently pursued by me since I became Minister for Transport and subsequently Minister for Communications.  Despite the facts, Deputy O'Malley consistently misrepresents the purpose of this Bill which is neutral and an enabling measure to put beyond doubt the powers of the Minister for Communications in the area of regulating air fares.  Those powers were always considered to be there but were put in doubt by a court case involving an airline and a travel agency.  As the court did not grant a temporary injunction, the question was put in doubt and this Bill is by way of clarification and improvement.</P>
      <P>My colleagues on the European Council of Transport Ministers know very clearly where I stand.  I am among the most ardent advocates of liberalisation of air transport.  I go much further than any of my colleagues on the EC Council of Ministers and I am all for an open skies policy throughout the European Community. It is no harm to repeat that in the aftermath of the European Council meeting where they had been talking about further moves towards unification of Europe.  One of the great ambitions which we must have in the context of European unity is to have one aviation system for the EC and that airlines within the EC would have equal opportunities to compete on all routes within the EC. Aer Lingus would then take their chances and Ireland would also take its chances in that context.</P>

      <P>I take your point but I am just explaining the overall policy of this administration in relation to air fares and getting them down.  We cannot allow a situation where below cost selling is permitted on a temporary basis and the regular airline pushed off routes causing one of two things to happen &mdash; the surviving airline being in a monopoly can push the fares up, or it collapses, which is more likely to happen.</P>

      <P>At last I am beginning to see the fruits of my labours.  I am delighted to hear that at long last the Minister has approved of a £99 return air fare between Dublin and Luton.  It was applied for last April and, even though the Minister gave assurances that all these matters would be decided within a month, the application of Ryan Air seems to have taken eight months to be decided on.  However, even though it took eight months thank God it has happened. At long last the kind of thing I had been asking for is happening for the first time.  I assure the House that, if I had not taken the stand I did over the past 18 months in relation to this matter, the hopes of Ryan Air of getting approval for the Dublin-Luton route at that fare would be negligible.  They would not have got it after eight years, let alone eight months.</P>

      <P>In spite of advice that the Minister got from certain quarters he had to give in and I should like to congratulate and thank him for doing so. There is often concealment of material facts in the airline business and I should like the assurance of the Minister that this is a genuine £99 fare and not full of all kinds of restrictions like having to go out on a Saturday night and come back on a Sunday morning or something of that kind.  Is this fare equivalent to the £208 cartel fare?</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say this but Deputy O'Malley, uncharacteristically, has continuously distorted the situation. For instance, he asked if the fare of £99 is the same as the £208 cartel fare. There are different levels of fares and £208 is the highest fare.  There are fares as low as £69 return but they are very restricted.  I am glad to tell the Deputy that there will be no restrictions on the £99 fare.  It will be a regular return fare.</P>

      <P>It is contrary to the policies followed up to now but I congratulate the Minister.  This is a great step forward in terms of Irish aviation policy. At long last what I have been asking for has happened and Irish people can now travel between Britain and here for £99 return which is roughly the economic cost.  Unfortunately, they cannot travel to Heathrow or Gatwick yet, but I am sure that will happen shortly.  That will certainly be a major event but Luton is a relatively short distance from London, I think about one hour by road.  This is a marvellous advance and it is only fair to congratulate the Minister.  He said it is a normal fare not subject to restriction and that it is equivalent to the £208 cartel fare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I do not think I did but I will refer briefly to it now.  Non-price competition by airlines is inherently wasteful.  It uses up valuable resources in image building and in artificial product differentiation.  It promotes low load factors and over-staffing.  This <Col N="1056" /> wasteful competition builds low productivity airlines and does not provide what the consumer wants, which is the cheapest feasible point to point low cost transport with fares which are not hedged in with restrictions.  Airlines fly the same aircraft between the same airports. Attempts at product differentiation are wasteful and exist only because of restrictions on price competition.  The real test of competition will be when airlines work out their fares independently and cease charging the same fares for every single category of passenger.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 3, I want to add a number of additional categories which should be taken into account by the Minister in considering an airline tariff.  These factors are the promotion of economic development by the availability of price competitive passenger mail and cargo services by air, the promotion of regional development, the availability of discounted airline tickets in neighbouring jurisdictions, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and in particular of Articles 85, 86 and 90 thereof, and the recommendations of the Report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on competition between travel agents presented to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in June 1984.  These are all matters of quite some significance which should be taken into account by the Minister when considering airline tariffs submitted to him.</P>
      <P>On the question of the promotion of economic development by the availability of price competitive passenger mail and cargo services by air, it is somewhat startling to realise that aviation in Ireland, unlike nearly all European countries, is rather stagnant because of the very conservative policy that is pursued here.  The first chink of light we have had has been within the past ten minutes. Tourism has already suffered heavily on the air tourist side and in a period of seven or eight years air tourism from Britain, as opposed to overall tourism, has declined by 50 per cent.  Business trips are also down very substantially, which has a considerable bearing on the promotion of economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> We lost half our air tourists in the period 1975-1983, according to the Central Statistics Office.  Since 1979 air travel between Britain and the Republic of Ireland has fallen from 2.015 million to 1.660 million, a fall of 17.5 per cent. Between 1980-1983 the number of business trips by air from the Republic to Britain fell from 149,000 a year to 114,000, a fall of 24 per cent.  In 1984 traffic between Britain and the Netherlands rose by 16 per cent in the nine months of operation of the Anglo-Dutch bilateral arrangement.  It is now running at over two million people a year.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the London-Dublin air route was 50 per cent busier than the London-Belfast route.  This year, 1985, will be the second year in which the London-Belfast route is a busier route than the London-Dublin route.  We know why that is so.  It is simply because of the question of price competition.  Unfortunately nobody would be in a position to describe Belfast as a prime tourist destination.  Traffic in Belfast airport grew from 700,000 in 1983 to an estimated 900,000 this year as a result of the competition which exists there.</P>
    <P>The proposals earlier this year for an £85 London-Dublin air fare were turned down in circumstances which in other countries would give rise to much questioning and possibly proceedings in appropriate courts.  That did not happen here because the Restrictive Practices Act of 1972 does not apply at present to air services, which is a pity.  One hopes that what happened last January and February in relation to the proposals by Dan-Air will not happen again in the light of the Minister's decision to allow this new fare between Dublin and Luton.  We hope that if Dan-Air propose in 1986 the kind of fare they proposed in 1985, they will not be put in such circumstances that they will not be able to go ahead.</P>
    <P>One of the factors to which the Minister should have regard when considering an airline tariff submitted to him under this section is the question of discounted fares in adjoining jurisdictions.  It is really a bit of a joke that it is possible for a <Col N="1058" /> travel agent in this country to sell what he likes in respect of people who commence their journey outside the Repbulic.  I saw a travel agency in Dawson Street advertising within the past day or two all kinds of discounted fares ex Belfast.  They are entitled to do that but if they were to advertise ex Dublin, ex Shannon or ex Cork they would be committing a crime under this Bill, for which the penalties would be very severe.  Does it not underline the ridiculousness of the situation that a travel agent in Dawson Street can advertise widely and sell discounted fares ex Belfast?  Of course it is an encouragement to people to go to Belfast and avail of these fares.  A recent article in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> pointed out that a survey they carried out indicated that some of their readers from as far south as Tipperary were travelling to Belfast to avail of the much lower fares.  The leading article in the most recent edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> stated that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder that people go to Belfast to avail of fares that are cheaper by £100 as compared with the fares here.  It would be unnatural if people did not do that.  However, it is a considerable pity and obviously it is a great loss to our economy but until things change presumably people will continue to go to Belfast.  There is a great danger that the situation will be made considerably worse as a result of the passage of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who reads <i>The Sunday Times</i> or <i>The Times</i>, two great sources of advertisements for discounted air fares, will see literally hundreds of such advertisements in every issue.  There is no possibility that Britain will abandon its policy of permitting discounted air fares.  More <Col N="1059" /> than five million people use them each year.  They are extremely popular and are likely to continue to be popular.  The Air Transport Users' Committee in Britain in their 1981 annual report made that point.  They said that the estimated five million tickets sold at various discounts were likely to increase rather than to decrease.  They went on to say that the committee still believed that widespread discounting operates for the general benefit of airlines and passengers.  However, they would like to see legislation for the sale of bulk fares by carriers for subsequent general resale by all travel agents, thus extending the availability of discounted air fares to a wider travelling public.  They said that was a matter that the Department of Trade seemed at that time unable to resolve.  In their subsequent report for 1981-82 the same committee said that what was needed was Government action that would make discounted tickets available to all, with any condition attached clearly explained, and firm guarantees that such tickets carry no extra risk of the purchaser being stranded or losing the money paid for the tickets. That is the attitude in Britain, our neighbouring jurisdiction, and in Northern Ireland.  We cannot legislate in a vacuum on the basis that these practices do not exist 100 miles from this city.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why those connected with aviation and the Department involved go to such lengths to try to ensure that the ordinary rules of competition laid down in the Treaty of Rome, particularly in Articles 85, 86 and 90, should not apply to airlines and air services. Article 85 outlaws the following:</P>
    <P> (a)  Any activity which, directly or indirectly, fixes purchasers' selling prices or any other trading conditions;</P>
    <P>(b)  Limits or controls production, markets, technical development or investment;</P>
    <P>(c)  Shares markets or sources of supply;</P>
    <P>(d)  Applies dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thus placing them at a competitive disadvantage. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> If those four conditions were in effect now in relation to airline arrangements, which we know are made privately and subsequently ratified, they would be contravened by the kind of arrangements that are taken for granted.  Article 85 has been in force in the European Community since 1958 and not without reason.  It is used to the great benefit of European citizens and consumers in Europe.  I do not know why it is not taken into account by the Minister in relation to these matters.  He should accept them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also take into account the recommendations of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on competition between travel agents presented to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in June 1984.  We understand that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is broadly in agreement with those recommendations. I think if he were free to do so he would be quite willing to implement them, all of which run counter to the provisions of this Bill.  I should like to quote recommendation No. 9 of the Restrictive Practices Commission.  It states as follows:</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a provision in the rules of an association of tour operators and/or travel agents imposing on its members price maintenance requirements in respect of rates and fares for travel on scheduled services, whether surface or air, should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>This statutory commission are recommending that non-competition or resale price maintenance should be prohibited under the restrictive practices law and, therefore, should be made a crime. However, in this Bill the direct opposite is happening.  Resale price maintenance is not being made a crime but failure to observe price maintenance is being made a crime.  What is recommended in the Restrictive Practices Commission report is in the public interest and in the interests of consumers generally, but under this Bill if a person were to carry out those recommendations he would be committing a crime, even though he was acting for the benefit of the economy and of the consumer.  The Bill using very draconian <Col N="1061" /> penalties makes compulsory this regime of resale price maintenance which the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism thinks should be prohibited.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not had the grace to admit that in every debate here he has made umpteen factual errors, allegations and statements that are not true.  I should like to quote from the publication entitled <i>Boardroom,</i> a Northern Ireland business magazine, issued in June 1985.  It said:</P>
      <P>The Belfast-London routes though booming are profitless.  The airlines pin their hopes on higher load factors and a growth of no-discount passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The article discusses the air fares war on the Belfast route.  The airlines lost £2 million on the Heathrow-Belfast service in 1984.  Pre-tax profits fell by more than £1 million because of the heat of competition &mdash; there is an air fares war.  The airlines are getting extra numbers but no extra money, thus losing money.  This is a feature of aviation history: what would be a profitable route for two airlines becomes unprofitable for three or four.  There are too many seats chasing too few passengers.  This brings about a situation of depressed air fares.  How long will it last?  What is important is continuity of air services and at the same time to keep air fares as low as possible consistent with continuity of services.  Deputy O'Malley proposes to insert &ldquo;price&rdquo;<Col N="1062" /> which would make the Bill more restrictive. His speech was in justification of that, and I am surprised.  I could accept on Report Stage an amendment to insert &ldquo;price&rdquo; at the end of the paragraph which would then read &ldquo;including tariffs which would be price competitive&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make long speeches in reply to every long speech made by Deputies.  I have already laid down several conditions which clarify the purpose of the Bill and the maintenance of policy in relation to air services. In view of the particular relevance of air fares to the tourist industry, I thought it only right that the criteria being laid down should contain a specific reference to the tourism dimension.  I recognise, of course, that there are other important dimensions, such as the promotion of general economic development, regional <Col N="1063" /> development, etc.  I am satisfied, however, that all of these elements are adequately taken care of by the provisions of paragraph (c) of my amendment, specifically by the inclusion of the words &ldquo;having regard in particular to the public interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it appropriate that references to discounting in neighbouring jurisdictions or to the recommendations of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission should be included.  As Deputy O'Malley is presumably aware, air services are outside the scope of the restrictive practices legislation and, as I understand the situation, the Commission endeavoured in their report to avoid making recommendations impinging on scheduled air fares, which are the primary focus of the legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>Questions relating to the application of the competition rules of the Treaty to air transport are being addressed in various Community institutions at present.  The European Court is deliberating on a case referred to it by the French courts, while the Council are proceeding to act on the proposals in the Commission's Memorandum No. 2 on Civil Aviation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is totally neutral in its attitude to EC law and it will be implemented in a way that will conform fully with whatever EC rules may dictate.  In any event, and were a dispute to arise, the House will be aware that EC law takes precedence over domestic legislation.  I believe that Deputy O'Malley's amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reiterate that I have tabled the amendment for clarification purposes because of distortions that have gained currency.  The purpose of the Bill is to clarify beyond doubt that this and future administrations will have the same regulatory power as all previous administrations. Of course, everyone in the country wants the lowest possible air fares and we in the Government want the most liberal possible aviation policy for Europe.  We are pressing for that at EC level.  We believe that that will bring lower air fares and an overall better service <Col N="1064" /> to the travelling public, but we cannot have selective liberalisation. Selective liberalisation that would suit the interests of other countries might not suit us here.  There is no doubt that other countries will pick the things that suit them and their national interests.  For instance, we want to deal with the fifth freedom.  We are all for the fifth freedom. We grant many out of Shannon Airport, in which Deputy O'Malley is particularly interested.</P>

      <P>We have a very liberal attitude in regard to the fifth freedom out of Shannon.  Delta and Pan-Am are coming to Ireland on the North Atlantic route.  I have made it clear to them that they are most welcome.  I have had very friendly meetings with them.  Delta have filed for fifth freedom rights to Gatwick, out of Shannon.  Will the British aviation authorities give them the same right?  If they do that they will be breaking new ground for the British Civil Aviation authority but Delta are very pessimistic about obtaining those rights.  We allow for freedom of rights but some of our neighbouring countries who pose as great liberals in the matter of aviation policy do not allow for freedom of rights.  Aer Lingus, for instance, spent a lot of money developing routes out of Manchester but were thrown off those routes as soon as they had made them profitable.  Similarly on the Dublin-Lourdes-Rome flight, the French got rid of Aer Lingus after they had developed the route.</P>

      <P>The same happened in respect of Geneva and Milan.  We consider that behaviour to be wrong and <Col N="1065" /> restrictive.  We believe in a very liberal aviation policy but aviation policy must not be selective in terms of suiting one or other country.  If air fares are to be reduced overall, if there is to be improved efficiency generally in the world of air transport and if there is to be fair competition, all the airlines of the EC must have equal access to all the routes as is the case in the US.  That is what we are working towards.  It is a very radical policy and one that goes much further than the policy of any of our EC partners, though I am glad to say that we are succeeding in having them move in that direction, too. Because a certain credibility attaches to Deputy O'Malley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly I wish to state the motivation for the amendment in my name in the light of what the Minister has said.  At the outset I indicated the Opposition's position with regard to Aer Lingus as the national airline.  I indicated that it has been the tradition of this party to support the national airline, having established it in the first instance and nurtured it through the years.</P>
      <P>I should like also to advert to the fact that in our last published policy on air transport we indicated that we expected Aer Lingus to be a commercially viable corporation and it was in the light of that that we approached this Bill.  It is in that context also that my amendment is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those economists who have commented on the legislation should be reminded that the <i>raison d'etre</i> of this House goes back to a policy which Arthur <Col N="1066" /> Griffith enunciated first, namely, that we should rely on ourselves to the maximum extent possible.  That would be within the principles I have mentioned, namely, that we expect Aer Lingus to behave in a fashion that will make the company commercially viable and which will take due account of the consumer and the consumer's interest.  The day of the idealist seems to be gone.  It is regarded as Quixotic to ask in the market place for the Irish product.  I would be regarded as a fool if, as one living nearer to Belfast than to Dublin, I chose Dublin rather than Belfast for my purchases.  I am speaking not from a full wallet type of background or philosophy but from the point of view of something I believe in and that is what compels me to crawl with my car back across the Border into the Republic to buy petrol or diesel at a higher rate than I would pay a couple of miles down the road.  People might smile at this but there remains some who are motivated by that type of thinking.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the sharpest fares possible obtain in Aer Lingus.  This would be to the benefit of the national carrier and to the benefit of the economy and would ensure that the customer is given a fair deal when he is using air transport.  I used Aer Lingus last weekend.  I was going to Cardiff but there was no direct flight to that city.  The reason offered was that the flight had been discontinued because of lack of customer support.  Consequently I had to travel first to Bristol.  I was glad to note that the plane I travelled on was made in Belfast, I regard that as inportant but I would have preferred a lower fare. There were only ten people on the plane from Dublin to Bristol but there were 35, which I think was the maximum, on the return journey.  I do not know whether there was any significance in that.  I am putting this on the record in the light of what Deputy O'Malley has said and to ensure that the stand I am taking is not misunderstood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said regarding fifth freedom rights out of Shannon.  The Minister will <Col N="1067" /> recall that early last year TransAmerica Airlines could not exercise effectively their fifth freedom right from Shannon to Amsterdam because of their being forced to charge a fare which was so high as to render it not worth their while continuing service on the route.  I am delighted to hear the good news that Delta are interested in fifth freedom rights out of Shannon but it appears from what the Minister says that their prospects of getting those rights in relation to Gatwick may not be all that good.  However, I would not be concerned unduly about that because there is a service from Shannon to London, though it is an extremely bad service.  It is operated by the cartel partners and could hardly be worse.  If Delta are turned down for Gatwick, the Minister might suggest to them that they apply for other locations such as Amsterdam, Paris or perhaps Frankfurt.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to <Col N="1068" /> hear that.  Occasionally in the midst of all this, we find some progress.  I hope that what was forced on TransAmerica in the past couple of years in relation to fifth freedom rights out of Shannon will not happen to any other carrier and that they will be allowed charge fares sufficient to make it worth their while keeping the route open.  It will be of tremendous benefit to the country if there is direct access from Shannon to the Continent.</P>

      <P>On the section, could I inquire from the Minister if he would agree to put in an amendment on Report Stage under subsection (2) in relation to the making of a decision on a tariff submitted.  I thought there was an amendment relating to that here &mdash; but there is not &mdash; and that the Minister would make a decision within one month or some other reasonable period.  My belief that the decision period would be one month arises from another ministerial amendment of similar type where a period of one month is specified.  It seems appropriate that decisions should be made within a reasonable time.  We have just heard about the Ryan Air flight to Luton which I welcome.  I understand that was lodged last April and this is December.  Perhaps it is because this Committee Stage is on today that a decision was made today, but it would be of great benefit to everyone, not just the airlines, if decisions on these matters were made within one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the point that Deputy O'Malley raised, Ryan Air asked for a decision in principle before 31 October and a decision was about to be made when some indication was received in my Department about management changes.  One thing we have to satisfy ourselves about is the management arrangements of any airline and dates on which things take place.  That was one factor which caused a delay to beyond 31 October.  There is a requirement within Europe agreed through ECAC, the European Civil Aviation conference, that decisions would be made normally within one month, but sometimes the airlines file long in advance of a required decision date for all sorts of consultation reasons and reasons of testing the water in different civil aviation authority jurisdictions.  Therefore within Europe there is an agreement that in general decisions would be made within one month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section as now amended would apply to agents, presumably travel agents, as well as to airlines. I find it difficult to go along with this because it extends the cartel situation which exists among airlines &mdash; which is proved in this country anyway &mdash; to travel agents as well.  In doing that it goes directly against the recommendations of the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission that arrangements of that <Col N="1075" /> kind should be prohibited.  On the previous section I quoted the recommendation of the RPC prohibiting and suggesting that it be made unlawful and an offence that an arrangement of this kind should be made, but it is being made here.  It seems regrettable, to say the least, that that should be the case.  We have two organs of the same Government pulling in directly opposite directions. The RPC and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism say that practices of this kind should be prohibited and made unlawful and the Minister for Communications is here with his Bill and this section saying that practices of this kind not alone should not be made unlawful but it should be unlawful not to carry out practices of this kind.</P>
      <P>This may not be of great interest to many people, it may be too technical and so on, but it is really ludicrous that at the same time in the same Government in relation to the same practices one commission and one Minister are saying &ldquo;prohibit them&rdquo; and another Minister is bringing in legislation here to say &ldquo;not alone do not prohibit them, but enforce them and make it a crime if those very practices are not put into practice&rdquo;.  This deserves attention.  A Cabinet are supposed, where difficulties of this kind arise between Department as they do frequently from time to time, to make the decision as to what line should be taken. There are two absolutely conflicting lines. The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Restrictive Practices Commission take one line while the Minister for Communications takes another.  It has not been resolved by the Cabinet and it should be.  The Minister should take the Bill away and get the matter resolved so that we will know where the Government stand.  Are we going to see a Restrictive Trade Practices Bill in the House in the next month or two promoted by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism making illegal the very thing the Minister for Communications wants to make legal?  It is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should ask ourselves whether, if <Col N="1076" /> a travel agent can perform his role in retailing airline tickets for less than the fixed 9 per cent of the retail price of the ticket, he should be allowed to pass on that saving to the consumer.  Under the terms of this section, as a result of the amendment made to it and the general provisions in it, that is illegal.  If a travel agent said he would work for 6 per cent commission he commits a crime.  Is there any other country in the world that does that?  Travel agents all over Britain sell millions of discount tickets every year &mdash; more than five million is the official estimate but that figure is probably well in excess of five million now &mdash; and not alone is that allowed there but it is encouraged.  However, one can get jail for that here.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister will impose the draconian penalties in the Bill on travel agents who, for example, may give a free ticket to one of their best customers in return for his custom?  That is not an uncommon practice.  But how will a travel agent be prevented from doing that? How will that be policed?  Who will know whether a customer paid for a ticket or not?  In relation to this ridiculous provision, it was pointed out to me by a semi-State body &mdash; as the House will be aware there are several semi-State bodies up in arms, furious about the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a travel agent is prohibited from giving a discount &mdash; even a modest one of a few per cent &mdash; and that is a crime, will it be a crime if instead of nominally giving the discount on the ticket he writes in the full price on the ticket, charges the full price but hands the client a voucher for £20 worth of duty free goods in lieu of the discount so that the client going out on the trip will hand the voucher to the duty free shop at Dublin, Shannon or Cork and get goods to the value of £20?  The client will look upon that as the equivalent of a discount, and it is precisely that.  Does the Minister not realise how futile this sort of exercise is in trying to make such practices illegal when there is not the slightest difficulty of getting around them and when within 200 yards of the House, in the next street, there is at this moment a travel agent advertising all kinds of discounts ex Belfast, which is just 100 miles away?  In fact, Belfast is nearer to this city than Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>Is it all right to offer discounts to selected people but not to offer them to the public at large?  I do not think that is all right.  Since they are available in virtually every country in the world they should be available here.  I do not think it should be necessary for somebody to have to travel to Belfast to get a ticket.  He should be able to do it from Dublin or Shannon if he wants to.  He should not be put in the position that he is forced by the much higher cost of flying out of this jurisdiction to go to another jurisdiction.  Not everybody is like Deputy Wilson, who said that even if it cost him £100 extra he would fly from Dublin.  I salute that patriotism, but there are very few like Deputy Wilson.  Most people will avail of the opportunity that there is to save £100. A lot of people are going to take the discounted flights out of Belfast now because they cannot get them out of Dublin or Shannon.  That only causes loss to the country.</P>

      <P>Throughout the debate Deputy O'Malley has been getting things very seriously wrong.  He referred to the report of the Restrictive <Col N="1078" /> Practices Commission and suggested that there was a great divide between my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Restrictive Practices Commission and myself.  I presume the Deputy has read the report of the commission and I am sure that, due to a lapse of memory, he has forgotten that the report does not, like the Bill, deal with scheduled air fares.  The report deals with chartered air fares.  One of the difficulties in dealing with the Bill is that Deputy O'Malley continues to make comments about things that are inaccurate. It is difficult to deal with that.  The points made about the report of the commission are not pertinent to the Bill, which deals with scheduled air fares and not charter fares.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the extract already, but obviously the Minister and his advisers did not hear it all.  I will read it again.  It states:</P>
      <P>9.  The inclusion of a provision in the rules of an association of tour operators and/or travel agents imposing on its members price maintenance requirements in respect of rates and fares for travel on scheduled services, whether surface or air, should be prohibited.</P>
      <P>It only deals with scheduled services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That quotation has been taken completely out of context.  It deals with the rules of the Irish Travel Agents Association in that respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told me that it did not deal with scheduled services at all but with chartered services. However, after I have read out the quotation for the second time he realises for the first time that it only deals with scheduled services.  He is now saying I am wrong again because the quotation relates to the Irish Travel Agents Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>The next amendment, No. 13, proposes the insertion of a new section.  It is in the name of the Minister and on that amendment <Col N="1080" /> No. 3 is consequential.  Therefore, amendments Nos. 3, 13 and the amendment No. 1 to No. 13, in the name of Deputy Des O'Malley, may be debated together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P> 5.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall keep a register (in this Act referred to as &lsquo;the register&rsquo;) for the purposes of this Act and shall, as soon as may be, enter therein particulars of&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  any airline tariff submitted pursuant to the requirements of a notice under section 3 of this Act and the name of the air carrier by or on whose behalf the submission was made, and</P>
      <P>(b)  any decision given by the Minister under the said section 3. </P>
      <P>(2)  The register shall be kept at such place as the Minister shall direct and shall be available for inspection during such office hours as shall for the time being be specified by the Minister.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>As I indicated when moving amendment No. 3 which provides the definition for the register, the new section proposed in amendment No. 13 is very much a consumer orientated measure.  Subsection (1) requires the keeping of an up to date register of airlines, tariff proposals and decisions made by the Minister thereon. Subsection (2) provides that the Minister shall make the register available for public inspection during designated office hours.  The ready availability of one register of tariff filings as they come into my Department will mean that any interested party can see what airlines are proposing. Similarly, the public will have a ready means available to them to check what fares have actually been approved or disapproved as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This register might be helpful to Deputy O'Malley because he asserted twice, earlier in this debate, that a filing <Col N="1081" /> had been made by Dan-Air.  Despite denials by myself, Dan-Air and Aer Lingus he repeated that statement.  With a register available now even Deputy O'Malley will not be able to get it wrong, because he will be able to check.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>Between the eighth and ninth lines, to add the following paragraphs:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  any communication between an airline and the Minister or his Department concerning fares or <Col N="1082" /> charges and route access involving the said airline,</P>

    <P>Before I get into the details of that amendment, I should like to make a brief comment on the Minister's statement, which he keeps coming back to, about my alleged mis-statements, he having been caught out on section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He thinks only in these rather combative terms.  I feel that I should exercise my right of reply.  I said that Dan-Air filed an application, or made one to the CAA, as they told various people at the time, and that it had been granted in accordance with the normal practice.  Various people told me that Dan-Air had said that to them.  Dan-Air confirmed that they had said that to them when it was rechecked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of an inquiry carried out by the Minister and myself jointly on, I think, 24 September last, we got a little nearer the facts, but not right to the bottom of them because those who are actually at the meeting in question were not allowed to attend.  What we did establish at that September meeting was that at the meeting held between Dan-Air, Aer Lingus and British Airways on 23 January 1985, Dan-Air, who had at that stage made informal soundings in accordance with the normal practice of airlines <Col N="1083" /> and had been given a positive indication by the British CAA that this proposal of theirs for an £85 fare between Dublin and London would be granted, mentioned this at the meeting.  There was immediately a hostile reception to that in various statements which were made which, in turn, in the week or so later caused Dan-Air not to proceed with the matter.  The Minister makes great play of this and has contradicted me about six times in this House on the basis that I said that Dan-Air had made a filing and had been accepted by the CAA.  It turns out that Dan-Air did not make a filing in the formal and strict sense of the word.</P>
    <P>What they did was what they and Aer Lingus and all other airlines do in similar circumstances.  They went in before that and said: &ldquo;We propose to do this.  Would you agree to it or not?&rdquo; After it had been considered by the CAA, that body said &ldquo;Yes, we will grant it.  You can now make your filing if you want to.&rdquo;  At that stage the meeting with Aer Lingus and British Airways took place and, as a result of that meeting, Dan-Air did not proceed with the formal filing.  Nonetheless, it is perfectly clear that, within the normal meaning of the terms within the industry, that fare was approved by the CAA and it is only misleading the public to suggest otherwise, or to try to rely on this sheer technicality of the technical meaning of the word &ldquo;filing&rdquo;.  People concerned for the truth should not seek to rely on or justify themselves with such things.</P>

      <P>If I may return to the amendment to establish the whole question of the register, this is a very welcome development indeed.  It was unheard of 18 months ago.  It is a welcome development because of the very thing about which we have been talking, the shadowy things that go on in the background in relation to applications for flights, arrangements made behind closed doors at different times where certain people apply for things and either get them or are muscled aside.  It is a great improvement that at least some part of this process will now, for the first time, be open to some very limited inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two proposals of the Minister in relation to this register are not sufficient; they should go much further.  The public will get only a very limited view indeed of what is happening in relation to applications for different tariffs, routes and so on.  The register as proposed which will be available to inspection would contain only two items.  It would contain only the tariff applications filed and the Minister's decisions.  That is not enough, particularly in the light of my fairly detailed knowledge of the famous meeting in London on 23 January 1985 between the three airlines, which even the representatives said was unusually hostile by the standards of these meetings.  It is frightening to realise the kind of muscle that is <Col N="1086" /> used privately behind the scenes.  It is necessary to add to the register some of the things which are listed in amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 13.  They are as follows:</P>
    <P> (c)  any communication between an airline and the Minister or his Department concerning fares or charges and route access involving the said airline,</P>
    <P>(d)  any communication between an airline and the Minister or his Department concerning fares and route access involving other airlines. </P>
    <P>This point is very important because this is where much of the real trouble happens. One airline goes to the Department in privacy to comment on the application of another airline.  The first airline should be allowed access to those comments.</P>
    <P>The next point concerns any communication between airlines pertaining to fares and route access.  That would cover, for example, what went on at this famous meeting in London.  It would raise the hairs on one's head when one sees the image which is sought to be portrayed by the front men of some of the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>The next point concerns any communication between airlines and associations of airlines pertaining to fares and route access.  Associations of airlines have a very strong influence on what happens. IATA is the most obvious example, but there is also the European association &mdash; a much less powerful body but nonetheless of some significance.  Another association which will become of more significance is the association of independent airlines within Europe who cannot be kept down for all time.</P>
    <P>My next point relates to any communication between the Minister and foreign governments pertaining to fares and route access under an air transport agreement. Judgment on matters of this kind could not be properly reached without that kind of information.  For example, what negotiations, if any, are going on between the Minister and the Department of Communications and the British Secretary of State for Transport?  The <Col N="1087" /> British seem to be negotiating with everybody in Europe.  I hope they are negotiating with us with a view to bringing into Anglo-Irish air routes the same kind of things they have negotiated with several other European countries.  This would be enormously beneficial to us and presumably also to Britain.  I invite the Minister to avail of this opportunity to make another reassuring announcement, on the lines of some of those he has made this morning, that he has agreed or is on the point of agreeing with the British authorities a more liberal bilateral agreement to replace the very unsatisfactory one which now exists between Britain and Ireland and fully sustains the cartel operations which are obviously not in the interests of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to Deputy O'Malley's quotation from the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission. The Commission state at paragraph 1.7 of that report as follows:</P>
      <P>One obvious example of an ancillary service would be the sale of tickets for scheduled flights and this is, in our opinion, outside the scope of the enquiry.</P>
      <P>I want to put that on the record in the interest of accuracy and to reaffirm what I said earlier, notwithstanding the quotation out of context by Deputy O'Malley of a particular section relating specifically to the Irish Travel Agents Association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the last point he made about an agreement with the British, this has been the subject of public statements by myself not once but many times.  Well over a year ago, when I met Mr. Nicholas Ridley, the Secretary of State for Transport, in London, I proposed to him a bilateral agreement of a very radical nature and he expressed interest in discussing it.  We have been having informal talks ever since.  A meeting was to have taken place in Dublin between his junior Minister responsible <Col N="1088" /> for aviation and either myself or my Minister of State.  Unfortunately, that cannot take place next week but will, I hope, take place within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>We are very much advocates of what I would call an &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; policy in Europe.  It will take some considerable time before an overall European Community aviation policy develops because of the obvious vital interests of many countries.  However, we ought to start by seeking bilateral and in some cases trilateral agreements in relation to aviation. This would include the question of fifth freedom rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are willing to talk to other countries as well.  We are willing to grant reciprocal rights here.  We are not asking anything for nothing; it would have to be reciprocal.  I say this to underline the policy which we have been pursuing and developing since I came into office.</P>
      <P>If Deputy O'Mally and Deputy Wilson have been reading the reports from European Community &mdash; they have been quoting some of them &mdash; they will see that three countries are listed as favouring radical liberalisation, ourselves, Britain and the Netherlands.  Some of our colleagues in Europe have been stunned by the radical nature of the proposals we are pursuing.  I say that in reply to the point raised by Deputy O'Malley.  We are pursuing new bilateral arrangements with Britain.  I do not know when they will come to fruition but any delay will not be through lack of effort on our part.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is asking that we declare what we have for breakfast every day, every confidential telephone call or communication.  No business could operate like that.  It does not make sense. What I am proposing in this Bill goes a very long way.  It is a new departure. We are proposing a register requiring the principal points of information, certainly all the points people need to know. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Is it quoted on the stock exchange in either London or Dublin?  Is there any Irish investment in it?  These are relevant questions because in my experience of ten months in that Department there were not many countries or governments anxious to oblige Ireland in regard to any of the freedoms of the air. I am very suspicious of the activities of British Airways and the British Government. I know they are being privatised but I should like to know whether the Minister will be dealing through the Government with British Airways when privatisation is accomplished.  I cannot help being suspicious when I read about what went on in regard to Laker between Britain and the United States and, in an attempt to clarify the position, Mr. Laker was involved at a very high level in governmental activity.  I do not know if we should be bleating too much about Dan-Air; it may be a question of another group of capitalists trying to maximise their profits.  I say this against a background of commitment to the Irish airline being as highly competitive as they possibly can in whatever circumstances obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer fully for Dan-Air but they are a privately owned British airline and it should be made clear that they are well respected. I have a great deal of respect for Dan-Air and we cannot say that about every airline. There are airlines with whom we do not like doing business and whose behaviour is not in the best interests of the travelling public.  My Department and I have nothing but the warmest praise for Dan-Air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that privatisation affects anything.  British Airways are like any other airline: they make filings to my Department and that will not change when they are privately owned.  They did not have any special status as a State owned airline so there will be no change.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley, are you pressing the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be antagonistic but when I make points the Minister does not reply to them.  He says that I am all wrong about this, that and the other.  However, there is no reply to the points I made.  It would be too strong to say that it is personal abuse but it is is, unfortunately, this rather contentious series of denials, and things from way back are dragged out as proof that whatever I say on any amendment must be wrong.  I would be interested in hearing, for example, why some at least of these various matters regarding communications and the Minister regarding the fixing of fares on routes should not be made available to the public.  I welcome the fact that the register has been set up but there are only two items in the new section 5 which are not enough to enable the average member of the public or commentator to form a reasonable judgment about what is proposed or about decisions made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not necessarily saying that I insist on getting all the information which I set out in my amendment but even half that <Col N="1091" /> information would be welcome.  We need more information than simply the fact that a tariff is lodged and a decision made on it.  One would certainly need more information than that.  If the Minister thinks that the five headings I set out are too much perhaps he would be prepared to take some of them?  Even the one about association of airlines, contacts with them and what they lay down is important because the public do not realise what IATA do.  They have been doing a PR job to project themselves as a trade association and to conceal the fact that they are a price fixing body.  They are still fare fixing in Europe and consumers should be made aware of that to see what influence or input they have.  Their influence has waned greatly in other parts of the world, but until they commission the court in Luxembourg or the Commission in Brussels to take steps early next year to put a stop to many of the existing practices, these arrangements in Europe will continue to the detriment of many of the people here.</P>
    <P>If airlines are as reasonable as they are portrayed, why should their communications with the Minister in relation to routes, fares and so on not be published? Why should it be only the tariff and the decision?  The principle of the register introduced by the Minister in these amendments six or eight months ago as a result of the debate on Second Stage 18 months ago is very welcome but it is a pity to bring in a register and then to confine it to so little information as is suggested here.  Some further information is obviously needed in order to make it useful and workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The five paragraphs of Deputy O'Malley's amendment go very far indeed and obviously we could not accept them.  It is like asking what you had for breakfast.  Paragraph (g) mentions communications between the Minister and foreign governments pertaining to fares and route access under an air transport agreement.  No government would want to communicate with us if we were going to publicise everything they <Col N="1092" /> said to us.  Paragraph (f) mentions any communication between airlines and asociations of airlines pertaining to fares and route access.  We do not know what communications there are between airlines or associations of airlines.  You break down all sorts of commercial practices and of course there have to be conversations, discussions and preliminary planning, However, the principle, as Deputy O'Malley acknowledged, is a good one and I will see if there is anything I can do on Report Stage to meet the points raised.</P>

There is a considerable improvement in that the consumer or even another air company would be able to see what is the tariff that is approved or otherwise.</P>

      <P>These are technical amendments, the combined effect of which is to extend to intermediaries the same defences against prosecution as are available to air carriers in the present text.  Essentially their purpose is to meet genuine circumstances where either an air carrier or an intermediary acted in good faith, notwithstanding any technical contravention of the Bill.  It is in ease of the present text, to give further grounds of defence to travel agents and other intermediaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I heard the Minister correctly, he says this extends certain defences to travel agents.  That is because they were dragged into this by some of the earlier amendments he made.  It would be quite unreasonable if they did not have whatever limited defences are open to them.  I have no objection to travel agents having these limited defences but they are not of much use. That is because under this Bill a person's prospect of an acquittal would be fairly slim once proceedings were taken.  I welcome the amendments so far as they go but they are of no importance.</P>
      <P>We cannot get away from the fact that the whole operation is completely wrong. Travel agents will be prosecuted for these allegedly dreadful offences and they will be subject to huge penalties.  The fact that they will have the same defence as that available originally to airline owners is not of much use but I suppose they will not be any worse off.  It does not get away from the fact that the whole concept is absolutely outrageous.  We are making it a serious criminal offence for someone to sell a ticket for a few pounds less than the approved IATA cartel fare.  Nothing said can gainsay that and it makes this country and this House look very foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> If the decision of the European Court goes the way of the report of the Advocate General, all of this law will be blown out.  The Minister mentioned earlier that EC law takes precedence.  We know that but what is the point in bringing in a law and forcing it through against all reason and commonsense when a decision will be made, probably next month, by the European Court on these points?  If they decide the way their Advocate General has advised them, all of this will be futile. I ask the Minister to consider leaving this matter over until January.  I understand a decision is likely to be given about mid-January which is only five weeks away. All of this will be blown out if the decision goes the way the Advocate General has advised.  Why must we go through this futile exercise now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been continuously asserting this point, that it is futile and that this Bill will prevent our having low air fares.  It is nothing of the kind.  The Bill is neutral.  Let us suppose a cartel &mdash; he has attacked cartels quite strongly and not without some merit &mdash; files a fare of £400 for a return journey from Dublin to London, is the Deputy saying I should not have the power to stop them?  This Bill puts beyond doubt the fact that the Minister always had the power to regulate air fares and that means downwards as well as upwards.  I have used those powers in the past three years always to reduce air fares&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I have persistently reduced the amounts set out in the findings to my Department, even when they have been approved by my colleagues abroad.  I have ensured that air fare increases have been reduced to sub-inflation figures.  All we are asking for is the right to regulate.  There will be cases of filing which may be predatory and against the public interest and we need to have these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is important is the policy, how the powers will be used.  Since I became <Col N="1096" /> Minister my policy has been to keep air fares down and to go as far as we can towards liberalisation, always bearing in mind the national interest.  Nobody wants to abandon the national interest, and Deputy O'Malley would not do so if he were sitting here.  If intermediaries break the law, as the Bill stands now they would not have a defence.  In these three amendments they could demonstrate that they were acting in good faith and show they were not breaking the law.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a supply of gas to Kilkenny are being re-examined by Kilkenny Gas Company and BGE.  The Deputy will be aware that an earlier approach had to be abandoned because the proposals would not give a viable project.  I will have to await the outcome of the renewed investigations before I can comment further, and I am pressing both sides, Kilkenny Gas and BGE, to press forward with all possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a firm indication as to when a decision may be made, particularly in view of the fact that there was a similar question to the Minister several months ago when he indicated that the provision of a supply of natural gas to Kilkenny was not a viable proposition?  Can he indicate now when his Department will be in a position to announce that Kilkenny is to be supplied with natural gas?  The Minister will note that on this occasion my question is &ldquo;when&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;if&rdquo; natural gas will be supplied to Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>To be fair to the Deputy, he will recall that on a previous occasion a project put forward for Kilkenny was rejected on the basis that it was not viable.  I then sought another method of bringing gas to Kilkenny and an assessment in that respect was undertaken. Consultants were engaged for that purpose. I do not like indicating a firm time scale because if I say, for instance, that something will be dealt with in a matter of weeks, and if that is found not to be sufficient time, I then have to come back to the House and explain the delay but I assure the Deputy that I am determined that a decision in respect of the supply of natural gas to Kilkenny will be made as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be aware that one of his colleagues in Coalition announced by way of the local papers that Kilkenny definitely will be <Col N="1100" /> supplied with natural gas.  I should like the Minister to confirm or deny that.  Can he say also whether the present investigation involves the supply of natural gas to Smithwicks Brewery who were involved in the original application?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The indications to date are positive, that Kilkenny should be receiving gas, a move which I would consider to be in the interest of the community and of the city.  Smithwicks are not involved in the project.  It is now a stand alone project for the city of Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>If the project were found not to be viable with the participation of Smithwicks who would be a huge consumer, it is difficult to understand how it can be considered viable in terms of supply to householders only.  Kilkenny Gas Company have been in a limbo for several months.  The Minister must appreciate that their position is desperate. I am asking him to make every effort to give a firm decision in this case as soon as possible rather than to play the type of politics that we have witnessed in the past couple of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to the question.  First, there is the matter of viability.  One must consider the question of capital expenditure and the securing of other commercial markets.  On that basis I am confident that we will bring about a viable product and I can assure the Deputy that that will be done as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>May we take it from that that the Minister is about to do a u-turn on his stated policy in relation to the provision of natural gas, because a long time ago he said that no private company who do not have majority public sector ownership would avail of natural gas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the proposals he has to make a bigger energy saving and a common standard for heaters, boilers and air conditioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department promote a wide-ranging programme of information and advice to encourage efficiency and savings in the use of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main elements of the programme this year are as follows.  First, for the industrial sector, the following activities have taken place or are currently in progress: a steam plant audit service completed in June 1985, through which steam traps, boilers and pipe insulation in approximately 800 companies around the country were tested free of charge: it is hoped that the service will have created sufficient interest among companies to continue regular maintenance of their steam equipment, thereby maintaining optimum efficiency and eliminating wasteful energy use; the steam plant service has been replaced by an electrical energy audit service which involves a free audit of the electrical energy use of companies; the service is at present operating on a pilot basis, to gauge its effectiveness; if considered successful it may be continued next year; grants are provided by my Department to manufacturing firms and hotels to cover one-third of the cost of engaging consultants to carry out fuel efficiency surveys of their premises and operations.  Second, for the public sector, energy audits are being carried out in a selected number of local authorities, covering their energy usage for street lighting, water pumping and transport; energy audits are also being conducted in a number of Government offices in the Dublin area.  The recommendations arising from these audits will be given to the Office of Public Works.  It is hoped that the OPW will find the recommendations useful in implementing an efficient use of energy in public buildings and offices. Third, for the domestic sector, an expert <Col N="1103" /> advice service the energy phone, available to give advice on all aspects of energy use and conservation.</P>
    <P>The programme for next year, which may include most of the activities which I have already outlined, will be designed to have the maximum energy saving possible achieved within the constraints of the budget made available.</P>
    <P>As regards the introduction of a common standard for heaters and boilers, two specifications have been drafted for the purpose of implementing EEC Directive 78/170 in relation to (i) minimum performance requirements of heat generators and (ii) thermal insultation of pipes, ducts and storage vessels.  The specifications will be finalised and submitted to me for approval as soon as possible.  I have no responsibility for the introduction of standards for air conditioning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he is carrying out energy audits in many public areas.  Is this House included?  I am sure the Chair will be the first to agree that the level of energy wastage in this House must be very high.  In heating this House we do not seem to take account of the temperature outside.  We never seem to get it right.  In my view, there could be a big saving in this area.  Is the Minister aware that there is room for major energy savings in local authority areas?  The local authority energy bill represents £28.63 million and it is estimated by the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards that a saving of £9.53 million could be made if a proper energy saving system was developed.  Nobody seems to be responsible for the management of energy.  A typical county council would spend something like £650,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely general question which asks what proposals the Minister has to make a bigger energy saving and a common standard of heaters.  The Deputy has started with Leinster House, and he has now turned to local authorities.  We could be at military barracks next, followed by the hospitals, then something in Cavan and we might then take a trip over to <Col N="1104" /> Longford.  We could be here for a couple of weeks.  The Chair must exercise, and must ask Deputies to exercise, commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was exercising commonsense.  If anyone was listening to what the Minister had to say he will remember he dealt at length with public authority buildings, savings and so on.  I am mentioning areas which he has not covered and I think it is in the interests of energy saving that local authorities who are badly strapped for cash at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has a question of a general nature, would he ask it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My second question is: is the Minister aware that local authorities spend approximately £28.63 million and that a recent report from the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards points out the savings to the tune of £9.53 million could be affected if a properly instituted energy programme, managed properly, was instigated?  If so, what action does he propose to take because he is responsible for instigating such policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the last question first.  The Deputy's figure from the IIRS report is incorrect.  The figure for savings estimated by the IIRS is £7 million per annum.  In relation to this House in particular, I have sympathy with his sentiments.  As he is aware, a group of buildings are heated centrally and the recommendations of the survey carried out will be acted upon hopefully, and will ensure the maximum efficiency in the use of energy in this House and in the other public buildings to which he refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards public authorities, I hope the examination carried out for the public authorities will be useful.  It is up to the public authorities to recognise the areas in which they can save money by looking at their energy uses.  They should not turn their eyes to Clare Street every time they have an energy problem.  They have their <Col N="1105" /> own engineers and they should make the maximum use of energy in their own areas.  In recent years we have become more energy conscious and more energy efficient.  There have been improvements in energy efficiency over the last few years.  The ratio of primary energy input to gross domestic product has decreased from 2.12 in 1979 to 1.6 in 1984.  This shows that there has been some saving and a more efficient use of energy.  As the Deputy pointed out, and I fully agree, the IIRS have identified an area which could produce an annual saving of £7 million but it is up to the local authorities and the public sector to be more aware of the money which can be saved by the efficient use of energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that very little expertise exists in the local authorities but that his Department have the necessary expertise and should be promoting the type of programmes I mentioned?  The Minister should not expect the local authorities to work on their own.  As regards the IIRS survey, I do not know which one he is quoting from but I am quoting from a recent survey based on the 1982 figures. In the local authority areas alone, a saving of £9.53 million is not to be sneezed at by any Government, but especially not by a Government who are looking for money.</P>
      <P>What proposals has the Minister for changing the ridiculous situation in this House where the little energy we have when we come in here in the morning has gone when lunch time arrives, and yet we are expected to work most nights until midnight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is casting a bad reflection on the expertise in local authorities.  They have many fine engineers who are very aware of what is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures have not proved that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the lack of <Col N="1106" /> progress but we intend to publish the local authorities' audit programme which has been carried out and hopefully it will be acted upon.  As I said, this House and other Government buildings are served from a central location and I hope the OPW will act on the information which will be given to them.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a need to look at the energy uses in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the proposals, if any, he has for reducing the high cost of electricity to industrial and domestic consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the report of the Inquiry into Electricity Prices found that, while Irish electricity prices for industry are higher than those prevailing generally in Europe, domestic prices <Col N="1111" /> compare reasonably well with European prices.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Jacobsen report are being examined by the ESB, but it will be appreciated that any sustained reduction in the cost of electricity would have to be part of a medium to longer term planning process.  This process has been under way now for some time and since 1982 the ESB have been successful in keeping their tariff increases for all consumers below the rate of inflation. There has, therefore, been a real reduction in electricity costs for all consumers.</P>
      <P>On 31 January 1985, I announced in the Dáil a reduction in the electricity prices charged to industry, ranging from 2 per cent for the smaller to 6 per cent for the larger users in the ESB's maximum demand customer category.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the Dáil on 31 October this year, I am generally in favour of improving the relative cost of electricity to industry.  I will take advantage of any opportunity which arises for further alleviation of electricity prices and will keep in mind the case being urged in respect of the cost to industrial users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect any action to be taken on the report of the inquiry into electricity prices?  I am glad the Minister is continuing the good standard set by me in 1982 when electricity prices were kept at 5 per cent.  Does the Minister intend to be able to bring prices down more, or has the Minister a clear planned programme in the ESB to try to get some sanity back into the energy costs for industry?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if, in view of the need expressed in the Anglo-Irish agreement to (1) promote cross-Border co-operation and (2) encourage economic and social development in Northern Ireland, the Government will request the British Government to reopen negotiations on the possibility of developing North-South gas and electricity links.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 10 together.  I am very anxious to see progress made on the restoration of the North-South electricity interconnector, because of the significant benefits it would provide, both economically and strategically.  However, the present position is that the interconnector, which was commissioned in 1970, has been out of action since 1975, due to malicious damage on the Northern side of the Border.  The situation is being kept under review and any opportunity that may arise for restoration of the link will be availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the supply of gas to Northern Ireland, the British Government have withdrawn from this project.  In July an order providing for the run-down of the gas industry in Northern Ireland was passed by the British Parliament and I understand that practically all of the undertakings involved have taken decisions to close.  Financial assistance is <Col N="1113" /> being provided by the British Government to enable consumers to switch from gas to other energy forms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that it is now the Minister's view as expressed in the answer that there is no future for a reactivation of the North-South gas deal? In view of the fact that the British Government have already decided to provide assistance for customers of the gas industry in the North to switch over to solid fuel and obviously the British Government are accepting that thousands of jobs are going to be lost and the close down of the gas industry will cost the British Treasury £120 million, does he see any realistic possibility of reactivating that deal in view of the commitment given in the Anglo-Irish agreement for North-South co-operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I made a statement on 22 October 1985 in which I said that the Irish Government would be looking at this in the context of further gas discoveries.  At this time it is very difficult to say if there will be a revival of the project.  Planning is going on in the South for the development of the national grid on the east coast.  I will still be encouraging the British Government to have a second look at this.  There may be an opportunity in the Inter-Governmental Conference to have a look at the energy question on the whole island.  I believe our position has always been reasonable and certainly we will maintain that reasonableness in the discussions with the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, because the British Government have so decided and things are moving along apace in relation to a switch over to solid fuels, unless that decision-making process stops now there will be no realistic opportunity to reactivate the North-South gas deal?  Furthermore, would he not accept that one of the flagships of good faith to be expressed by both Governments in the context of the Inter-Governmental Conference would <Col N="1114" /> be that such a proposal would be put back on the table straight away before we go to the point of no return?  Only on that basis will we know whether good faith is really forthcoming.  I am sure the Minister will also agree with me that the North will be the only part of the EC that will be deprived of the benefit of natural gas if the British Government hold the ground that they have held over the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, there is no doubt as to the significance of an indication from the British Government that they would reconsider.  Some work is still going on in Northern Ireland.  The chairman of the Belfast Gas Company is still looking for possible investors in the gas company in Northern Ireland.  On a longer term, I believe in the extension of the national gas grid to this whole island and that this island will be well served if we have interconnection to the European natural gas grid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

In relation to the gas projects I think I have clarified the situation.  We are willing to and certainly would renegotiate with the British in relation to the interconnector.  There are security implications which would not be appropriate to go into in this House, but in the longer term obviously it would be wise to restore the interconnector.</P>

      <P>An examination of the long term development of the gas industry, including the optimum allocation of the balance of the Kinsale Head reserves, is currently under way.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to go into the volumes.  There will be a rescheduling for a five year allocation of 150 mm cfd up to the end of 1987. Obviously there will be a complete rebalance of energy supply or gas usage when Moneypoint is on stream and fully operational. As I said, an examination of the long term development of the gas industry is under way at present.  I am expecting a report early in the New Year and I do not think it would be wise to comment until we have that report in relation to longer term strategy for gas usage and allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I said that at present Moneypoint 1 is undergoing preconditioning tests which I presume should be completed fairly shortly.  The second and third units are expected to be on stream in June 1986 and April 1987. Deputies must appreciate that the question of gas usage by the ESB is not static. For example, there was an increase in 1984.  The ESB asked for a substantial increase in allocation and they had projected increases into the future.  The board of the ESB are concerned to reduce their dependency on heavy fuel oil.  There will be a balancing to be done and, on receipt of the report of the consultants in early 1986, I will be in a better position to clarify for the House what the medium term strategy will be for the usage of natural gas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of research and development projects being undertaken or considered in the area of biomass.  The more notable developments are as follows.</P>
      <P>My Department are contributing towards the cost of a project in County Leitrim which is being undertaken by An Foras Talúntais and the National Board for Science and Technology with the co-operation of two farmers.  The project involves the growing of about 16 acres of willow and poplar trees of which about ten acres are already planted.  The remaining six acres will be planted for the next growing season.  This is a renewal of an earlier project which showed limited success.  It is planned to have the project completed in 1989.</P>
      <P>The Department are also involved in the EC research and development programme on various aspects of energy, including biomass.  Proposals for projects in this area are still under adjudication by the Commission including nine Irish biomass projects.</P>
      <P>The IIRS are completing a biomass scoping study commissioned by my Department.  The results will provide information on the potential for biomass in Ireland, the existing usage of biomass, wood and wood waste as a source of energy, and the economic worth of promoting conversion to biomass as a source of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other organisations outside the aegis of my Department are also engaged in biomass projects and it is my intention to promote full co-operation between all the <Col N="1119" /> institutions involved with a view to ensuring the best returns on the relevant expenditures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to tell the House why the previous project was only a limited success in view of the fact that the growing of the willow species has been successful in Northern Ireland and Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A combination of factors resulted in very poor growth.  In 1983 it became apparent that the crop was being attacked by slugs and overgrown vegetation.  A similar problem occurred in 1984 and on one side the trees were attacked underground by leather jacket grubs.  The simple answer is that both sides suffered from the droughts of 1983 and 1984 and that may have been the reason for the lack of success of the project. We are anxious to continue with our experiment in this area because we feel there may be some scope for its use in future years.  However, I am not very enthusiastic about the results that have been achieved to date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to a demonstration programme carried out by Bord na Móna.  The areas involved were Clonsast in County Offaly and Oweninny in County Mayo.  There was not a successful growth in the areas concerned and the major causes of inadequate growth were the absence of suitable depths of ameliorated top soil, <Col N="1120" /> inadequate plant nutrition and, to a lesser extent, drainage.  There were other minor technical problems but the fact is that the biomass demonstration project was not a great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that it was the poor quality of the land in County Leitrim that contributed to the bad results in the tests carried out in that county?  Is the Minister in a position to say that it takes better quality land to get good results for willow and poplar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unreasonable to assume that there would have been better results if the experiment took place on better land but a better return could be obtained for all crops on better land. We are in a catch 22 situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that the experiments have not worked?  Is it the view of the Department that there is little ground for the high expectations held out in regard to biomass production here for a number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been greatly encouraged by the experiments carried out.  The Department are involved in the project in County Leitrim.  Research by the Forestry and Wildlife Service is continuing. They have about 220 hectares at eight sites.  The IIRS are a collection agency for the International Energy Agency Biomass Conversion Technical Information Agreement.  It is also understood that Bord na Móna are having discussions with An Foras Talúntais with a view to preparing a biomass research and development project.  I must emphasise that we are at an experiment stage in regard to biomass.  I do not think too much should be expected at this stage of the development of the sites.  Perhaps in some years time when greater experience has been gained we will see biomass as a very useful source of energy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements being made by the ESB to monitor emissions from Moneypoint are quite extensive, are in accordance with the planning permission for the station and are in line with standard international practice. Clare County Council operate a separate independent network to monitor air quality in the county.

Will the Minister comment on the fact that there is considerable unease in regard to the potential damage that may be done? There is a general unease and concern about the prospect of the destruction of our environment as a result of the emissions from Moneypoint.  Is it reasonable to expect the general public to believe and have full confidence in the monitoring service of the ESB?  In other words, are we asking them to be judge and jury over their own actions?  Should there not be an independent monitoring system to relieve the concern which exists among the general public?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of scrubbers would involve quite large sums of money, perhaps hundreds of millions of pounds. They are not envisaged and not necessary. In relation to the general public, I can understand their concern and share that concern, as I assume would all Members of this House.  I shall list the 14 monitoring stations: Ballyline, the Burren, County Clare; Cahercon, Kildysart, County Clare; Knock, County Clare; Kilrush, County Clare; Labasheeda, County Clare; Knockerra, County Clare; Kilkee, County Clare; the station perimeter, Slieve Bloom, Capard; Tarbert, County Kerry; Ballylongford, County Kerry; Mount Trenchard, near Foynes, County Limerick; Moyvane, County Kerry; Glin, County Limerick and others throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An adequate monitoring system will be in situ from day one and the information will be provided.  I can assure the Deputy, and I have said so publicly already, that no information will be held back from the public in the interests of the public good. It is in all our interests that the information as to the emission levels from the station at Moneypoint will be made available, obviously in the interests of public health.  At this point I am satisfied, from the restrictions on planning permission and from the ESB's own network <Col N="1123" /> of monitoring stations aligned to Clare County Countil's, that we will be in a position to monitor the emission on an hourly basis.  I should also point out something of which the general public seem not to be aware, the fact that emissions from existing oil fired stations for the same electrical output as Moneypoint would be about 50 per cent higher than the emissions of sulpur dioxide from the new units at Moneypoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate what, if any, independent studies have been made of the potential emissions from the Moneypoint station, in view of the claims and counter claims being made by different bodies?  Could he indicate what monitoring services exist on the east coast, which would appear to be the area most likely to suffer if any area is to suffer, from the alleged contamination by sulphur dioxide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Two major independent studies of the environmental impact of Moneypoint were carried out; first, an ecological impact assessment by An Foras Forbartha and, secondly, an environmental impact study in relation to the consequences for agriculture, by An Foras Talúntais.  Both of these studies include analyses of the sulphur dioxide fall-out from the station and the results of both studies indicate that no problem will be caused by the fall-out.  With regard to the second part of the question, I do not have an indication of the monitoring stations on the east coast, but I shall also supply that information to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in countries such as the Scandinavian countries, Canada, Germany and other European countries, where there have been coal burning generating stations, serious environmental problems have arisen?  It is obvious that a similar problem will arise here.  I gathered from the Minister's reply that there was only one monitoring station in the midlands and I do not think there was any further east; some further stations are necessary. <Col N="1124" /> Would the Minister not have a separate independent body, as distinct from the ESB, monitoring the emissions in view of public concern and the experience in other countries?  We are going to have a problem here and it should be tackled immediately, rather than later when the damage is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's long question was in relation to the European experience but, as they say in Kerry, it all depends on volume.  We have to take into account that we will have one major coal burning station in County Clare and I must refute the suggestion that the ESB are not going to treat this matter in a thoroughly responsible way, or have not been treating it so.  They are a semi-State company of whose record down through the years we can be very proud in connection with what they have done for electricity provision.  I am sure they will approach the monitoring of the fall-out from this coal fired station with the same seriousness as they have had on the whole question of electricity supply to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the examinations that have taken place and the studies, there is no danger to our environment from the volume of sulphur dioxide which will be emitted from the three coal burning units in Moneypoint.  That is the position.  Also, I believe that the ESB, the county council and likewise my Department, with the monitoring systems that are being set up, will be in a position to confirm for this <Col N="1125" /> House, which should allay any public anxiety, the levels of emissions from the coal burning units at Moneypoint.  The situation might be somewhat different if it were part of our energy strategy to have ten or 12 of these coal burning stations around the country, but that is not the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us the Government position in regard to the directive from the European Commission and whether we have sought derogation from the directive in its entirety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The position basically is that we must take into account the fact that, as the Deputy will be well aware, the air in this country is much cleaner than that in the other European member state countries and also that we account for about 1.1 per cent of all EC emissions to which large plant, including ESB stations contribute approximately 45 per cent.  We feel that the imposition here of standard emission limit values and of a uniform percentage reduction would not contribute in a significant way to the solution of the problem of trans-boundary air pollution.  In that respect there was a meeting of the Environment Ministers last week and we shall be considering the implications of that at our next meeting in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if his Department have undertaken an assessment and an evaluation of early production systems for off-shore oil recovery, as to their suitability and technical competence for operation in the Celtic Sea, if he intends to approve such <Col N="1128" /> a system and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have assessed a very large number of early production systems, both those in use throughout the world and those being developed, and have evaluated their potential suitability for possible development operations in the Celtic Sea.  In fact, a comprehensive report on such systems, which was prepared at the request of my Department and under their aegis, and which includes an evaluation of the type referred to by the Deputy, has been completed. The non-confidential sections of this report, which will be entitled &ldquo;Marginal Field Technology &mdash; A Review&rdquo; will, with my approval, be published shortly by its authors.  The conclusions of the report indicate that in the right circumstances several types of early production systems might well be suitable for Celtic Sea operations.  In the event that early production is decided upon for a Celtic Sea development then the individual characteristics of the field concerned, including characteristics of a geological, economic and technological type, would dictate the type of early production systems which might be employed within the limits of procurable equipment. Safety considerations would also have to be taken into account in any such analysis, as well as the optimisation of reservoir potential in accordance with good oil-field practice.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals in my Department at present seeking approval for a development, nor for a production system of this type.  I would, of course, be prepared to consider and evaluate any such proposal on its merits at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will be publishing the non-confidential part of the report.  I begin to wonder what part of a report having such information would be confidential.  We are talking about the evaluation of an early production system that is already either built or in the planning stage for use in the Celtic Sea for oil <Col N="1129" /> recovery.  Perhaps the Minister could go somewhat further and give some indication as to what would be confidential in the evaluation of a particular system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to go into detail on confidential aspects of the report, but the Deputy will appreciate that I am usually very forthcoming with information because I believe it is in the interest of all of us that information should be public.  I will certainly try to be of assistance to the Deputy when this report is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has always been forthcoming with the maximum amount of information. That is why I am at a loss on this occasion.  The Minister said that his Department have assessed many production systems.  Are these systems already in use or is this a newer form of technology?  Have they been involved in assessing the new type of technology that could possibly apply in the Celtic Sea area?  The Minister will appreciate that the early production system in the North Sea was not very successful but many changes in technology have taken place since.  I want to know which evaluation he is talking about.  Is the Minister referring to the old systems, the newer systems or the systems which are in the planning stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that we have looked at all these systems.  We have assessed a very large number of early production systems, both in use and being developed.  Technology in the oil industry is very fast moving on a yearly basis and we are trying to match these systems with conditions in the Celtic Sea.  The report is not being compiled totally by people within my Department but it will be available shortly and will be published.  It will be stimulating information for anybody interested in oil exploration off our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to consideration of how these systems could be applicable to conditions in the <Col N="1130" /> Celtic Sea.  Would he accept that conditions in the Celtic Sea are very favourable for early production systems?  I cannot understand why there should be such confidentiality.  The information is available to the oil industry and all I am seeking is the departmental assessment. I am not an expert in this area but I have a particular knowledge and interest in it. I am looking for assistance from departmental investigations of the various systems. I have several systems in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Deputy comment that he considers the Celtic Sea to be suitable for early production systems.  Of course in choosing the type of system it would be necessary to consider the geology of the Celtic basin and the field economics.  There are many different types of early production systems. What might be suitable off the west coast might not be suitable in the Celtic Sea.  From initial examination it appears that the Celtic Sea is an area where early production systems would be beneficial but it would be premature at this stage to comment on any particular type of system because no decision has been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he is prepared to review his pricing policy for natural gas especially for labour-intensive and high energy user industries in order to protect jobs, increase competitiveness and develop new Irish industry such as horticulture and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <P>13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy if he will accept that the availability and pricing of natural gas should now be regarded as instruments of a much broader economic strategy to provide a <Col N="1131" /> badly needed boost to our flagging economy and if he will publish a five year plan showing the development of usage and distribution of natural gas to the different sectors of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.  Government strategy is already designed to exploit our national gas resource so as to maximise the benefits to the economy. The primary objective is to capture the markets inherently suitable for natural gas and to provide the necessary infrastructure to achieve this.  Considerable progress has already been made in developing our gas supply network and the decisions to extend supplies to Clonmel, Limerick and Waterford mark a further advance.  Also, as part of the phased development of the network, gas supplies are being made available to existing pipelines and within utility supply areas.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on 31 October last in reply to a question by Deputy Collins, it has been the established policy of successive Governments that natural gas should be sold at market prices.  This produces the most favourable allocation of the gas both for the purpose of displacing more expensive oil product imports and of providing an income to the Exchequer which benefits the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>I would add that an examination of the long term development of the gas industry is currently in hands and future policy regarding depletion of the remaining Kinsale Head reserves will be decided in the light of this examination.  Given the continuing exploration effort and the need to adopt to changing market conditions, I would take the view that at this stage it is preferable to work to an overall policy framework rather than being tied into a fixed five-year plan, in a changing energy scene where all options and policies have to be continually examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister does not intend to get into forward planning in relation to the distribution and allocation of natural gas, which rather surprises me.  In any five-year plan <Col N="1132" /> there can be adjustments along the way as more reserves some on stream.  Towns and areas interested in getting a supply of natural gas have no idea where the Department see themselves going over the next three to five years.  That is regrettable, if we are interested in long-term planning in relation to the economy and using natural gas to benefit the economy by reducing industrial costs and providing jobs.  It is very disappointing that three years after the completion of the pipeline to Dublin there have been no natural gas spurs.  Would he accept that this is very disappointing in an area which was open for immediate development to provide jobs, generate more revenue for the Exchequer and reduce energy costs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>The important thing is that progress has been made and that the extensions will take place.  As I clarified in an earlier question, when the consultants' report is available early in the new year and taking into account the overall strategy for the completion of the Kinsale Head field, the people whom the Deputy feels cannot make forward planning decisions in relation to the supply of gas will be in a better position to go ahead with strategic planning for their energy supplies as we will have allayed their fears in that regard.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Energy the dates on which Bula Resources Limited relinquished their interests in exploration licences because of their inability to meet their financial obligations therein, the identification of the blocks concerned and the names of the companies that have been awarded those interests and the dates on which those transactions were completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to an earlier question by the Deputy on 31 October last, I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to discuss matters of a confidential-commercial nature in relation to any specific company.  Where reallocation of participating interests in a licence may be proposed, disclosure of information would not, in my view, be justified until such time as formal documentation has been submitted to my Department and the transfer of interests definitively executed.  The reason for this is that we cannot be sure, until the formal documentation is submitted, that alternative arrangements will not be adopted by the parties concerned.  In any case when matters have been brought to a conclusion, I will be glad to provide information to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister let me know when Bula Resources Limited relinquished their interests and why is there such a long delay in reallocating them?  There seems to be an awful lot of secrecy surrounding this matter and this is my second attempt at trying to extract information in regard to this sad sorry situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to withhold any information from the Deputy and I can understand his reasons for asking the question.  However, I said that it would not be good commercial confidential practice to make facts known to the House until formal documentation has been submitted to my Department and arrangements finalised.  That has not <Col N="1134" /> happened to date and, until it does, I will not be in a position to make any further information available.  I assure the Deputy that I hold no brief to withhold information and, as soon as formal documentation has been received in my Department, the Deputy will have ample information made available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that Bula Resources Limited will be relinquishing their interests in the various wells?  Does the Minister agree that, if they relinquish them, it is because of their inability to meet their financial commitments? Could he give any explanation for giving out four more majority interests in blocks to the same company who failed to meet their liabilities in regard to existing blocks?  Does the Minister think it appropriate that the Government and he should be in the position of improving a balance sheet for the private sector so that they can dispose of it.  I do not think that that is the way to dispose of our natural resources.  The Minister should clear the air once and for all.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy, and I will endeavour to report as fully and clearly as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that at the Council, in Milan, last June, there was general discussion of the functioning of the Community market, of the working of the Community institutions and of ways of achieving the basic ideals of the Rome Treaty.</P>
      <P>This is not simply a matter of political philosophy or ideology.  It is a matter in which the future of Europe and the economic health of our countries are inextricably involved.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the Luxembourg meeting, I had useful discussions in Paris with President Mitterand, Prime Minister Fabius and Foreign Minister Dumas.  I also had meetings with the President in office of the Council, M. Santer of Luxembourg, and the President of the Commission, M. Delors.</P>
      <P>The Luxembourg Council began with an analysis of the malaise which has affected Europe and has led to significantly lower growth rates there than in Japan or the United States in recent times.  In the same period, total employment in the United States has risen while in Europe it has fallen, so that we now have more than 13 million without work in a Community which was set up and designed to encourage economic prosperity and political cohesion.</P>
      <P>A presentation made to us in Luxembourg by the Commission, with which most of the Heads of State or Government there expressed agreement, was that Europe can achieve the sort of growth which was commonplace there when the Community started, bringing with it a reduction of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoption of an appropriate strategy, involving among other things action to moderate wage increases, while sustaining demand by other measures could, the Commission estimate, reduce the rate of unemployment in the Community &mdash; at present 11 per cent &mdash; by one-third to around 7 per cent by 1990.  In my own intervention I strongly supported this strategy, which is very much along the lines I have been advocating at recent <Col N="1157" /> meetings of the Council and in that respect pursuing the same line as did the Leader of the Opposition before me.</P>
    <P>The Milan Council to which I have referred said that to achieve the full potential of the Community there must be:</P>
    <P> (1)  an improvement in the decisionmaking procedures of the Council of Ministers,</P>
    <P>(2)  an enlargement of the European Parliament's role,</P>
    <P>(3)  better administrative arrangements and powers for the Commission,</P>
    <P>(4)  the extension of Community activities into new areas, and</P>
    <P>(5)  the strengthening of political cooperation.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>It was under these five headings that the Inter-governmental Conference was proposed in Milan with a view to achieving concrete progress on European Union.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that Ireland was among the seven member states which supported the suggestion to convene this conference.  Subsequently, the three member states which dissented rallied to the majority view and a formal decision to convene the conference was taken unanimously.  The conference has met seven times at ministerial level.  The Irish representative was Deputy Peter Barry, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and there have been numerous meetings of a high level preparatory group of officials.</P>
    <P>These meetings produced a number of texts for a new or amended Treaty which were before the Luxembourg Council. Indeed, I have rarely seen a Council where Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers were so much concerned and spent so much time on textual work and drafting.  The reasons are, of course, obvious: we were concerned not with a communiqué but with a new Treaty with legal effect on the way the Community works.</P>
    <P>Among the profusion of issues before the Inter-governmental Conference, on which it reported to the Luxembourg Council, there were seven major themes. <Col N="1158" /> These were: first, the internal market. Under this heading, the Council was concerned to complete the common market in goods and services before 1993; second, the monetary capacity of the Community.  Under this heading, the Council was concerned with providing in the Treaty for such a capacity; third, increasing the economic and social cohesion of the Community.  This matter is, of course, of particular concern to the less developed regions of the Community, including Ireland, which require safeguards against the centripetal effects that can flow from greater integration; fourth, the powers of the European Parliament. As a directly elected body, the Parliament has considerable potential for development in the interests of European integration generally; fifth, the Commission's implementing powers.  As a matter of basic principle, progress can be achieved only if the Commission, as a major engine for European development, has the executive powers it needs; sixth, research and technological development. In this area above all others Europe which once led the world has now fallen far behind the other great powers in the application of research and development in the market place; last, environment and social policy.  I need hardly argue the point that it is in nobody's interest that economic development should lead to environmental or social deprivation.</P>
    <P>As the Luxembourg Presidency pointed out in a presentation to the Council, a reform of the Treaty on these lines is an important event in the history of the Community.  What is involved is the completion before 1993 of an internal market of more than 300 million people within which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <P>Towards this end there was agreement that certain provisions of the Treaty should be altered so as to provide for action by the Council by a qualified majority rather than unanimously.  The matters covered by this change include the common customs tariff, measures <Col N="1159" /> affecting the protection of savings, obstacles arising from different national standards, freedom to provide services, exchange policies in respect of the movement of capital and measures affecting sea and air transport.</P>
    <P>Towards the same end, that is, the completion of the internal market, there was agreement that the Council &mdash; in this area acting unanimously &mdash; might adopt provisions on the harmonisation of legislation concerning indirect taxation to the extent that this is necessary to ensure the establishment and operation of the market.  However, there was general recognition that it is quite unrealistic to expect rapid progress in this area in view of the wide differences that exist in relation both to overall levels of indirect taxation and individual tax levels.</P>
    <P>There was also agreement that the powers of the Council under Article 100 of the Rome Treaty to issue directives for the approximation of laws, regulations or administrative actions in member states which directly affect the establishment or functioning of the Common Market might be exercised by qualified majority rather than by unanimity, but that a measure adopted under this provision would not stand in the way of national provisions which are justified on grounds of major needs as referred to in Article 36 of the Treaty or relating to protection of the working or natural environment.</P>
    <P>The grounds referred to in Article 36 are public morality, public policy or public security; the protection of health or life of humans, animals or plants; the protection of national treasures possessing artistic, historical or archaeological value; or the protection of industrial or commercial property.  This is important for us because of the freedom of our animals and plants from many diseases prevalent on the Continent.  There is a procedure, of course, to ensure that these national provisions cannot be used as a means of arbitrary discrimination or as a disguised restriction in trade between member states.</P>
    <P>The establishment, development and conduct of the European Monetary <Col N="1160" /> System has taken place essentially outside the framework of the Rome Treaty until now.  At the Inter-governmental Conference the Commission put forward a proposal to endow the Community with a specific capacity in the monetary field which would have had the effect of bringing the EMS within the Treaty framework in the most general way, and among some other detailed provisions, would have included a reference to the establishment at an appropriate time of a European Monetary Fund, as foreshadowed by the European Council in Bremen in 1978.  Subsequent proposals from the Commission, Belgium and the Luxembourg Presidency introduced some modifications but their general thrust was similar.</P>
    <P>The Irish approach was that we favoured the idea of bringing a monetary capacity into the Treaty in a general way but without setting out provisions in such detail as to inhibit the organic development of the EMS which has been operating satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>After prolonged discussion both in the Inter-governmental Conference and at the European Council in Luxembourg, there was a narrowing of differences and it was ultimately found possible to reach agreement.  This involves including descriptive references to EMU and the EMS in the preamble to the text amending the Rome Treaty.  The more substantive element in the agreement reached involves a proposed new article before the present Article 103.  This provides that member states shall co-operate in accordance with the objectives of Article 104: these are the classic economic aims relating to the balance of payments, employment, prices and confidence in the currency.  A reference to the EMS is brought into the Treaty but in the most general way and without changing the existing situation.  This modest agreement in respect of the monetary area holds open the possibility of further, gradual development of the monetary dimension of the Community.  The procedures to be followed ensure that further steps along this road will be taken with due deliberation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> As a totally integrated market could in principle adversely affect regions such as Ireland on the periphery of Europe, we urged that special attention should be given to regional policy and the necessity for measures to counter the centripetal effects of integration.  Deputies will see that there will now be, for the first time, a specific Treaty article referring to the need to promote harmonious development and to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the Community and, in particular, to reduce disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, this was an objective referred to only in the preamble to the Treaty and, as a result, the Community's regional policy has had to be developed on the basis of the residual powers under article 235 of the Treaty.  We set out six months ago to get this commitment to economic convergence into the body of the Treaty.  We were at the time by no means sanguine as to the outcome, but we pressed our case actively and submitted our own formal proposals to the Inter-Governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>It is no mean achievement for this country to have been successful against much resistance in having this question included among the core issues before the Council.  In this we were helped by a large measure of understanding and co-operation on the part of the Luxembourg Presidency which persevered in insisting that progress in the enlarged Community of 12 would be considerably hampered if the requirements of cohesion were not reflected in the Treaty.  For their efforts in this regard &mdash; and indeed generally in the conduct of the Inter-Governmental Conference and of the Presidency &mdash; I wish to pay a very warm and sincere tribute to the Luxembourg Presidency, and, in particular, to Prime Minister Santer, who came to Dublin on 7 November to get our views at first hand.</P>
    <P>Deputies can read the detailed provisions for themselves but I am happy to report to the House that on this issue of cohesion or convergence we have registered <Col N="1162" /> a success in an area which has been central to the approach of successive Governments of all parties to Ireland's participation in the Community and to the latter's further development.  What had hitherto been only the Preamble to the Treaty is now in the Treaty itself, and the Regional Fund, which was developed under the general umbrella of the Treaty, is now incorporated in the Treaty itself.</P>
    <P>In regard to the powers of the European Parliament, the formal position, as set out in the conclusion of the meeting, is that agreement in principle was reached on the institution of a new procedure for co-operation with the Parliament. The Council of Ministers have been given a brief to:</P>
    <P>clarify the procedure in the event of the Parliament rejecting the common position of the Council at the second reading provided for in this new procedure; and to spell out the procedure to be followed, in the event of the Council not acting by the three month deadline laid down in regard to the closing stages of the procedure.</P>
    <P>This spelling out is necessary in order to avoid any legal vacuum.  It is being agreed that the Council will have the last say, this was a matter I had raised at the meeting.</P>
    <P>In regard to the whole package agreed on the work of the IGC, Denmark has a blanket reservation, while Italy has made its final acceptance conditional upon examination by the Italian Parliament, with a link also to the attitude to be taken by the European Parliament.  These reserves relate principally to the text about the powers of the European Parliament, with Italy concerned that it does not go far enough to ensure ratification by the Italian Parliament, while Denmark considers that it may go too far to be capable of ratification by their Parliament.</P>
    <P>For our part, we accepted that the agreement represents the best balance between the various views that realistically can be worked out at this time.  It has the potential greatly to enhance the <Col N="1163" /> influence of the Parliament while at the same time ensuring that the Council will have the last word.</P>
    <P>I hope that the reserves by member states can be lifted and that the European Parliament can accept the agreement as a modest but worthwhile step forward in the evolution of the Community.</P>
    <P>The European council's agreement to the inclusion of research and technological development in the Treaty marks an important step in the establishment of a European Technological Community to narrow the serious gap which has developed between the Community and its US and Japanese competitors.  Our particular concern that the development of the Community's role in this area should not be prejudiced by the Eureka initiative &mdash; which we support and in which we are participating &mdash; as well as that the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises should be catered for, have been accepted.  Our other concern regarding access to the results of research programmes in which the Community participate financially, will be pursued at a later stage when the Council decides on the rules governing these programmes.</P>
    <P>The protection of the environment has hitherto lacked a specific basis in the Treaty and Community action has been taken pursuant to the residual powers in Article 235.  Reflecting growing concern about environmental matters in the continental member states, the Commission, Denmark and Germany proposed specific Articles on this matter for inclusion in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>We were happy to agree to making specific provision for the environment. We were concerned to ensure that the Articles should provide for taking into account the need for balanced regional development, the differing ecological conditions prevailing in member states and that measures to be taken would be justifiable on a scientific basis and by reference to the costs and benefits involved.  The European Council agreed Articles that explicitly meet these concerns.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> The draft Treaty on which work has been going ahead for some time will formalise the arrangements for European political co-operation.  On security, the text recognises that co-operation in the sphere of foreign policy will, in response to our concerns, continue to be limited to political and economic aspects of security.  The text makes it clear that co-operation on security matters going beyond this is a matter for the member states who are members of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.  There is also provision for a continuing secretariat to act under the authority of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>We thus achieved overall a modest degree of success at the Luxembourg Council.  As an exporting nation whose prosperity depends on trade, we have a real and substantial interest in measures which counter protectionism and lead to the opening up of markets.  For this reason, at least since the European Council in Stuttgart, we have urged and supported measures to develop the internal market with appropriate safeguards for our interests in regional development and in regard to particular sensitive areas like plant and animal health.</P>
    <P>The Luxembourg Council fully reflected our concern and gave a further impetus to the development of the market.  And, in relation to political co-operation, our particular concerns were also fully accepted and taken on board in the discussions and drafting sessions. Work is now going ahead on the final version of Treaties for the Community, both in its economic and political aspects, based on the Luxembourg conclusions.  I hope that the House will join with me in wishing that work &ldquo;God speed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday morning, I had a brief meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at which we reviewed the position following the signature of the Anglo-Irish agreement.  We both confirmed that the agreement would be implemented, as planned.  At the same time, we recognised the concern about the agreement among the Unionist community. We hoped that that community would come to understand the reassurance <Col N="1165" /> on the status of Northern Ireland and other matters which the agreement offers.</P>
    <P>To the Nationalist community, I repeat here what I said at Hillsborough: they can now raise their heads knowing their position is, and is seen to be, on an equal footing with that of the members of the majority community.  For them also the agreement will have considerable benefits in peace and stability &mdash; peace and stability which can be brought about only by tackling, as this agreement does, the problem of their alienation from the system of government with which they have had to live for 65 years.</P>
    <P>Moreover, to both communities our two Governments have affirmed their commitment to a society in Northern Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination and intolerance, and with the opportunity for both communities to participate fully in the structures and processes of government.</P>
    <P>Later, in the evening, some considerable time after my meeting with the Prime Minister, I was told of certain remarks made in Brussels by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Tom King, which, <i>inter alia</i>, purported to represent what I think and believe about Northern Ireland.  Nobody speaks for me on Northern Ireland unless he fully and accurately represents my views as an Irish Nationalist who all his life has believed and worked for the ideal of Irish unity achieved by agreement and in peace.  That is and always has been my objective and the objective of the Government and people I represent.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Mr. King came to believe that he could speak for me.  His remarks were inaccurate and singularly inappropriate and are, in fact, as everyone knows, a complete distortion of my position.</P>
    <P>I understand that at the press conference in Luxembourg, early this morning, the Prime Minister accepted that the remarks made in Brussels were not in accordance with the agreement.  She reaffirmed that the position is as it is in the agreement that we signed and that it will remain that way.  The position is that <Col N="1166" /> the two Governments agree that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of a majority &mdash; and I stress the indefinite article &mdash; of the people of Northern Ireland and that if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support in the respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish &mdash; no more and no less than that.</P>
    <P>This formal and binding agreement between our two Governments is what matters.  As recently as yesterday morning, in the Kirchberg in Luxembourg, the Prime Minister and I had, in fact, stated our intent that the agreement would be implemented, as planned.</P>
    <P>Later, in the evening, Mr. King in a speech in Brussels brought his earlier remarks into the line with the agreement. Today, I understand, he expressed regret about the impression his remarks created and said that he wants to make it absolutely clear that he understands perfectly well that neither I nor my Government agree with the view he expressed about the political future of this island.  I understand that Mr. King is, at the moment, making a statement in the House of Commons. If this statement is on the lines of Mr. King's latest remarks, I would regard the matter as having been resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he heard the unrepentant tone of Mr. King in a broadcast at 12 o'clock today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The report which the Taoiseach has just made on the Luxembourg Summit will, I hope, help to focus the minds of Deputies in this House and of the general public outside on the current situation in the Community, the direction in which it is heading and our position and prospects as a member state. There are many aspects of the situation which are far from reassuring.  It is urgently necessary to review the whole situation, to assess current developments <Col N="1167" /> as accurately and as realistically as possible and to work out some sort of coherent strategy and approach.</P>
      <P>When I had the privilege recently of talking to a special meeting of the IFA on the occasion of their 30th anniversary, I pointed out that when we joined the Community we had been prepared to incur losses and disadvantages in a number of areas in the knowledge and assurance that benefits from other areas, and in particular the benefits that would flow from the Common Agricultural Policy of the Community, would far outweigh any losses we might incur in the particular areas.  I said that the time has now come to look very carefully and closely at what has happened in that regard since we joined.  I believe that is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary to recall that when we joined, a special Protocol, Protocol No. 30 governing Ireland's special position, was included in the Treaty of Accession.  It is as well as to recall the words of Protocol 30.  They are as follows:</P>
      <P>THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES, desiring to settle certain special problems of concern to Ireland, and having agreed the following provisions, recall that the fundamental objectives of the European Economic Community include the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the peoples of the Member States and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions;</P>
      <P>TAKE NOTE of the fact that the Irish Government has embarked upon the implementation of a policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate under-employment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RECOGNISE it to be in their <Col N="1168" /> common interest that the objectives of this policy be so attained;</P>
    <P>AGREE to recommend to this end that the Community institutions implement all the means and procedures laid down by the Treaties, particularly by making adequate use of the Community resources intended for the realisation of the Community's above-mentioned objectives;</P>
    <P>RECOGNISE in particular that, in the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty, it will be necessary to take into account the objectives of economic expansion and improvement of the population's standard of living.</P>
    <P>These are clear principles.  It is legitimate at this stage to ask whether the principles outlined in that Protocol have been adhered to.  I think any fair minded person would have to acknowledge that they have not.  During the course of the past three or four years, there has been a steady and persistent erosion of the benefits accruing to this country and in many areas of policy, the whole trend is in a direction which is detrimental to our best interests.</P>
    <P>When speaking to the IFA meeting, I suggested also that we should prepare a balance sheet in regard to our position in the Community.  Such a balance sheet would serve many purposes.  The principal objective would be to set out clearly and accurately the positive advantages which flow from Community membership, side by side with the disadvantages and the losses which membership brings. In the wake of a number of major changes which have taken place in Community policies, it is necessary to know exactly where we stand and whether the gap between advantages and disadvantages is narrowing, and if so, to what extent.  Such an assessment could also identify for us the areas in which we should concentrate our efforts.  We would also be in a position to argue much more cogently and convincingly on matters affecting our national interests which arise for decision at Community level.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, of course, would occupy <Col N="1169" /> a very central position on such a balance sheet because of the vital place it occupies in the national economy and also because it was through the development and prosperity of our agricultural industry that we had hoped to gain the principal benefit from membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>I want to press very strongly that something in the nature of such a balance sheet be prepared and published so that we can all see what the situation is.  We could then base a coherent strategy on such an assessment.  At the moment there is no such strategy.  There is only a series of isolated responses to developments, very often panic-stricken responses and <i>ad hoc</i> compromises.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting and immediately relevant documents before the Heads of Government was the Annual Economic Report of the Commission entitled &ldquo;A Cooperative Growth Strategy for More Employment&rdquo;.  In a nutshell the thesis of the report is that on the basis of current policies a 2½ per cent growth rate is all that can be expected in the Community, and that on that basis there will be no significant decline in unemployment for the rest of the decade. The report sets out a strategy for increasing the growth rate to 3½ per cent, the minimum necessary to achieve worthwhile reductions in unemployment, so far as the Commission's view is concerned. That is a key aspect of the report.</P>
    <P>The Commission also pinpoints one of the basic weaknesses in Irish economic policy, policy pursued since the Coalition came into office.  In what I can only describe as a dramatic confirmation of what I have been saying in this House in debate after debate, the Commission states that the budget should be restructured and I quote:</P>
    <P>to increase public investment; particularly in respect of infrastructure, environmental protection and urban renewal, a considerable backlog of needs has build up in recent years, which could be met with the spare capacity in the construction industry. The realisation of major infrastructure <Col N="1170" /> projects in the transport, telecommunications and environmental fields, as well as exploitation of technological potential, would substantially improve the functioning of the internal market. The accelerated implementation of numerous projects, which are already available and have an adequate social rate of return, would reinforce economic dynamism and contribute to the success of the proposed strategy. </P>
    <P>Is that not exactly what I have been advocating?  We have constantly and consistently urged the importance of freeing more resources for capital investment on roads, on the natural gas network, on extensions to the public transport system in Dublin, and on developing our natural resources and developing the inner city while the Government, in accordance with <i>Building on Reality</i> have cut the capital budget in real terms every year they have been in office.  Indeed, the Commission goes so far as to say that the decline in public investment is offsetting the increase in private investment in capital goods.</P>
    <P>But the main thrust of the Commission document is to suggest that in certain Community countries there is scope for giving a boost to demand.  Particularly in Germany with a balance of payments surplus, the Commission sees scope for steps to sustain growth.  I hope the Taoiseach made a strong case for the cooperative action urged, albeit very cautiously, in the Commission document.</P>
    <P>In the section on Ireland there is the interesting comment that the <i>Building on Reality</i> targets are stated to be a minimum, and that the deficit must be reduced by at least 1½ per cent as a halfway step to 1987.  That means a deficit of less than £1,100 million or a reduction of up to £250 million compared with this year.  They also envisage the second and final phase of the abolition of food subsidies, and add: &ldquo;It is questionable in the context of overall budgetary targets, whether the real value of social transfers can be maintained.&rdquo;  Can we detect an Irish Department of Finance briefing undertone there, I wonder?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> It is very disappointing that the council have not taken on board the recommendations of the Commission's report, which is merely to be examined.  Instead a complacent tone is adopted in the Presidency Conclusions, which state that progress towards rationalisation and economic recovery and the increased convergence of economic policies have already made it possible to stabilise the level of unemployment in the Community and even to reduce it in some countries.  That is rubbish.</P>
    <P>What the Irish people wanted from this Summit was something positive in regard to employment.  They are entitled to expect that the leaders of Europe, assembled at this meeting with all the trappings of power, served by the best trained and most sophisticated bureaucracy in the world, commanding all the vast human and material resources of the Continent of Europe would produce policies which would put people to work, restore their dignity and self-respect and not leave them loitering for ever in humiliating and degrading dole queues.</P>
    <P>This Summit has been another non-event in that regard and the leaders of Europe have once again let their people down and condemned them to still more years of hopelessness, idleness and despair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As usual the European Council pays lip service to increased economic and social cohesion and to reducing the disparaties between the regions.  I use the term &ldquo;lip service&rdquo; advisedly.  There is talk of clarifying and rationalising the tasks of the Regional and Social Funds, but no talk of increasing the resources available to them.  Without specific mechanisms and in particular increased resources for the Regional and Social Funds, the Council's statements are nothing more than empty verbiage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to increase cohesion and reduce disparities is to give adequate resources to the Funds and in our case to strengthen the CAP, not to emasculate it.  As we know, this year in the budget, <Col N="1172" /> the Regional Fund allocation for Ireland has been cut not increased.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of this Summit has been proposals for completing the internal market.  It would not be sensible for us to adopt a simplistic view either for or against that proposal.  Obviously, a single market of 320 billion with no barriers of a non-tariff kind would offer us, in theory at least, better export opportunities, provided we knew how to take advantage of them.  However, the third objective of completing the internal market as set out in the Commission White Paper must give us pause for thought.</P>
    <P>This objective is to ensure, and I quote, &ldquo;that resources, both of people and materials, and of capital and investment, flow into areas of greatest economic advantage&rdquo;.  As we know, areas of greatest economic advantage tend to be concentrated in the south-east of England, northern Germany and northern France. It is only with the help of regional support funds and low corporate taxation that we can hope to provide some countervailing attractions to industry and services to locate in Ireland.  There is also a danger if we are not careful that such defences as we have will be dismantled far quicker than the more elaborate and sophisticated defences of our larger partners. What have the effects of economic integration been to date, and have we good reason for believing that a bigger dose of the same interpretation would be much more beneficial than our experience to date?</P>
    <P>I would like to recommend to the House the Thomas Davis lecture given last Sunday by Dr. Kieran Kennedy.  He points out that many of the expected gains from new industry were thwarted by the two oil crises.  Industrial recovery, such as it is since 1983, has been concentrated in a few &ldquo;sunrise&rdquo; industries, notably electronics and pharmaceuticals, which employ relatively few people in relation to their sales.  He points out that £940 million was taken out of the country last year in profits as part of the &ldquo;in-famous&rdquo; black hole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> If the situation in respect of new industries is far from satisfactory, Dr. Kennedy points out that the situation in the traditional sector is even worse.  Employment in many of the larger firms has been wiped out or much reduced.  He concludes &mdash; I quote &mdash;&ldquo;the belief that competition would whip native industries into shape has not been sustained. Instead, it snuffed them out&rdquo;.  With over 17 per cent of the work force unemployed, by far the highest unemployment rate in the Community, we must surely have some concern about the effects of even stronger winds of competition.</P>
    <P>It seems to us on this side of the House that the larger countries want all the benefits of a single homogeneous internal market without being prepared to pay any price for it, in terms of compensatory payments to the less developed regions.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to the regional and social funds in the budget for next year is an illustration of this.  For a start the budget is only equivalent to 1.25 per cent of VAT instead of the 1.4 per cent the Council recognised would be necessary in the context of enlargement. It at present appears that there will be a substantial reduction in the amount Ireland receives from the Regional Fund next year.  Our quota under the fund ranged up until now from 5.6 per cent to 6.8 per cent of the total.  The Commission has proposed that our share be reduced to between 3.8 per cent and 4.6 per cent but in the context of substantial increases in the fund.</P>
    <P>Our 1985 allocation is in the range 123 million to 149 million ECUs.  Under the Commission's proposals for 1986 this will be reduced to 115 million to 138 million ECUS, and this reduction is even greater in real terms if the rate of inflation is taken into account.  However, the Council has not of course accepted the Commission's proposals but decided on an even lower figure.  On the best estimates available, and given that the budget procedure has yet to be completed, there could be up to a 25 per cent drop in allocations for Ireland in 1986.</P>
    <P>I would have to point out that Ireland <Col N="1174" /> has obtained no compensation of any kind following the process of enlargement. France, Italy and Greece have all obtained increased funding under the integrated Mediterranean programmes, while Germany and Britain have the increased markets for their goods in the Iberian Peninsula.  Ireland has negotiated nothing, and faces a decrease in funds, in particular the Regional Fund, and of course from the CAP where no provision has been made in the budget for any increase in agricultural prices in 1986.</P>
    <P>I do not need to remind Deputies that in recent years, the Social Fund has played an important part in our economic and social structures.  As far as the Social Fund is concerned, I understand an entirely inadequate provision has been made for the commitment agreed to by the Council, and that the funds will not be adequate to meet the commitments.  I am told by those with experience that employment training and experience schemes will not be able to continue at present levels next year.  If this is so it will be a near disastrous situation.  What have the Government been doing about that situation?  They appear at this stage to have been inadequate and ineffective in protecting and promoting our interests in that vital area.</P>
    <P>As far as concrete decisions on the internal market are concerned, I presume that detailed clarification of what is involved will be given by the Government at an early date.  From a cursory examination it would appear that the common external tariff, recognition of professional qualifications, exchange controls relative to third countries and transport will no longer require unamimity, but I understand that <i>de facto</i> at least the so-called Luxembourg compromise, the veto will continue to operate, where vital national interests are concerned. There is a commitment to harmonise indirect taxation as far as necessary, but this is subject to the unanimity rule.  But in relation to health, safety, environmental and consumer protection there is provision for national exceptions provided they are not a disguised form of protectionism. Article 1 of the section of the <Col N="1175" /> internal market is not to be interpreted, according to a statement in the minutes, as creating a legal obligation, it is merely an expression of political will that the internal market will be completed by the beginning of 1993.</P>
    <P>I see in all that many dangers.  We would very definitely have to discuss this whole situation further in this House. No matter how enthusiastic we are for European Union and for improvements and progress in that direction, we have to see the veto as the final defence mechanism for a small country like ours which at this stage has suffered a great deal in many areas from membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>While the EMS is now to be written into the Treaty, any further developments require not merely unanimity, but a full scale inter-governmental conference and treaty amendments to be ratified in all Parliaments.  As <i>the Financial Times</i> point out this morning, these changes could make future development of the EMS even more difficult than it is already, while making no real difference to the current situation.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Taoiseach being interviewed this morning by RTE and it seemed to me that he was seeking to convey the impression that this Summit was a good one from our point of view and that its outcome will be beneficial.  I think that is very misleading.  The whole trend in Community policies over recent years has been contrary to our best interests under practically every heading.  We must recognise and acknowledge that trend, face up to it and try to cope with it and not engage in self-deception, pretending to see benefits and progress when, in fact, the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>In regard to agriculture, fisheries, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the budget, the whole trend and movement is against our interests and constantly narrowing the gap between the advantages and disadvantages of membership. It was to be expected that the outcome of the debate on European Union would be a good deal more modest than the enthusiasts would have wished.  The <Col N="1176" /> Spinelli Treaty and even the Dooge report were very ambitious in the institutional area, while being far from ambitious enough in terms of proposals to increase the economic and social cohesion of the Community.  We believe that a pragmatic approach, concentrating on the real problems, is the only realistic course for the Community to take, and any attempt to effect a wholesale transfer of sovereignty to the EC institutions would have left a small country like Ireland in a dangerously exposed and vulnerable situation, apart altogether from its implications for our neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Draft Treaty on European Political Co-operation which essentially formalises the political co-operation process, is one about which we would have considerable reservations.  It will have the definite effect of making the operation of an independent foreign policy by a small country like Ireland more difficult, and it does not provide any permanent safeguards for our neutrality.  I doubt if the Taoiseach could contradict either of those statements.  It will certainly be more difficult for us to pursue any sort of independent foreign policy on the basis of our neutrality.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first point, there is now a formal obligation to consult before taking up positions, and to take into account the views of partners.  This would tend inevitably to inhibit independent initiatives by Ireland particularly in relation to general disarmament and especially nuclear disarmament, an area where the policies and priorities of our partners will often differ from ours.  The practical effect could be to water down our neutrality to a minimalist policy level with little practical content.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to direct the attention of Deputies and the public to Article 8 of the Treaty which states in paragraphs 1 and 2 the following:</P>
    <P>The High Contracting Parties consider that closer cooperation on questions of European Security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European external policy identity.  They are ready to coordinate <Col N="1177" /> their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 states:</P>
    <P>The High Contracting Parties are determined to maintain the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security.  They shall work to that end both at national level, and, where appropriate, on the framework of the relevant institutions and bodies. </P>
    <P>These are very important paragraphs and reading these two paragraphs together could bring us a long way away from neutrality in practice.  To agree that closer co-operation on questions of European security is essential, and I emphasise the use of the word essential, even if for the time being the member states are only ready to co-operate more closely on the political and economic aspects of security, could and no doubt will be interpreted as a formal abdication in principle of our neutrality.  Acceptance of that paragraph is formal acceptance of the principle that military and defence matters are essential to the development of a European external policy identity.  If the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach can counter that proposal I will be interested to hear from them.</P>

      <P>For that reason, unless it can be shown that our view and interpretation is erroneous or exaggerated, I must give notice that we will find it difficult to support this draft Treaty, when it comes before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 also clearly opens the way for collaboration on weapons production within an EC framework, something that every Irish Government up to now have opposed, and that Fianna Fáil have opposed consistently in the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies in this House who are concerned about the principle of neutrality must examine whether they can support the wording of Article 8 as it stands, or <Col N="1178" /> whether when the draft Treaty is next discussed by the Foreign Ministers Ireland must make formal objections to this part of the text.</P>
    <P>Speaking at a Fianna Fáil function in the Burlington Hotel.  On Wednesday, 20 November I said that because we were anxious to secure any possible improvement in the situation and the circumstances of the Nationalist section of the community in the North of Ireland, we did not wish to engage in any activity that would impede or obstruct anything this new Conference might undertake for that purpose.  I went on to say that though we had deep concerns about the Conference, if those who were committed to it would use it to ameliorate the condition of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, we would not put any difficulties in their way because we fully understood and sympathised with the need of both Nationalists and Unionists in the North of Ireland to see some progress in the appalling state of affairs that prevails there.</P>
    <P>Since the conclusion of the Dáil debate, during the course of which we put our position on the unity and the sovereignty of the Irish nation firmly on the record, we have not made any further comment.  This restraint on our part was deliberate.  We are deeply conscious of the need for us to act with the utmost sensitivity and responsibility.  We were fully conscious of the sensitive and dangerous nature of the situation the agreement had created.  We were quite clear in our determination that no action or statement on our part would heighten tension, cause difficulties, or obstruct any progress that might possibly be made. We maintained that attitude in spite of a great deal of provocation and criticism. We have, in fact, been compelled to have to listen to a number of statements and comments from people who on the one hand, abjured us to be supportive and responsible, while at the same time, losing no opportunity to condemn and vilify us.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will maintain this dignified and responsible role in regard to the <Col N="1179" /> agreement and it is entirely in that spirit and context I find myself compelled to comment on the recent developments which have taken place though I would much prefer not to have the obligation to do so.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate, it was an essential part of our case against the agreement, that it undermined our national position in regard to unity and our rejection of British sovereignty over the six counties of Northern Ireland.  We also stated that the signing of the agreement would enable any British Government to turn to the outside world, and in particular to our friends abroad, and claim that there was no longer any problem in regard to Northern Ireland between the Irish and British Governments, that they were in agreement about it, that the integrity of Northern Ireland as part of the UK was fully accepted by the Irish Government and that no further action of any kind was called for on their part.  It is unfortunate and regrettable that that is precisely what has happened.</P>
    <P>What Mr. King, the British Chairman of the Inter-governmental Conference that will be established has said, clearly constitutes his understanding of the agreement.  What he said was:</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland now we have signed an Agreement in which the Prime Minister of Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that he faces and has to live with a Constitution which has aspirations of sovereignty over Northern Ireland, has in fact accepted that for all practical purposes and into perpetuity there will not be a united Ireland, because he has accepted the principle of consent that the will of the majority in Northern Ireland must predominate and that Northern Ireland, which is our fervent wish, remains part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>He went on to elaborate at a press conference:</P>
    <P>What has been widely misunderstood is that it marks the acceptance in a formal agreement which will be <Col N="1180" /> lodged as a Treaty at the United Nations by the Government of the Republic of the principle of consent, that is, in fact, therefore the legitimacy of the Unionist position based on the majority view in Northern Ireland is accepted, and that therefore means that, as you put it, for all practical purposes there is no prospect of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mr. King's remarks have not been rejected or repudiated by the British Prime Minister.  He has repeated and reinforced them in several interviews since.  The reality is that Mr. King's remarks are exactly the way the British are presenting the Hillsborough Agreement internationally.</P>

      <P>I wish to repeat that we will favour anything which will help to improve the position of the Nationalist community, end discrimination and eliminate the many grievances and instances of oppression they suffer from.  Obviously, the way the British Government interpret and implement the agreement is crucial.  I can only say that what was said yesterday by the British representative on the Conference does not give grounds for confidence.</P>
      <P>I feared and gave expression to the fear that the whole purpose of the agreement from the British point of view was to secure the full backing of the Irish Government for their security policies and to legitimise the RUC, the UDR, the courts and varous controversial security practices.  That suspicion has, I regret to say, been greatly strengthened not lessened by these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also draw the attention of Deputies to another element in this situation &mdash; a new element which has been imported into the situation.  The British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in the course of his speech in Brussels, stated that it was his fervent wish that Northern Ireland would always remain a part of the United Kingdon.  The same sentiment was expressed by the British <Col N="1181" /> Prime Minister who said: &ldquo;Tom King and I both hope and expect that there will continue to be a majority&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach must acknowledge that the combination&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;these two powerful statements makes a total nonsense of his claim in regard to the third paragraph of article 1 of the Hillsborough Agreement. Speaking in the Dáil debate on the agreement, he said:</P>
      <P>The commitment in this clause to introduce such legislation is the first clear affirmation in any binding Anglo-Irish Agreement since 1921 that Britain has no interest in the continuing division of this island and that its presence in this island, undertaking the responsibility of government in Northern Ireland, continues solely because this is the wish of a majority of the people of that area and will not continue beyond the point when that consent is changed into consent to Irish unity.</P>
      <P>I have to emphasise at this point that the content of the agreement itself represents those things to which both Governments can give their assent; of its very nature it contains no unilateral statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, unfortunately, the position that both the British Prime Minister and Secretary of State have unequivocally stated that the British Government have a continued interest in the partition of Ireland, and that indeed they both wish to see Ireland divided in perpetuity and a majority in Northern Ireland supporting the union. They see the agreement as a bulwark <Col N="1182" /> of partition.  Mr. King has said that he believes that this is what the agreement will prove to have established.  The cause of constitutional nationalism in Ireland is not lost, but no one who is committed to that cause can be encouraged or made optimistic by these far-reaching recent developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The summit which has just taken place was, as I understand it, the make-up-your-mind time on many major structural issues which faced the European Community, but from the Taoiseach's statement here today and from press coverage this morning it is clear that, while a number of modest changes have been made, the major structural issues have not been dealt with. At the Milan summit about six months ago it was agreed, despite strong opposition from Britain, Denmark and Greece, to establish an inter-governmental conference to produce a package of proposals to revitalise and streamline the Community, especially in view of the imminent entry of Spain and Portugal. This summit was intended to deal with the recommendations of the inter-governmental conference in relation to those major items, but the conference produced very little in the way of agreement. The conference considered the Dooge report and proposals from the European Parliament for a revised treaty, but there were so many objections by different Governments to different aspects of the proposals that little progress was made.  EC Commissioner Jacques Delors summed up the efforts of member governments as &ldquo;a Texas chain saw massacre on the well-intentioned proposals for European development&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland raised as many objections as other countries, and many of the objections were well justified.  The Taoiseach indicated today in his speech that agreement in principle was reached on revisions of the Treaty of Rome which are intended to speed up decision making and to give the European Parliament an enhanced role.  There is to be a new treaty formalising foreign policy co-operation <Col N="1183" /> of the member states along with strengthened policies on environmental protection and technological research.</P>
    <P>The most significant change for Ireland seems to be the decision to introduce the concept of qualified majority voting on the Council of Ministers for many areas. This has enormous implications for a small country such as Ireland.  We are still relatively underdeveloped compared to other EC members and very often our interests will not coincide with the interests of the bigger, more developed industrial nations, particularly France, Germany and the UK.  The Taoiseach indicated that there is to be a new article in relation to cohesion.  He said:</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that there will now be, for the first time, a specific Treaty article referring to the need to promote harmonious development and to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the Community, and in particular, to reduce disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions.</P>
    <P>That is a welcome development; but I for one, cannot see how that in reality will improve the situation which exists already.  It may strengthen ministerial hands in negotiations but it is little enough to come away with in terms of the kind of assistance which underdeveloped regions of the EC require.</P>
    <P>One area where majority voting has been introduced is the question of financial services, banking, insurance etc.  Surprisingly, the Taoiseach has withdrawn his reservation about majority voting in this area.  According to press reports, he indicated that he hoped for a sympathetic hearing at a later stage if Ireland sought an exemption.  However, there must be serious doubt now about the ability of any Irish Government to mount a rescue operation similar to the PMPA and ICI operations which we saw recently, or there may be a question relating to how these existing rescue operations can be maintained.  People would be naive if they believed that free trade in the financial <Col N="1184" /> area will result, even in the long term, in cheaper insurance for the people here and, indeed, for Irish businesses.  For instance, much of the public liability area for insurance is done already with Lloyds of London and there is reason to suspect that this is one of the reasons for major problems faced by companies and bodies securing public liability insurance at an affordable price.</P>
    <P>Another area which must be of major concern to us as a neutral country is the reference to the formalisation of the foreign policy co-operation of the member states.  The Taoiseach referred to this in his speech.  There has been a trend in recent years to subsume our foreign policy under the Community's foreign policy approach.  It is normal now, if a question is placed here in the House asking the Government what their attitude is or what they have done in relation to Central America or South Africa or anywhere else, for us to be told that the Community has a particular position, that this is what they have said and done.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get an expression of a view of what the Irish position on certain areas of foreign policy.  We are gradually losing our independent voice on foreign policy matters.  I do not believe it has got to a critical stage as yet but the trend is there.  This new formalisation of foreign policy co-operation is a hardening of that process.  In effect, we are being asked to accept that our foreign policy interests are the same as those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, the same as nuclear powers such as France and the UK.  One of the worrying aspects of the EC membership has been the gradual but presistent erosion of the perception of Ireland abroad as a genuinely neutral country.  We have accepted without much demur the role of the EC as in effect the political wing of NATO.  I am sure the Taoiseach will be anxious to deny that but the effect on the ground of the position we take indicates that we are quite soft in relation to the areas of policy which might impinge on the interests of NATO countries.</P>
    <P>Our Government have never taken any initiative to develop an alliance of non-aligned <Col N="1185" /> or neutral countries.  We have not taken any initiative to provide an alternative which would encourage the Danish, the Greek or the Irish Governments to co-operate in opposition to the military build-up which is now such a feature of modern Europe.  We have never initiated dialogue with the Scandinavian countries, Austria, Switzerland or Finland, on mutual co-operation for demilitarisation and world peace.</P>
    <P>We have largely been inactive promoting <i>detente</i> in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki Agreement, an agreement which provides a framework based on respect for sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and political independence. It is based on ten principles which are in effect the Charter of the United Nations.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach why such an approach has never been placed on the European agenda.  It is no wonder people ask what we mean when we say that we have a national policy of neutrality when we seem to cut corners on it in many areas of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I read with interest reports of the Summit and listened to the Taoiseach's speech today in the hope of finding something concrete that would have in some way or another shortened the dole queues.  I regret to say that there was not anything substantial in the reports of the Summit that will in the short term lead to a shortening of the dole queues.  I am not only referring to the dole queues in Ireland but to the 13 million who are unemployed in the EC.  In 1973 we pointed out that we considered the EC to be a rich man's club and nothing has happened so far to encourage us to change that perception of what is involved.</P>
    <P>While progress has been made on the elimination of tariff barriers to facilitate the free movement of labour and capital, the inequalities within the Community are still largely there and appear to have a very low priority.  While capital and labour had great expectations when we joined the EC it is fair to say that capital is the only area which has benefited to any great extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> It is desirable that there should be a move towards reform following the operation of the Treaty for the last 25 years. I hope that when the amendments to the Treaty have been agreed by the Council of Ministers adequate time will be given in the House to debate them.  I hope every opportunity is given to all Members, not just those with an interest in the area, to contribute to such a debate.  The suggestion made by Deputy Haughey in relation to a balance sheet as to the benefits and disadvantages of membership is long overdue.  While I do not believe that there is any realistic possibility that we could withdraw from the EC at this stage a debate on the advantages and disadvantages of membership would clarify for many in the House, and perhaps for the Government, the direction in which our negotiators should be moving in regard to gaining some benefit for our people.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point in regard to the Taoiseach's statement on his meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.  I was disappointed that the Taoiseach stated merely that there was hope expressed that those in Northern Ireland who opposed the agreement would see the benefit of it.  I was hoping that the Taoiseach would be announcing today some concrete steps to encourage that development to take place.  It is unfortunate that Mr. Tom King, the Northern Ireland Secretary, made a statement last night.  I cannot believe that it was by way of a slip of the tongue or was made inadvertently.  It would be an extraordinary thing for a person in his position, given the crucial role he has to play in the Inter-Governmental Conference to be so unguarded in his remarks. I can only assume that he was genuinely expressing his view of the agreement. Whether he has the right or not to interpret the mind of the Taoiseach is a matter for the Taoiseach to say but it is my view to say that the interpretation he has put on the agreement does not appear to be accurate.</P>
    <P>However, the remarks by Mr. King are an indication of the dangers that arise from the agreement such as this, which <Col N="1187" /> in many ways is pitched to be vague on certain things so that different shades of interpretation can be allowed in order to reach the compromise that is needed for a working relationshop.  All Members of the House should take that into account when responding to the position Mr. King has adopted.  To argue that Mrs. Thatcher or Mr. King were anything other than Unionists when they signed the agreement is foolish.  I do not think there was anything in the communique or in the agreement which indicated that Mrs. Thatcher or Mr. King, or anybody else who previously was Unionist, were anything other than Unionists after they had signed the agreement.</P>
    <P>If this agreement is to be of any benefit, it must encourage the development of political dialogue between the democratic parties in Northern Ireland.  For that reason I hope that no opportunity will be lost by any of the parties there to sit down around the table without preconditions and discuss their differences.  I and other members of The Working Party inside and outside this House believe that the greatest gesture which the SDLP could make at this time would be to enter the Assembly.  This would reduce considerably the fears and anger of the Unionists &mdash; not with a large &ldquo;U&rdquo;.  I am talking about the people of Northern Ireland who consider themselves to be unionists and feel anger and fear at this time.  I accept that this would be a fairly difficult gesture for the SDLP to make.  However, they would certainly lose nothing in the eyes of the people of the Republic of Ireland and I have no doubt that they would not lose face among those in Northern Ireland either.  I urge that they should be encouraged by whoever has influence over them to enter the Assembly.  It is a gesture of that kind which is needed now.</P>

That is what keeps me from saying many other things or having said them over the past number of years.  In the heat of the <Col N="1190" /> moment earlier today I spoke in relation to the signing and negotiation of this agreement as being between the professed Unionist Loyalist.  Mrs. Thatcher and our clown.  I want to withdraw that, Sir, and to have it stricken from the record as not being subscribed to by me in relation to this or any other Taoiseach, whether he has sold out this country or not, which I profess he has.  I thank Tom King for elucidating their view of this agreement.  That is what I have been telling you, but nobody wants to listen.

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 5, as amended, stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 sets out the offences which will be punished by very substantial penalites indeed, as set out <Col N="1191" /> further in the Act but as proposed to be amended slightly by having some of the jail sentences removed and some of the fines reduced.  It is interesting to see what is defined here as an offence because, for the first time, travel agents are included. If they sell a discounted ticket, no matter how slight, they commit an offence for which, on indictment, they can be sent to prison or fined.  I think in the Bill it is £100,000 which is proposed by the Minister's amendment to be reduced to £50,000.  In addition to that, there is a provision that, if an offence is created under this section, under section 10 of the Bill a travel agent can lose his licence. That is the case even though the whole purpose of licensing travel agents under the 1982 Act was to seek to protect the public against tour operators who went out of business.  It was never envisaged in 1982 that that Act would be used to impose penalities on a travel agent for engaging in the normal commercial practice of giving a discount, a normal trade discount to anyone of his customers, no matter how good that customer might be.</P>
      <P>We are in a very unusual situation here, in that we have under this Bill higher penalties, for example, then under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act of 1978 or the Consumer Information Act of 1978.  We have far higher penalties than under the Prices (Amendment) Act of 1972.  It seems extraordinary that, while the maximum fine there is apparently £500 for charging too much for a product or service, the maximum fine here is £50,000 for charging too little, which seems to be a remarkable sense of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems equally remarkable to anyone who cares to look at it or think about it.  Even for malpractices on the stock exchange under the European Stock Exchange Law the maximum fine for many serious malpractices is £1,000, even though the loss to the public or the consumer would be very substantial.  Here where the consumer might gain from the offences of charging too little, the fine is no less than £50,000 plus a period in jail for some offences.  This is from a Minister <Col N="1192" /> who has claimed on numerous occasions that he is pro-consumer and supportive of competion, for example, between airlines.</P>
    <P>In connection with the offences created under this section, I would refer to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 February 1985 which stated:</P>
    <P>Significant amendments, to reduce legal penalties and free competition between travel agents and airlines, have been agreed by the Government in relation to the Air Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Communications, Mr. Mitchell, advised the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party yesterday on the steps he intended to take to amend the Bill at present before the Dáil so as to provide for more open competition between travel agents and airlines.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the parliamentary party, Mr. Kieran Crotty, told correspondents that the new proposals were &ldquo;quite acceptable&rdquo; to most people at the meeting.  They had been given an assurance, he added, that the legislation was not anti-consumer and not &ldquo;a benefit Bill for Aer Lingus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Fine Gael Parlimentary Party were given those assurances and if they believed them, as apparently they did &mdash; nobody has come in speak on this Bill apart from the Minister, Deputy Wilson and I &mdash; they must have been misled because there is no evidence in this section or in the remainder of the Bill of any attempt to permit more open competition between travel agents and airlines. Anyone who does compete will commit a crime and will face very substantial penalties, including a jail sentence.  I do not see how this Bill, even with the limited amendments proposed by the Minister, is compatible with the statements he is reported to have made on 6 February last.  Certainly these statements were not denied.</P>
    <P>On 14 November 1984 the Minister made the first of the various statements that he was in favour of free competition. He makes statements of that kind but what counts is what is to be enacted, <Col N="1193" /> not a general bland assurance from the Minister.  The provisions of the Bill, particularly in this section setting out a whole series of rather artificial offences which hardly correspond to the provisions of the law in other countries, are at variance with the grand, general, bland assurances of the Minister that he is all for the consumer and for competition.  They are quite incompatible.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there are other countries which prosecute for offences of this kind but the only one I can think of is France.  We know what has happened to the French prosecution.  The French court took the view that the provisions of the French law were not compatible with the Treaty of Rome and referred the matter to the European Court for judgment. The judgment is still awaited but the opinion of the advocate general advising the court is to the effect that the court should find the French law incompatible with the competition provision of the Treaty and that therefore it should be struck down.  If the French law is struck down, this proposed law, which is far more stringent then anything there is in France, will be struck down too.  Since the judgment is due to be given by the court next month and since it looks on the balance of probability that it will go in favour of striking down the French law, what is the point of trying to enact this law since it would be struck down too?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question boils down to whether we should have regulations in relation to international air transport. Earlier in the debate if memory serves me correctly, Deputy O'Malley made the point that some other countries did not have these controls.  I asked him to name one of these countries but he was unable to do so.  Every country in the world has the power to regulate and control international aviation.  That includes the United States of America which has internal deregulation but which insists on exercising the power of controlling international aviation as to price, tariffs, numbers of journeys, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> All we are seeking is to put beyond doubt the fact that we also have this power.  It was brought into doubt because of a court case.  If we are to have control and to have legislation giving us this control, it is incumbent on us to have legislation through which a coach and four cannot be driven.  I would assume Deputy O'Malley agrees with that approach.  It we are giving the State certain powers in the public interest, we want the legislation to be effective.  A coach and four was being driven through the existing legislation by the device of granting a specific travel agent very large commission which that travel agent was passing on to the customer.  That is good news as far as it goes, but it was a device to get around the Minister's control of air tariffs.  The Minister does not want to have control of air tariffs if it is not necessary in the public interest, but it has been found necessary in the public interest in every other administration in the world.  That is why it is necessary to have the provisions as laid down in section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We already have ample control and if the Minister wants an example of a country which does not seek to utilise any controls against travel agents and others who sell below the stated or recommended price on a ticket, he need not go very far but only to Britain where they confirm that year after year more than five million such tickets are sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out this morning we have, within 200 yards of this House, a travel agent in Dawson Street perfectly lawfully and commendably offering discount fares and tickets out of Belfast.  Does the Minister not realise the futility of this sort of law?  He said he was trying to bring in a law that a coach and four could not be driven through, but let him walk over to Dawson Street and see the coach and four there already before the law is even enacted.  Even if this law is enacted the travel agent in Dawson Street can continue this practice.  The British can also continue to do what they are doing and they regard it as plain common sense. <Col N="1195" /> Everyone is moving in this direction except us.  This House is out of step if it accepts the Bill with these provisions and offences.</P>
    <P>It is not right for the Minister to say that this is only a kind of re-enactment of the existing offences.  They are far more extensive and the penalties are enormously more extensive than is the case at present.  The position is as I outlined it and I invite the Minister to go to Dawson Street to see discount tickets being sold. He cannot legislate in a vacuum.  We had the spectacle over the past number of years of the Minister for Finance thinking he could fix indirect taxes at whatever level he liked and that it did not matter because it would not affect the yield. However, as we now know, it certainly did affect the yield because there are two jurisdictions on this island and if the prices in the other jurisdiction are significantly below ours &mdash; as they are on many items &mdash; people from here will avail of them.  Air fares are a very obvious example and it is pointless for the Minister to pursue his present line.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, subsection (1) (a), lines 51 to 54, to delete &ldquo;£1,000 or at the <Col N="1196" /> discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£500&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to offences under section 5 which we discussed a short time ago and sets out the penalties for the various offences.  The most significant one is selling below the approved cartel fare which will be a crime&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalties for this new crime of selling below the approved cartel fare are enormous.  As it stands, there is a fine on conviction on indictment not exceeding £100,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both the fine and the imprisonment.  In one of the subsequent amendments the Minister proposes to delete the reference to imprisonment in this section and to reduce the fine to £50,000.  He possibly intends to reduce some of the other smaller fines also.  Even the reduced figure of £50,000 is ridiculous for charging too little for something.  The corresponding fine, as far as I can ascertain from the Prices Act, 1972, for charging too much is £500.  Why should the fine for charging too little be 100 times greater than the fine for charging too much?  What sense of priorities exists?  I do not think that there is any rhyme or reason to it.  It is also highlighted by the situation in Belfast where most fares are between £60 and £120 cheaper if you fly from Belfast to London than if you fly from Dublin to London, and these are return fares.</P>
      <P>When I spoke this morning I was not aware that the figures were set out in a very good article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by Dr. Seán Barrett, the leading transport economist in the country who agrees with my views on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can allow the professional reputation of my friend, Dr. Barrett, to be called into question in this way.  He is the leading transport economist in the country and unspecified allegations of errors in his writings will not remove him from that pedestal, even if these unspecified allegations are made by the Minister for Communications.  The anxiety of travel agents to give some kind of discount to people who fly out of the Republic will be all the greater in present circumstances where we have such an enormous disparity in the Dublin-London and the Belfast-London fares which comes to over £100 on the full fare.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that British Airways are flying to Belfast-London and Belfast-Dublin and although Belfast is significantly further from London than Dublin they are able to charge £109 less for the longer journey from Belfast to London than they are for the shorter journey from Dublin to London.  British Airways are not foolish and, if they charge substantially more for a shorter journey, they are doing so only because they are allowed to do so due to the regulatory system here.  They are not allowed to do it from Belfast because there is free and open competition there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The penalties as proposed here are two years in jail and a fine of £100,000.  The Minister proposes to lessen those considerably because of the attention I and others drew to these matters in the past 18 months.  Nevertheless, he is proposing a fine of £50,000 for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo;&mdash; I put the word in inverted commas &mdash; of charging too little.  That is outrageous.  I invite the Minister to tell me if there is any other jurisdiction in Europe that fines people £50,000 for cutting a few pounds off the price of a ticket. It is absolutely outrageous, even in its amended form.  In my amendment I propose to reduce the fine of £1,000 plus 12 months in jail to £500 without any jail term and I propose in amendment No. 22 to reduce the fine of £100,000 and two years in jail to a fine of £10,000.  This is more than adequate for a conviction of this kind on indictment.  In amendment No. 23 I propose that we substitute £100 for £1,000 as the fine for charging too little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister seriously say that those fines, which are substantially higher than the fines imposed under the legislation dealing with prices, are inadequate? Why is it that here the crime of charging too little is so much more heinous than the crime of charging too much?  I should have thought we would be anxious to stop people from charging too much.  Indeed, the Minister gives the impression to some people that that is his view also.  He is constantly making statements that he is for competition but <Col N="1199" /> yet he produces this Bill with these appalling penalties to penalise the people who are trying to compete.</P>

All I ask is to be judged on my record which can be examined in relation to what has happened to air fares since I became Minister.

I challenge him to say where the figure of £200,000 or two years in jail appears in this Bill or in other Bills.  The first error in the article by Dr. Barrett in the <i>Irish Independent</i> was the reference to the sum of £200,000 and it is extraordinary that the same error, as well as many other errors of Deputy O'Malley and Dr. Barrett, were peppered throughout an editorial in <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i> I should be happy if both of those newspapers would give me the right of reply to answer the many inaccuracies and distortions in their articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be useful in this debate if we dealt with facts.  The fact is that here we <Col N="1201" /> are proposing to give the courts discretion to impose maximum fines.  We are dealing with aviation, an industry in which hundreds of millions of pounds are involved.  We are dealing with major companies and for Deputy O'Malley to suggest that £1,000 or £500 would be an impediment to those people is quite absurd.  We are proposing realistic maximum fines and we are leaving it to the discretion of the courts to decide what the fines should be up to the maximum levels, while taking into account the seriousness of the offence.  There is little point in our having regulatory controls &mdash; every State has such controls &mdash; unless there are meaningful penalties.</P>

      <P>I found I could not go along with the penalty involving imprisonment and I have tabled four amendments with regard to that provision.  The argument of the economist puts me in mind of the statement that if all the economists in the country were laid end to end they would not reach a conclusion, while the alternative version is it would be a damn good job for the country. While I do not subscribe fully to those beliefs, I agree that an economist who cannot distinguish between £100,000 and £200,000 would not be a person I should like to take as an adviser.  The reaction aroused by this section in regard to the penalties was natural and therefore the deletion of the imprisonment clause is one I support fully.  The fines, originally at £100,000 and £1,000, were also exorbitant and I support the reduction.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to take away from Dr. Seán Barrett's ability, but in this case he seems to have had a fixation which led to many distortions of fact.  Deputy O'Malley asked what other countries would do, if they would impose jail sentences for charging less money for fares.  This is enabling legislation to allow us to exercise control in cases in which fares are too high or too low.  Deputy O'Malley is an advocate of the regime in the UK.  What penalties apply in the UK for selling discounted tickets?</P>
      <P>Section 21 (8) of the 1971 UK Civil Aviation Act, as amended by the Criminal Law Act, 1977, provides that a person guilty of an offence under section 21 (5) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of an amount not exceeding £1,000 or such sum as may be substituted for that amount by virtue of the 1977 Act, and on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for up to two years, or both fine and imprisonment.  This is the distinction I have been drawing throughout the debate.  I have pointed out that the powers are enabling.  If I were to pursue the policy I have been pursuing in the past three years I would be happy, but Deputy O'Malley has refused point blank to recognise how the policy has been pursued.</P>
      <P>In the original Bill we sought penalties similar to those in the UK.  Now we are abolishing the proposed jail sentences and reducing the maximum fine to £50,000.  That is a response to the debate and that is what the legislative process is all about.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to agree with those penalties, even though they have been reduced drastically from the original figures.  They are still ludicrously high for the so-called crimes to which they are being applied.  Anybody who looks at this objectively will consider it a joke.  The Minister justified those penalties by saying it does not matter what is in the Bill because it is the policy that counts.</P>

      <P>This opens up many avenues in terms of legislation and jurisprudence. The proposition is that there should be terribly severe penalties, draconian law, but applied only now and again at the whim of the Minister.  That is dangerous thing.  I can think of many crimes for which there are enormous penalties, murder for example, but if the Minister for Justice were to bring in a Bill about murder, with enormous penalties including death, is it enough for the Minister for Justice to say that we will put it into the law anyway but we will not use it, we will not act to exact the maximum penalty?  That is not acceptable.  Perhaps if the Minister were more familiar with legal practice and the propriety of legislation, he would not suggest that.  It is frightening concept that in proposing a Bill the Minister should say that what is in the Bill or what is in the law does not matter, that what matters is the policy and that we will not exact our full pound of flesh.  That is selective enforcement of the law.  It is not good enough.  It has been pointed out here before on numerous occasions and it must be pointed out again that courts cannot consider the policy of a Minister.  They cannot consider what the Minister said in the House. They will not be concerned with whether the Minister proposed here today to use this law very sparingly or selectively against a very limited number of people. The courts must administer the law as they find it.  Therefore, the Oireachtas should legislate on that basis and not on <Col N="1205" /> the basis, as the Minister suggests, of selectivity or on a hit and miss basis. If the policy were to change numerous times, the law would not change in any respect on that account.  It could happen that in a couple of years time we would have a Minister for Communications who would take the view that I take, that is, that competition should be encouraged and that discounting should be allowed and encouraged.  What would be the position in regard to the law then?  If such a Minister should not happen to like some travel agent, should he be in a position selectively to prosecute that agent?  We cannot have that kind of law.  One must assume that if law is enacted it will aply to everyone, that the full rigours of it will apply to everyone and not to selective customers who invoke the wrath of the Minister of the day or of the head office of the Department of Communications. It is disturbing to hear the Minister say that the law does not matter.</P>
      <P>The right way to approach this matter would be to reduce the penalties further, to reduce them to a reasonable figure that would prevent some grave injustice being inflicted on a selective basis in pursuit of the policy of the day rather than in pursuit of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let that go unanswered.  I would not wish the words used by Deputy O'Malley in the past few minutes to be taken as representing my view.  I was trying to illustrate that British legislation, which apparently the Deputy very much admires in this regard, allows for the jailing of people for periods of up to two years in respect of the breaking of tariff regulations.  We are not including that in this Bill.  That does not mean that in the UK people are being sent to jail every day of the week because of this provision.  The picture conjured up by the Deputy of our going out, watching and besetting good samaritans who are trying to introduce low air fares and putting them in jail is a distortion of the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am highlighting the fact that the Bill is enabling legislation.  It provides for certain powers which, by the very reason of their existence, we hope will discourage <Col N="1206" /> any breaches of the regulations which, I reiterate, are made in the overall public interest as much as in the interest of controlling excessively high or excessively low fares or fares that would be predatory and which would disrupt the market, fares which in the short term might be beneficial but which in the long term would be damaging.  That is the purpose of the Bill and it is why 165 Deputies of the 166 in the House are supporting the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some confusion about this section so I wish to clarify the position. The 1965 Act provides for six months imprisonment for people who breach, for instance, air safety requirements.  There was an incident at Shannon some time ago of a pilot boarding a loaded plane and flying off without air traffic clearance.  In the process of departure, a number of parts fell off the aircraft.  The pilot flew the plane across Europe to Germany. The aviation authorities in the other countries concerned were notified of the matter.  This section is to deal with the sort of breach of regulations.  It does not <Col N="1208" /> deal in any way with tariffs or such matters. It deals solely with safety and related matters.  We were proposing in the Bill to increase the imprisonment provision from six to 12 months but by way of the amendments we are proposing to leave the 1965 Act alone in this respect.  I hope I am right in assuming that Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Wilson may have misunderstood the point because they are proposing that the existing jail provisions should be deleted.</P>

      <P>The deletions I am proposing with regard to imprisonment &mdash; as I said I have a commitment against the imprisonment clauses in the penalties &mdash; refer not to paragraph 9 (f) but to the Table.  My proposal in amendment No. 37 reads: &ldquo;In page 7, in the Table to the section, lines 52 and 53, to delete &lsquo;to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or&rsquo;&rdquo;.  I have a very strong commitment to that and I follow that through in amendments Nos. 40 and 44, all of which will be discussed together. What the Minister has referred to as far as my amendments are concerned is not relevant.  He is wrong in thinking I am referring to that section because I find it repugnant in the context in which I have suggested the amendments to have imprisonment penalties.  On the other hand, I would like the Minister to tease out a little the statement he has just made about section 9 (f), lines 21, 22, 23 and 24.  He gave an example of the kind of case he wants to cover, but I would like a little more expansion on that.</P>

    <P> (a)  on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to both the imprisonment and the fine, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding one thousand pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to both the imprisonment and the fine. </P>
    <P>(3)  In any prosecution of a person for an alleged contravention of or failure to comply with a provision of this Act or an order, regulation or direction under this Act it shall be a defence for the person to prove that the contravention or failure was due to stress of weather or other unavoidable cause, and in any prosecution of the owner, hirer or person in command of an aircraft for such alleged contravention or failure it shall be a defence for the owner, hirer or person in command to prove that the alleged contravention or failure took place without his actual default or privity.</P>
    <P>(4)  An offence under this Act may be prosecuted by or at the suit of the Minister as prosecutor. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the points I would like to clarify.  The Minister read out provisions with regard to penalties under section 12 of the 1965 Act, but they were penalties for breaches of the Act, they were not simply for a section relating only to air safety.  Section 12 (1) applies to safety matters, about flying aircraft in contravention of directions, orders and so on, but subsection (2) goes on to lay out the penalties and does not refer to offences against this section.  It says &ldquo;offences under this Act&rdquo;.  They will all be offences under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would include things like charging too little for tickets or less than the Minister ordered on a particular tariff.  With respect, the Minister is not right in saying that because he has amended the 12 months to six months in one of his amendments, there is no change in the penalties.  There is an enormous change in the penalties, an absolutely vast, mind-boggling change, a fine of £1,000 increased to £100,000.  I cannot imagine anything more drastic.  Perhaps £1,000 is not a big fine in certain circumstances but £100,000 is an appalling imposition on anyone.  The Minister's amendment which we are discussing only proposes to put back the jail end of things from 12 to six months.  The Minister does not change his proposal to change the fine of £1,000 up to £100,000.  Section 12 (2) of the 1965 Act says</P>
      <P>A person who contravenes or fails to comply with or who is deemed by this section to have contravened or failed to comply with a provision of this Act or an order, regulation or direction under this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is section 12 (2) of the 1965 Act.  Under this section the penalties are not imposed for breaches of the air safety section.  They are imposed for all breaches of the Act, and that would include breaches of the tariff regulations, for example an airline or a travel agent charging too little.</P>

      <P>With respect, it is very clear.  The Minister should look at the marginal heading to section 12 of the 1965 <Col N="1213" /> Act.  The heading is &ldquo;Penalties&rdquo; not &ldquo;Air Safety&rdquo; or &ldquo;Breaches of Air Safety Regulations&rdquo;. Section 12 is the penalty section for the entire 1965 Act.  There is no other penalty section.  Section 10 of the 1965 Act refers to approval of fares and grants charged on air services, therefore a breach of section 10&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There might be dreadful things in that.  All of these amendments will have to be looked at again in the light of that.  There is no doubt that even without change in the six months to 12 months it is proposed in paragraph (f), line 21 of section 9 to increase the two fines of £100 and £1,000 to £1,000 and £100,000.

      <P>I had down a series of amendments with regard to imprisonment. What the Minister says puts a different complexion on it.  I am grateful to the Minister for his fairly radical undertaking to put down an amendment on Report Stage to make it clear that he is not referring to the offences that are being created by this Bill but rather to section 12.  Section 12 of the 1965 Act refers exclusively to penalties.  It says:</P>
      <P> (1)  If&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  an aircraft flies in contravention of a provision of this Act or an order, regulation or direction under this Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> (b)  an aircraft fails to comply with a provision of this Act or an order or regulation under this Act, or</P>
    <P>(c)  an act is committed in respect of an aircraft which is a contravention of a provision of this Act or an order, regulation or direction under this Act, the owner or hirer (not being the State) of the aircraft and also the person in command thereof shall be deemed to have contravened or, as the case may be, failed to comply with the provision. </P>
    <P>(2)  A person who contravenes or fails to comply with or who is deemed by this section to have contravened or failed to comply with a provision of this Act or an order, regulation or direction under this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to both the imprisonment and the fine, or</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to a fine not exceeding one thousand pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to both the imprisonment and the fine. </P>
    <P>That colours my amendment to the lines in the table.  I was alarmed when Deputy O'Malley mentioned that he thought that this penalty section would throw an umbrella over the earlier section, section 7.  For that reason I would be grateful to the Minister if he would let us know in somewhat more detail his intentions under this section for Report Stage.</P>

We were assured that the words at the end of the table on the bottom of page 7 of <Col N="1215" /> the Bill dealt only with air safety and connected matters.  I agree that it could be extended to include section 9 of the 1965 Act which deals with air tariffs, charges and so on.

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 7, in the Table to the section, line 33, to delete &ldquo;to,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subsection in the table reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by order, fix the fares, rates or other charges, terms or conditions to be charged, made, applied or imposed in respect of or in relation to the carriage of passengers, cargo or mail on air services to, from or within the territory of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My proposal is to take out the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; before the territory of the State&rdquo;, just the word &ldquo;to&rdquo; on the basis that it is inappropriate for us to be seeking to keep up the level of fares of people who want to come into this country.  There may be some argument &mdash; I do not agree with it &mdash; for keeping up the level of fares in respect of people flying out of the country or within the country &mdash; again I do not agree with it but it could be argued &mdash; but there is absolutely no justification for deliberately keeping up, as this subsection will, the fares of people flying to the country. Unhappily for all of us, we know the appalling state of the tourist industry here at the moment and for some time past, and it seems to be getting worse rather than better.  We hear that half the hotels in the country are up for sale and that things are pretty diabolical.  There are many constraints on tourism in this country, not least the high prices, the high rates of taxation and so on, but one constraint is the high fares into the country. I would seek to take away the right of the <Col N="1218" /> Government here to keep up fares of people flying into the country.</P>
    <P>I think of my days when I was involved in tourism and about the efforts that used to be made, for example, in the US and throughout Europe to get people in here cheaply and which had to be given up because it just could not be done, and the tens of thousands of people who would willingly visit this country as tourists if they could get here at a reasonable price. Of the many experiences I had at that time when I was in tourism I remember attending in 1980 or 1981 a lunch in Chicago for travel agents, particularly those who had an interest in the Irish market, and I was subjected to a barrage of complaints from them.  I heard all the usual stories about the difficulty of getting into Ireland, the way charters were blocked and so on, and, when you finally get in, the extraordinarily high prices that are charged.  At that lunch one travel agent produced brochures from his firm which showed that the cost of a holiday in Sydney was about £10 less than the cost of a holiday for a similar period in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Who would want to go to Sydney?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mind going there now and I am sure the Deputy would be happy to do so.  I spent some very happy days in Sydney once.  We are in Chicago at the moment.  We are looking east and west and we see Sydney and the sun shining there and we see Ireland one-third of the distance and the sun perhaps not shining, and the price is roughly the same.  That is not coincidence.  It is not just bad luck.  It is due to the consistent regulatory policies that have been applied here by the Department of Communications and their predecessors, and the loss to this country has been enormous. It has become common now, among those in Europe particularly who seek to have the present very unsatisfactory state of airline regulations in Europe improved, to have a policy of single approval, a policy of approval by the originating State.  That in Memorandum <Col N="1219" /> No. 2 of the Commission has been criticised widely in Europe for not going far enough, but I see it as being adequate for our purposes in this matter.</P>
      <P>Would it not be of great benefit to us if people from the US and particularly from Europe could fly here at the kind of levels that would be approved in their own countries?  I do not mean simply by scheduled services.  I mean in particularly by chartered services.  I drew attention in the House before to the fact that charters from Britain to Ireland are almost negligible, are less than 1 per cent of what comes from Britain to Ireland by air, although more than 50 per cent of passengers flying out of Britain fly by charters. From Germany there are hardly any charters.  Occasionally there are charters but they do not seem to last.  They are not enouraged at this end.  The position is that same from other countries.  Charters are very rare except from the United States and even those are much more limited than we would wish to see.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it would be entirely compatible with Memorandum No. 2 of the European Commission that the amendment should be accepted, that the words &ldquo;to the territory of the State&rdquo; should be deleted and that access should be allowed to people who want to come here but who effectively are prevented from doing so by the high rate of fares. What I have said was borne out by the UK manager for Bord Fáilte, Mr. Joe Kennedy, in the course of a speech at a lunch in London last week.  In that speech, reported in last Sunday's issue of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, he said that there could be a bonanza in tourists coming to Ireland if there was a £90 fare freely available without restriction.  He said that tens of thousands of additional tourists would come here and he referred to the difficulty of access to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That bears out precisely the points I have been making.  The difficulty would be overcome if the amendment was accepted and if the British and Irish airlines were allowed to fly charters into Ireland at whatever rate the market <Col N="1220" /> would bear.  We must remember that eventually, through court action or otherwise, the Commission's proposals will be accepted and it is likely to happen that fares will only be regulated in a few years time by the country of origin.  We will not have two Governments having to agree as happens at present.  It would be forward looking if the amendment was accepted and if we were not dragged screaming against our will into reality in the late eighties.  It would be forward looking if we went out to sell our country and our airlines and try to fill them rather than trying to keep them operating as at present purely by protectionist policies which clearly will go out of date and, whether we like it or not, will be taken out from under us.</P>
    <P>The approach I have suggested is the proper one and I urge it on the Minister and on the House.  People who understand the problem of trying to get tourists into Ireland &mdash; who can understand it better than the UK manager of Bord Fáilte who was quoted at length in last Sunday's issue of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash; say that one of the major constraints is the problem of the cost of access.  If there was access at a reasonable cost those people tell us that a greater number of people would visit Ireland.  Unfortunately, I cannot find the exact quotation but I have no doubt that I have accurately represented what was said in that speech as reported in that newspaper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has been arguing against himself in this case. It is very endearing that he should have made the self-deprecating admission that when he was Minister responsible for tourism air fares were very high and the number of people coming into the country was not very high.  In those days Shannon was losing money because it was cheaper by far to go through London. Inflation was very high when he was in Government but it is now down to 5 per cent, below the EC average.  Air fares through Shannon are on average up to $100 cheapter than fares through London.  Shannon has returned to boom times, high profitability.  This has been its <Col N="1221" /> best year ever and that underlines the point I have been making, that the policies I have been pursuing since I became Minister have been correct.</P>

      <P>One of the things about being a Minister is that one gets blamed for everything that goes wrong but no credit for anything that goes right, and I am sure Deputy O'Malley experienced that many times in the past.  However, the fact is that Shannon is booming. Tourism from North America has grown in leaps and bounds in the past two years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is thanks to a number of factors but it should be remembered that there are different fares on the North Atlantic route.  Different airlines have filed different fares and some are considerably cheaper than Aer Lingus.  Those fares have been allowed. I cite those facts to undermine the arguments made by Deputy O'Malley about cartels operating to keep air fares up as if we did not know that cheaper air fares are better, provided such a policy does not clash with continuity of service.  After continuity of service the aim is to have cheaper air fares.  Arguing about the level of air fares when there is not an air service is irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible for us to forego our control on fares because we would be in breach of international obligations under bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements. It is required that, following discussions between states, there should be control of air fares in both directions.  It is not hard to imagine all the distortions that would arise if it was only the country of <Col N="1222" /> origin that controlled air fares.  We could jack-up the air fares out of the country if we did not want people to go abroad on holidays.  A similar policy could be pursued by the American and British and that would affect us.  That danger of such a policy is that countries may increase fares because more Governments are not exactly encouraging their citizens to go abroad on holidays.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legal consideration I mentioned in relation to our bi-lateral and multi-lateral commitments, there is a more substantive reason why the amendment cannot be accepted and recent events bear out that belief.  Under Deputy O'Malley's scheme the Irish authorities would not be able to exercise any control on fares into Ireland.  That could have very serious implications for Irish tourism.  I should like to remind the House that in the past two years I have turned down significant increases in fares from Britain although those increases had been approved by the British Civil Aviation Authority.  I used that power to reduce those fares.  That is what I have done persistently done since I became Minister.</P>

      <P>There are fares advocated for different services on different routes which have to have the approval of both administrations.  Call it cartel or what you like, that application sought approval of a 10 per cent increase from the British authority.  I would not give my consent and forced it down to half that. I have used that power consistently not to jack up fares, as Deputy O'Malley erroneously keeps saying, but to keep them down.  I defy him to challenge that statement.</P>

      <P>With regard to keeping the fares below the level approved by the British, I disapproved of the increases because I could not believe that such increases would be in the interest of Irish tourism and I insisted on a reduction, but that was not the only case.  I insisted on smaller increased in fares from Paris, having received strong representations from the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to use my powers.  I also had representations from Bord Fáilte in that regard.  Deputy O'Malley is saying we should throw that power out of the window and leave it to the British, the American and the French to decide what to charge on flights into Ireland?&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I might also add that if at any stage, for example in the context of an EC initiative, it become opportune to adopt a country of origin approval regime, or some other liberalisation measure, the Bill as at present drafted through sections 2 and 3 when read together, gives me full flexibility to <Col N="1224" /> accommodate changes.  I hope, therefore, that on reflection Deputy O'Malley will agree to withdraw his amendment.  I could not possibly be in the interests of tourism which he has gone to such lengths to argue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this discussion with interest, in particular the reference to the Belfast route.  I want to confirm whether the Minister said earlier that British Midland had lost £2 million on that route.  Was that this year or was it an overall loss which that airline made? If that is so, I cannot see how a service could be kept up to Belfast.  The inevitable end to that kind of loss &mdash; for some time we have sustained the transatlantic route by subsidy, although we call it something different, &mdash; for an ordinary private company responsible to shareholders and so on seems to be pointing one way, to bankruptcy only.  Technically it is an internal flight but ideologically we deny that.  If the Minister renounced any power that he had in regard to flights such as that, I would be quite dubious about British Airways.  As I said earlier in the debate, I got a very bad vibration from British Airways' involvement in the Laker collapse, which involved the British and US Governments at one stage before a decision was taken to compensate Laker.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick West)</i> on Tuesday, 3 December 1985:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to request the Board of Siúicre Éireann Cpt., to review its decision to close Erin Foods at Mallow, County Cork in view of the loss of employment involved and the serious consequences for the whole horticultural industry and the future of food processing in this country. </P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. D. Moynihan Mr. D. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh an dúnadh síos seo i Malla agus i dtaobh na fostaíochta atá á tabhairt ag an monarcha seo, Erin Foods.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Rialtas gach aon chabhair gur féidir a thabhairt chun an fhostaíocht sin a choimeád ar siúl i gCorcaigh thoir-theas agus i gCorcaigh thiar-thuaidh.  Os rud é go bhfuil an oiread sin daoine dífhostaithe sa dúiche seo, féachann sé an-olc ar fad dúinn go bhfuilimid chun 164 daoine eile a chur as obair ansin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closure of Erin Foods would be a disaster for Mallow which has the highest unemployment rate in the country with 1,300 people already out of work.  Erin Foods are a valuable industry for employment-starved north Cork.  Over the past few months this area has lost 400 to 500 jobs with cutbacks in Golden Vale, Charleville, and the closure of Apple Computers in Millstreet.  If Erin Foods close it will be an economic disaster for the whole area and especially for the 164 people whose jobs are threatened.  The Coalition are doing this in the name of bookkeeping but they will be the losers. If they have any consideration for these <Col N="1229" /> unfortunate people, some with large families, they will realise that they are all entitled to a job and a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>The cost of closing Erin Foods would be greater than the cost of keeping them open.  The cost of closure will be almost £9 million and running costs over the past three years were £2.5 million.  Another year of production would have allowed them to recoup their losses.  We should also remember that the interest on loan repayments is the main loss factor at present. Financial losses at Erin Foods have been diminishing in the past number of years and there is no doubt that with proper management the factory were and are on their way to profitability.  This would have been the first year that Erin Foods operated to full capacity and it is a shame not to give them a chance.  If we want to progress in agriculture we should plan ahead and the closure will have a damaging effect on the economy because £1 million worth of dried vegetables will have to be imported annually.  Surely the Government are not stupid enough to allow this to happen after all their talk about imports and buying Irish?  Closure would mean that we will import many goods which could be produced here and to close the factory would be a backward step.</P>
    <P>This factory paid £4 million in wages annually and farmers benefited to the extent of £1.8 million.  If they can put that amount into the north Cork economy they deserve to survive.  Agriculture is our greatest resource industry and is a natural asset.  Food processing has a great potential and any factory engaging in it should not be threatened with closure.  It will be a scandal if we increase our imports of vegetables and horticultural products further, at a time when the Government are setting up the National Development Corporation at a cost of £300 million to create jobs by exploiting natural resources.  Obviously, Government Departments are pulling in opposite directions.  We call on the Government to request the board of Erin Foods to rescind their decision.  I call on the <Col N="1230" /> Government Deputies for Cork North and Cork West to say publicly if they agree with the board's decision to add so many people to the already unacceptable level of unemployment in north Cork.  If they agree let them take the blame but if they do not it is their duty to vote against the motion.  Now is the time for these Deputies to stand up and be counted so that we will present a united front to save jobs.  We must not add to the suffering of these people.  For God's sake keep Erin Foods open.</P>
    <P>There are 1,500 post-primary pupils in Mallow and seven leaving certificate classes will have completed their course next year.  Erin Foods would give employment to some of those people and the young people would like to think they could get a job at home.  I again call on the board of Erin Foods to rescind their decision and to keep the factory open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with sadness and regret that we have this motion before the House tonight.  The closure of five factories by the Sugar Company in recent years, Tuam potato plant, the plant in Carlow, Fastnet, Mattersons' Canning and East Cork Foods, all under Fianna Fáil Governments, and now the threat of closure over Erin Foods, Mallow, raises fundamental questions about our food industry.  Certain questions must be asked of politicians and management. Why have the management not changed the product line in the last 25 years?  Why have they not invested in new machinery? When the workers implemented the rationalisation policies asked of them why did this not suffice?  Why are the workers always knocked on the head while the management seem to get off scot free?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Midleton plant closed in 1983 the problems were identified as those of products and machinery which were out of date, and bad marketing.  I am mesmerised and baffled that two and a half years later the same problems have been identified in Mallow.  They tell us that the product and the machinery are out-of-date and that the marketing strategy has not been good enough.  What has been <Col N="1231" /> happening for the past few years?  Why is this all coming to a head now?</P>
    <P>The workers in Erin Foods in Mallow have more than played their part.  Many of these people have been with the company for the past 25 years and have given good and loyal service.  When they were asked to implement rationalisation plans they co-operated.  The evidence of their perfect record is that there has not been a strike in Erin Foods, Mallow, since the factory was founded 25 years ago.  Surely that record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the workers are the people who will suffer.  In this case that involves 164 workers, their wives and children.  Many of them are in their mid-forties, a critical age so far as employment is concerned.  Where will they find alternative employment?  Mallow and the north Cork area suffer from a grave unemployment problem.  The unemployment figure for Mallow town alone is 1,530 and by adding another 164 there will be nearly 1,700 unemployed.  Mallow is an area that is designated 40 per cent for industry but it is obvious that the percentage should be increased to 60 per cent and I ask the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to do that.  It is very important for the future of Mallow.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out by the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, students from seven leaving certificate classes will leave school this year.  Where will they, their fathers, brothers and sisters get work? We must not forget the consequences of unemployment.  There is no substitute for work in our lives.  We are conditioned to work and we find it difficult to cope when we find ourselves without work.  The people in Mallow want work, not redundancy payments or social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the history and the decision of the Irish Sugar Company to close Erin Foods in Mallow.  In the past few years there have been losses and this year the loss was £700,000.  That is not only a turnover loss.  Interest rates and overhead losses are also involved and some of those overheads have been <Col N="1232" /> incurred in Dublin.  The Sugar Company must give Erin Foods, Mallow, a capital injection because it is their industrial base.  Mallow has served the company well and has made many profits for them but they are now willing to let part of the workforce go on the dole queue.  I say to the company that they are unfair.  They know they should give Erin Foods, Mallow, a capital injection to allow it to become viable in the long run.  The Mallow area has a lot more in its favour than other areas.  People with the necessary skill are in the area.  It is an agricultural district and it has producers who have grown vegetables for a long time. In addition, it has a well-educated young population.  Other areas have not all these advantages and I ask the Sugar Company to take note of this.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Agriculture has found the action committee and members of Mallow UDC to be intelligent, rational and constructive.  He does not say that of all groups.  They have pointed out where solutions could be found.  What the people do not want is the door of the factory to be closed.  I appeal to the Minister at this late stage to see if the factory could be kept open.</P>
    <P>If all else fails, it is incumbent on all of us to make every effort to ensure that there is a vegetable plant in the Erin Foods complex in Mallow and that it will employ many people.  There is no point in thinking other jobs are available.  It is not as though Mallow people can go to Cork to find jobs because they are not available in the city.  Neither can they go to Fermoy because that town has an unemployment figure of 1,000.  Therefore, I make a last appeal for a capital injection for Erin Foods, Mallow, to make it a viable industry.  I believe it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers in Erin Foods, Mallow, who are in the majority members of my union, the ITGWU, are deeply concerned at the announcement by the board of CSET to close down the Erin Foods vegetable plant at Mallow with the loss of 164 jobs.  This is the latest <Col N="1233" /> in a series of closures which reflect the company's failure to maintain successfully viable vegetable processing operations in spite of the considerable and positive advantages which undoubtedly exist in this area of production.  Previously the company abandoned vegetable processing operations in Carlow, Midleton, Limerick, Skibbereen and Tuam.  In each of these areas there were Government promises of replacement factories, none of which has materialised to date.  According to the company, the current vegetable processing campaign is the final one and employment will be terminated at the end of the campaign at Christmas and early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>From being an industrial boom area some years ago, Mallow has declined to the point where it has the unenviable distinction of having the highest unemployment rate in the north Cork area.  Its mainstream industrial activity, namely, dairying, is rationalising.  Golden Vale are implementing a redundancy programme with a loss of 230 jobs and the Ballyclough Co-op have shed some 200 jobs in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The population response to the industrial good times has produced a profile where one in three of the unemployed are under 25 years with little or no prospect of finding employment.  The labour force in Erin Foods is a comparatively youthful one with young families and extensive commitments.  In these circumstances the closure decision will have devastating consequences in human and family terms and the withdrawal of State investment with the abandonment of Erin Foods will represent a crushing blow to the local community.</P>
      <P>In his last review of the company's affairs, the chairman expressed confidence in the company's industrial and branded products achieving permanent viability from a sound base.  In Mallow there has been a continuous process of rationalisation and reorganisation involving product, working time and pay.  The Irish Transport Union and the workers in the company have co-operated fully in all that activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> The Mallow factory processes vegetables for industrial use and for its own branded products.  In the latter case the added value activity takes place in the Thurles plant.  The industrial product is mainly exported and this should be noted by the Minister.  Thus, national policy is doubly served, that is, in respect of exports on the one hand and import substitution on the other, not forgetting the considerable value of this activity at the level of the primary producers.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement, the ITGWU in particular, has long advocated the tremendous potential for wealth and job creation that lies virtually untapped in this section of agriculture. Indeed we believe that if Erin Foods did not exist they would require to be created as part of the process of exploiting this extremely valuable resource.  With the advent at long last of the National Development Corporation, Erin Foods represent an essential vehicle for the development of this vast potential.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, having regard to Government policy and commitment to the development of our natural resources in the interest of the first national priority of job creation, the decision by CSB Teo is impossible to justify and must be rescinded.  The closure will generate massive negative costs for the State.  In the company's announcement of closure, costs of over £40 million, including a projected £1 million for imported processed vegetables, have been mentioned.  There is, of course, in addition, the costs of social welfare and the loss of tax revenues and the depressing costs in human terms for those immediately affected, their families and their communities.</P>
    <P>In response to the campaign to keep the plant open, which was launched by the workers at local and national level, I am strongly urging the Minister to use his good offices to reverse the closure decision.  This is an ideal project for inclusion under the umbrella of the NDC so that the company can be kept going and the workers kept in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting <Col N="1235" /> the Government amendment to the motion now before the House I want to say at the outset how regrettable to me as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture with responsibility in the area of food and horticulture the closure or discontinuation of any food activity would be.  As a Deputy representing the area affected by this decision and including in my constituency both those involved in the factory operation and those who supply products to the factory, I fully appreciate that there are those in the Mallow area who must now be experiencing a deep sense of trauma and anxiety, and I sympathise with them in their present difficulties.  As the Minister said last night, it is particularly unfortunate that the closure should occur in an area of Cork which has suffered other closures and job losses.  Therefore, in discussing this problem I would like to ensure that as far as possible Deputies and the people of the area, particularly those directly affected by the closure, are made fully aware of the background and circumstances of this decision to close and will be kept up to date on the possible more hopeful developments currently taking place.  This is not a time for recrimination but for co-operation and working together for progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would first of all like to assure Deputies of my continuing commitment to vegetable based enterprises in County Cork. Indeed, it is now almost a quarter century since I was involved in the setting up of East Cork Foods at Midleton, an operation in which the Sugar Company also became involved.  I gave my support and assistance to the venture and we succeeded in getting together in record time what amounted to a very substantial amount of the capital required to get the ECF under way.  Other enterprises have failed and have been forgotten but when the East Cork Foods closure was announced and when I had come into office, the closure having been acceded to by the previous administration.  I immediately set about getting a rescue package for the Midleton area and after considerable effort and negotiations with <Col N="1236" /> various potentially interested parties we got an alternative operation going.  This had not happened with any previous closure, and I can assure Deputy O'Keeffe that Midleton has not gone into oblivion. Although it is early days yet, the operation in Midleton has proved quite successful. We have some 2,000 acres of crops, an efficient factory and, most important of all, a ready market for the produce.  We can in fact readily learn from the Midleton experience in our approach to Mallow.</P>
    <P>A major problem with Mallow is the scale and type of operation carried out there.  Deputies opposite have alleged that the equipment is old and technology out of date.  I would suggest that their knowledge is rather out of date.  The Mallow plant has some most up to date technology; it is the first food operation to produce no-cook products, but the company have been unable to achieve a satisfactory price volume market combination which would make this type of operation viable.</P>
    <P>There are, however, other types of operation which could be viable and I have been looking into the possibilities for some time now.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to point this out to Deputies Noonan, O'Keeffe and Reynolds and any other Deputies opposite who believe that one should wait for the evil day and then cry loudly but do nothing.  I have not cried although I have every sympathy for those affected by the closure.  In fact it is because of my appreciation of their position that I have been doing something &mdash; I have been particularly active in pursuing the possibility of a new arrangement for Mallow. In doing this my first priority has been to ensure that there is a ready market for the product.</P>
    <P>It is no good whatever producing something for which there is no market or for which the market available is not such as to allow for a viable operation.  One first has to identify the market and then get an operation under way which will meet the requirements of that market.  I believe the scene is now set for such an <Col N="1237" /> operation, but if it is to be successful it will need the co-operation and support of all those involved.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for sniping or making irrelevant but smart debating points.  It is a time when there is a need for everyone to work together to get an alternative operation off the ground and to make a success of it.  This will require the involvement of all, the relevant State agencies such as IDA and the National Development Corporation, the Sugar Company as current owner of the plant and property, the Mallow workers whose commitment to any new operation will be essential for its success, and the local growers to provide the basic input material.  Also required of course, is the involvement of a relevant marketing company.  This is the essential element which I am pursuing.  Even at this stage I can report I am quite confident that a viable alternative activity can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Another point raised by the Opposition relates to the high level of food imports coming into the country.  The Minister has already commented adequately on this and pointed out that in a free trade situation it is the consumer in this country who determines the amount and type of product imported.  In the case of what are statistically classified as food imports it is quite clear that a very large proportion of this £800 million consists of animal feeding stuffs and that the customer for this product is the very person who is responsible for the agricultural product on which our huge food export business is based.</P>
    <P>One of the principal reasons why such levels of feeding stuff imports take place is a direct reflection of the very high degree to which our agricultural industry is based on the output of livestock and livestock products generally especially cattle, beef, milk and dairy products.</P>
    <P>I will reply briefly to some of the points made by Deputies.  I wish to congratulate them on their dignified, constructive approach to this matter.  The Horticultural Development Group were referred to and it was said they had gone into oblivion.  That organisation made a <Col N="1238" /> number of very good suggestions which are being acted on, such as the setting up of a national potato co-operative.  This has been set up with a marketing arm. Evidence of its effectiveness will be seen as it grows from strength to strength.</P>
    <P>Last week we set up a national vegetable horticultural co-operative, again with the help of the farming organisations and ACOT, in order to bring some <i>rationale</i> into the market.  For far too long we have been growing things and just hoping we could sell them.  Of course the right approach would have been to go into the supermarkets, find out what products people are buying and produce them. Thanks again to the recommendations of the national horticultural committee we have decided to grant aid the glasshouse industry.  Many of the food imports we have been talking about come about because the glasshouse owners were not able to heat their premises and we were consequently importing.  Our grant aid is for the conversion of heating from oil to solid fuel.  These grants are being taken up.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the fallacy of imports.  Most of our imports are composed of off season produce such as tomatoes and peppers.  We can do much in that regard and I suggest that Mallow is the kind of place where it could be done, as was pointed out last evening.  We have a big climatic advantage on the south coast but we are not taking full advantage of it.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for food production, my responsibility is to knuckle down and try to do something about Mallow.  This I am prepared to do, but if I am to do it I will need the co-operation of everybody, Members of the House, those who are working in Mallow and the growers there.  We need the co-operation of everybody.</P>
    <P>I have been around for a long time.  I have been growing crops for East Cork Foods for 25 years without a break.  I know something about the problems of the company.  Neither in the case of East Cork Foods nor in the case of Erin Foods has there been any inherent problems in the factories nor in relation to growers. <Col N="1239" /> So far as Midleton is concerned we were lucky to have succeeded in attracting an overseas company to become involved there, admittedly in a small way, but that involvement has convinced me that we have the best pea growing land in the world.  That company were so pleased that they are now considering further development in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the Mallow plant and East Cork Foods not succeeding was our failure to gain access to the market place.  Our own market is pitiably small, so small that one small plant would flood it.  Therefore, we must concentrate on exports.  The horticultural market in the UK is very much a closed shop.  Our weakness was always that we were depending on brokers and the very haphazard type of arrangements when we put our crops into the ground.  This is not sufficient because these are high cost crops and we must know whether at the end of the day we will be able to sell them, and if so, what prices we can command for them.  We were always prepared to settle for modest profits and that was important.  I have been having discussions with a company who have a big share of that market and, with the help of everyone concerned, we hope to have that sort of involvement in a new operation.</P>

      <P>For that achievement we need the help of the IDA and, possibly, the help of the National Development Corporation but, more than anything else, we need to take a hard look at the whole food market.  Ten years ago in Sainsbury's in London or in any of our supermarkets one would hardly find a fresh vegetable, but the swing now is back to fresh vegetables, to chilled vegetables or to vegetables with a long shelf life. That is the area we should grow for.  It is one in which Mallow would have a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in waiting around for something to happen.  The time is opportune.  I have much less time in relation to Midleton because in the <Col N="1240" /> month of March I had to go out seeking growers.  Fortunately I was successful to that extent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to come to that, but I am not being given an opportunity to develop the point.  What is important in regard to Mallow is that in any type of horticultural operation there will be surpluses, products that will not be suitable for the fresh market.  In other words, there will be second and third grade products.  Consequently, it is inevitable that there should be a processing facility available so as to take up the slack.  If we organise in the area of horticulture we will need that sort of operation.  It would be very easy for this side of the House if they adopted the same attitude in regard to Mallow as Fianna Fáil adopted in regard to the many closures over which they presided.</P>

We are prepared to do our part in bringing that about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down this motion because we are witnessing another sad saga in the continued demise of our vegetable processing industry.  In 1983, in the same constituency East Cork Foods and Midleton closed down.  I grant that the Minister did Trojan work and managed to get some substitution, but at that time worry was expressed about the future of Erin Foods in Mallow.  Those doubts were dispelled and we were told there was no fear of Erin Foods in Mallow being in trouble.  Yet two short years later, here we are.</P>
      <P>For 164 workers and their families this will be a bleak Christmas and their foreseeable future will also be bleak.  The impending closure will change the lives of all connected with Erin Foods, and not for the better.  As has been stressed time and time again by speakers on both sides of this House, the number unemployed in Mallow town and the region is approximately 3,000 at the moment.  As has been stated, many school leavers will be coming on the market in the near future, and now we will be adding the people who are working in Erin Foods and ancillary industries and the unemployment number will be greatly increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With Deputy Barry I must call for a review of the grant system, not only in disadvantaged areas but in areas like Mallow which is also disadvantaged, and consideration should be given to increasing the grant to 60 per cent.  Not only will the effect of this closure be felt by the immediate workers but the whole area will be affected, psychologically as well <Col N="1244" /> as economically.  Farmers will lose one of their options and in this era of quotas &mdash; milk quotas, grain quotas and beef problems &mdash; farmers will not have a market for peas and will have difficulty in finding alternative paying projects.  It is estimated that spending power in the area will be reduced by around £3 million and this will have a devastating effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the closure of the factory was announced was particularly callous, especially in the light of the chairman's statement less than 12 months ago. When reviewing the food operation he said that an ultimate decision must not be reached until after the most careful evaluation.  The results of such an evaluation have not been made public and I call on the Sugar Company to give a detailed statement on their reasons for closing Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>We were told last night by the Minister that losses of £800,000 were sustained in 1983, £500,000 in 1984 and the projected loss of £1 million in 1985.  It is not unknown, especially where there is a group of companies involved that figures can be played around with to give the desired result.  I do not think it is any secret that the board of the Sugar Company were anxious to divest themselves of the food division and over the past number of years they have proceeded to do this.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the closure of East Cork Foods it became clear that head office costs &mdash; for the St. Stephen's Green office &mdash; contributed enormously to the overruns.  Although I do not have the figures, I have been led to believe that a sizeable amount of head office costs is also included in the accounts of Erin Foods &mdash; this cost is for marketing.  When we were discussing the Midleton operation, it was accepted by most people that marketing was being done from the central office in Dublin and that many people there seemed to be out of touch with what was happening on the ground. I thought they would have seen reality at that stage and changed their plan of action, but this did not happen.  I attribute <Col N="1245" /> this closure to the desire in head office to get rid of the food processing section at all costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the situation internationally in the food processing business, and particularly in the industrial food processing sector, is one of intense competition.  This is true of all businesses but when we look at the response of senior management, the decision makers, over the years to the development of Erin Foods in Mallow those responsible for this closure can be identified.</P>
    <P>Over the past 25 years there has been little or no capital investment to re-equip the factory to meet the changing demands of the times.  The market for dehydrated vegetables is out of date and it was known over the past year or so that demand has been for fresh vegetables, but no attempt was made to channel into that market.  In not doing so I have no doubt head office believed that in the longer or shorter term the company would make losses and that would give them a cast iron excuse for closure.</P>
    <P>Many years ago a large international firm &mdash; Heinz &mdash; joined with Erin Foods and struck up a very favourable relationship. They identified and got into the market but at a certain stage they departed and I believe it was then that Erin Foods lost out.</P>

      <P>The cost to the State of the closure of this plant in the coming year will be in the region of £5 million, and will continue at £1.5 million per annum after that.  We have been told of the projected loss of £1 million for 1985 <Col N="1246" /> but account should be taken of the exceptionally bad summer and allowance should be made for it.  Would it not make more sense to pump some capital in to enable the company to update, to review their marketing strategy and to set up a new marketing and management structure and not close the place down?  If one breaks up an institution and disperses the workforce it is very hard to get it back on an even keel.  If the management were restructured in the light of marketing and so on, it would be a recipe for keeping this business going.  Substantial import substitution will be necessary, contrary to what the Government are preaching daily.  We have been listening to what this Government will do about imports of fruit and vegetables for the past three years and in this case words are speaking louder than actions.</P>

      <P>I and a delegation from my party visited the fruit and vegetable market in Dublin where we were sad to see so many foreign vegetables and so few Irish vegetables on display.  We must make an effort to make the indigenous vegetable industry successful and put a stop to this scandal.  The producers, who are the farmers, must accept that producing vegetables is not a pastime but a business.  They will have to produce quality goods and give a regular supply so that we can compete with foreign importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Corporation was proposed last night as a likely answer to the problem.  The Minister said that he had £300 million ready for investment. That is not true.  The £300 million is authorised share capital and the corporation has not got a brown penny at the moment to invest.  The Minister should acquire some of the £18 million which was voted as part of a larger amount, but not used by the Sugar Company in 1982 <Col N="1247" /> and use it to ensure that Erin Foods in Mallow will not close.  Deputy Barry said that the Sugar Company should pay the money into Erin Foods.  The House can be assured that the Sugar Company have no intention of putting money into Erin Foods.  It is up to the Minister to tell them to do so.  The Minister is where the buck stops.  It is up to the Minister to decide on the future of Erin Foods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate.  It is a matter of considerable regret that this motion has had to be put down for debate.  We have been discussing the serious plight of the processed vegetable industry and contributions from all sides of the House illustrate that there is a serious lack of commitment by the Government towards supporting the food processing industry.  When we examine the economy and look for development potential to generate national wealth and much needed jobs at a time when unemployment is increasing rapidly, the food industry comes immediately into focus.  At a time when the consumption of processed vegetables has been increasing rapidly, the processing industry has been in steady decline. Surely it is time for the Government to examine the situation.</P>
      <P>Because of changing attitudes towards diets and a greater emphasis on health foods a greater percentage of the household budget is being spent on both fresh and processed fruit and vegetables; yet the processed vegetable industry is in serious decline.  The Government cannot allow that situation to continue.  We cannot allow the tremendous potential for national wealth creation and invaluable jobs creation which exists in this industry to wither away without being utilised for the benefit of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Erin Foods has been a major processor of vegetables.  The closure of the Mallow plant marks the almost total cessation of the Sugar Company's involvement in the <Col N="1248" /> production and processing of vegetables. That is a sad commentary on the Government. We must see this closure in the context of an ever-increasing volume of food imports, in the context of a serious loss of spending power in the Mallow area and in the context of very high unemployment in the area.  Erin Foods provided invaluable employment.  Apart from the jobs involved in the plant, there were jobs on the farm and in the distribution and sales area.  Approximately 160 jobs have gone in the plant and perhaps up to 100 farmers are affected.  Are the Government prepared to allow this saga to continue without making some effort to consider the implications for everybody involved?  Are the Government prepared to give the necessary support to allow the plant to be kept open and to be put on a profitable footing again and are they prepared to give a real commitment to providing the necessary support for the vegetable processing industry?</P>
    <P>Where are the Governments' priorities in this matter?  Despite what the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, said earlier that there was not the amount of vegetable imports that some commentators would lead us to believe, when we examine the figures we see immediately that the import figures for fruit and vegetables are very significant and cannot be dismissed. If we have hundreds of millions of pounds worth of imports at a time when every effort must be made to ensure that wealth is kept in the country, it is surely an area which requires urgent attention.  It is not good enough for the Minister to tell us that it is not all that significant.</P>
    <P>In relation to fresh vegetables, there has been a considerable increase in the volume of imports.  I had a Parliamentary Question down last week to the Minister asking him if he was satisfied with the progress that has been made since he took office in the development of the horticultural industry generally in this country.  The replies I got were very unsatisfactory.  The measures taken to improve the situation were few and far between.  Those measures are very insignificant where very significant measures <Col N="1249" /> are needed to get the industry on a proper footing to bring the necessary cohesion and co-ordination into the marketing area to ensure that imports of fruit and vegetables will be stemmed where they can be stemmed and where a real industry can be developed, where national wealth creation and the significant number of jobs that can be created will be set in train immediately.</P>
    <P>I am asking tonight that the Minister for Agriculture or his Minister of State will tell us what measures they have in the pipeline to get the processed vegetable industry and fresh vegetable and fruit industry on a proper footing so that we can go out and tell those involved that there is a future for them.  Those involved in growing must yearly commit considerable resources, in certain instances, to high cost crops and must plan for the future.  If the Minister or the Minister of State could assure such people that they are concerned about their plight and that they will give them sufficient backing to allow them to develop their industry, to supply the needs of the consumer and to ensure minimum imports, that would be a very worthwhile step.  I am afraid over the past three years that sort of commitment and confidence boosting were not forthcoming for the industry.  It is time the Minister and his Minister of State got together a proper co-ordinated policy for the development of the horticulture industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the closure of Erin Foods in Mallow for a number of reasons.  Mallow has probably one of the finest work forces that could be put together.  They have technical know-how and skill unparalleled by any other group of people and we cannot allow this country to lose that skill.  We must make sure that there is some way, somehow, somewhere an opportunity to harness this skill and technical know-how.  When one speaks about vegetables and about the closure of the Sugar Company, one can speak about their history also, and it is extremely difficult to believe that, in a country such as ours with the climate and <Col N="1250" /> facilities we have a facility such as Erin Foods should close.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the decision to close Erin Foods in Mallow was not taken last week or the week before.  It was taken some years ago.  If you go back on the record you will find that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann made the first decision to get out of the vegetable industry in 1978 when the factory in Tuam was closed.  In 1980-81 the Carlow premises was closed as was Fastnet at that time.  Obviously, a careful decision was made that vegetable processing would not be part and parcel of the Sugar Company.  I believe that that section of the company was over managed and badly managed and that the workers on the ground had not the opportunity to make their knowledge and expertise available.</P>
      <P>The marketing of the products was totally unsatisfactory and as a result we have reached this stage.  The Minister, Deputy Deasy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, with their knowledge and acknowledgement of the position in Mallow whether with the IDA, the NDC or a combination of both, will bring in a new industry, be it private, semi-private or whatever, and the skills of the workforce will be harnessed once more.  I do not accept that in a country such as this we can allow that facility not to be developed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kirk mentioned the enormous amount of vegetables coming into this country.  Have we not got the vegetables and the marketing skills to present products in such a way that they are acceptable to the Irish housewife?  Maybe we are all at fault in that area, politicians, workers, management, everybody.  I have no doubt that the amount of money made available to Erin Foods in Mallow in particular has been totally inadequate.  The facilities for picking the peas out in the field have been antiquated and some of the machinery in the company has not been changed for years.  In effect the work force did not contribute to the situation they are in now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management were and are wrong in this case, and I do not say that lightly. <Col N="1251" /> Considerable amounts of vegetables are imported and we have no one but ourselves to blame for that.  There is no point in saying that one or other group is wrong.  We have failed as a race to provide what the Irish housewife requires and is seeking.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, spoke about the national potato board.  Carrying that to its logical conclusion and providing a framework and facilities for the provision of vegetables, there must be a future for us to survive as a people.  There is no point in people across the House telling this Government that they are wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>With low interest rates and inflation, the environment is right to encourage outside interests to set up industries here.  In the Mallow area we have an expert work force and I have no doubt that a replacement industry will be found for the town.  Expressions of interest have been made about Mallow and I am convinced that whether under the aegis of the Sugar Company or the NDC we will get an industry.  I do not wish to see Erin Foods closing in the town and my heart goes out to those who may lose their jobs.  However, I am convinced that the efforts of Deputies Deasy and Hegarty will not go unrewarded.  They are committed to Mallow where we have all the necessary facilities to expand the industry once more.  For too long we permitted companies that did not have proper knowledge or commitment to <Col N="1254" /> remain in operation.  That has been arrested.  It is because of wrong decisions down the years that we have to face this sad decision.</P>
      <P>I am supporting the decision of the Government because at the end of the day it will be the correct one.  It is preferable to support the Government tonight rather than putting off the evil day for six months or until after the next general election.  We have an opportunity to obtain a replacement industry and if our efforts bear fruit the workers in Erin Foods can look forward to the future with considerable confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní mór dom cuidiú leis an rún atá molta aréir ag mo chairde ar an dtaobh seo den Teach and say that I totally reject the Government's amendment, unlike the last speaker.  I want to underline that I do not support the Government's amendment.  Our motion which has two elements in it deals specifically with the position in the Erin Foods factory in Mallow and mentions the serious consequences for the horticultural and food processing industries.  There can be no doubt that a new approach to the development of food processing is needed.  There are many reasons why the industry has not kept pace with demand and why it is not making the progress it should.  There are many factors inhibiting the development of that industry.  However, the cost of energy and communications is causing serious problems for the food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of technology on the development of new products and on food processing can be considerable.  The application of micro-electronics and biotechnology is expected to grow rapidly in the remaining years of this decade and we should address ourselves to those matters. The ability of the food manufacturing industry to use new technology is the function of the scientists and technologists working in such firms.  As far as I can ascertain, the food industry recruited about 60 new graduates in science and technology annually in recent years, while the chemical and electronic industries <Col N="1255" /> recruited about four times as many. That is an indication of our approach to the food industry.  In our RTCs and universities we are training and educating scientists and technologists for such work.  Are we to allow their skills to drift off somewhere else and not be used for the benefit of our own industry?</P>
    <P>The food industry recruits about one-fourth of the number of science and technology graduates who leave our third level institutions compared with the chemical and electronic industries.  There is a direct relationship between investment in highly skilled technological manpower and the capacity of the food processing industry to expand rapidly through the development of new products and processing.  Current difficulties should make us more determined to create favourable conditions for the development of a thriving food processing sector.  However, it is important to point out that conditions here will not encourage investment in any industry, including the food industry.  The Government should be addressing themselves to that problem.  We cannot get people to invest in our industries and that is clear when one considers the limited amount of money that has been contributed to the trust funds for industry.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater co-operation between the food processing industry and agriculture.  There must be greater co-ordination between those related activities.  Those in the processing industry hold the view strongly that the Government must reflect the changed emphasis that has been forced on them by market development and changes in EC policies.  No single Minister has a clear mandate to promote the development of the food industry.  Food manufacturers have to relate to a series of Government Departments and a large number of State agencies.  The absence of a co-ordinated approach, making due allowance for the importance of processing, is a significant constraint on the development of the industry.  The Ministers responsible must address themselves to the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> A single Government Minister would have responsibility for the co-ordination of Government policy at any particular time regarding all aspects of the food industry, but placing particular emphasis on creating the conditions of adding value profitably to this country.  That we are not doing at this time and we must address ourselves to that aspect.  I want to emphasise for Ministers and Members of the Government and everybody else who wants to take note, that we must create conditions which can be met by the majority of firms in the food sector.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Government White Paper on Industry published in July 1984.  In chapter 7.4 it is indicated that a group of Ministers of State &mdash; Foreign Affairs to be the chairman, from Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, two people, Agriculture, two people, Fisheries and Forestry, one person &mdash; are to review the involvement of Government agencies in the food industry.  They were sanctioned to engage a person of international experience to help them.  The urgency was indicated at that time and the situation was identified, but the evidence so far of any action by this group is not apparent to me.  If it is apparent to somebody else, I should like to know about that.  I could justifiably say that this group of Ministers of State, without being derogatory to them in any sense, and the person with international experience have dithered, reminding us of Nero fiddling while Rome burned.</P>
    <P>In chapter 1 it is stated very clearly:</P>
    <P>The state of the Government finances does not allow for any real expansion of expenditure on job creation.</P>
    <P>Therein lies the message from this Government.  It was initially hoped to have a processing plant in every county in Ireland, but this ambitious aspiration was never realised.  It is well to note that after M.J. Costello stepped down as General Manager of the Irish Sugar Company and Mr. Tony O'Reilly came on the scene, the latter cut back operations and consolidated and did deals with people. He did not take risks.  His deal with Heinz <Col N="1257" /> prevented Erin Foods from being independent in marketing.  Vegetable consumption across Europe is on the increase, but our acreage has declined dramatically.  The lesson of Erin Foods is not that food processing is impossible, it is that if one approach fails another should be tried.  If necessary, links with larger multinationals should be forged, but it is important to ensure, from the experience we have gained in the past, that all the benefit is not on one side.</P>
    <P>Having dealt briefly with the general aspect, I turn to the local matter of the plant at Mallow.  In addressing myself to the Minister's contribution last night I have to say that the weakness of it was epitomised by his reasoning &mdash; to allow Mallow plant to close because of closures in the past.  I do not accept that.  He also stated:</P>
    <P>Competition from external suppliers who supply to the Community is virtually free of levies and taxes, whose input costs are far lower and whose level of production is geared for a far wider international market.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that there are no barriers within the EC.  I want to know which it is.  Government policy should accord with what the Minister of State has said regarding levies and taxes.  Some effort should be made to redress any imbalances which he has discovered.</P>
    <P>On the possibilities of job creation in the development of food processing in all its aspects as an agriculturally based industry, we are, by the proposal of the board, diminishing our ability to create an outlet for the produce of the land.  The figure of £800 million of imports has been constantly referred to.  The Minister suggested last night that figure should be £200 million.  The £800 million of imports stands but there is £200 million worth of food imports which could and should be produced here and would be if we were committed to producing it.</P>
    <P>It has been said already in this debate that the workforce in Mallow are second to none.  There has never been an industrial relations problems at that plant.  I <Col N="1258" /> ask both Minister present and their colleagues to show faith in this work force, to change the stance indicated in the Minister's speech last night and again tonight. I ask them to accept the motion, save the plant and the jobs.  Direct job losses amount to 160 and the numbers of people affected with regard to suppliers and growers are not enumerated.  The value to the growers is £.8 million and there are the staffs and the service industries. The Government are closing the whole lot for £1 million and that is the value of the produce to be supplied to Thurles in the event of the closure of the Mallow plant.  I pose the question: &ldquo;From whence do you get that £1 million worth of produce that you will direct to Thurles?&rdquo;.  The cost of the closure is given as £3 million to pay for more redundancies.  Wages at present going into the economy in Mallow would be £1.5 million per year. At the eleventh hour of the Coalition Government, I appeal to them to change from the hallmark of their term of administration of closures, liquidations, increasing unemployment and a depressed economy.  I ask the Government to request the board immediately to defer closure.</P>
    <P>Mallow down through the years was a boom town, based on agriculture.  With close to 1,400 people now unemployed, that is not the natural order of things for that town.  It is becoming like all the other locations up and down this country as long as this Government stay in power.  I ask what of the remaining equity due to the Mallow plant of £18 million?  Is it not true that the £240,000 overhead charge is related to the headquarters?  Is it not true that the research and development charge of £60,000 on the Mallow plant is not a fair assessment of the amount due from that plant?  Is it not true that losses were generally kept to £1 million per year during the seventies in Erin Foods?  In the year 1983-84 the losses there were said to be £.25 million as against £1.5 million for the year 1982-83.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Courts Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for an increase from 14 to 15 in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court for a limited period; an increase from 12 to 15 in the statutory maximum number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court; and an increase from five to six in the number of Circuit Court judges permanently assigned to the Dublin circuit.</P>
      <P>The temporary increase in the number of High Court judges, as provided for in section 1 of the Bill, is necessary to clear up a backlog of High Court jury actions which is beyond the capacity of the existing complement of judges to clear within an acceptable time.  The delay now involved for litigants between the &ldquo;setting down&rdquo; of a jury action and the trial ranges from ten months at Dundalk to 12 months at Dublin and elsewhere.  It has been as long as 30 months at Cork, but following special steps taken by the President of the High Court, including extra court sittings, the delay has been reduced to some 26 months and is expected to be reduced to at most 22 months in 1986.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of these actions arise from road traffic accidents and delay in these cases can result in severe hardship and stress for the plaintiffs involved. Deputies will be aware that there are other delays to be added to the ones I have mentioned.  In many cases a substantial period may elapse before proceedings are &ldquo;set down&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware that in many cases the delays I have mentioned are not attributable exclusively to the non-availability of judicial time.  This is only one factor in a complex situation. Nevertheless, the Government have come to accept that if a substantial improvement is to be made in the present unsatisfactory situation, then, an extra judge will be needed and the present statutory restriction should be temporarily eased.</P>
      <P>I should make it clear, of course, that this is not a question of providing an extra judge for Cork or anywhere else.  When the extra judge is appointed, the question of his assignment to help with the overall arrears situation is exclusively a matter for the President of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last occasion on which an increase in the number of High Court judges took place was in March 1982, when the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1981, increased the number of ordinary judges from 12 to 14.  At that time it was thought that the increase, together with the enactment of <Col N="1267" /> the Courts Act, 1981, which provided <i>inter alia</i> for an increase in the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £2,000 to £15,000, as well as the giving of extra family law jurisdiction to the District and Circuit Courts, would arrest and contain the arrears in the High Court.</P>
    <P>This view has turned out to be only partially correct.  Following the coming into operation of the relevant provisions of the latter Act in May 1982, the volume of new business being entered in the High Court decreased substantially and it is expected that the existing number of High Court judges in the longer term will be adequate to deal with the reduced level of business.  However, there is still a substantial problem as regards the level of arrears which built up prior to the change in jurisdiction brought about by the Courts Act, 1981, there is no substantial spare capacity among the existing judges which could be utilised to make inroads into the arrears.  It is against that background that a temporary rather than a permanent increase in the High Court Bench was considered to be the best way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The maximum number of permanent ordinary judges of the Circuit Court authorised by statute, section 3 (a) of the Courts Act, 1981 is 12.  However, section 14 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, authorises the Government temporarily to increase that number whenever it appears to the Government that such a step is necessary to prevent the work of the Circuit Court getting into arrears either generally or in any particular circuit or circuits.  Successive Governments over the years have found it necessary from time to time to increase temporarily the number of Circuit Court judges to cope with the continuing growth in the business of that court.  At the moment the full complement of Circuit Court judges includes two &ldquo;temporary judges&rdquo;.  These appointments were necessitated by the continuing growth in the volume of court business.  The Government are satisfied that the business of the Circuit Court will continue to grow in the foreseeable future and that an additional judge to the existing <Col N="1268" /> complement of 15 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court, is needed.  The Government are also satisfied, and I am sure the House will agree with them in this, that is such circumstances it is unjustifiable that two judges should continue to hold office on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill provides for an increase of three in the statutory maximum number of ordinary Circuit Court judges.  I may add that it the intention of the Government that the two serving &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; judges be made permanent so that only one new appointment will arise as a result of this provision.</P>
    <P>The increase from five to six in the number of Circuit Court judges permanently assigned to the Dublin circuit recognises a need which has existed for some time to cope with the volume of business there.  This Bill is an important one from the point of view of the proper administration of justice and I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is an important Bill.  I wonder if the Minister will explain why a particular date was selected for inclusion in the Bill. I was disappointed there was no explanatory memorandum with the Bill, though whenever we inquire about this we are told it is a relatively short Bill which should be self-explanatory.  However, this Bill is complicated, and a brief memorandum would have been helpful which would indicate exactly what is being done and why 2 April 1987 was chosen.  Was that date chosen for a particular reason? Is it the date on which a judge will retire? The Minister did not deal with that in her speech and that was a little surprising.  Is it somebody's birthday or is the date on which, as I said, somebody will retire? Why was it necessary to present the measure in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took some trouble to explain why this is a temporary rather than a permanent arrangement.  The number of judges will be 15, and on 2 April 1987 it will revert to 14.  The Government had the option to make it <Col N="1269" /> 15, the upper limit.  Then, on certain occasions there could be provision for an additional judge for a limited period.  In the past judges have been appointed to head inquiries or tribunals, and judges have been taken out of areas temporarily. The Government could have decided that the maximum number would be 15 and that thereafter the Government of the day could decide whether posts should be filled as they arise.  That would leave that option to the Government of the day. This Bill proposes to create an additional post and to fill that post now.  I will not go so far as to suggest that the Government might be buying ahead, as it were, and making appointments in advance in this case, but the question arises, especially because of the way this is being done, as to why the figure should not be set at 15 now and then leave it to the Government of the day to decide whether posts should be filled.</P>
    <P>Presumably, it would not be possible to specify in relation to what timetable would be concerned.  I do not know whether the Minister expects to be in office after April 2 1987 but it would appear that the other approach would be more straightforward.  From here on I understand that retirements from the Judiciary will be very few at High Court level.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us something about this.  Presumably it is a factor in the provision of the April 2 1987 date.  I should like to hear the reason for the temporary nature of the provision.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary are criticised from time to time but very often the public do not appreciate the position in which a member of the Judiciary finds himself in terms of limitations of the court's jurisdiction and so on.  The presence of an effective and independent Judiciary is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. It represents the single most important protection for the citizen in dealing with the State or organised business.  This is a very important Bill and this is an important occasion.  There can be little doubt that we have been served well by the members of our Judiciary particularly in their independence and in their dedication to justice and equity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Nevertheless, the speed and effectiveness of the administration of justice has at times come in for widespread criticism. To the man in the street the courts appear antiquated in their surroundings and administration.  The Minister is asking the House to approve, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, the appointment of additional members of the Judiciary.  How many High Court and Circuit Court judges should we have? It seems that at the moment the Government consider the figure of 14 to be right but that for a time we need to have 15 and that after April 1987 we revert to 14.</P>
    <P>On what are the Government basing these figures?  Have we considered the whole system and how it is operating?  In recent years we have passed legislation enabling the number of High Court judges to be increased from eight to 15. The Minister mentioned the most recent increases.  At the same time, there has been a growing demand on the courts and on the Judiciary.  The volume of criminal and civil litigation has exploded and the demand for judicial tribunals has increased also.  These could be used in more circumstances because they have the support of all sides of this House and of the people generally and they can act very effectively as independent tribunals.</P>
    <P>We have no hesitation in approving the appointment of extra judges but we must ask whether this step is adequate or sufficient, or is it the principal priority at this time?  We must ask also who is attending to the reform of the courts?  Justice Keenan Johnston in Waterford District Court gave us a valuable insight into the maladministration of justice in his court when he wrote recently to the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism to point out the number and value of unissued fines.  These were estimated at 9,000 fines valued at £700,000. Since then it was discovered that the more up to date figure was 12,000 fines valued at £900,000.</P>
    <P>This led to the discovery that the figure for the Dublin District Court was 55,000 unissued fines valued at an estimated £2.1 million.  The overall figure for district courts is now estimated at not less than £4.25 million in unissued fines.  In my <Col N="1271" /> view Justice Keenan Johnston has created an important precedent and has done us all a valuable service.  The Judiciary are responsible under the Constitution for the administration of justice. How can they administer the law effectively if the Minister does not provide adequate support and administrative back-up?  What maladministration could the judges of the Circuit and High Courts reveal if they chose to put pen to paper? In matters of administration it seems that the Judiciary hold neither the sword nor the purse.  What support staff and backup services will the Minister provide for these new judges?  The Minister makes no reference to this in her speech tonight.</P>
    <P>Appointing a judge is like appointing a consultant to the hospital services.  In order to carry out his or her work adequately, a judge needs support staff. Will there be additional registrars, courtrooms and staff?  The Minister says that the provision is for a temporary period only, but will the necessary staff be provided in the short term and in the meantime will extra rooms be provided?  This would be part of the delivery of the whole service involved in the administration of justice.  The Judiciary have been complaining about the lack of such facilities especially in recent times.  The image of the courts is one of an institution where time has stood still or at least where time matters little.</P>
    <P>In a personal injuries claim there is often a long delay from the date of the injury to the hearing of the action.  Part of the delay is inevitable since the plaintiff must wait until the full extent of his or her injury is known.  This may take from weeks to years, depending on the medical prognosis.  Once the matter has been set down for trial there is still a long delay before a hearing.  The Minister gave some up to date statistics in relation to the kind of delay which can occur and we have all come across cases where the delays have been quite extensive and there is considerable complaint about them.  This waiting time has been reduced considerably over the last few years due to the efforts of successive Presidents of the <Col N="1272" /> High Court with the co-operation of the Bar, but it is still too long in some instances especially in the High Court.</P>
    <P>On the criminal side the bulk of the indictable crime is dealt with by the Circuit Court.  It would appear that from the date of arrest and charge to the date of preliminary examination and return for trial by the District Court a period of one to three months is not untypical.  I heard today of some which are longer than that. From the date of return for trial to arraignment before the Circuit Court the delay is on average six months, and from that date to a trial the period can vary between one and three months.  It would seem that from date of arrest to trial by the Circuit Court a period of eight to 12 months' delay is not unusual.</P>
    <P>There is obviously room for a critical examination of a system of criminal administration which involves delays of this order.  One of the specific causes of delay which has been publicly commented on by members of the Judiciary is the delay in producing books of evidence. Judges have been so frustrated with these delays that they have had to dismiss some serious criminal cases which caused considerable public comment, one a murder case and another a major robbery of substantial sums, as well as many others.  We brought this to the Minister's attention earlier but we got a general response that there was an embargo which affected him as much as anybody else and he was not prepared to make any exceptions.  The judges have become so frustrated with these delays that they had to dismiss some serious criminal cases.  This action finally embarrassed the Minister and the Government to such an extent that he was forced to provide the necessary staff for the Chief State Solicitors Office.  That happened very recently.  In fact, the staff may not even be there yet, but they were approved and presumably the appointments will follow directly.</P>
    <P>The administration of the law had first to be brought into disrepute with the public before the Government took the necessary action.  The public were very upset about the delay in courts and about cases being dismissed and then the <Col N="1273" /> Government took the necessary action.  I do not think this is good enough when the administration of law is involved.  The Government will have to make exceptions in certain instances when the embargo will not be applied.  We cannot have criminals going free because the Government are applying an inflexible embargo.</P>
    <P>Shortly before I left office I got the Government to make an exception and I got a Government decision that the mentally handicapped were a special case.  We had a number of units waiting to be occupied, but because of the embargo we could not take on extra staff. We had pared the staff to the minimum and had the voluntary help, but we could not do more unless the embargo was set aside.  As the record will show, that was done.  There is a similar problem now because units for the mentally handicapped are ready but they cannot get the staff.  In exceptional cases attention must be paid to the essential purpose and the constitutional requirements of administering the law effectively.  In this case public criticism of the courts was misplaced because of the Government's failure to provide necessary resources.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves who should reform the courts?  To whom should this reform be entrusted?  Do the Department of Justice have too much power and control over the administration of our courts and exercise too little of it?  The duty to &ldquo;administer justice&rdquo; is a constitutional duty imposed on the Judiciary by Article 34.1 which states that: &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution, and, save in such special and limited cases as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public&rdquo;.  Are the Judiciary satisfied that the administration of justice in our courts is modern, effective and appropriate to the needs of Irish citizens in 1985?  Our hospitals and health boards have modernised. Our local authorities and welfare organisations are modernising.  Why have the courts not kept pace?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Superior Courts &mdash; the High Court and Supreme Court &mdash;<Col N="1274" /> should be made truly independent by separating them as much as possible within the limits of practicability from the Department of Justice and the Executive. Should they not be granted a degree of administrative autonomy commensurate with or greater than the best of our semiState organisations?  Should they not be given this autonomy under the administrative control of the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, with a suitable budget?  The courts should be required to review their working practices and improve their efficiency.  They should be given the resources to do so. The Minister should now appoint a high powered working party to prepare a blueprint for the reform and modernisation of our courts system.  This should include the early reform of outmoded procedures and practices and the establishment of a modern system of courts appropriate to the Ireland of the nineties.</P>
    <P>All we are doing is appointing additional judges to the same system with all its problems and administrative difficulties.  At this time we should be taking steps to provide a truly modern administrative system for our courts and the Minister should set about doing this without delay.</P>
    <P>In considering the staffing and organisation of the courts there is now a clear priority for the setting up of a Family Court.  This would be an entirely new body with full and exclusive powers to deal with all types of family cases.  It would provide a suitable environment and a more uniform approach to the settlement of family disputes.  It would form part of the High Court and Circuit Court.  The designation of it would have to be considered, but it would certainly involve both the High and Circuit Courts. We have given a great deal of extra authority to the Circuit Court to deal with family law matters, and it is important that they be co-ordinated.  The Government should make provision for the appointment of a Judge to this Court now.  Surely this must rank as a priority if the Government have any commitment to the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. <Col N="1275" /> The Minister, in talking about the appointments, has not said anything about the provision of a Family Court.  I see this as one of the principal priorities at this time.  The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee has been available for some time and many individuals have put forward the need for a Family Court.  In my view, this need is self-evident and would be admitted by both sides of this House.</P>
    <P>Such a Family Court will require the appointment of judges specifically to deal with family law.  They would have to be selected on this basis and the criteria for selection should be set out in advance by the Minister.  Until a new approach is adopted in this area we continue to use outmoded and unsuitable court procedures to resolve family disputes.  It is time for a change if the Minister and the Government are serious about even beginning to solve the problems of marriage breakdown.  I am disappointed that the Minister is not taking this opportunity to establish such a court and to make the appointments to deal with the volume of business which will come into a Family Court.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable concern about sentencing.  Here we are appointing judges who, within a matter of a few weeks, will be sitting on the bench and sentencing offenders.  What will they know about the sentencing policies and procedures adopted in the Circuit Court around the country.  What advice and assistance will they get in bringing a reasonable amount of uniformity into the whole system?</P>
    <P>There has been considerable public disquiet about the sentencing of offenders convicted of criminal offences.  Concern has been expressed at wide variations in sentences imposed for similar crimes by different judges.  The circumstances of each case may be different and may require individual consideration, nevertheless, particularly in the case of drug offences and attacks on the elderly, there is a clear need for an updated policy on sentencing.</P>
    <P>Surely it is time to review the policies <Col N="1276" /> which are being adopted in sentencing. An independent Sentencing Commission could be established to review current sentencing policies and to provide a comprehensive and consistent statement of the purposes of sentencing and of the sentences available to achieve those purposes. I do not believe that exists anywhere here at present.  When we go to other jurisdictions we find that such statements for particular offences can be available. Thirdly, it could require judges to impose sentences in line with detailed guidelines established by the sentencing commission, for example in the case of drug offences and, fourthly, permit defence appeals of sentences which are above the guidelines.  Such a system could provide for greater consistency and uniformity of sentencing throughout the criminal court system.  Even the provision of proper reporting system to enable each judge to be familiar with sentences imposed by colleagues in similar cases would lead to greater standardisation.</P>
    <P>The presence of a modern reporting system available to members of the Judiciary would be very helpful in leading towards greater standardisation.  We suggested before that the President of the court can confer with the judges of that court from time to time.  Apparently that did not happen much in the past but it is happening to some extent now.  That is one measure which is helpful.  However, a proper reporting system could mean that, for instance, a judge of the Circuit Court should be given time to write up his judgment after his case is finished, perhaps even before the next case, so that the judgment is available.  Something which causes a great deal of confusion in the public mind and in the media is the question of getting a story that some reporter happened to give about the judgment when the judgment is not yet written and the question of when one gets a judgment in relation to a case, because of the work load.</P>
    <P>The UK Circuit Court uses a system of reporters to deal with the short term extra requirements.  I do not know if the Minister considered that procedure whereby senior counsel will be provided only to <Col N="1277" /> the Circuit Court and can then return to work within the court after a period.  If we had time to do more research we would probably find other systems of which we could avail.  The Minister may have considered that and may have views on it.  It is a possible alternative which should be evaluated in relation to its possible usefulness in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>In regard to tribunals, the Oireachtas relies heavily on the Judiciary to provide independent judicial tribunals to oversee and adjudicate on difficult and controversial matters of public conflict.  Their record in independence and integrity is outstanding by international standards. We can look to other countries not so far away where some of the tribunals have shown a lower standard of integrity than would be required of a judge in our jurisdiction. The recommendations where these were requested have proved to be incisive and widely accepted.  Both the Government and Opposition have been glad of their services and recommendations because these have been of value in considering further legislation.</P>
    <P>In recent times we had the O'Briain report and we know how much that report has influenced thinking in relation to the detention of prisoners in custody. We have had the Whiddy disaster report and the Stardust Tribunal report with its various recommendations in relation to safety standards in buildings.  We have had also a report on the Kerry Babies Case.  In this case the tribunal were not asked to make recommendations.  This was obviously specifically the intention of the Minister because we put down an amendment at the time and we asked that in that case they should provide recommendations. The Minister decided not to ask the tribunal for recommendations so recommendations were not provided.  In the other cases recommendations were requested and valuable recommendations were given.  We still await the setting up of the tribunal to inquire into the allegations of political interference with the Garda.</P>

      <P>I hate to interrupt as what the Deputy is dealing <Col N="1278" /> with is very interesting, but the Bill deals with an increase in the number of judges. The Deputy can make a passing reference to these matters.  I would ask the Deputy to look to this Bill to see what exactly is in it.  I am not trying to restrict the Deputy in his contribution but if the Deputy reads the Bill he will see that it is a very limited Bill which basically refers to the number of judges to be appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister and I remarked about administration and delays.  I have been entirely relevant and will continue to be relevant.  One of the reasons we could appoint a judge at this stage is to deal with this question of the allegations about interference with the Garda.  We are still awaiting the tribunal which is to inquire into these allegations of political interference with the Garda. The Government committed themselves in their programme for Government to setting up such a tribunal.  That was three years ago and so far the Government have not taken action.  Why has the Minister not gone ahead with the Government's pledge?  Why did the Minister undermine or set aside a promise solemly given by his Taoiseach?  He cannot have been short of a judge.  According to what is set out here, the Judiciary have been over-pressed and we are now appointing additional judges.  Surely they can take that matter into consideration.  From the additional judges appointed it should be possible, particularly between now and 2 April 1987 when there will be 15, as an upper limit rather than 14, to set up such a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Minister has not said so, maybe that is one reason why the Government want an extra judge for that <Col N="1279" /> period.  In 1982 the Fianna Fáil Government asked the President of the High Court to nominate a judge for such an investigation.  Before that could be implemented an election intervened and then it became the responsibility of the Coalition to renew this request.  So far they have failed to do so.  It appears that this Government and this Minister are prepared to put political opportunism before public confidence and the reputation of the members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Government were right to say they would set up such a tribunal and the now Opposition who said in Government that they would set up such a tribunal and find a judge for such a tribunal were right to do that.  This would have restored public confidence in the Garda.  The fact that that has not been done has sent reverberations and innuendo throughout the country which could and should have been stopped.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister now that he is getting an extra judge and he has the opportunity with an extra judge between this and April 1987 to set up such a tribunal and let it inquire into the allegations that were made.  The Minister can consider that matter.  Certainly he has not put it down as a priority and the Minister of State has not put it as a priority here this evening.</P>
    <P>These are some short comments on the Bill.  There is a great deal that we can say at the moment about the Circuit Court and the problems therein and we welcome the steps which the Minister is taking in that respect.  I try to stick to logic all the time because I find that, while it might not be popular in the short term, it is useful in the long term.  I am puzzled about one thing.  Why to April 1987?  If 2 April is the time when someone retires, why not leave it at 15 and let the Government of the day take whatever action is seen to be necessary at any time? It is only an upper limit.  I hope that in reply the Minister of State will give us her views on that matter.  We have pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House this evening is very welcome and it is necessary for the appointment of additional judges.  The Minister of State this evening made the point very clearly regarding delays in having a number of types of cases heard.  Any delay in the hearing of cases is wrong.  This is a genuine effort to speed up cases where there are delays.</P>
      <P>One area of very serious delay is in High Court cases heard before juries. When delays of about 26 months occur in the hearing of such cases something is seriously wrong.  When a case is set down and does not come to trial for 26 months, that is most unfair.  For example, consider somebody who has been seriously injured and is awaiting compensation.  During that period he may be obliged to borrow money or, to live off his relations.  All of that causes serious emotional and financial problems.  Litigants who have very small incomes, the poorer litigants in particular, on many occasions feel obliged to settle their cases because of their financial circumstances.  Because they are short of money they may decide to settle for perhaps less than they would obtain in court.  That should not be allowed to continue. For that reason it is important that the number of High Court judges should be increased.</P>
      <P>In the Circuit Court delays have occurred in the hearings of different types of criminal cases.  Again this is serious and a matter for concern.  People are charged with crimes and their cases are delayed because of a shortage of judges. This measure will speed up the hearing of these trials.  If the accused persons are guilty, well and good, they are brought before the court and are proven guilty, but if they are innocent and under this cloud it is important that the cloud should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals only with the High Court and the Circuit Court.  It does not touch on the District Court, unfortunately.  It is a pity that the Minister of State has not some provision here in relation to the District Court.  Let me make a brief passing reference to the situation that has <Col N="1281" /> arisen in Dublin in regard to the centralisation of the District Court.  The Circuit Court and High Court go on circuit to the different towns.  They come to a town in my constituency and the District Court sits in each of the county towns.  All District Court cases from the Dublin area, with the exception of a few places such as Dún Laoghaire, are heard near the Four Courts.  I ask the Minister of State to address herself to making provision for the District Court in areas like Tallaght, Ballyfermot, Finglas, Crumlin, Foxrock and so on.  People with families, women with children and so on are obliged to come into town for District Court cases. It is not good that the Dublin District Court should be centralised near the Four Courts as has been the case for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is increasing the number of High Court and Circuit Court judges but she should consider also the appointment of personnel to support and work with these judges.  I assure her of the calibre, goodwill and generosity of the people attached to the courts.  They are very dedicated.  For a long time they have been making a case for additional staff.  Now that more judges are to be appointed it is imperative that more staff be appointed.  The offices of the High Court and Circuit Court around the country are seriously understaffed and this is causing serious problems for judges, registrars and so on.  They have requested that appointments be made.  I am aware of the embargo, but the serious shortage of staff is causing great problems and they will get worse.  This matter should be attended to immediately.  The shortage of staff has caused problems in regard to administration, enforcement of judgments and in the collection of fines.</P>

      <P>There has been a lot of comment recently about the appointment of judges and suggestions that this function should be taken out of the hands of the Government of the day.  A former president of the Law Society suggested that an independent tribunal should be established to appoint judges.  I would be opposed to that.  The Government of the day are elected by the people and one of their important democratic functions is to appoint High Court and Circuit Court judges.  I wonder what type of tribunal people have in mind.  Is it the intention that a senior counsel, a solicitor and a civil servant should be appointed and conduct interviews, examinations and so on?</P>
      <P>Over the years Fianna Fáil appointed people to the bench who were active in political parties although of a different political persuasion.</P>

      <P>I would not be in favour of a change in the system.

He proved to be one of the most outstanding judges in the country. There are many other examples.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  On occasions we have appointed members of the Fianna Fáil Party to the bench.  In my 25 years practising as a solicitor I have never heard of a judge being accused of corruption.  The same cannot be said of <Col N="1283" /> any democracy in the world.  There is no place where the Judiciary are held in such high esteem.  We can be proud of them. In making appointments to the bench successive Governments have always taken into consideration the integrity and honesty of the person.  The media and others are calling for the establishment of an independent tribunal to deal with the appointment of judges, but I would have great reservations about changing the existing system.  I hope the Government will not move to change it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods that there is need for uniformity in sentencing.  It is essential that arrangements are made by the Department and the Minister to have discussions with judges about sentencing. There is a lot of criticism about that at present.  Our courts should be reported more extensively by newspapers.  There is not sufficient attention paid to them, particularly in Dublin.  Nell McCafferty, who contributed a column to a daily newspaper on the proceedings in our courts for some time, succeeded in improving the functioning of the District Court in the city.  She did a tremendous amount of good.  I welcome this important piece of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on this Bill of limited scope will be brief.  The Bill proposes to increase the number of High Court judges and judges in the Circuit Court.  One would assume that the proposal to increase the number of judges in both courts is for the purpose of dealing with the backlog of cases awaiting hearing. To that extent the Bill is welcome. One of the criticisms I have of the Bill &mdash; I made similar comments in regard to other Bills &mdash; is that this important area of legislation is in need of radical reform. The number of Acts under which the Department of Justice operates represents a jungle of confusing unco-ordinated laws under which a citizen hopes for an expects to get justice.  Surely, in an age when we hear so much about citizens' rights, it is not unreasonable to expect that our laws should be rewritten and framed in a language that can be <Col N="1284" /> understood by ordinary citizens.  The new laws should enable citizens to identify with a code of behaviour which we as legislators have formulated for the purposes of ordering the affairs of society.  It is wrong that legislation, which is the product of the democratic process of the House, cannot be fully understood and disentangled by those who formulated it in the first instance.  As a spokesman for my party on Justice, I have to seek professional advice to help me understand the legislation that comes before us.  If that is the position with the legislators' what chance have ordinary citizens got? There is an urgent need to consolidate the fragmented and confusing rules and laws of behaviour under which we are all expected to live in this wide area of the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to sound cynical, and I am conscious of the company in which I am making this statement, but I cannot help thinking that all this confusing legislation is the product of a self-preservation act by people who have a vested interest in keeping it confused for ordinary mortals. I will not change all this in the course of the debate but the matter deserves further consideration by the House at a future date.</P>
      <P>The media gave a lot of attention recently to be outmoded and archaic codes of practice in our courts and I agree with a lot of what has been written in that regard.  However, if we are to bring about such reform we should also include a move to make all aspects of the system fully understood by the public who have access to it.  I have referred to the need to improve the efficiency of the judicial system and to improve the accessibility of our courts for the citizens and also to speed up court procedure.  This matter has been dealt with by all the previous speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a believer in holding our legal institutions and those who administer justice in the highest honour and respect.  It would be a sad day for society in general if that were not the case.  It is true that those who have been selected and appointed to these trusted positions carry <Col N="1285" /> out their tasks with dignity and, as already said, with a great sense of justice. There is, perhaps, the odd exception and it is no harm to say that these exceptions are noted in this House and by the people.  We all wish such a very sensitive and important area of public administration to be above reproach.  There have been improvements in the efficiency and administration of justice in recent years. As previous speakers have already done, I should like to acknowledge the work of our Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Finlay &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge that this reform should continue and all those who spoke here this evening would, I am sure, share that plea with me.  The present president of the court, because of his very wide experience in the field of the administration of justice, is a man highly qualified to undertake and continue the work which was put in train by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major areas of change which resulted in improved efficiency, referred to by the Minister in her contribution, was that the jurisdication of the District Court was extended from £250 to £2,500 and correspondingly the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court went from £2,500 to £15,000.  Has the Minister any plans for further changes in this area? The further extension of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court would enable a considerable volume of work to be transferred from the High Court to the Circuit Court, where there are excellent and highly qualified judges on circuit.  Such a change would be of benefit to the litigant and should result in a reduction in the <Col N="1286" /> cost of obtaining justice, a factor which must be examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in far too many cases the financial and physical cost to individuals and families in their quest for justice has been devastating and to some extent has discredited the concept of justice as we understand it in a democratic system.  I do not say that as a reflection on or condemnation of the very excellent and credible barristers and lawyers who naturally operate legitimately within a system which we as legislators have established. I say that in the presence of the very distinguished company we have in the House this evening.</P>
    <P>In the context of the new appointments, did the Minister give any thought to putting another High Court judge on circuit for the purpose of speeding up High Court cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which have been awaiting hearing for a considerable length of time and which were highlighted and admitted by the Minister of State in her contribution to the House this evening, and more important, for the purpose of making our High Court more accessible to the people.  Such a move would also have the advantage of removing some of the awe and, indeed, fear of the system as it operates from the Four Courts in Dublin.  It would also have the advantage of reducing the considerable inconvenience and cost to litigants in having to travel to Dublin and other major cities for High Court hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I realise that the District Court system is probably outside the scope of this Bill.  Let me say by way of a passing reference that more attention should be given to strengthening that system.  It is the area with which most citizens most easily identify.  To broaden the jurisdiction of the District Court would provide for a more equitable distribution of court work.  All that is needed to bring about this objective is the provision of additional court staff.  We all heard, over the past 12 months in particular, the pleas from the District Court <Col N="1287" /> clerks all over the country for additional staff and facilities to be made available to them to allow the more efficient operation of the District Court system.  Could the Minister give us some indication as to whether there are any plans afoot in the Department with a view to strengthening the District Court and making more staff available?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give some thought to the establishment of a small claims court where small claims could be disposed of, which would reduce the reliance on and remove some of the pressure from our higher courts.  I understand from people to whom I have spoken in other countries that this system has operated with them very effectively for many years, particularly in relation to the smaller claims that could be disposed of under such a system without all the bureaucracy and red tape associated with the higher levels of court jurisdication here.</P>
    <P>Another thought in relation to courts generally is that the hours of court sittings should be more effectively organised, not only with a view to improving the output of the courts but also for the purpose of suiting the litigants, many of whom, as Deputy Enright has already acknowledged, are working people who do not find it possible to take a day off from work and for various financial and family reasons would find a wider range in time of court sittings more suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>Another point, that occurred to me in connection with this Bill is the problem of trying to create an awareness and an understanding of how our judicial system operates.  For many people it is something which is extremely remote and is perhaps feared by the majority who do not want to be associated with it.  To some extent this is a reflection on our educational system.  I would like to see our civics classes expanded and extended and our young people educated in the process of the administration of justice.  I do not know if it could be done within the regulations governing attendances at courts, but I would like to see senior students at <Col N="1288" /> school and college having the opportunity and being encouraged to visit our courts to see justice being administered on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the need for family courts and I fully subscribe to that.  It is a sad reflection on society today that we find more and more families needing access to our courts in relation to the various social problems which now face the family unit.  For that reason a very sound and logical argument can be made in relation to the establishment of special family courts.  Perhaps more important is the fact that the judges we appoint to these courts should have access to the kind of training they will inevitably need to deal with the very sensitive work which is undertaken in the family court.  I am not casting any doubt on the qualifications and ability of existing judges but they would be the first to admit that there is need for some kind of in-service training to keep pace with the rapid changes in society.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by some earlier speakers to what appears to be a variation in sentencing by the courts.  It is difficult to assess the circumstances under which individual sentences are imposed but, without any condemnation of the judges who apply those sentences, there do seem to be discrepancies.  There is considerable merit in the argument put forward by my constituency colleague, Deputy Enright, that a co-ordinating committee should be established to assist in achieving some kind of uniformity in sentencing.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that there is a time limit on this debate and that a number of other speakers wish to contribute.  We give our full backing to the Bill.  There is a vast jungle of confused legislation under which the Minister's Department have to operate.  The time has surely come for a consolidation of all that legislation in a language which the public and Members of this House can understand.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister in the introduction of this Bill to provide for an increase in the number of judges at High Court and Circuit Court <Col N="1289" /> level, especially in Dublin.  I am well aware that there has been an unacceptable level of delay in the courts, although there has been an improvement in some areas.  It can be over two years after setting down before a trial commences.  This is totally unacceptable and we are all anxious that these delays should be reduced.  I would hope that the appointment of an extra High Court judge would go some way towards achieving this.  The Minister indicated that Cork would not necessarily have a full time call on the services of this judge but I would hope that particular emphasis would be placed on this area in the initial period because delays there are unacceptable.  The Minister said that delays might be cut next year to 22 months and while this is still unacceptable at least it is an improvement.</P>
      <P>These delays occur for various reasons but are usually attributable to a combination of factors at different levels of the legal process.  Delays by solicitors and barristers can be exacerbated by delays involving other people with expert knowledge, such as gardaí and medical people.  Sometimes it is a couple of years before cases are set down and there is a further period before they are heard.</P>
      <P>In recent years there have been three tribunals of inquiry, in relation to Whiddy Island, the Stardust and the Kerry Babies, and High Court judges had to be directed to deal with these very important matters.  This meant that the number of High Court judges was not at full strength in dealing with ordinary work because these inquiries took a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the appointment of extra judges would be simply one step in the process of further reform of the administration of justice.  We have been well served by the judges appointed by various administrations.  They have all been people of integrity who have served the country very well.  All matters affecting the administration of justice should be continually reviewed.  The judges must have proper back-up staff who should have good conditions and the courthouses should be kept to a very high standard.  This is an area which should <Col N="1290" /> be well served.  The innocent public are often badly affected by delays in court cases.  People who have been injured may be in very poor circumstances until their cases are heard and awards are made to them in court.</P>
    <P>I hope that further reforms will be forthcoming and that the Minister will take note of the points made on all sides of the House.  A full examination of the process of administration of justice is probably overdue.  While many of the courts are working quite well, there is always room for improvement.</P>
    <P>I reaffirm my support of these judges and I hope that the situation will be kept under review so that particular &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; will be improved.  It may even be necessary to appoint further judges and justices in the interests of eliminating unacceptable delays.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in supporting the Bill.  I should like to make a number of observations which are to a considerable extent derived from my own practical experience but also from the experience of those who have more time than I to practise. I agree with Deputy Enright when he said that it is the Government who have and should retain the responsibility for the appointment of judges.  I say that in the knowledge that the Judiciary subsequently becomes a separate arm of the Constitution.  I have been practising for over 25 years at the Bar and I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for 20 years and I have found that the manner in which the Judiciary discharge their separate constitutional function has always been independent and without any political bias.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this late hour we are only speaking for the record and certainly not for the mass attendance here.  Perhaps we are not even speaking for the public because of the late hour and the pressure that puts on the reporting staff in the media.  For that reason I want to quote my own experience in Government and in practice. That experience is derived from an association which I had on a personal level with a former Taoiseach, the late <Col N="1291" /> John A. Costello, whom we all knew at the Bar as &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; and which is how he wished to be known.  It was my privilege to find myself sitting beside the late Jack Costello when the question of appointments by Governments came up.  He indicated that in the first Inter-Party Government a suggestion was made that the appointments should be taken out of the hands of Government and placed in the hands of the Bar Council or the Incorporated Law Society, for whom I have the greatest respect, or some other independent group.  The Government tried to be impartial for a very short period, but they then decided that that was not the way to do it.  The representations and the understandable persuasions from within the professional lobbies became the main problem that the Government faced, whereas in this instance it is their role to discharge independently their function in the appointment of judges.</P>
    <P>A former President of the Incorporated Law Society, Michael Houlihan, made great play in public statements recently regarding the Judiciary.  The consequences of his statement could only have two effects: to denigrate the standing of the Judiciary, although he may not have intended that, and also to denigrate the role of public representatives.  He suggested that the appointment of judges should be taken out of the hands of politicians. Unfortunately, the term &ldquo;politician&rdquo; does not have the connotations or standing that we wish it had, but I totally repudiate the implications of that criticism. It is the fundamental role of Government and in the discharge of that role they have invariably made the best choice.  I see no basis on which anybody from a professional organisation should, for the sake of publicity, make a criticism which is so ill-founded.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that Deputy Enright mentioned that I was a member of the Government who appointed such a distinguished former Fine Gael Deputy to the High Court.  I refer to Mr. Justice Finlay, who is now the Chief Justice.  I was equally privileged to be a member of the Fianna Fáil Government which <Col N="1292" /> appointed Mr. Justice William O'Brien Fitzgerald as Chief Justice.  He had not been a representative of Fine Gael but his sympathies were known to lie in that direction.  We also had the distinction of appointing the first lady to the High Court, namely Miss Justice Mella Carroll, and that could hardly be said to be on the basis of association with Fianna Fáil.  The pattern in recent times, if not as obviously impartial, has been done on the basis of the highest standing at the Bar.  To those who suggest or imply that our Judiciary are there because they are politicial hacks, I say that that is a great insult to those who have served us so well.  It is also an offence to the House and to the Government who have discharged their responsibilities very effectively. We are very fortunate in the standing of the current Bench, not that I am looking for any favours when I may appear before some of them next week.</P>
    <P>The problem is not just in regard to numbers of judges; it also refers to accommodation.  If we had adequate accommodation in the courts we could deal very effectively with the backlog referred to by the Minister.  The Minister mentioned that there are delays in bringing trials to court, ranging from ten months in Dundalk to 12 months in Dublin and elsewhere.  As far as I know, the Dundalk High Court sessions last for at most four weeks in the year.  They are currently sitting for two weeks in Dundalk.  Therefore, when one speaks of a ten month delay, in effect you are not talking about a delay at all.  I know of cases in connection with accidents which occurred during the last year and a half which are down for hearing in this session in the Dundalk High Court.  We need more accommodation around the country so that the High Court and justice can be brought to the people.  The only limit on that operation is the lack of adequate accommodation.  If one could have three judges of the High Court in Limerick there would be little or no backlog in the High Court there.  The same applies to Cork and Galway.  The real limitation is not that on the number of judges, it is the limitation of accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Some of the experiments that took place some time ago in bringing the High Court to towns such as Trim, Kilkenny and other places might be repeated elsewhere. For instance, why not bring it to Nenagh where we have the necessary accommodation?  It is certain that sufficient litigation from County Tipperary could be dealt with there.  I am not making the case just for Nenagh.  I suggest that in many places the facilities are available and they should be used to relieve the backlog of cases.  While judges are needed, accommodation is also necessary.</P>
    <P>There is some necessary delay in most serious High Court actions.  If a person suffers a serious injury, a claim in the High Court cannot be concluded without having the opportunity to establish and diagnose the <i>sequelae</i> of the injuries suffered by a person in an accident.  In major injuries this will not emerge clearly until at least two years have elapsed.  A person may suffer a fractured femur, a fractured tibia or a fractured skull but the consequences will not be known until at least two years.  People should realise there is a minimum period that must elapse before proceeding with a case, even though a courtroom and a judge may be available immediately.  Any prudent lawyer would advise waiting until there was a final prognosis and a conclusive medical opinion. It should not be thought that all delays are due to the backlog of cases.  Quite a number are delayed by deliberate and prudent decision of the legal advisers concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the current President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton and to his distinguished predecessor, Mr. Justice Finlay, now President of the Supreme Court.  Presidency of the High Court entails the job of management and administration as much as carrying out judicial functions.  The current president and his predecessor have accommodated the interests of litigants and of the juries and witnesses.  They have also accommodated the lawyers who discharge their professional obligations and the court staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> The only problem that remains is the problem of adequate accommodation. Sometimes people compare the atmosphere in the High Court to a fair day in the old town.  It has to be said that the provision of adequate consultation rooms in court buildings would not go amiss.  I am not talking about lawyers who are paid to do their job and who are used to standing around in corridors.  However, for the people involved that one day has fundamental importance in terms of obtaining proper compensation and they have to convey their views to their lawyers in the corridors of draughty court buildings.  That is not a proper service. There should be adequate consultation rooms for people to allow them facilities to consult with their legal advisers on a very important day in their lives.</P>
    <P>I exclude Dublin when dealing with accommodation because the Round Hall is spacious and there are consultation rooms, but the story is different so far as the High Court and the Circuit Court are concerned when we talk about Cork, Galway, Limerick, Sligo and Dundalk. Sometimes consultations have to be conducted outside doors even in winter. What kind of facility is that for our citizens? It has to be said that some progress has been made in improving some of the accommodation.  In Waterford, Thurles and Dungarvan &mdash; I am talking about the circuit in which I practise &mdash; facilities are adequate, but I think it would be past the comprehension of any Member here to realise the circumstances in which justice was administered in these courts even ten years ago.  However, I must acknowledge the progress that has been made and I hope there will be further improvement.</P>
    <P>The appointment of judges is important. They will not deal just with civil cases but with criminal cases.  The most grave error was made by this Government in early 1983 when they cancelled the prison development programme.  It was necessary at that time, but now it is crying out for implementation.  How can the courts properly discharge their responsibilities when people sentenced by them find there is no accommodation for them in prisons?  On occasions people sentenced <Col N="1295" /> by our courts get as far as the front door of the prison but are sent home because of lack of accommodation.  Consider the damage done by that to the whole administration of justice, to the standing of our our courts, the morale of the Garda and the social fabric of society.  I have never heard any Minister attempt to justify that shortsighted decision.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice were present, and I wish he were, he would try to deny that that caused the problem.  Judges, district justices, the Garda Síochána and people who know the system are aware of the true situation.  It is a major public scandal.  In his report on the Appropriations Account for 1984, the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out the money wasted in the prison development programme.  Millions of pounds have been wasted on surveyors' fees, on site acquisition and on accommodation of prison staff.  Costs have been incurred in respect of custom engineered operated steel doors.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government acknowledged that that decision in 1983 has had disastrous consequences for the administration of justice, that it has undermined the morale of prison staffs, the Garda and the officials of the Department of Justice who could have told the Minister for Justice that if that programme was urgently necessary in 1980, by 1983 it was far more necessary.  It was cancelled.</P>
    <P>We complain about judges, the courts and about criminals walking our streets. I know the Minister of State is concerned about preserving our social fabric.  Would she therefore please convey, as a matter of urgency, to the Minister for Justice the need to have proper prison accommodation, the kind that was taken over in Cork which was used for the education of people from deprived backgrounds, people who should be helped by every means along the way to rehabilitation. We have done nothing about such deprived people &mdash; indeed, we have deprived them of the rights that should be theirs while they are in custodial care. A matter which applies equally to the High Court, the Supreme Court and the <Col N="1296" /> District Court has been included in the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It appears on page XXX of the report.  It shows how the current blunt instrument in regard to public sector recruitment is affecting the administration of justice:</P>
    <P>The Accounting Officer has informed me that the Commissioner has since reported that the number of unexecuted warrants in this office in mid-1985 was 10,360, a reduction of 4,500 since June 1984.</P>
    <P>The report stated that the local District Court &mdash; this is in Dublin &mdash; had not issued any warrants to the Garda in respect of traffic offences for more than a year.  Why should they, when they know that the warrants have not been executed?  The backlog of warrants in the District Courts is greater than that in the warrants office.  The Accounting Officer said that the situation was created by staffing problems for which no immediate solution is in sight.</P>
    <P>This has been evident to all but those who do not wish to see, and I particularly include in this the current Minister for Justice who does not want to see, the lack of proper prison accommodation, the lack of court staff, the lack of staffs to execute judgments which are piling up. The effect on the Garda is serious.  I hope the appointment of extra judges will not be the subject of criticism because their judgments, sentences and fines will not be implemented.  I hope the Minister of State will report to the Minister for Justice that, though we welcomed the appointment of extra judges, we expressed serious concern about the lack of back-up staff, of prison accommodation and proper court facilities which undermine the whole process of the law and the prison service.  Our Judiciary and prison staffs have done us proud in severely restricting circumstances.</P>
    <P>Grave injustices are being caused, also by staff shortages, to people who have been sentenced in the Circuit and Central Criminal Courts and who have lodged notices of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  They are unable to proceed <Col N="1297" /> because transcripts of the trials are not available.  Appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal are heard on those transcripts but there are delays of between two and three years in the production of those transcripts.  I have this on the authority of members of the Judiciary.  Therefore, a person convicted who has lodged an appeal has to wait, possibly in prison, for two years until the transcript of his trial becomes available.  This is due to the staff recruitment embargo.  There are many people in prison whose appeals should have been heard long ago.  The appeals of some of those people may be successful, so one can appreciate the mental and physical harm inflicted by this crude blunt instrument of the recruitment embargo. It is time for that embargo to be removed so that the courts could have the proper back-up services to enable them to work properly in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland was more than kind to lawyers but he referred to the use of legal gobbledegook which the public do not understand.  I endorse fully his concern that the law should be understandable to ordinary members of the public.  Every young law student knows the maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Therefore, we should try to ensure that the citizens would be able to understand the law.  It is not the fault of lawyers that the phraseology of law is so complex and unintelligible.  The fault lies with this House.  We are the ones who pass legislation and who introduce all the complex amendments to amendments.  We use such phraseology as, &ldquo;the Principal Act is the Act of 1935 and notwithstanding anything contained in section 43, subsection (2) of that Act, amended by section 5, subsection (6) of the Act of 1948 with the proviso that no amendment be made to the Act of 1949.&rdquo;  We are the ones who present that gobbledegook.  That is the kind of terminology that Deputy Hyland has complained of.</P>
    <P>It is easier to complain than to do something about the problem but I must hazard the view &mdash; it is more than a guess &mdash; that by and large the terminology in most of our legislation is based closely on <Col N="1298" /> the drafting procedures in British legislation. Much of the legislation being introduced here is &ldquo;cogged&rdquo; directly from British statutes in terms of drafting.  I am not blaming the parliamentary draftsman's office for this because again we are talking about an area in which there is not adequate staff.  The courts cannot be blamed for the delay in updating laws. We have been waiting for a long time for this updating.  In this regard I shall not mention the number of Bills that have been promised here but the main reason, though not the only one perhaps, for the delay stems from the draftsman's office because of the shortage of staff there as a result of the embargo on recruitment. The only point on which I would take issue with Deputy Hyland in his criticism is that the lawyers are not responsible for proposing the kind of terminology used in our laws.</P>
    <P>I trust as Deputy Hyland has raised the issue it will have the result of all of us being a little more sharp in our scrutiny of legislation.  Regardless of what role I may discharge at the time of the next Finance Bill, I will bear in mind the Deputy's criticisms.  Anyone who has ever tried to make sense of the terminology in Finance Bills will appreciate precisely what Deputy Hyland is complaining about though I consider him to have directed his criticism at the wrong targets.</P>
    <P>Regarding the appointment of women to the Judiciary or to ministerial position, I am proud that we made history by being the first Government to appoint a woman judge, in the person of Miss Justice Carroll, to the High Court and in the appointment of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn as a Minister.  We must all welcome the fact that women are being acknowledged in our society at every level in terms of the roles they discharge.  The number of women practising at the Bar and in the solicitors' profession will mean that, if not immediately, there will be soon a highly qualified pool of expert lawyers who will include women and men and from which the Executive of the day will make its choice in terms of appointment to any of our courts.  From my knowledge <Col N="1299" /> of the capacity of so many lady barristers and solicitors I am confident that in the foreseeable future there will be an adequate representation of experienced and qualified professional women on the Bench.</P>
    <P>The only comment I would make is that all judges should have the necessary professional qualifications.  If they do not have those qualifications after ten years of practice at the Bar there is little hope for them.  The only question of suitability that arises is not a question of qualification and experience: it is a question of temperament.  The old fashioned gifts of courtesy, patience and concern are of special importance to those who sit on the Bench.  I am glad to be able to say that the present judges of the High Court, the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court are exemplary.  That has been the pattern at least during my experience of the courts and I trust it will continue.  I trust, too, that there will be no implication that those being appointed to the Bench are being appointed as political hacks but rather that their appointments are based on their professional standing, integrity and the human qualities of courtesy and concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those Deputies who contributed to the debate, a debate that has been very wide ranging and interesting and during which some very worthwhile points have been made. I am pleased that the Bill has the support of Deputies.  This is a recognition that the reasonably quick disposal of court business must be the primary concern of all of us.  I thank Deputy Woods, Enright, Hyland, Cosgrave and O'Kennedy for their contributions.  It is particularly useful that three of those who contributed are legal practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods complained about there not being an explanatory memorandum with the Bill but he supplied the answer himself when he said that this is a simple Bill and one that is clear in its intent.  Because of that it was not considered necessary to provide an explanatory <Col N="1300" /> memorandum.  The Deputy also queried the reason for the date, 2 April 1987, as proposed in section 1 (2) of the Bill.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no sinister motive or undertone for this. The next vacancy, due to retirement, in the High Court, will occur on 3 April 1987.  The idea is to allow for a review at that stage of the numbers required.  It may happen that reduced business in the High Court and a clearance of arrears will mean that continuation of the extra appointment will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy asked what the right figure is in regard to the number of judges.  This depends on the business offering and on the complexity of that business.  There has been a substantial increase in the business of the courts down through the years and there is now a very serious level of arrears.  This governs the number of judges proposed.  The Deputy questioned the sentencing policy of the courts.  As he will be aware, the Oireachtas specifies the maximum and often the minimum sentences.  However, the courts are independent in their decisions and it would be a matter for the Judiciary to set up a system of review. There are arrangements already for meetings of the judges of the Circuit and High Courts and it would be a matter for the presidents of each court at such meetings to review sentencing procedures.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy's Woods' claims about outstanding fines, he quoted a figure of £4¼ million. These are face value figures based on a very limited survey and take no account of fines that are uncollectable or that may be remitted and there is also the normal day to day work in progress figure to be taken into account.  The embargo is affecting this collection but a step has been taken in so far as a decision has been made to take on 57 clerical trainees in court offices. They will be engaged mainly in warrants and fines work.  The figure of £4¼ million which is circulating widely is not a real figure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods questioned the need for support staff for judges.  I am glad to <Col N="1301" /> say that it is intended to appoint two registrars, one crier and one usher in the near future.  Accommodation for extra sittings is not a problem.  Deputy O'Kennedy also mentioned accommodation and while it is not de luxe, it is adequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods mentioned the modernisation of procedures.  The rule making bodies of the various Courts have considerable scope to recommend changes.  As regards the autonomy of the Supreme and High Courts, administrative staff have a high level of autonomy already and the Department of Justice provide the necessary central back-up service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright raised the question of centralisation of District Courts in Dublin.  He suggested that hearings should be taken to outlying areas, such as Tallaght, Ballyfermot, and I think he mentioned Foxrock, where I live.  This does not arise under this Bill.  If we were to consider such changes, pertinent consideration would have to be taken into account, such as the cost of providing venues which has to be borne by local authorities, whether there would be a sufficient amount of business offering and the degree of convenience or inconvenience to the parties involved, including solicitors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland made a number of points.  He asked if there were any plans to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.  The simple answer is that there was a considerable increase in May 1982 and there are no proposals for any increases at this stage.  He mentioned also the training of judges and justices.  The Minister is open to any proposals the Judiciary may submit.  Because of their constitutional independence it is for them to take the initiative, not the Minister or the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the delays in Cork in hearing High Court cases.  As I mentioned the President of the High Court has already taken a number of steps, such as additional sittings in Cork this year, to reduce delays. It is for the President to decide how best the Cork situation may be further improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the need for improved conditions for meetings throughout the country.  There is an extensive building programme under way in the Four Courts area in Dublin.  The new building on the Four Courts site when completed should mean a major improvement in facilities.  I do not intend to refer to his other points because he referred to prison accommodation, facilities for prisoners and the capital programme for prison buildings, matters which do not arise under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Once again I want to express my appreciation to the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  I believe this is an important Bill for the proper administration of justice and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I sought to raise the question of the threatened disruption of the bus services as a result of action by the management of CIE.  I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and <Col N="1303" /> to thank the Minister for coming here at this late hour to reply.</P>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that a semi-State company like CIE should refuse to avail of the services of another State agency which was established specifically to help avoid a total breakdown in industrial relations.  In the past Government Ministers have been very quick to criticise and condemn the trade union movement if they did not avail of the Labour Court. Therefore it is rather surprising to have the present situation where CIE refuse to go before that body.  While the negotiations for the pay as you enter bus service, or the one person operated bus as it is known, have been going on for the past 18 years, the recent overwhelming rejection of the latest CIE offer by all the unions involved shows there are still areas not satisfactorily ironed out and in need of very patient negotiations.</P>
      <P>One person operated buses cannot be introduced without the co-operation of the staff, the workers and the trade unions involved.  While there are still issues to be resolved and while the workers are willing and even anxious to bring the matter before the Labour Court, it is extraordinary that this showdown has been precipitated at this time by the management of CIE.  There are major difficulties in operating double deck pay as you enter buses.  They can only be introduced effectively on a gradual, on a phased and on an agreed basis, where they are capable of being operated efficiently and safely, not just from the point of view of the company but from the point of view of the men and women who have to operate them, and particularly from the point of view of the men, women and children who will have to use them.  A major obstacle in the way of their introduction is the method of fare collection, the security of the drivers, the stresses and the greater responsibility which the drivers, both men and women, will have to bear in handling these buses on their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in recent years there has been a rise in the number of attacks on bus workers.  Studies in other cities <Col N="1304" /> where these pay as you enter buses have been in operation have shown that the stress on the drivers has resulted in a very high level of heart conditions among them.  There are serious issues in the whole area.  Along with that, the bus workers are amongst the lowest paid workers.  A married man with three children who does not work his rest day takes home approximately £92 per week and if he works on his rest day he may take home about £120.  That could include shifts which could have a spread of almost 12 hours through the day with possibly a five hour break in the middle of the day. In those circumstances the bus workers concerned do not refuse substantial increases in pay without very serious reasons.  The whole question of security and the nature of the work and the hours they have to work are issues which have to be dealt with in a humane way.</P>
    <P>There are other problems relating to these kinds of buses.  How do bus workers cope with elderly passengers, men and women with young children and prams, pregnant women and so forth?  There are disadvantages in the system.  From studies made in other countries, particularly in London and Manchester, it has been found that these buses take four times as long to travel distances previously covered by two person buses.  This has resulted in some cases in a reduction in the number of passengers who have a choice of other modes of transport.</P>
    <P>In this instance it is significant that CIE have chosen this time of year to force a showdown on this issue which has been around for 18 years.  The fact that it has been around for 18 years does no credit to industrial relations.  The DART system and the feeder services for it, which is the issue which has been used to precipitate the present situation, has been with us now for 18 months.  The DART system has been quite successful and there is no doubt that it requires the feeder service to extend its use to other areas of the city.  Why did CIE select next Monday to implement the feeder service? Why did they pick today to insist that bus workers must turn up for training in the new system?  The only logical explanation <Col N="1305" /> is that they calculated that three weeks before Christmas is the bus workers most vulnerable time.  They know that bus workers cannot afford to lose pay coming up to Christmas, that the areas most affected by a stoppage of buses or by a company lock-out are working class areas where most of the bus workers live and that they would obviously come under pressure to concede.  What man or woman with a family would like to be locked out or involved in a dispute with a resultant loss of pay at this time of year? The escalation of this issue can affect the Christmas trade in the city and can cause a loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>The decision of CIE not to go to the Labour Court is outrageous and it must be unprecedented for a semi-State company to take that action.  It cannot have been done without the connivance of the Minister for Communications.  It is further manifestation of the &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; style of industrial relations being pursued by other companies under the Minister's direction.  CIE management now appear to be persuaded that they should follow the lead given by Mr. Alex Spain of B &amp; I where normal procedures have been thrown out the window.  We know that the Minister for Labour has the power under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, specifically under sections 18 and 24, to require the Labour Court to intervene in the public interest and report to him on the issues.  If there was ever a dispute where the public interest was affected this must be it and the Minister for Labour should intervene and ensure that sanity prevails.</P>
    <P>I commend the responsibility and mature reaction of bus workers and their unions in refusing to be pushed into a strike by the company's suspension of 20 of their colleagues.  This is a clear indication of where the Minister must exert his influence in order to bring about a resolution of this problem.  I never thought I would see the day when a semi-State company would use the tactics which William Martin Murphy used almost 72 years ago when he attempted to break the transport workers of this city.  He failed then and I have no doubt <Col N="1306" /> that the tactics of today's CIE management will also fail.  The Minister for Communications and the Minister for Labour must not allow the bus workers or the public transport users to be the victims of the tactics being pursued by the management of the company.  I appeal to both Ministers to intervene and ensure that negotiations are started through the Labour Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Transport Acts matters such as employment and conditions of employment are the responsibility of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is my policy not to interfere in functions of CIE which are day-to-day matters.</P>
      <P>One-person-operation of buses has been under negotiation since 1967, a period of 18 years of continuous negotiation. Since July of that year CIE have used all the negotiating machinery established by the State as a means of reaching agreement on OPO working.  Hundreds of meetings and thousands of hours have been devoted by management and unions to the issue.  The lengthy process of negotiation led to the Labour Court recommendation on 23 August last and the court's clarification on 10 October.  The board informed the unions that from 8 December they proposed to introduce OPO, including DART feeder buses. The Labour Court recommendation, a long detailed document, concluded</P>
      <P>Whatever the overall benefits of OPO to the company and the community, it should be clear that there are tangible benefits to bus workers who choose to avail of them.  The proposals are entirely voluntary for each individual.  They contain no threat to the job or security of any individual existing bus worker.  In the light of this, the Court strongly recommends that the bus workers accept them now for Dublin as a blueprint for other cities.</P>
      <P>OPO will bring an increase of £52.72 to bring the weekly wage for a basic 40 hour week for bus drivers to £210.91.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer would benefit by a 20 per cent fare discount per journey &mdash; a <Col N="1307" /> saving of £1.60 per week on a ten journey ticket for a commuter currently paying a single fare of 80p.  These tickets will be available from retail outlets and CIE offices to accommodate the public and to ease the work pressures of drivers.  In addition each OPO bus will be fitted with a cash safe.</P>
    <P>The board will benefit from a reduction in expenditure of about £4.5 million on Dublin city services each year after the implementation period of four years.  The Exchequer will benefit from this reduction in expenditure which will be reflected in the level of subvention necessary for CIE.  This is of importance in the context of CIE achieving the targets set by Government and to contribute to the long term future of CIE under the re-organisation plan.</P>
    <P>The success of DART is dependent on the introduction of feeder services.  CIE need 82,000 passengers per day on DART by 1987 in order for the system to meet its operating costs.  This is exclusive of the Exchequer support for the interest charges on the capital cost of DART now running at £16 million per annum.  Dublin is now virtually the last city in Europe to introduce OPO.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Labour Court recommendation seems a reasonable basis for the introduction of OPO.  I appeal to the unions and the CIE bus drivers and conductors to think seriously on the damage which may be done by withholding their consent to the solution which is so strongly recommended by the Labour Court.  The image of Dublin city services has been very seriously damaged by industrial relations there.  However, I am very heartened by performance in that regard for 1985, the first year since 1972 so far that there has been no significant industrial stoppage in Dublin city services.  I earnestly hope that CIE and their employees will build solidly on that base.</P>
    <P>I would very much regret the hardships on the travelling public should bus services in Dublin be interrupted.  I sincerely hope they will not be exposed once again to such a situation.  At this stage there is <Col N="1308" /> no indication that circumstances such as those indicated by the Deputy will materialise.</P>
    <P>The chairman of CIE has made the board's position clear on participation in a suggested conciliation conference.  In that situation and taking account of the Labour Court recommendation, the statutory responsibility of the board for industrial relations in CIE and all the other circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to intervene in such day-to-day matters of CIE.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me answer a number of points raised by Deputy De Rossa. He asked why CIE management picked today.  They did not pick today.  The calendar of events picked today.  The Labour Court recommendation came out on 23 August.  There were clarification talks at the Labour Court on 10 October and subsequently there were ballots by the unions which concluded only a few weeks ago.  Therefore, after 18 years and a very strong and clear Labour Court recommendation, the management took their own decision.  The Minister did not connive at that decision and was not implicated.</P>
    <P>In the past three years successively each year CIE have reduced their deficit in real terms so that the deficit this year will be 25 per cent less in real terms than it was in 1982.  In the preceding 15 years it escalated by seven times the rate of inflation.  This success has been achieved by a number of factors, chiefly by Ministers not interfering in the day-to-day affairs of the company, and leaving them to the board and management appointed for that purpose.  I intend to continue to pursue that policy.  Not only has it been successful financially, but that financial success has been achieved without massive curtailment of services or massive redundancies.</P>
    <P>It has also brought about an improvement in industrial relations.  As I have said, 1985 so far is the first year since 1972 that there has been no industrial relations stoppage whatever in Dublin city.  I consider it extemely important that strikes and threats of strikes should cease in Dublin city if the company are to get <Col N="1309" /> back the passenger numbers they have lost and provide a much brighter future for their employees.  I am glad that the indications so far this year are that, for the first time in several years, there has <Col N="1310" /> been an increase in passenger numbers in Dublin city services.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 December 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions on the question of Community support for industries producing solid fuels have been continuing at the various energy working groups in Brussels on which my Department are represented and at Council level since 1982.  Under revised Commission proposals presented to the Council in 1984 it was proposed to grant financial aid over a five year period, under two general headings: (1) the modernisation of hard coal production and (2) the production of lignite and peat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions in the Council on the Commission proposal have, however, revealed serious differences of opinion within the Council.  A significant number of member states are reluctant to expend funds on Community production aids for solid fuels, particularly coal, when ample supplies from outside the EC area are cheaply available.  These differences remain unresolved and adoption of the <Col N="1137" /> Commission proposal now seems unlikely.</P>
    <P>Ireland has supported adoption of the Commission proposal on the grounds that a viable Community solid fuels policy which is suitably balanced between coal, lignite and peat has an essential role to play in contributing to the Community's energy objectives of fuel diversification, security of supply and a reduction in the dependence on imported oil.</P>
    <P>At the most recent Energy Council held on 11 November 1985 the Commission stated that it is reconsidering its position on solid fuels.  The Council will again deal with the question at its next meeting in early 1986 on the basis of any revised proposals which the Commission may submit to the Council.  My Department will continue to keep in touch with the Commission in relation to the prospects for aid for solid fuel production in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a fall off in the level of on-shore minerals exploration. Historically the main thrust of the minerals industry in Ireland has been in the search for base metals.  This industry must operate within the context of the international metals market where an excess of supply over demand, except for brief periods of upturn, has resulted in low metal prices.  This situation has in turn had a depressing effect on investment in exploration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no firm evidence that present policy in relation to minerals exploitation and in particular my Department's <Col N="1138" /> flexible approach in relation to the settlement of mining lease terms has deterred investment in minerals exploration here.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the present policy which contains assurances that companies investing in minerals exploration here would be treated fairly when mining lease terms are being settled has been sufficient over the years to attract heavy investment from major international companies.  We continue not only to attract new investment from abroad but also investment from indigenous sources.  Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that I am keeping the situation under continuing review and in this connection I will be glad to consider any reasonable proposals from the mining industry arising out of studies in which they are currently engaged.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.  I am not aware of the basis for the assertion that the Sheelin Farmers' Association are not implementing the undertakings in regard to (a) the assumption of responsibility for the operation of the slurry transport scheme from 1 January 1985 and (b) participation in the new management committee. I understand that substantial quantities of slurry have been removed from the catchment by the pig producers <Col N="1139" /> during 1985 without cost to the Exchequer. I also understand that the association's representatives are actively on the management committee which now meets monthly.</P>
      <P>As regards the present condition of the lake, I understand that results of monitoring indicate that the input of nutrients via feeder streams has been somewhat higher this year than in recent years.  This has been due chiefly to the wet spring and summer, which has had the effect of washing residual nutrients from the soil. It is the responsibility of Cavan County Council, as the pollution control authority, in consultation with the management committee, to monitor the situation closely and to determine whether changes in existing arrangements, or new measures, may be required to ensure the protection of the lake.  The council have already availed of their powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, by serving notices on pro-ducers prohibiting slurry spreading within the catchment between 15 November 1985 and 15 February 1986. The notices also require that for the periods 25 October &mdash; 15 November 1985 and 16 February &mdash; 31 March 1986 slurry may only be spread in such quantities and in such conditions as will not cause or be likely to cause pollution.</P>

      <P>The European Community system of vacancy clearance, known as SEDOC, provides a means of exchanging information on vacancies in EC countries and applicants seeking placements.  It also gives an overall view of the Community labour market.  Because of the availability of suitable workers in all areas and a reduction in the number of vacancies due to the recession, most vacancies are filled locally, leaving very few for circulation. Circulated vacancies relate mainly to highly skilled technical occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Manpower Service of my Department is fully involved in the workings of the SEDOC system and has regular direct contacts with the national placement service of each EC country. Information on vacancies from the SEDOC system is available at all offices of the service.  There are a number of institutional arrangements for improving liaison between labour market and educational authorities.  These include a high level liaison committee chaired by the Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Labour and representation by the Department of Education on the councils of AnCO and CERT and <Col N="1155" /> the board of the YEA.  The White Paper on Manpower Policy will provide for improvements in the interface between the educational system and the world of work.</P>
