      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of the final report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Building Societies; and the amending legislation which will be required following the publishing of the report.</P>

      <P>The committee who have been reviewing the legislative and regulatory arrangements in relation to building societies completed their report on 25 October.  The report is now being considered and such proposals as may be necessary on issues arising from the report will be brought to Government. Should legislation be required it will be brought before the House in the usual manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity we have had to ask the Taoiseach about the committee of inquiry announced on 31 July last.  At this stage would the Taoiseach be prepared to indicate to the <Col N="1706" /> House who chaired this inter-departmental committee and the members who served on it?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee was chaired by my economic adviser, was composed of representatives from the offices of the Tánaiste, the office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Departments of Finance, the Environment and Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  The secretarial services were provided by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Taoiseach's economic adviser is Dr. Patrick Honohan.  Would the Taoiseach care to give an indication of the consultations that took place and if the building societies were consulted or approached in this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach care to elaborate on that &mdash; because it is a very important aspect of the inquiry &mdash; who were consulted and particularly the other relevant institutions to which he referred.  Could he give us the details?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the information in detail.  I am sorry.  The Deputy may wish to put down a further question. I know that the building societies were met and that discussions were held with them.  From my recollection I could not go beyond that and I have not got further information here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Might the Chair point out that the question clearly asks for details of the final report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Building Societies and the amending legislation that would be necessary as a result.  In the opinion of the Chair it is not reasonable to go into how the inquiry was conducted or what witnesses were heard because it is not contained in the question.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you tried to stop the Taoiseach from answering the first question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing secret about it.  The Chair wants to restore order at Question Time but it is impossible for the Chair to do so unless his rulings are obeyed.  There is no point in the Chief Whip of the Opposition party telling the Chair that he must get on with questions and get more work done if the Chair is going to be obstructed at every turn he takes.</P>

      <P>Normally when a final report is brought to the Government it is relevant to ask these sorts of questions. Will this report be published or will it be the subject of a White Paper to be issued by the Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not envisage it being published.  The report was commissioned with a view to providing the Governent with material for decisions.  It will be brought before the Government and they will decide what action, if any, they will take.  Action will either take the form of legislation through this House or, if it does not require legislation, it will be announced by the Government in the usual way.</P>

When I stated that I had requested and nagged for progress to be made I was told that I would have to do more.  Deputies cannot have it both ways. We are moving on to Question No. 2.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Lenihan</b> asked the Taoiseach if the views of the Government Press Secretary, as quoted in the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> newspaper on 3 November 1985, and reproduced in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Tuesday, 5 November, 1985, that the Irish and British Governments are hoping to buy the consent of Catholics to be governed in their talks, represent Government policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any agreement between the two Governments resulting from the Anglo-Irish talks will have to take account of the immediate problems and the sense of alienation of the Nationalist minority in Northern Ireland, without detriment to the majority there, and to allow for peaceful development in the interest of the whole island.  The remarks of the Government Press Secretary, to which the question refers, were, in their full context, intended to make this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes me to go into that matter, I shall be happy to reply.  I told the meeting of Young Christian Democrats in Brussels of our hopes and aspirations that Ireland will in time be united in peace, aspirations that we will not abandon.  I also told them that we believe that we have an obligation now to secure the application to the Northern Nationalists minority of two of <Col N="1712" /> the Young Christian Democrats' principles, first, that full participation in the life of one's society is the birthright of all and, second, that the struggle for peace cannot be detached from the struggle for justice.  I said that the political identity of the Nationalist minority has not hitherto been accommodated in Northern Ireland and that, as proposed in the Forum report, we wanted to see structures created in Northern Ireland with which the minority could, for the first time, identify. Our Nationalist hopes and aspirations, which I reasserted and to which everyone in Ireland knows I am totally committed as part of my personal heritage and which I will never abandon, must take second place in the short term to securing these rights for the Nationalist minority in the North.  If we persist in the policy of doing nothing about these rights until we secure Irish political unity, we would be betraying that minority and I will not be a party to such a betrayal.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, when I spoke to journalists in Brussels, that the headlines were misleading and that the initial statement in one newspaper, purporting to be a quotation from my speech, was incomplete and misleading but that the substantive reports as filed were correct.  My objections lay with the headlines and with the first sentence in one particular news report, not with the contents of the reports themselves which were substantially correct.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that he and his Press Secretary regularly plead misquotation when they find themselves in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> which denies the basic aspirations of our people?  In this case, the Government Press Secretary paid a wanton and gratuitous insult to the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland specifically stating that the Irish and British Governments are engaged in a process of buying their support. They are the precise words which <Col N="1713" /> the Taoiseach said were uttered and they cannot be taken out of context.

      <P>The Army have excellent training facilities and they are used in an excellent way to train excellent soldiers. However, those facilities <i>per se</i> would not be appropriate for use in a quasi-social context which the Deputy suggests. There have been a number of suggestions from various bodies as to how the facilities available in the Army might be utilised in some kind of scheme of youth training that would not be part of the normal activities of the Department of Defence or of the Defence Forces.  These suggestions are under examination.  I do not know if it will be possible to bring them to a satisfactory conclusion in the context of what the Deputy has said, but the matters are being examined.</P>

      <P>There are 380 old type married quarters still occupied.  The location of these quarters is set out in a schedule which will be included in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As all the quarters in question were built more than 60 years ago, it has been the practice in recent years when such quarters become vacant not to re-allocate any of them which are in poor condition. In this regard the provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and married soldiers have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the recent extension to the occupants of <Col N="1722" /> married soldiers quarters of the £5,000 grant scheme introduced last year for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers who re-house themselves in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Following is the schedule:</P>

      <P>I have not here details of any plans for the provision of new married quarters.  I regard the housing of soldiers to be a matter primarily for local authorities.  Soldiers should be dealt with in this respect as is any other citizen. However, I have been pursuing plans which might result in surplus Army land being made available in a way that would assist Defence Force members to house themselves.  Those plans have not yet come to fruition, but I hope to make progress in that regard which would be of significant benefit to those concerned.</P>

      <P>The position in respect of retired Army personnel is difficult.  That is one of the reasons why it is being good policy to move away from the married quarters concept as such.  The Deputy will be aware that retired Army personnel are required to vacate Army houses. Consequently, they must seek accommodation elsewhere but in some areas they experience difficulty in finding alternative accommodation because of the failure of local authorities to make provision for them.  This is prejudicial so far as these personnel are concerned in that they become over-holders on the Army premises and suffer by way of the witholding of pension and-or gratuities.  That is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>

      <P>Knowing is not necessarily understanding.  Women are not permitted to engage in the Army in a combatant role.  Consequently, the roles they can perform are necessarily limited unlike those that can be performed by a male soldier.  The numbers in our Defence Forces are tight in terms of the demands on them but if those numbers were to be diluted further by way of diluting the present intake with personnel who would not be entitled to discharge all the duties of a male soldier &mdash; the demand generally being of a combatant nature &mdash; the burden falling on the remaining members would become even heavier.</P>

      <P>Commencing on 16 September 1985, I made an official visit to the Irish contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  I also visited Irish military personnel serving with the United Nations Force in <Col N="1728" /> Cyprus (UNFICYP) and with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in Syria, Egypt and Israel.</P>
      <P>The visit enabled me to see at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate and to assess the overall position in regard to the safety and welfare of Irish personnel.  An important element in this evaluation was the opportunity to have discussions with my political counterparts in the Governments of the countries concerned and also with the four United Nations force commanders in the area.</P>
      <P>In the course of the visit about six days were occupied in visiting UNIFIL locations, four days in visiting UNFICYP personnel and two to three days each in visiting UNTSO personnel at locations in Syria, Egypt and Israel.  The cost of the visit excluding the use of the Government jet was approximately £9,200.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  Has he any information on social welfare, because it is that Department which mainly concerns the Ombudsman, particularly in relation to the question of averaging requirements for contributory old age pensioners.  I realise the Minister is not in a position to answer social welfare questions but perhaps he could say if there is an intention to amend the averaging clause in the next budget, or if it is the Government's intention to do so.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that the Government recently advertised to recruit 1,000 trainees and interviews are at present taking place.  It is hoped that the first of those trainees will be employed in the immediate future.  That is an example of administrative change which does not require legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of reducing the current maximum retirement age of 65 in the public service to age 60 has already been considered in the course of examining job creation measures generally. However, the extra costs of immediate payment of pensions plus lump sums which would arise &mdash; without taking into account any additional incentives &mdash; are such as to make the matter prohibitive at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a costing?  Presumably if it has been found to be prohibitive the Minister must have a cost per job or some sort of financial analysis to show that.  It seems that there are many people in the Public Service over the age of 60 who would be glad to go on early retirement if they were to get a sum more or less in line with what they would get at 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures are interesting and instructive.  The question of introducing early retirement as a means of job stimulation is often advanced and was advanced by Deputy Ahern by way of a parlimentary question almost a year ago. The difficulty is that to reduce mandatory retirement age even by five years is prohibitively expensive.  Whilst the cost this year of the superannuation allocation for this year for the public service is £196 million, if the mandatory retirement age were reduced to 60 and all those in the age category 60 to 65 were obliged to retire during next year, the cost would amount to a further £104 million in respect of once-off lump sums and £35 million in annual pension costs.  In the year in which such an initiative would be introduced the cost would be £140 million additional to the £196 million allocated to pay existing pensions.  If a Government <Col N="1733" /> had the discretion to have that kind of money available for job creation measures, it would choose to deploy the money in a different way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on the Public Service, <i>Serving the Country</i><Col N="1735" /><i>Better,</i> acknowledges that the embargo as applied in the Civil Service is proving too inflexible for to-day's conditions.  For this reason it is intended to replace the present embargo with a system under which Departments will have greater flexibility on the filling of vacancies within overall staffing targets.  In determining these staffing targets the Government will have regard to all the factors including the need to collect all revenue owed to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What is outlined in the White Paper is that for an interim period a Department will have their staffing targets for a period a year hence set for them and the obligation would then be on them rather than on the central Department to ensure that they met those terms, the aim being to arrive at a situation where Departments would have an overall allocation made to them and then things would be much in line with what the Deputy suggests: it would be up to the Departments to decide which grades to fill.

    <P>On 9 November 1984 I wrote to the Chairman of the Public Services Committee of ICTU indicating that I was anxious to discuss with the committee the operation of the present machinery for pay determination and that I would like to meet the committee within a week.  In a reply to me on 16 November 1984 the chairman said that the committee had come to the conclusion that no purpose would be served at that stage by the discussions I suggested other than to delay still further the processing of the 24th round claims in the public service.</P>
    <P>He indicated, however, that the committee would be prepared to consider a proposal for discussions at a later stage when the negotiations for the round had been completed.  On 20 November I again repeated my request for discussions to the chairman of the committee.  I indicated that I could not see how discussions on the pay determination machinery could prove an inhibition to any ongoing negotiations under the machinery. Indeed, I suggested to him that, since some form of negotiation was ongoing at any given time, such negotiations could always be advanced as a reason for not commencing discussions on what I thought was mutually regarded as an area meriting the most serious consideration. Again the chairman replied that the committee saw no reason to change their previous position.</P>
    <P>In May last, following a request from the Chairman of the Civil Service Staff Panel about the appointment of an arbitrator, I indicated that, before replying, I would be most anxious to have discussion with the panel on the operation of the present machinery for pay determination. I sought to get such discussions under way before the summer holidays and indeed before the term of appointment of the arbitrator at that time had <Col N="1741" /> expired.  However, correspondence with the chairman of the panel dragged on into the autumn when the chairman wrote to me noting the recent Government statement and indicating that the panel could not accept my invitation to discussions at this time.</P>
    <P>I have gone into these matters in some detail in order to let Deputies know that every effort has been made by me over the past 12 months and earlier to get discussions under way and I am still hopeful that such discussions can take place. In advance of such discussions it would not be appropriate for me to indicate at this stage the specific amendments which I will be putting to the staff side.</P>

      <P>My Question No. 51 on today's Order Paper is to ask the Minister for the Public Service if he will reappoint the arbitrator without preconditions and following the Minister's reply the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  He did not actually say it but it was it in every word he said.  Will he not in a straightforward way at least show some honour and say that, until the Public Services Committee of the ICTU accept all the diktat and preconditions which he is setting down, namely, a satisfactory 25th round settlement, a deal on special awards and outstanding claims pending, and a commitment to negotiating changes to the pay machinery, he has no intention whatsoever of appointing a public service arbitrator and that the seven schemes are in suspension?  I am amazed to hear the Minister say that the conciliation and arbitration system is not suspended.  It is suspended.</P>

      <P>If the Minister refuses to say anything further than what he has said, will he accept that the invitations issued by him and the Taoiseach over recent weeks are unfair and misleading, that he has never changed his position, that no new offer has been made to the public services committee of the ICTU, that the Minister has laid down preconditions and has not at any stage been genuine and sincere about meeting to talk about the conciliation and arbitration system?</P>

      <P>As I have outlined, for a period of two years past on various occasions the Government have sought to have discussions with the public service unions regarding the machinery for pay determination.  Each of those attempts has been unsuccessful.  The Government believe that it would be in the interest of the orderly progression of pay determination that the existing machinery should be the subject of examination and consultation. They also believe it is reasonable that, when one side to an agreement seeks to have discussions about the terms of that agreement, the other side would participate in those discussions.  So far it has not been possible to have those discussions take place and get under way, but the Deputy is quite wrong in suggesting that the schemes are in suspension. A number of various claims, both departmental and general, are being processed through conciliation at departmental council and general council level at present.</P>

      <P>The disruption at various levels in the Civil Service has gone on for several weeks and the Minister must be aware that further action is pending. The Public Service Committee of Congress will not even meet the Minister because he will not reappoint the arbitrator and allow the scheme to continue. <Col N="1743" /> The scheme has been in existence for 30 years and the Minister is suspending the system to ensure that he gets his way.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is prepared today to call on the Public Service Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meet him without the three preconditions he continuously sets down.  Will he not put those three preconditions aside and call upon the committee of Congress to meet him to discuss whatever amendments he wishes to make to the scheme?  Since the Minister has refused to tell the House the amendments he has in mind I should like to ask him if it is not possible to make amendments under the present scheme with the conciliation and arbitration board sitting? Can one side not bring forward amendments? The employer representative proved very effective in the teachers' dispute where he held the matter up for several months.  I am anxious to know if the same individuals can put down amendments on behalf of the Government and discuss them without suspending the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reiterate that the scheme is not under suspension, but Deputy Ahern has made a very important point.  Of course it is possible to amend the scheme without it being suspended and that is precisely what I sought to do this time last year when I invited the Public Service Committee of Congress to meet with me to discuss possible amendments to the scheme.  Their reply at that stage was that because they had their 24th pay round at conciliation, or just about to leave conciliation to go to arbitration, they considered it inappropriate to conduct any negotiations about amending the scheme whilst a claim was in process. In fact, that is not the case and the two matters could and as I suggested to them, ought to proceed quite independently. At any one time there are always a variety of claims at some stage in the conciliation and arbitration machinery and if that was to be advanced as a reason for not having discussions then, clearly, discussions could never take place.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1744" /> that apparently is the case being advanced, and has been advanced consistently, by the staff side: that as long as a case is at conciliation or arbitration it would be inappropriate for them to discuss the terms of the scheme.  Of course, discussions on the terms of the scheme can take place totally outside any matter in process within the scheme at that time. If the Deputy, as he seems to be in his question, is endorsing the terms of the several letters which I sent to the public service committee in November of last year I very much welcome his support in that regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to respond to a suggestion.  If after the suspension we are talking about the public service unions were prepared to have on the agenda of the first meeting the conciliation and arbitration system would the Minister re-appoint the arbitrator without any further preconditions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to appear contentious I must say that the Deputy appears to have a misapprehension about how the scheme operates.  Discussions about the possible amendment of the machinery for pay determination would not be discussions which would take place under the chairmanship of a public service arbitrator.  Those discussions would take place between parties to the agreement &mdash; in other words, the Government or the employer on the one hand in the various schemes and the staff interests on the other hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For several weeks the Minister has not received any co-operation and he has not deserved it because he stuck to preconditions.  I am asking him if he got an undertaking that the conciliation and arbitration system would be on an agenda for discussion after the re-appointment of the arbitrator would he reappoint the arbitrator now?  Is it his stand that only if he gets his three preconditions &mdash; a satisfactory 25th round settlement, a deal on special awards and a commitment to negotiate changes &mdash; will he re-appoint the arbitrator?  If the <Col N="1745" /> main point is to get progress will the Minister not appoint the arbitrator on the basis that amendments to the conciliation and arbitration scheme would take place after that?  Is the answer to that question &ldquo;No&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>It has been the practice of Government at an early stage during each pay round to issue guidelines on pay generally in the economy, both private and public sector pay.  Those guidelines have normally, because of the constraints on the public finances, been of a rather restrictive nature.  The guidelines issued in respect of this pay round do not differ substantially from guidelines issued in respect of the last two or three rounds.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish very briefly to urge the House to agree with this measure and in so doing to note that the Housing Finance Agency has been an outstandingly successful option for many people who could not otherwise have obtained ownership &mdash; or, indeed, tenancy &mdash; of their own homes.  I hope the Minister might consider the revamping of the agency and the extension of its remit so that it might be able to engage more directly in the business of providing housing for people in need of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average cost of a local authority house in 1983 was of the order of £34,000, a cost which needs a sum of £4,500 in perpetuity to service it.  My argument is that it is not unreasonable for the State to consider whether the present system of funding and construction of dwellings, particularly in the local authority housing sector, is appropriately delivered.  There certainly was a time when the local authorities had to deal with housing construction and housing needs as they now do, <Col N="1885" /> but the agency has shown us that there is a demand out there for people to own their own homes.  That agency has, to some extent, pointed the way.  I suggest that the Minister might consider, even on a pilot scheme basis, whether it would be possible to take a portion of the present capital allocation for housing which is expended by the local authorities on behalf of his Department and give it direct to people on housing lists in the context of 100 per cent housing loans which would be repaid over as many years as necessary by people who would then own their own homes.</P>
    <P>The irony of the present situation, which might appear a more stringent economic approach on first glance, is that the total income from rented dwellings at present covers approximately half the cost of maintenance and makes no contribution at all to the capital cost.  The result is that the Housing Finance Agency option, extended to its logical conclusion, would be socially preferable.  It would mean that we would not continue to perpetuate an arrangement whereby there were two classes of people &mdash; those who owned their own homes in the private estate area and those who rented them in the local authority housing estate area.  It would be economically far more beneficial in the sense that it is not unreasonable to suggest that the present arrangement, whereby there is a perpetual £4,500 annual grant escalating in accordance with inflation for every local authority dwelling, regardless of the incomes of the people in the dwelling, is one that simply cannot be sustained in the medium or long term.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of proper social development, of the rights of the individuals who are in such dwellings, of the harmonious and integrated social mix, of sensible economics, it is far more reasonable to suggest that the vast sums of capital grants in due course be converted, in large measure if not in total, to direct loans to people who would repay them in an orderly fashion.  Probably this would mean that the mechanism of the local authority as an agent in developing, designing and constructing houses would <Col N="1886" /> no longer be appropriate but that the local authority would, in fact, become a building society.  All I am asking at this stage is that the Housing Finance Agency be guided in considering whether such an approach would be wise.  I am convinced from long experience of local authority housing that such an approach is not only desirable but essential if we are to get away from the ghetto mentality which at present surrounds our approach to local authority housing &mdash; an approach which may have been reasonable in trying to deal with the crisis in housing ten or 20 years ago but is no longer justifiable in that context.  It is producing very significant social disadvantage in terms of bringing together in particular areas residents who have in many cases particular types of difficulties.  Anybody who looks at the present inner city of Dublin, where, I think I am right in saying, no new private housing has been built between the canals during the last ten years, will see what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>My wish is that the agency, in continuing its successful work, will be asked to consider extending its remit a little further, or that some other mechanism be found which would give people not just a roof over their heads but their own roofs over their heads, and that the taxpayer be no longer asked to subsidise that unnecessarily.  Obviously, the taxpayer will have to continue subsidising where there is true need and where people cannot be asked to cope with that themselves.  I proffer these remarks with respect to the Minister, whom I know to be very concerned about local authority finance in a number of respects and local authority housing finance in particular.  I would be happy to develop these thoughts at greater length on another occasion when perhaps a more appropriate Bill than this might proffer itself for consideration.  In the interim, if one looks at the vast sums being spent on the local authority housing sector one is reasonably entitled now to ask, could we be spending that amount of money in a better way?  I suggest that we could, perhaps along the lines just mentioned by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, as the Minister stated, increases to £500 million the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow in making loans.  I wish to raise the matter already raised of the impression of the majority of people about this type of loan, that they will have very small repayments to make in the early stages.  People might be under the illusion that this is a type of loan for which, particularly, young people should go because we are talking about a minimum repayment in year one of £125 a month, or £30 a week.  That sounds very attractive when one can borrow £22,500 under this scheme or up to £27,000 if one is a local authority tenant or in the special category.</P>
      <P>The figures made available from the agency and through local authorities would suggest that with £125 per month in year one and £1,257 per month in year 30, one would be paying ten times the amount after 30 years, if paying 20 per cent of income.  That frightens off people when they read through the actual scheme.</P>
      <P>I know it is mentioned in the actual hand-out from local authorities that people should consider choosing to make a higher repayment so that the level of the outstanding debt is not increased.  I know that most local authorities advise people that they should pay more than the 20 per cent of their income but it is now nearly imperative that all local authorities do that because you can borrow £27,000 in the special category areas with an income limit of £10,000 whereas the SDA loan can only give you a maximum loan of £16,000 and the repayments will be £43 or £44 a week over a fixed 30 year period.  There seems to be something wrong when you can borrow so much money under this scheme and find yourself for the first 13 or 14 years paying a subsidised amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the people who operate those schemes on behalf of the agency, namely the local authorities. The housing section of many local authorities are up to their eyes operating the SDA loans and the disabled person's <Col N="1888" /> housing grants as well as other local authority programmes and for the last few years they have been operating this scheme.  They have to get involved in a lot of calculations to try to help out people. People may decide to pay more than what is required under the scheme.  Local authorities also have to get involved in deducting the amount of new house grants paid and the actual mortgage subsidy which is taken off the loan.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of assessing the amount of loan to be offered to an applicant in the special category area, I would like the Minister to look at a situation where a person who is building his own house goes to the local authority and finds that very little value is placed on the actual site where he is building.  In order to get over the problem where only 90 per cent of the value of the house can be borrowed, if the Minister cannot bring in a scheme where a person gets a 100 per cent loan on the value of the house he should ensure that a reasonable figure is placed on the site where the house is being built.  I find that a very low figure is being put on the value of the site and this will not help out applicants who want to get more than 90 per cent of the value of the house when applying for a loan. There are many local authority sites available in every county.  The local authorities should be encouraged to promote the sale of these sites and give people an opportunity to borrow more than the value of the sites.  If those people went to other agencies they would probably get more money apart from the county council SDA scheme.</P>
    <P>I have always been impressed by the fact that the Housing Finance Agency have a mortgage protection policy.  The actual terms of the policy arranges for this protection for every loan advanced to cover the borrower in the event of death or permanent disability.  Only 0.25 per cent is added to the interest rate to cover the cost.  It is very important to have this in the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  It is not in the ordinary county council SDA loan scheme and people have to take out their own insurance policy for mortgage protection.  It is also <Col N="1889" /> very welcome that in this scheme when a person is unemployed the payments can be deferred.</P>
    <P>There is no mention in the Bill in regard to where the borrower decides to resell his house and he will not benefit from appreciation in the value of the house in the same way as a person who has an ordinary mortgage will.  I would like the local authorities to talk to people who are making very low repayments and who obviously will have to make a substantial increase in their payments near the end of their loans.  The people in local authority houses can borrow up to £27,000.  Such people can also get a £5,000 grant to vacate their local authority houses if they find new houses and are borrowing money.  Those people will obviously get new house grants.  The people in the special category can only borrow £22,500.  The Minister should ask the agency to equalise this situation and allow the £27,000 to any applicant who, because of his income or because the house he is buying is 90 per cent of the value, can also avail of the £27,000, because it is hardly fair to confine this loan to special category applicants or local authority tenants.</P>
    <P>This loan will be attractive while inflation is low but if inflation increases people will find great difficulty in making repayments. In cases where local authorities have sites I would like to see them sold for building.  I would also like to see the loans, which can be paid in two instalments, being paid in three or four instalments. We are talking about a considerable amount of money, whether it is £22,500 or £27,000, and it should be possible to make the payments in three or four instalments.  Our entire housing policy must be looked at with a view to improvement.</P>
    <P>However, we will not be allowed to speak about that on this limited Bill, but I should like to say briefly that many more people would be interested in the scheme if the improvements Deputies have been suggesting could be brought about.  We might be able to get the agency to make some improvements.  They have pointed out how difficult it can be for <Col N="1890" /> borrowers who decide to sell their old houses in order to buy new ones.  They come back to the agency for another loan but there is a condition on Form No. 2 that they must approach the inspector of taxes and say they did not claim tax relief on repayments.  Obviously, that would debar a person from going to the agency for a second loan, which is exclusively for first time buyers.  I should like to see the scheme broadened to cover people who want to sell their old houses and buy or construct new ones.</P>
    <P>Under the SDA schemes we have grants and subsidies for new houses and for reconstruction work on existing houses, but under this scheme the floor area must not be more than 125 square metres.  Under county council reconstruction schemes the figure of £6,500 is confined to new houses and I am glad that under this Bill we are increasing the grant to £5,000.  I hope that later when we have an opportunity to talk about local authority housing policy we will have a general debate on housing policy and include in it conditions under this Bill.  I suggest that the agency might draw to the attention of young borrowers the pitfalls attached to the scheme if they do not repay more in the early years of the loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I welcome the Bill because it increases the amount of money the HFA may borrow for loans for the construction of houses.  The present borrowing level is about £200 million.  I should like to refer to a paper prepared for the Construction Industry Federation by Mr. D. K. McCarthy.  It states:</P>
      <P>The degree of flexibility that local authorities could enjoy with a system of capital grants or income supplements could be seen by reference to total expenditure in 1984 of £211 million: 6,000 house completions and work in progress on 8,000 houses by the end of the year.  In terms of completions the average approximate was £35,000 in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the same in 1983.  There is a small <Col N="1891" /> reference in that document to which others have been referring, that is, that capital expenditure in 1984 by local authorities would provide capital grants of £7,000 per household on the waiting list which would cater for 30,000 families. The net effects of comments made by Deputies from both sides in relation to the possibility of increasing grants and thereby bringing more people in who could afford to buy their own houses is that there is general agreement with this scheme, and even though Fianna Fáil objected strenously in the past, and from time to time sniped at it, there is no doubt that if and when they get back to office this scheme will be kept going.</P>
    <P>After the short experience we have had with this scheme, have we learned any lessons from it?  In that regard I will confine my comments to the purpose of the Bill.  The Bill provides for an increase in the sum to £500 million and it will provide better value for money than the Government have been able to get from the HFA.  It is difficult to know where these schemes come from but eventually they are introduced by a Minister and many people make suggestions from time to time but they seem to fall on deaf ears. The ones I have made have, but I have seen in the schemes one or two ingredients of what I suggested.  I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will refer to some of these points and that he and other Ministers will open a channel whereby backbenchers and others could contribute to the policy of the HFA, particularly Members of the House who have a considerable amount of experience of local authority housing through people with housing needs coming to them.  One could say with confidence that such Deputies know what they are talking about.</P>
    <P>We could address ourselves to immediate difficulties that can be met in the working of the scheme.  One of them is bridging finance.  People are encouraged to take out bridging loans for the £5,000 grant in order to get into their houses.  It is natural that the builders encourage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are certain limits to this debate.  The Deputy has read the Bill.  It is a very limited amending one and does not permit a large scale development of a discussion on housing in general.  I said that to every Deputy last week.  I am only asking the Deputy to co-operate with the Chair in that matter. The Deputy's attitude of remaining on his feet is all right provided he is in order. I am not stopping him.</P>

      <P>The way I read the Bill is that its main purpose is to increase to £500 million the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow for the payment of loans for the construction or building of houses.  I submit that, therefore, I can talk about how the £300 million extra can be spent, how the £200 million has been spent to date and whether or not we have got value for that money, and to include any suggestions as to how value could be got for taxpayers' contributions and how we could improve the housing situation generally.  That is what I am endeavouring to do.  If I go off the track &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to remain within them.  I did mention bridging finance which constitutes a great problem for many people.  There are hundreds of people being walked into bridging situations they cannot afford.  That relates to the £5,000 grant and the main loan for houses.  Prior to the inception of this Housing Finance Agency these would be people who would have been unable to afford to buy their own houses. They were encouraged to do so by the establishment of the agency.  Having carefully calculated their income, perhaps that of the husband and wife, they go to buy but then find themselves in <Col N="1894" /> a bridging situation in which they may remain for several months.</P>
      <P>There are various reasons for that.  One is that very often the legal department are not in liaison with the loans department. The loans department may be saying to the couple concerned that they are all right, not realising that the legal department may be three months behind, causing people incredible hardship.  Certainly in the case of many people I have met, had they the chance again, they would not allow themselves to become involved in such borrowing.  They go around advising others likewise.  We should advise people.  I know builders cannot be blamed because they are endeavouring to get the money to survive.  People should be advised not to become involved in bridging finance which will involve them in much trouble.</P>
      <P>Some people pay over £100 per week by way of bridging finance whereas, under the terms of the lending of the Housing Finance Agency they will end up paying 20 per cent of their income. They cannot afford such bridging finance and that may continue for months on end.  We have an obligation to inform people of prospective delays, of the current situation, and endeavour to sort it out.  I should like to warn people not to enter into bridging finance commitments. They are told and believe in their naivete the position will be sorted out in two to three weeks when often it takes anything from three to five months.  They borrow money from sharp money lenders, credit unions and banks in an endeavour to survive.  As I understood the concept of the Housing Finance Agency when established, that was not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had some examples of solicitors not appearing to understand that the obligation is on them to contact the relevant local authority and formally request the cheque.  Very often when people come to me they are being told by their solicitor that their cheque is not ready.  I have made inquiries and I understand that it is up to their solicitors to formally request the cheque, that local authorities do not inform solicitors.  Solicitors should advise <Col N="1895" /> their clients.  Very often they act for purchaser and builder, an anomaly I should like to see removed.  I do not think a solicitor can act for both, treating each fairly, especially if he is acting for a builder building a lot of houses when his job will be to get people into those houses for the builder.  He is not then acting in the interests of the purchaser.</P>
    <P>Many of these will be people who cannot afford to be out of pocket even to the extent of £100 in loans.  These may be people who have extreme difficulty in making ends meet who, very often, are hungry and do not understand the benefits of a drop of 1 per cent or an increase in a grant of £300 million.  That means nothing to them if they cannot afford to put food on the table or pay the rent at the end of the week.  They may have the dream of moving into their own home but we have an obligation to render the realisation of that dream as easy as possible for them which may entail their being careful about their financial arrangements until they eventually gain possession of a house.  Certainly it is not their intention to go into debt.</P>
    <P>I might give one short example of the case of a lady who came to me.  She was in occupation of her new house.  The corporation decided, unknown to her, that she owed them approximately £400 or £500 arrears of rent and they would not release the relevant grant.  That woman had to obtain bridging finance until she obtained the £5,000 grant.  It transpired that she had paid twice that amount but the corporation still would not release the grant.  That is just not right.</P>
    <P>Because of the success of the Housing Finance Agency we are experiencing the great move out of local authority areas, very often to private housing estates.  We should consider the future implications of that trend, the desirability of getting people out of those estates.  That raises another question which the Minister and the Housing Finance Agency should examine.  What kind of housing do we want for our people?  What should be the end result of the Housing Finance <Col N="1896" /> Agency operating in an ideal situation? Should it mean the ending altogether of local authority houses?  Should we try to encourage people to buy their own homes anywhere they like because that carries great advantages?</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt spoke about increasing the loan to £27,000 and Deputy Keating spoke about 100 per cent loans, very worthy suggestions.  The Minister should consider the cessation as far as possible of local authority building, allowing people to purchase private dwelling anywhere they like.  I represent a constituency through which both canals flow and I have given that matter very serious thought.  I have looked at the deterioration of the city of Dublin and housing around Dublin, due mainly to lack of proper planning.  In that respect I might highlight the great advantages to be had from this agency.</P>
    <P>I am glad that under the provisions of this Bill the House is requested to increase the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow in order to provide more houses for our people.  The maximum Housing Finance Agency loan is £22,500 and that effectively determines: (a) the size of the house and its price, (b) the location of the house, (c) the people who are in a position to buy the house, (d) those who must look to the local authority for housing and (e) the amount of personal savings necessary or the amount of additional borrowing necessary.  A person on a salary of £7,500 per annum can get a loan of £22,500. With this and the minimum of savings or bank borrowings, a person could buy a house costing £26,000 which appears to be the base in current market conditions. The position is much the same as it was a year ago which means that house prices have remained stable.</P>
    <P>A person with a salary of £5,700 per annum can only obtain a loan of £17,100 and, given that people on such salaries have very little, if any, savings, their maximum expectation would be to buy a house costing £20,000 and there are very few of those.  If, however, a person wished to purchase the typical house on today's market, he would have the <Col N="1897" /> impossible task of finding a further £6,500 allowing for the grant from the Department of the Environment.  Therefore, although the person on a salary of £7,500 receives a loan of £17,100, when tax has been deducted there is not much difference between him and the person on the lower salary.</P>
    <P>The person on a lower income can never realistically hope to buy a new house in present circumstances, whereas if he was entitled to the maximum loan, a point which the last two speakers made, he could have a sporting chance of home ownership.  If the maximum loan were increased to £25,000 &mdash; Deputy Kitt mentioned the sum of £27,000 &mdash; and made available to people on salaries of £5,500 and upwards, it would transform the housing market.  If people had a greater chance to own their own houses, through the medium of higher National Housing Finance Agency loans, local authority lists should decline.  It now costs about £40,000 to build a local authority house. It could be argued that it would pay the Department of the Environment to further grant-aid applicants for NHF loans since they would no longer be a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>The implications for employment in a resuscitated building industry following restructuring of the NHF <i>modus operandi</i> are very obvious.  The advantages are that existing tenants would give up their houses and purchase in the private sector, thereby freeing local authority houses for needy tenants.  That is happening at present because of the grant of £5,000 for those who can afford to get out.  However, getting out is not the sole objective and I will elaborate on that later on.  It would mean the complete transformation of Dublin city of which I can speak and would also do the same for the rest of the country.  Of course we can only estimate how many people would avail of this opportunity but we could gauge the numbers in the new bracket by their earnings.</P>
    <P>It would also effectively do away with local authority and corporation houses as we know them and speaker after speaker <Col N="1898" /> mentioned this.  It would free large numbers of people at present in administration, architecture, engineering and quantity surveying in local authorities and, without cost to the Government, it would boost private sector building and financing.  I should also mention that this would not cost the local authorities anything either.  What is local authority rent per unit as against the repayment per unit?  These figures are readily available. Given the extraordinary things which £300 million can do if used properly, this is the time to think about suggestions which I made.  It will enable large numbers to buy the house of their choice, in the area of their choice, which is not the case at present because they have no savings and, therefore, no deposit.</P>
    <P>As many speakers mentioned, it would relieve maintenance and management of these houses which would result in huge savings to the Exchequer, tens of millions of pounds.  It would increase building to market demand and would not be restricted by the amount of money available to local authorities and the building programme. It would enable more houses to be built for the same money and would at least double housing in corporation and county council areas all over the country.  I do not think this has been considered up to this but this Bill and the amendment make this an opportune time to review the situation.  It would also eliminate the suspicions of the cartel which, it is alleged, is operating in local authority housing.  It would also question the present costs to corporations and local authorities of building houses about which private developers dispute and have disputed in the past.  There are many social advantages which also must be taken into consideration in allocating this huge sum of money from the Exchequer which the Minister is asking the House to approve.  For example, there would be no ghettoes and it would remove the stigma from those people who think there is one of living in a local authority area. It abolishes the degrading points system which, although it may be necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It opens the possibility of providing houses for the needy and paying rent only on corporation and local authority housing on the savings made. It means that people would no longer be a burden on the State.  The savings can be quantified in millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>Every Member who holds a clinic knows the trauma, deprivation and hardship caused to people on housing lists. This would also introduce self-help in place of handouts and would give great hope to young people who want to get married and to set up home.  It would pay the Government to invest this money with insurance companies.  It would also control the increase in house prices by builders by means of the certificate of reasonable value.  Given the row that was kicked up here regarding the sum of £300 million given to the National Development Corporation, it would release some of the £450 million which is in private hands in the construction industry.  It is another example of how we could get masses of people back to work and increase the confidence of the entire community. It would satisfy to a great extent the demands of house builders and allow the Government more money for the productive and manufacturing sector.  I should like to hear the Minister's answers to these questions.</P>
      <P>The National Housing Finance Agency loan should be increased to £25,000 and it should be available to all with incomes between £5,500 and £9,000 per annum. In order to ensure that the purchaser would own his house sooner and to be more in line with building society practice, there is a strong argument for sliding the 20 per cent salary requirement to a maximum of 23 per cent over seven years. That is an answer to the point about reducing the ceiling to wage earners of £5,500, many of whom it is stated would not own their homes in their lifetime. Why should people on an income of £5,500 be excluded?  By including them we would answer many of the problems in the private and the public sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1900" /> What I have suggested would be in line with the Government's policy regarding private sector investment.  What we need is a team effort.  Any person with a job will earn a minimum of £5,500: the average industrial wage is much higher.  This means everyone could have the opportunity of buying a house.  It also means that we will not be selecting people with the worst health, financial and educational problems, putting them on a list and putting all of them at the same time into estates, thus creating enormous problems.  What is happening at the moment is that a healthy person is asked almost to degrade himself in order to secure enough points to get into the system.  He is nearly asked to become ill to increase his points.  It is a bad system and we should do away with it at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency has proved a success.  Before we give the extra £300 million we should consider the best way to go forward.  I was born and bred in Dublin and I am sick of looking at its dilapidated state.  As I said last week, it is falling into the river.  Huge problems are arising every year and to a large extent they are occurring because we are not anticipating the future needs. We could eliminate many of the problems by proper planning and by carefully monitoring the housing market.  Dublin County Council have done very good work throughout the county.  They have had a good mix of local authority and private housing in manageable estates that are landscaped.  These estates have been laid out beautifully and people love to live in them.  Dublin Corporation should get their act together.  They will not listen to anyone.  They will not follow the example of Dublin County Council. They will not try to plan their estates properly but they go on willy-nilly and destroy everything.</P>

We have the power; we know the problem: why can we not come up with a solution to it. If it was in the private sector it would have been solved long ago.  I have not been able to get this across and I have to mention it in the House in the hope that the matter will even be discussed.  If the Minister wants an extra £300 million I am entitled to put forward my tuppence worth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>About the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are talking about whether the Minister should get that £300 million.  The Minister can ignore me &mdash;<Col N="1902" /> this is usually what happens &mdash; but on behalf of my constituents and of the people throughout the country I must put forward a case.  I will continue to do that as long as I am here, even if it is uncomfortable to listen to what I have to say.  That is my job and that is what I will do, regardless of the cost to me.</P>
      <P>I have heard some very weak answers to some of the questions raised.  I know I am limited in what I can say in relation to the overall problem.  Nevertheless this is one of the two page documents that has come to the House involving, in one case, the nodding through, a term used by correspondents, of £100 million and which resulted in Members being criticised for not examining carefully what we were nodding through.  For example, we nodded through £80 million for Aer Lingus and we are talking here about £300 million.  Is it the attitude that because the Bill is only a two page document containing four sections that we should not spend too much time on it, that because there may not be many people in the House, it can be put through without detailed examination?  The Minister may not have to come back to the House for some time in respect of any extension of the power in this legislation because he can increase the lending to £500 million with the permission of the Minister for Finance but I wish to hear how the money is being spent and why it is being spent.  It may be some time before we have an opportunity of reviewing how the money is being expended.</P>
      <P>I was told by the Minister for Finance on another occasion here that rents of local authority houses make no contribution towards loan charges and meet only half the management and maintenance cost of the dwellings.  That Minister reminds me also that our priority must be to review and monitor local authority housing costs as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I hope my point has not been lost by the attempts of the Chair to keep me on the straight and narrow.  I appreciate that any new scheme of grants, whether in the form of capital grants or subsidies, towards house purchase will tend to increase house prices and thereby erode to some extent the benefit that would otherwise accrue to the purchaser.  However, I think I have answered that question well by saying that this is something that can be controlled by the CRV system.  In the past couple of years the price of housing has not increased to any appreciable extent and has reduced in some instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We always seem to come back to this question of operating difficulties but I should like to take the opportunity to deal with all these schemes in the light of any difficulty that may arise.  All I am asking, and all I ever ask, is that they be considered carefully, that they be deliberated on and that a decision be made on <Col N="1905" /> them.  What concerns me is that often these schemes are not even considered.  I have made submissions on other occasions both to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment in relation to this kind of scheme. The then Minister for the Environment, who is now the Minister for Energy, told me that he accepted fully the principle underlying my suggestion.  That was essentially that those in receipt of modest incomes should be given a better chance to buy houses for themselves and in that way reduce the local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me also on that occasion that after we had more experience of the operations of the Housing Finance Agency it might be possible to increase their limit but that at the time he thought it was a little risky to contemplate doing that.  I understood that, but that was more than two years ago.  We have now had two and a half years experience of this scheme and it is time to review it with a little courage.  The Housing Finance Agency concept was a step in the right direction but I have heard people say that many problems have stemmed from it in the sense that certain local authority areas have been denuded as a result of applications under the HFA scheme.  It would be a much easier procedure and much more worthwhile if people could buy houses where they wished.  We know that local authorities cannot build houses as cheaply as they can be built by the private sector.  It would be in the interest of the Exchequer if people, on being allotted local authority houses, were told that they must maintain them themselves.  There is no reason for not examining the prospect of such a scheme now, before most of Leinster is blotted by the indiscriminate and undisciplined building, especially in the Dublin Corporation area.  That sort of situation could be corrected to the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by way of the agency and through his Department, has enormous influence in this respect.  The Minister of State has long experience of local authority housing in Dublin city.  There is a <Col N="1906" /> great deal of expertise available, much of which is not utilised.  It was left to the architectural department of UCD to undertake a study on the quays in Dublin. Studies undertaken both by that body and by students from Bolton Street have shamed the Departments but yet no action has been taken.  We should switch to private housing because we all need better value.  This change also would solve a great social problem.  By using the public and private sectors in this area we could put large numbers of people back to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency scheme was brought in primarily to give people who could not acquire finance through any other source an opportunity to acquire homes for themselves. The intent behind that is laudable, but once that principle is adopted everything should be done to make the path easy for those who wish to avail of the HFA scheme.</P>
      <P>One point which is causing very serious problems is the question of delays.  The law's delays are notorious and go back hundreds of years and were written about centuries ago.  But the delays which are taking place today are due, I think, to lack of staff in the legal departments of the main local authorities.  My knowledge is confined to the Dublin area, but I understand similar situations pertain in other urban councils around the country. For example, from the time the title deeds are sent in to the Dublin council law offices, it takes anything from six to ten weeks before they are even looked at, let alone processed or the title examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For people going forward for a Housing Finance Agency loan, time is of the essence.  Every week is a crucial factor. In many cases these delays are literally crippling young people who are starting out in life and buying houses.  They are building up debts because they had to go to the banks for bridging finance.  I do not know whether these delays arise from bureaucratic shortcomings and inadequacies of staff, whether approved by the Department or whatever.  There are <Col N="1907" /> many legal people unemployed &mdash; solicitors, solicitors assistants and clerks &mdash; who could be taken into the law offices of the local authorities.  This would enable the title deeds to be dealt with in an appropriate period &mdash; one week at the outside ought to be more than enough. At present we are told, shamefacedly, by employees of the legal departments of local authorities that the papers had arrived but were put at the bottom of the bundle and because of severe pressure of staff, it would be at least two months before they reached the top and were allocated to somebody.  As Deputy Skelly pointed out, bridging finance can cost £100 a week.  That is a crippling factor for people who are trying to avail of this scheme.  What is the point in purporting to hold out a helping hand to these people if at the same time we are putting unnecessary difficulties in their way?</P>
    <P>It is not as if the legal departments of the local authorities provide their services free, not at all.  They charge for examining the title and these, fees have to be paid on completion of the work.  If any Minister or civil servant thinks there is an economy to be made by clamping down on the necessary staff to examine title deeds, then all I can say is that this is false economy.  People waiting for their loans would be delighted to pay the fees to have the papers cleared and there would not be any cost involved to either central or local government.  I do not know why it is so difficult for anybody to see a simple point like that.  If the necessary staff were provided we would avoid the present position which is reaching the proportions of a scandal &mdash; this is true in the Dublin area.  The burden this delay places on people looking for loans has to be seen to be believed.  It is tragic and pathetic.  It reduces young men and women to tears when they see their chances of getting a home slipping away because of this bureaucratic nonsense.</P>
    <P>It takes longer than necessary to process applications.  I do not know why it has to take four, five, six, seven or eight weeks to process these applications. There seems to be too much bureaucracy <Col N="1908" /> at that end of the procedure as well.  A fortnight or three weeks at the outset should be adequate to deal with these matters, assuming all the necessary documentation has been provided and that the papers are in order.  I ask the Minister of State to have some inquiries carried out to see if the procedures cannot be streamlined. As I said, time is of the essence and there is no reason why, if everything was properly organised and adequate staff was available, the whole operation could not be completed within six weeks from the time a contract to buy the house is signed until the deed is completed.  At present, the sky is the limit.  It can take three, four or even five months to complete such a transaction &mdash; nine months is not unusual and a longer period is not unheard of.  One must take into account the fact that some legal officers are not the fastest workers, and if a prospective purchaser is unfortunate enough to get a combination of these circumstances he can be in trouble.  Many people have lost the opportunity of getting a house as a result of such happenings.  That is a tragic situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with financing from the Housing Finance Agency.  Efforts ought to be made to broaden the availability of lending for house purchasing from other institutions also.  The responsibility for providing funds for house purchasing should not fall on the Housing Finance Agency alone, on the local authority alone, or even on the building societies alone.  The other major financial institutions in the State &mdash; the banks, the insurance companies, the commercial banks and so on &mdash; should have a responsibility to provide at least some appreciable measure of finance per year out of their resources to enable people to get long term loans to buy houses.</P>
    <P>Years ago the insurance companies and some of the banks used to put aside a reasonable sum of money for this form of lending, but that seems to have diminished over the years and very little is provided by the banks or the insurance companies for this purpose.  That should not be allowed.  Appropriate constraints, be they official or unofficial or both, <Col N="1909" /> ought to be put on those institutions to ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities in this regard &mdash; and they have responsibilities.  Let it not be said by any bank or financial institution in trying to push away the undesirability of this form of investment, that they are not meant to do that kind of lending or that that type of lending is not suitable for their purposes. That should not be acceptable.  When it suits them they can invest in the most outrageous forms of investment, from satellites and racehorses to dubious insurance companies that go broke and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a fair point. The Chair's objection to what I am saying is not well taken and I do not mind explaining why.  We are talking about the provision of money for the Housing Finance Agency.  The amount of money that will be provided for the Housing Finance Agency to give loans for houses will be determined by what funds will be made available from other funding institutions for the same purposes.  If the Bill seeks £300 million and £100 million were provided by the banks and institutions, that much less would be needed under the terms of this Bill.  Therefore it is fair to advert to the fact that lending institutions make other untoward investments. This is a fair point in the context of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The banks can make outrageous investments that end up in the lap of the taxpayer.  If they can do that <Col N="1910" /> they can certainly earmark a relatively small amount of capital, be it £20 million or £30 million per year per major bank or financial institution, towards providing long term lending for at least some people to get their houses.  They can do that at a substantially more favourable rate of interest than people have to pay under the HFA loans scheme which, when all is said and done and when the reality is added up over the years' spread, is a too heavy rate of interest.  It is too high for many people to bear, spread over a period as it is.  I take the point that the essence of the Housing Finance Agency scheme is that it is made easy in the first years.  That is fair enough, but the fact remains that the interest is charged at the full heavy rate on the nail.  Although the person has to repay only 20 per cent of his earnings each year the fact remains that the excess he is being charged is not written off by the Housing Finance Agency, but added on to the bill and that bill escalates with terrifying severity to a massive figure.  The system frightens me. I said previously that when the scheme was introduced it would give rise to some appalling problems for quite a number of people in a few years' time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It will give rise to a situation where the debt owing on the house will be considerably more than the house will be worth.  One can visualise a situation where a person may be moved in his job to another part of the country or will have to move house due to family circumstances.  Many people who have taken out their mortgages a few years ago under the HFA scheme will find themselves with a house they cannot sell because the amount they owe on it will be considerably in excess of the value of the house.  They will find themselves, with inflation taken into account, living in a house worth £40,000 with a debt of £90,000 and yet they will be forced to leave it for good reasons.  The complexity built in there staggers me.  Many houses will be abandoned and vandalised.  There will be a serious problem and it will take <Col N="1911" /> some unravelling.  It would be far better if in our loans schemes the repayments and the repayment period were organised in such a way that at least some small amount of capital is paid back at the end of each year so that the person who is paying back the money will be buying back some small equity in the house so that after a number of years when he goes to sell the house he will be in a position to pay what is owing and not find himself in debt.  The present system will cause great troubles and I fear we will be hearing a lot about it here in this House as the years roll on.</P>
      <P>The whole system has thrown up quite a number of anomalies.  There are cases where a tenant of a local authority house wishes to buy out the house in which he is living as a council tenant.  We would all be in favour of facilitating such a tenant, but we have the strange situation that the one house the tenant cannot buy under the HFA scheme is the very house of which he is the tenant.  The only scheme the council tenant can avail of to buy out that house is the local authority's sale scheme, but the rate of repayment under that scheme, if the house was built recently, would be astronomical and an uneconomic proposition for the tenant, yet he cannot avail of the £5,000 grant and the HFA scheme to buy out his own house.  The tenant must move and buy a house elsewhere; he can buy any house other than the house in which he is living. That raises the question of the values of the local authority houses sold in this way.  When the local authorities are selling houses it should be done at the value of the house and not on the artificial basis of what it cost the local authority to build it.  All arbitrations and valuations other than that one situation are done on the value of the dwelling concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The HFA scheme has a role to play but it needs some considerable care and adaptation as it is developed.  Many people are confused and do not fully understand the differences between the small dwellings' scheme and the HFA scheme.  They are both complex in the nature of the operation and greater <Col N="1912" /> efforts will have to be made to simplify both schemes so that the communication between the local authorities and prospective borrowers under these schemes can be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which increases the borrowing facilities of the HFA.  I pay tribute to the Housing Finance Agency in its very substantial growth.  Only last week at the Small Businesses Committee we had oral evidence from Mr. Jim O'Hehir, Chief Executive of the HFA, to whom I pay tribute for the fine job he has done and for being particularly helpful to Deputies.  Mr. O'Hehir has presided over one of the most astonishing growths in any financial agency in this country.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise a few aspects of the mortgage finance market.  We must realise that the whole need and genesis of the HFA are based on a failure of banks and building societies to provide the types of mortgage finance required. Last year the purchase of 12,759 newly constructed houses was undertaken with mortgage finance.  Building societies provided mortgage finance for 53.5 per cent of this total, namely 6,850 houses.  The associated banks provided 349 loans or for only 3 per cent of the total.  The societies provided mortgage finance for 17 times the rate of that of the banks.  Last week the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses interviewed the banks and AIB came up with the very plausible figure of £341 million that they had lent in the home loans mortgage finance sector. The Bank of Ireland had £250 million for house purchase.  That does not disguise the fact that a big problem in both the investment market and the mortgage market is to get private sector finance directly into mortgage finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to study that a little to see where the problems arise.  I am referring particularly to the Bank of Ireland mortgage savings scheme.  They introduced a scheme under which an individual saving with them would be guaranteed a mortgage.  That has not been outstandingly successful and one must ask why.  These very same banks through <Col N="1913" /> perhaps pension funds or insurance corporations that they are associated with are investing and getting a premium return on HFA stocks which are being sold to the investment market, and they cannot become directly involved in the business.  The banks' money goes in through the HFA, taking out expensive index-linked stocks.  That situation can be explained quite simply by the anomaly that the banks must suffer in the investment market.  If as a young person I am interested in taking out a mortgage, the reason why I would not invest in the banks' savings mortgage scheme is clear. For every £1 over £50 that I invest the rate of return that I get is invariably taxed at a minimum rate of 35p in the £, whereas if I invest that money with a building society the tax is of the order of 28.5 per cent deduction.  It is clear that it would not pay me to invest in a savings mortgage scheme with the bank simply because I could get a better rate of return tax effectively from the building society. If I wanted to invest that money in insurance I would get a tax free allowance on that investment as one would for VHI or other forms of insurance, whereas if I invest in the savings mortgage scheme I will get no tax relief.  Therefore, we have a double tax disincentive for investing savings in a bank for a savings mortgage scheme.  Therefore, the banks tell me, quite rightly, that if the tax code was changed they could increase their mortgage finance from its existing 3 per cent share to a far higher level.  We could achieve an objective of getting greater mortgage finance availability, more houses built and greater availability of mortgages to young couples if we looked at the tax code.  The building societies provide 53 per cent of mortgage finance. Local authorities built 3,700 houses last year through finance, the HFA accounted for 1,760, and the only people who are not pulling their weight in that scenario who can do so are the associated banks.  Therefore, I ask the Minister of State when he goes to the Minister for Finance seeking this extra money which we are accommodating through this amendment to say that another way of <Col N="1914" /> doing the same thing is to call in the associated banks and tell them that we want them to develop a savings mortgage scheme whereby if people invest with the banks they are guaranteed a mortgage but that there is an impediment to that. If the saver invests in that he is discriminated against in the rate of return of dividend on his deposit.  In other words, he could get an increased tax free allowance if he put the money into life assurance or if he put it into building societies he would get a higher rate of return.</P>
    <P>I understand that under the present legislation the finance that can go into the HFA is restricted solely to life assurance corporations and pension funds.  It could have been deemed at the time of the preparation of that legislation that those two institutions are interested predominantly in a longer term maturing investment and they want a secure hedge against inflation for maturing life policies or pensions that will mature when people retire.  However, we must look at a situation that is changing now.  The building societies are investing in the order of £400 million in Government gilts at present.  Is it not ironic that a lending sector that is perceptively there solely for the purpose of providing mortgage finance &mdash; the Big Four building societies &mdash; would not be asked or even allowed to put, say, £10 million per annum into the HFA?  The same applies to the banks.  There is a case for de-restricting to change the current situation where only life assurance corporations or pension funds are allowed to invest in HFA stock so that banks and building societies will also be allowed to invest in those stocks.  That would create a more competitive edge in terms of demand and probably it would mean that the HFA would not have to pay the very creamy premium rates they are paying at present.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in the investment market <i>vis-à-vis</i> mortgage finance.  We need two tax changes to get the associated banks more involved and to derestrict the finance that can go into HFA stocks.</P>
    <P>Turning to the mortgage side of the HFA we see a number of interesting <Col N="1915" /> things.  The HFA originally said that they would charge a mortgage at 14, 16 or 18 per cent of gross income.  Very quickly they decided to charge 20 per cent across the board and in my view, from their own perspective, very wisely.  I understand from the statistics or mortgages that the vast majority of them are getting loans which are three times their gross income and are paying 20 per cent on that.  In the first year there is a gross repayment to the agency of 6.66 per cent which means that the net receipts to the agency are 5.25 per cent once the administrative and other costs are taken out.</P>
    <P>The yield to the agency on the first year of the mortgage is less than they are currently paying on the stocks which is 4 per cent above inflation.  Therefore, there is a deficit which the agency will have to finance.  Consequently, if inflation rises mortgages with the agency will find themselves in a position where they are tied-in tenants and not mortgagees because the rate of repayment and the rate at which they are reducing the principal and the interest in the formative years on their mortgage will not match the rate of inflation.  I am very worried that people with mortgages with the agency will find themselves in a position that their flexibility of moving house in the event of changing employment or change in circumstances will not be very good three years later.  The mortgage could be £28,000 outstanding whereas the original principal was £25,000.  Such people would be tied-in tenants.  In this regard we get into the cyclical nature of high and low inflation.  There is a dichotomy here.  If we have low inflation it will be bad for getting investment into the HFA and good for the mortgagee and if we have high inflation it will be bad for the mortgagee but good for the investor who is trying to get ahead of inflation and preserve the value of his or her finance.</P>
    <P>The agency has been in operation for three years during which there has been a drop in inflation but I would like to know what the position will be in the event of that not maintaining or in the event of a slump in the market.  People <Col N="1916" /> who may have to sell their house may find that with high inflation their mortgage is a lot higher than the amount they borrowed originally.  How can they redeem that?  The agency may find that they have title documents which are over-borrowed. Potentially there is a position there where liabilities will exceed assets. The current predicament is that the net receipts in the first year of the repayments of a mortgage are not commensurate with the amount being paid on the investment market for HFA stock and that should be clarified.  What happens in the event of high inflation?</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the agency in relation to their costs and overheads. They run a very tight ship with a staff of seven or eight people.  Their administrative overheads are very low and, while they have the network of local authority loan and grant offices to take a lot of the donkey work off them, they have certainly not turned into a quango.  All credit is due to them for being cost efficient.  The growth in the agency is unprecedented.  It has gone from £55 million in 1983 to £72 million in 1984 and to £86 million this year.  In my view that type of growth will level off and I do not anticipate the growth level can be sustained.  The agency deserves praise for the way they treat mortgagees.  They deserve credit for the legal costs they apply to the mortgagee, the open position they take on house insurance, the expeditious way they pay the loans &mdash; a week or so after approval is received from local authorities &mdash; and their attitude to repossession in the event of default.</P>
    <P>During the summer I was looking into another area of mortgage finance which did not adopt such a nice attitude to the areas I have outlined.  We have a position with the building societies where, to put it mildly, there are questionable practices in terms of restrictive practises in that they often insist that there should be three solicitors for the conveyancing involved in one house.</P>

      <P>A person who takes out a loan with the HFA will pay legal fees of the order of £110 in addition to a valuation fee.  Those figures are very good. There has been a huge growth in loan applications to the agency and one of the reasons is because the building societies are ripping off their clients.  It is appropriate that the growth of the HFA should be explained in terms of the restrictive practices on house insurance which results in them getting fat commissions. Building societies insist on people getting house insurance through their company. A person who works in an insurance company cannot take out house insurance with that company.  The position is similar in regard to the employment of a solicitor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accede to the wishes of the Chair in this regard.  I should like the Minister to refer in his reply to the practice that has developed about the increase of VAT on houses, house grants and so on and the method of calculating the amount of loan to be paid.  It seems to me quite alarming the way the Irish Permanent Building Society are doing this.  Where a person is availing of the £5,000 grant often it would be preferable if the local authority was the recipient of the £5,000.  A person who is a local authority tenant for five years who seeks to buy a house for £20,000 may get approval from the HFA for 90 per cent of the cost.  If he obtains the £5,000 grant his loan approval is reduced by that amount.  From a bridging finance perspective, surely it would be much better not to give £5,000 to be spent perhaps on a new car but to let the local authority give approval for the full cost of the house, let the person buy the house and when the £5,000 is payable on occupancy taking place, it would be paid direct to the local authority or the Housing Finance Agency and the need for bridging finance would not arise.  That needs to be done. I certainly welcome the announcement made last week of an extra £6 million to the £20 million announced earlier this year and the reduction in interest on SDA finance from 12½ per cent to 11½ per cent. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation.  Would that decrease apply to new mortgages or existing mortgages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to the important question of new houses versus secondhand houses. There has been growth predominantly in mortgage finance for secondhand houses but the figures for building societies and banks are not followed through by the Housing Finance Agency.  When Mr. Jim O'Hehir was asked last week about this and the overall construction point of view <Col N="1919" /> in terms of stimulating extra activity, he said that they were introducing computerisation. As times goes on the agency will need to become more selective in their approach to ways of stimulating the construction industry.  At the moment the agency is very much a life line to the industry in the same way that I hope the housing improvement grants will be. Unless computerisation is brought in fairly rapidly and an analysis done across the board on the type of houses, the type of applicants, whether on local authority housing lists &mdash; I understand that at present 34 per cent answer yes to that question &mdash; defaulting might become a very serious issue.  It is not a matter one likes to talk about, but one which must be faced in times of recession.  Other lending institutions beyond the terms of this Bill take a very savage attitude in relation to repossessions, but I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>Future hassle can be avoided if the agency adopts a more selective process with regard to applicants.  We could find in this huge growth of finance made available that of the 4,000 applicants who may get a loan this year or next year 15 per cent would have a very serious risk factor associated with them.  There seems to be no screening process, other than the provision of the previous year's P60.  I understand that at the moment defaulting stands only at something like 15 mortgages, which is very good indeed.  That is all right in times of very low inflation, but when there is high inflation the situation could be completely different.</P>
    <P>I refer to comparison between the mortgage rate costs of the Housing Finance Agency and of other lending institutions, some of which are in an advantageous position.  It is very interesting to note that in 1983 the agency mortgage rate cost was 12.45 per cent whereas that of the building societies on average across the board was 13.67 per cent.  In 1984 the agency variable figure was 13.95 per cent and the building societies 12.06 per cent.  In 1985 the agency variable figure was 9.95 per cent and the building societies 12.07 per cent.  In 1983 and 1985 agency finance was cheaper by between <Col N="1920" /> .8 per cent and almost 3 per cent, whereas in 1984 the building societies' finance was cheaper by almost 2 per cent.  Could the Minister of State clarify the reasons for this?  It seems peculiar that there should be such a juxtaposition in those short three years.  What are the likely implications in the future?</P>
    <P>One other request is in relation to assisting the construction industry through the agency.  The Minister knows the figures much better than I do, but there is a vast amount of land available for housing construction which local authorities will never reach, either because of its size or because of the up-to-date developments in terms of local authority housing due to the huge moneys which the Government have put towards eradicating that social problem of local authority housing needs.  This dormant land is costing local authorities or the Department money in terms of loan charges on it.  At the same time many employed people are looking for mortgages and cannot get them through the banks or building societies.  There is a real need for the Housing Finance Agency to promote joint venture housing.  Already the local authorities administer HFA loans and already they own this land. They also know the people who would be the best recipients for a low cost housing initiative such as this.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land made a very detailed study into the prohibitive costs in this area.  I am asking that the agency, through the local authorities, together with the CIF, arrange for the promotion of joint venture housing on the basis that the agency would provide the mortgage finance for the applicant.  In other words, the builder and the local authority would work out a straightforward joint venture but the agency can bring that to fruition by giving the mortgages.  That would get over the problem of the dormant land, people would be housed who otherwise would not be and the agency would be getting further business.</P>
    <P>The income limits laid down by the Housing Finance Agency are anomalous in this respect.  A dual income family with <Col N="1921" /> both spouses earning £9,999.99p each gross on their previous year's P.60 can get a Housing Finance Agency mortgage. However, for a single earning member whose income is £10,001, that is over the limit.  The gross income of the first family is £2 short of £20,000 but both incomes are under £10,000 and they are successful in getting a loan but the applicant with an income just over £10,000 is unsuccessful. The income limit for one income families is very unfair, indeed.  It would be more realistic to put a ceiling on two income families.  The wife might not continue to work.  The limit for a one income family would be £15,000 and the limit for the other would be £20,000.  This would be much fairer and ensure that the people who really needed the loans would get them.</P>
    <P>In 1984 of new houses that required mortgage finance the banks catered for only 3 per cent.  The associated banks are not in any difficulty with the liquidity requirements laid down at present by the Central Bank.  Sometimes it could be the case that restrictions on personal credit or on liquidity across the board would not permit the banks to get into long-term finance.  It is very important that the Department of the Environment, as opposed to the Housing Finance Agency, should come up with new initiatives in relation to such things as joint venture housing, perhaps allowing the applicant to get 50 per cent equity in the house while renting the rest.  Various combinations have been successfully adopted in Northern Ireland.  This would need an alteration in the tax code.</P>
    <P>The Chair has restricted me to a great extent in relation to what I wanted to say about the building societies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many aspects of building society mortgage finance that are blatantly restrictive practices, that are unfair to mortgagees and to other people competing with the building societies on the investment market.  I hope that the Government will at least shore up their <Col N="1922" /> own position in relation to the HFA so that the building societies are not in an unfair position.  There is a huge demand now for finance from the HFA but the building societies are lending to only 18 per cent of their shareholders.  It was 33 per cent three years ago.  They are so busy making money on gilts and other things that they are not interested in this area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember quite clearly that when the original Bill was introduced in 1981 there was very strong opposition to this form of housing finance from the opposite benches.  Some people went so far as to say that a financial noose would be placed around people's necks from which they would never recover.  There were reports in various papers that at different stages people would be paying as much as £80,000 per year to the HFA. It was said that the whole thing was entering into the area of fantasy.  It might have appeared that way if inflation had continued at the uncontrolled rate of increase of two or three percentage points each year.  Fortunately there has been a change and the fears expressed then by the Opposition and by others outside the political scene have not materialised.  This Bill is evidence of the tremendous demand for finance through the medium of the Housing Finance Agency.  One must congratulate the Coalition Government of 1981 for contriving this idea and ensuring that people could borrow money at a rate which they could afford.  A large number of people have benefited and have been enabled to purchase their own houses, something they might otherwise never have been able to do.  No Governments have better records than Coalition Governments in relation to the provision of financial <Col N="1923" /> assistance for housing, through grant-aid and otherwise.  The evidence is there. This Government have their record and they are only three years in office.  The increase from £200 million to £500 million provided for in this Bill is an enormous advance, apart from other assistance which has been provided.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency may have a small shock coming to them. Deputy Yates ranged over the whole field and drew attention to a number of inadequacies. He also made comparisons between the HFA and other lending agencies.  Let us consider the case of a person earning about £4,000 who wants to leave a local authority house and borrows £7,000 or £8,000, in addition to the £5,000 grant.  Another person may borrow £27,000 to buy a bigger house in a more exclusive area.  The rate of 20 per cent applies to the wages of the low level borrower in the same way as it applies to the borrower of £27,000 at the top end of the scale.  The second borrower might also qualify for the £5,000.  The rate of interest on SDA loans has now been reduced from 12.5 per cent to 11.5 per cent, not before its time.  The level of housing finance cost is less than 10 per cent.  On that basis and on the basis of the SDA loans, repayments are running at between £2.50 and £2.85 per week per £1,000 borrowed.  On a small income there is no way to bridge the gap.  No account is taken of a person who works additional hours to generate additional income for other family needs.  He has to meet the additional costs out of that resource.</P>
      <P>There is another point which bears serious consideration by the Department. One of my colleagues referred last week to the craft, guide and cunning of the Spanish and Portuguese in relation to fishing.  The Irish are no less cunning when it comes to getting around matters of law and securing finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come to my notice that though properly audited and authenticated P60s are demanded in order to secure finance, some people who apply for loans are not earning at all.  I have known of people <Col N="1924" /> who attempted to do that.  They got caught before they achieved their purpose, but it behoves the agency to remember that they are dealing with taxpayers' money and that therefore they should make sure of the authenticity of the P60s.  In the last 12 months local authorities found they were not as quick as they should have been in this matter, so the Department and the local authorities should be on the watch constantly to prevent it.</P>
    <P>One thing is not clear to me.  When a person pays his loan back with interest over 24 years, does the house become his sole property?  A person earning as little as £9,000 can borrow £27,000 under the old scheme.  That figure may not increase greatly but if the person succeeds in paying his mortgage for 24 years will he be the absolute owner of the house?</P>
    <P>There have been some defaulters under the SDA.  People have found it exceedingly difficult to continue payments when they lost jobs.  Local authorities are empowered to examine that, but sometimes people are in arrears and under this scheme they may not realise that adjustments in the amounts of repayments can be made.  Many people whose incomes increase still find themselves unable to make the increased payments and they have found this a serious handicap. Sometimes they may be earning excessive amounts in overtime but that should not be regarded by the agency as part of normal income because the level of overtime is not a permanent feature of incomes and people may fall behind in such cases.  There should be adjustments for this.</P>
    <P>The £5,000 grant is made available to people who intend to leave local authority houses and have new houses constructed. This has been of considerable benefit to people wishing to purchase their own houses.  That is an important scheme brought in by this Government. However, there may be need for bridging finance.  Between the time the loan is applied for and the handing over of the new house there can be a gap before the £5,000 grant becomes payable.  This may <Col N="1925" /> cause serious problems for people who do not have reserve cash.  There should be some mechanism, some liaison between the Department of the Environment and the agency, which would simplify the whole thing without people having to take out bridging loans.</P>
    <P>This is a limited Bill and I will not attempt to go into general housing policy. I welcome the Bill and the thought that has gone into the setting up of the Housing Finance Agency.  I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials for the competency and expertise put into the work of making these loans available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the HFA are a good organisation because the administrative aspect is the type of bureaucracy I like to see.  The agency, administering large sums of money in the national interest, have been keeping administrative costs low.  Here we have not one of those crazy quangos, of which we have enough already.  We are talking about making loans available for the construction of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not my intention to intervene. Since my election I have tried as best I could to keep to realities and truth, but Deputies on the Government benches worry me.  This Bill is good news among the overall bad news we have been receiving from the Government since they took office in December 1982, and I assume they will be celebrating their three years in office very soon.  I wonder will the rest of the nation be celebrating in the context of what we are discussing here at present. We are discussing an agency which may borrow for the payment of loans for the construction of houses.  If I look at a document such as the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics, incorporating the quarterly bulletin, ended 31 December 1984, published by the Department of the Environment which deals specifically with the Housing Finance Agency and their input since their inception in 1981, I have the gravest of doubts about the attitude of Fianna Fáil then.  What we said in 1981 is a matter of record, that it appeared to be a good housing finance <Col N="1926" /> funding operation.  Having said that, it is interesting to read this document published by a Department of Government. It demonstrates the decline in the building industry including within that decline the growth of the Housing Finance Agency and the decline of other areas of housing endeavour.  While the Housing Finance Agency may be seen as a qualified or unqualified success, depending on one's point of view, the Government have presided over one of the most savage attacks made on the most fundamental industry to our economic well being, the building industry.  I know I am travelling the long way around to the quotation which will assist me in exposing the most extraordinary, phantasmagorial contributions of a number of Government Deputies, particularly in the Fine Gael interest.</P>
    <P>According to the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics in 1977 the total number of houses completed was 24,500. In 1978 the corresponding number was 25,500; in 1979 26,500.  Then in 1980 there were 27,785 houses completed.  In 1981 30,000.  I pause there because as we know the legislation setting up this agency was introduced in this House in 1981.  We are aware also that this Government came into office at the end of 1982. It should be remembered that at the end of 1981 housing had reached a peak at 30,000.  The Government programme on housing was a predicted outflow of 30,000 units per annum.  We move on to 1982, remembering that the total housing to be provided by this Government under their Programme for Government was to be 30,000.  In 1982 the figure was 26,798; in 1983 a total of 26,138 and in 1984 24,944, say, 25,000 as a sop to the Government. Therefore this Government have presided over a rapid decline in house building since they assumed office.</P>
    <P>The consequences of what they have done to the building industry, in terms of the economic health of this nation, cannot be over-emphasised.  In my clinics, in my daily contacts with constituents, indeed with people outside my constituency, in my contacts with people interested in the future welfare of this <Col N="1927" /> nation, with people interested in the building industry and the employment that industry gave under successive Fianna Fáil Governments, the sad story is that the house building industry is in decline.  Now we are meant to give three cheers for the Government; they are increasing the Housing Finance Agency borrowing requirement from £200 million to £500 million.  We are meant to give them all the plaudits in the world.</P>
    <P>If one resorts to this piece of wisdom from the Department of the Environment, the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics to 31 December 1984 it will be seen that that document reveals the fraudulence of people who come into this House and maintain that the building industry is not in decline.  Whether they are on the Government or Fianna Fáil side is of indifference to me but, unfortunately, it must be said that the people who have the power with responsibility, are those from the Government side.  We have no power but, as an Opposition, we do have responsibility.</P>

The building industry has become a thing of the past under the present Coalition Government.  It is extraordinary that successive Coalition Governments always have presided over the decline of the building industry.  Its consequences are immense, not only for those people directly involved, the general operatives, the legitimate builders be they large or small, but in addition, there are the spin-off effects on the community. The fact that this Government have presided over the death of the construction industry constitutes one of the great tragedies of this Government.  All the Housing Finance Agency Bills in the world &mdash; well intentioned as they are &mdash; will not get away from the fact that this Government presided over an annual decline of something in the region of 5,000 houses per annum.</P>

      <P>The house improvement grants were mentioned as was the £5,000 grant.  That £5,000 grant is a good one if properly administered.  One of its inherent problems, however, is the hardship it causes in the context of bridging loans.  What action can be taken to cure that problem?  Deputy Yates, in his very intelligent contribution, put his finger on the problems and the Minister should take note of what he said.  I do not intend to repeat it but he put it very well.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> At page 1 (a) of the bulletin to which I referred it states that the figures for local authority completed houses for 1981 was 5,284.  For 1982 the figure was 5,725 and for 1983 the figure was 4,340.  The figure for 1984 was 3,700 and if Deputy Allen suggests that I am misrepresnting the position I will give him the bulletin before he makes his contribution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Housing Finance Agency, the figure for 1982 was 393, for 1983 it was 1,263 and for 1984 it was 1,760, which shows that the Housing Agency is working &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am talking about the total figures in relation to the years <Col N="1930" /> 1977-84.  The Minister can study the figures and determine whether I have misrepresented the situation, whether I have totals wrong and if the Bill will improve matters.  Perhaps the Minister will say that everything in the housing industry is rosy and that the Housing Finance Agency will take care of many of the problems which Deputies deal with on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, the housing construction industry is in a shambles although not from the want of will on the part of builders.  The Government recently introduced a number of schemes which we were told would help, including the grant of £5,000.  We were told that housing improvement grants would also help and although it is a good scheme I wonder if it will operate successfully or grind to a halt because of the impossibility of administering it due to lack of personnel. It is the good news always followed by the bad news and the Government are notorious in that respect.</P>
      <P>For the sake of accuracy and the protection of my word, perhaps the Minister will support me in my analysis of the decline of the building industry as outlined in the Government publication produced by the Department of the Environment.  I appeal to the Government to look at the cost of land in the Dún Laoghaire area and to recognise that it is prohibitive.  The cost is interfering with progress in building local authority houses.  We have effectively run out of building land in the borough and we are now moving into the county.  The Government, via the local authority, must provide adequate housing for a very quickly expanding population by providing moneys to build houses for single and old people &mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps the Minister would also give some thought to the provision of short term accommodation for the homeless in the form of hostels and low rent accommodation for newly married couples who at present start their married life in Rachman-type housing accommodaton which prevents them from buying their own homes for years. Unfortunately there are many people who cannot provide their own houses. They are excluded from local authority housing, they cannot afford private housing and they have to go into prohibitively priced flats.  Anything that could be done to help them would be a piece of social philosophy which this Government preach but do not practise.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Obviously Deputy Andrews has not been listening to his own colleagues.  I listened to the speeches very carefully and the majority welcomed the Bill with very few qualifications.  Deputy Molloy was among those who welcomed the Bill.  I should also like to point out that the concept was one brought forward by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the type of housing provided under the auspices of the HFA loans is quite obvious when one looks at the amounts made by way of loans in the past few years.  In 1983 the amount was £55 million, in 1984 it was £72 million and in 1985 it was £86 million.  This indicates <Col N="1932" /> the growing demand to provide not houses or investments but homes.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the HFA particularly on their sale of index-linked stock in what can only be described as very unfavourable times and bad market conditions.  I hope the downward trend in inflation will enable them to sell more stock issue at a lower cost.  It is to be hoped that in the short term bank borrowing by the agency will be phased out as soon as possible.  I regard the HFA borrowing from the banks as something like a bridging loan: it is something in which they should not become involved if possible.  They should revert as quickly as possible to index-linked stocks.  In the report for year end 1984 the HFA requested the Minister for Finance to grant them concessions under section 79 of the 1976 Act dealing with corporation tax.  They requested that they be allowed off some 35 per cent corporation tax and I am delighted that the Minister has done this.  It means that the money that would normally go back to the Department of Finance remains with the HFA and gives more money for borrowing purposes.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the HFA have helped hundreds of families to own their own homes.  The concept behind it was not for investment purposes but purely for the provision of homes for those who otherwise could not afford them.  I will give some figures in relation to Galway city, which area I am familiar with as is Deputy Molloy.  To date 150 loans have been allocated which approximates to £3 million in the housing construction sector.  This is a substantial investment and can only be described as good news especially for the building industry to which Deputy Andrews referred.  I have always admired the way Fianna Fáil appear to take the building industry under their wing, or at least attempt to do so through propaganda rather than actual works.</P>
    <P>The greatest beneficiaries of HFA loans have been local authority tenants. Coupled with such loans the £5,000 grant for these tenants has meant that there are many local authority houses available for those on the housing waiting list.  In the <Col N="1933" /> past year in Galway city 30 such dwellings have been made available and 52 applications have been approved.  If one takes 52 houses each at a cost of £32,000 &mdash; a moderate amount &mdash; this equates to £1.8 million that has gone back into the construction industry.  This is at a cost of £250,000.  What has been done in this area is a great fillip for the construction industry and there is no way the Members opposite can ignore it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should talk to those in the building industry in Galway.  They have informed me their problem is that the secondhand house market is the greatest market.  The reason is simple.  The fact is that a certain lending agency, a building society, provide approximately only 80 per cent of loans for firsthand houses.  If fault should lie anywhere it should lie at their doorstep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a worry facing applicants for HFA loans because of the insecurity of inflation rates.  In the term of this Government people do not feel insecure because inflation has dropped dramatically from the 20 per cent range down to single figures.  However, they are frightened that a return to Government of the Opposition would mean higher inflation and, therefore, their repayments would be increased accordingly. This Government, quite rightly, have seen as one of their priorities a reduction in the rate of inflation thus ensuring, <i>inter alia,</i> that the interest rate on HFA loans is very attractive; but those borrowing loans are fearful that perhaps in the future a Government would push the inflation rate into double figures because of their ill-considered economic <Col N="1934" /> policy.  The Deputy will recall that this was done in the period 1978-1980.  Loan applicants need have no worry on this score while this Government are in office.</P>
      <P>I suggest that an undertaking be given to people having HFA loans that the interest rate would have an upper ceiling, linked perhaps to building society rates. Such a mechanism would operate if inflation rocketed.  The interest on HFA loans would not exceed building society rates by more than 2 per cent.  Of course this would involve the State in giving a subvention to these people but there is nothing new in that.  Building societies have received subventions in the past and people with SDA loans have also been beneficiaries of State funds.  These suggestions would eliminate long-term worries for people with loans.</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of tenants who give back their dwellings to local authorities for no compensation.  If these people buy a new house they do not qualify for the new house grant of £2,000.  The reason given by the Department of the Environment is that they owned a previous dwelling.  However, they were not given any money by the State when they purchased the local authority house and they will not get the £2,000 grant on buying a new house.  Neither will they get compansation for payment of legal fees in connection with the transfer.  These people are the only category who do not receive the new house grant and I ask the Minister to amend the regulations to take them into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £2,000 house grant is deducted from the HFA loan.  This could be all right if a person is on the maximum income but a person on the lower income could find this the straw that broke the camel's back.  Perhaps the Minister would consider giving a person on the minimum income the total grant of £2,000 with a <i>pro rata</i> payment to others.  In other words, it should not be taken into account as part of the loan.  When an applicant receives, say, one-third of the total loan &mdash; this is usually when the roof is put on the house &mdash; he or she is required to commence the repayments the following <Col N="1935" /> month.  These are the minimum repayable amounts on a full loan even though the person has not received the full loan at the time.  For example, an applicant who is approved for a £24,000 loan will be required to pay a minimum repayment of £200 per month.  If he were to receive a first instalment of, say, £8,000 he would be liable to commence repayments at £200 per month as if he had received the total amount of the loan.  This can be a burden when one considers that the person can still be involved at that stage in completing his dwelling.  I suggest that the HFA insert a condition in the deed of charge so that an applicant would be liable only for interest on that portion of the loan he has received as opposed to being charged on the full amount at that stage.</P>
    <P>The monthly repayment on the £8,000 advance would be between £75 and £80 as opposed to the £200 that must be paid if interest is charged on the total amount. I am calculating that on an interest rate of between 10 and 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>As set out in the present application form, interest payment is required to be made in respect of the full amount being borrowed.  I trust the Minister will take this factor into consideration in order to help those who need these loans next.  A procedure whereby a borrower would be asked to repay the interest each month on the portion of the loan he had received would be similar to the scheme operated in respect of an SDA loan and that would be more equitable in every way.</P>
    <P>I trust that the various points I have made will be noted by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points I had intended raising have been made already so I shall not deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency scheme though much criticised since its establishment, is most attractive.  Its success can be gauged by the number of houses that have been built with the help of the scheme.  However, this scheme could be rendered more attractive if a number of steps were taken.  For example, regarding the administration of the scheme and the <Col N="1936" /> bureaucracy, when a local authority requisition a loan there is a delay between the date of the request and the sending of the cheque of between four and five weeks.  That period could be shortened considerably.  People will be on bridging finance during that time and this can cost between £60 and £80 per week whereas they would be paying about £20 per week on their agency loan and that would be the amount they had budgeted for.</P>
    <P>The whole question of bridging finance has been dealt with by previous speakers and I shall merely make the point that this factor is a deterrent to people to avail of the scheme.  I have known of hundreds of people who would have sought HFA loans had it not been for the difficulty of bridging finance.  There must be some solution to this problem.  Why, for example, can local authorities not accept letters of undertaking in relation to title from properly indemnified solicitors?  In other words, if a solicitor gives an undertaking that a title is in order and if he is insured properly against negligence, that should be sufficient for the local authority to accept the undertaking and to pay out. This would overcome the whole question of the examining and registering of title by local authorities.  There is considerable delay in sending the documentation to Dublin and waiting for its return.  Overcoming that problem would be another step in making the HFA more attractive.</P>
    <P>Surely, too, the Minister could put pressure on the banks and the building societies to accept such letters of undertaking. If a solicitor is paid up to £700 for undertaking a conveyancing, should his professional judgment not be taken into account as a backup to the documentation being supplied to a lending agency? Dealing with this area, too, would eliminate another major obstacle in the way of people who are deciding whether to purchase houses.  These are the kinds of questions I have been trying for a long time to have answered.  As the body responsible, the Department of the Environment should provide some of the answers.  If there are regulations preventing local authorities from paying out on <Col N="1937" /> foot of letters of undertaking, these should be changed.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has become more prevalent in recent times is the lack of protection for those who embark on house purchase.  There is very little protection for them in their contract.  As builders increasingly go to the wall, house purchasers are being left with useless pieces of ground and very often with no title.  This, too, is an area in which the Department should interest themselves. This would be another step in encouraging people to buy houses for themselves, either with the help of the HFA or of some other schemes.  I have written to the Construction Industry Federation on this matter of the lack of protection for purchasers so far as members of the confederation are concerned.  I have written in this context, too, to the Law Society but everyone passes the buck.  Surely that buck must rest with the Department.  In conjuncton with the CIF the Department devised a scheme whereby house purchasers are protected against structural defects.  My information is that that scheme is well funded, that its liabilities are small in terms of money, while its funds are large.  I should like to hear what is happening to the many millions of pounds that are in that fund.  Could that scheme not be extended to include builders who go into liquidation or who for one reason or another go out of business, leaving the clients without protection?</P>
    <P>In a submission from the Department in 1975 the then Minister said that concern had increased because of instances of insolvency and of misrepresentation by private house builders and that this resulted in hardship and financial difficulties for people buying houses.  That was during the run up to the establishment of the national house building guarantee scheme but the Minister's suggestion was never taken up by the CIF.  It comprises the people in the industry making decisions.  The Minister has very little input, while the consumer has none. Therefore, there is a crying need for the replacement of that scheme and for the setting up of a national housing council which would incorporate a guarantee <Col N="1938" /> against structural defects and against a builder going into liquidation.  This would be a good day's work, on the part of the Minister and would result in many people, in my constituency anyway, regarding house purchase as a far more attractive proposition.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what response he has had from the construction industry in relation to these problems.  In response to my inquiry to the Law Society in early October.  I was informed that while the society agreed fully with my sentiments the matter was one for the CIF and the Minister and that they would welcome any review of the provisions of the national house building guarantee scheme &mdash; I will not bore the House by reading the complete letter.  I wrote to the Construction Industry Federation and they gave me four very good reasons why they could not set up a protection scheme against insolvencies and builders going out of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important. People are afraid to buy a house because of the legal problems and costs attendant on it.  I believe if there was a will to get over these problems they could be solved. I urge the Minister to ask how the money, which is available to fund the national house building guarantee scheme is being used at present, where the interest is going and why can we not extend the scheme and use the money to fund a scheme protecting the purchaser against building companies going out of business. If there was a co-ordinated effort and a will to get over these problems we would have a far more attractive scheme, the Housing Finance Agency scheme would be even more attractive, and there would be more demand for new houses with a resultant rise in the house building programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews should have taken that into account when he spoke about figures dropping.  Because of the recession, figures are dropping, demand for all kinds of commodities has dropped <Col N="1939" /> and house purchasing figures have dropped because people have to pay conveyancing fees; they have no choice, it is a monopoly; they have to pay surveyors fees if they go to a building society, another monopoly; they have to take out insurance with a building society, another monopoly, and so on.  If they buy a house through the SDA or HFA loan scheme, again they meet vested interests, and nobody is willing to make a move.  The onus is on the Minister to be a catalyst to bring about a major change.  Then people will buy their houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One could accept that the Housing Finance Agency has improved its image over the past two years, more than can be said for the present Government, with the small staff operating efficiently, cutting out the red tape of bureaucracy to which we have become accustomed when dealing with State or semi-State bodies, but we should not think that the Housing Finance Agency have solved all the problems of the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The building industry is in a depressed state with thousands of skilled and unskilled workers on the dole queues. Since the Coalition came to power there has been 25 per cent to 30 per cent job inactivity in the building industry.  We had the Taoiseach's famous words &ldquo;dusting off the JCBs&rdquo; but unfortunately nothing has happened in that area.  We had the 100 per cent VAT increase, which struck the building industry a killer blow, and many building firms have gone out of business.  This Government, and every Coalition Government, seem to seriously dislike the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the new increased powers for borrowing allocated to the HFA mean a change of direction, then we must welcome them but piecemeal attention to the industry is not acceptable.  Co-ordinated plans for its development should tie together all the agencies.  On the one hand, the Government are making grants and loans available and, on the other, they have increased VAT by 100 per cent, reduced the capital programme for the <Col N="1940" /> construction industry and there has been a reduction in the number of local authority houses.  Hardly an imaginative way to tackle the problems facing the construction industry.</P>
    <P>In many areas, there is a serious question mark over the Housing Finance Agency loans.  Many politicians, including Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, advise people to run a mile from HFA loans because of the fluctuating interest rates and other related problems.  One speaker today mentioned that there has been a great demand for these loans, but many people have no alternative because a person earning over £8,000 does not qualify for an SDA loan.  Many people cannot get a bank or a building society loan, and have no alternative but to seek an HFA loan.  The HFA loan does not suit the low wage earner.  If he gives up a council house he will get a full loan, but if he has a small income and lives in a flat he will get two and a half times his income.  This will in no way meet the present cost of a house.</P>
    <P>Secondhand houses cause major problems because there are no grants available and this makes it very difficult for people to acquire such houses.  The Minister should look at this area.  We have heard a great deal of talk about grants over the last few weeks, but people not living in local authority houses and wanting to buy a secondhand house are being unfairly treated.  Grants should be available for secondhand house purchasers.</P>
    <P>The decision to grant HFA loans should be made as quickly as possible because the cost of bridging finance is outrageous.  The delays between making an application, having it processed and the money being given to the applicant, is causing serious hardship for young couples.  In my view the banks should take up some of this responsibility.  The banks are charging outrageous interest rates on bridging finance.  At a time when there is so much talk about the depressed economy, the banks should make bridging finance available at lower rates.  They are bleeding the young people.  This is another area where the Minister should enter into negotiations with the banks to <Col N="1941" /> make bridging finance available at low interest rates.</P>
    <P>People who are unemployed or on sick leave but have HFA loans still only have to pay 20 per cent of their incomes.  This is a very good provision.  At present many people on SDA loans have serious problems making their repayments if they have lost their jobs or are not employed because of illness.  I know of many cases where people had to sell their houses and go back on to the local authority housing list because they could not meet their SDA loan repayments.  I welcome the provision in the HFA scheme which helps such people while still recognising that they will have to pay at the end of the day.  That too may cause problems, but it at least alleviates the hardship imposed at present.</P>
    <P>This scheme is to be welcomed but I do not think it will solve all the problems as the Minister and the Government would like us to believe.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed and showed interest in this matter.  While this is a fairly modest Bill proposing technical adjustments, it has given the House an opportunity of touching on wider questions on the progress of the Housing Finance Agency.  It continues to attract considerable public interest as is demonstrated by the very strong demand for loans.  The provision of mortgage finance for housing, particularly those on modest incomes, is a matter which affects the vital interests of a great many people. The Government are concerned that all necessary steps are taken to ensure a continuing adequate supply of such finance.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to publish a detailed plan for the development of the Port of Dublin, to attract back lost business and to revitalise the undeveloped dockland area for industrial, commercial, housing and leisure activities.</P>
      <P>I will explain the circumstances of my putting down this motion.  My motion was dated 10 October and on the morning that the TDs got my motion in the post we find that the <i>Irish Independent</i> had a banner headline covering the terms of my motion &ldquo;Government to spend £150 million on inner city development&rdquo;.  I am glad that the motion obviously had the effect of putting the skids under the Government and forcing the Taoiseach into the House to make the statement which he has made since then.  It is also interesting from the media point of view in that there was obvious panic when my motion was received and contact was made with the editorial end of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and we got a banner headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Friday, 11 October 1985, the exact date on which Members of this House received my motion.  Perhaps I should be glad that that happened.  I should regard it as a positive reaction from the Government. The only thing is that it was a long time coming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> The Fianna Fáil Party had an interest in this whole area and had plans for that development for some time.  I would refer the House to the terms of two Bills, the Urban Development Area Bill, 1982 and the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill, 1982.  That is an area in which Fianna Fáil have taken an interest for some time.  The inter-departmental committee on Dublin inner city, 1979 reported on that and I remember from that report that there was a strong emphasis on provision being made for the area.  It is paradoxical that the Taoiseach should come into the House to announce a plan for the development of the inner city when he and his party condemned a similar effort in the most trenchant terms when proposals were coming from this side of the House.  Indeed, as late as 30 April 1985 the Minister for Communications talked about an infamous deal with Deputy Gregory with regard to this development.  I, in my simple way, find it difficult to understand how what was an infamous deal in 1982 and was an infamous deal in the words of the Minister right up to April 1985, has suddenly become the essence of commonsense, the engine for development, a completely new ball game, a completely different point of view on the exact same policy.</P>
    <P>I would refer also to stupid allegations that were made by members of the Dublin Port Authority and Dublin Cargo Handling Limited with regard to Fianna Fáil's plan for development.  Sometimes I find that people who are involved in bodies like that and in semi-State bodies are anxious to hang their failures around the necks of the politicians.  Deputy Haughey, then Taoiseach, had no intention of damaging the finances of the Dublin Port Authority nor of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited but is on record as saying that the site which would be acquired would be paid for at full market value.  I am taking the opportunity of nailing one more lie that was perpetrated outside this House with regard to this. Sometimes it is an alibi for stupid decisions and failures in management.  I characterise this thing as just that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1944" /> We know that the actual port of Dublin with regard to the business of a port deteriorated very much over a number of years and that Drogheda.  Arklow, Rosslare, Wexford, Greenore and as far north as Carrickfergus benefited by the failure of Dublin to provide an adequate service for importers and exporters. Many of the problems have since been solved.  The terms of my motion mentions the publication of a detailed plan to be followed by legislation for the development of the port of Dublin to attract back lost business and to revitalise the undeveloped dockland area for industry, commerce, housing and leisure activities. This part of it is the actual business of the port.  I know the urban report was published and I will leave that area to be dealt with by some other speakers from this side of the House, and I will proceed to deal with the other areas mentioned in my motion.</P>
    <P>What prompted me to put down the motion was the fact that we had had the commitment with regard to inner city development over the years, the fact that in 1982 two Bills had been prepared with this objective and the fact that we had developed a climate of opinion that this was necessary.  An article in <i>Industry &amp; Commerce</i> of October 1985 is <i>ad rem</i> to the matter here under discussion.  Mr. Tom Cox, Director of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in a very interesting interview advocated more or less the implementation of what has been for some time Fianna Fáil policy.  He talked about the port, about the sickness that was in the port &mdash; I hope that sickness has been cured &mdash; about the recommendations of the Horgan report and about the Dublin Chamber of Commerce being set to argue with its members who had left the port to return and make an act of faith in the future.  He said that he had doubts about the recommendation to sell &mdash; which I think came from the Minister &mdash; the forced sale of assets when the market was at rock bottom.  Those are the words he used.  I agree that that would be very false economy indeed.  Of course he recommended that a short-term loan would be used as well as grants to deal <Col N="1945" /> with it.  The interviewer put this question to him:</P>
    <P>Many other capitals with ports have revitalised their dockland area with aplomb.  How would you like to see our dockland area, now largely derelict, developed?</P>
    <P>His reply is interesting, and I will read it:</P>
    <P>Firstly, I would recommend every citizen of Dublin to go down to the North Wall and have a look at the Port. It is a fascinating place, though under-utilised. The surprising thing for most people who go down there is how vast the Port actually is.  There are fine undeveloped spaces down there and you don't have to be a planner to see the potential for development.</P>
    <P>As an area, within 2½ miles of O'Connell Bridge, with lots of land available and with many redundant buildings, there is abundant potential. Besides the straightforward industrial and commercial possibilities,</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am emphasising those deliberately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>leisure activities might be well suited.  Running tracks are a possibility. Speaking as a non-expert, I'd even say that you could develop a golf course down there.  It's absolutely vast. It's a great asset for a capital city to have so much development potential so close to its core.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil had been interested in the development of that area for some time and had been reviled, mainly by Fine Gael Members of this House, because of that commitment.  Obviously, the whole commercial and industrial climate in the country was thinking along the same lines as Fianna Fáil had been thinking with regard to this development.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the details of these two Bills, No. 12 of 1982 and No. 30 of 1982.  No. 12 is called the Urban Development Areas Bill.  According to the explanatory memorandum the main purpose of that Bill was to provide for the establishment of urban development commissions to secure the regeneration <Col N="1946" /> of designated urban areas, to designate the Custom House dock site in Dublin and the area covered by the medieval walled city of Dublin as urban development areas, to provide for the establishment of a Custom House docks development commission and to empower the Minister to designate other areas as urban development areas.  I do not have to go on with that one to convince the House of the commitment of the Fianna Fáil Party, in and out of Government, to this development.</P>
    <P>Bill No. 30 of 1982 is called the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill. The object of this Bill, according to the explanatory memorandum, was to provide for the establishment of the Dublin inner city development authority to coordinate and supplement the work of a variety of agencies affecting the Dublin inner city area and to provide assistance by way of grants, loans or otherwise for inner city projects.</P>
    <P>That whole business was opposed by the senior partner in the Government who are now putting it before the House. I do not know how long it would have taken to come before the House had my motion not got down, but with almost indecent haste the media people were contacted as soon as my motion was received.  <i>The Irish Independent,</i> ever loyal to the Government, decided to run it on the day that the TDs got returns of my motion in their post.</P>
    <P>I want to refer the House to the Fianna Fáil policy document <i>The Way Forward</i> because it is relevant to this development. In particular I want to read from it a half paragraph about methods of funding development.  I quote from page 42:</P>
    <P>Where appropriate, semi-State bodies will be encouraged to undertake joint ventures with private sector enterprises or institutions.</P>
    <P>They will be eligible for industrial grants on the same basis as private sector enterprises.  The total State investment involved in projects, inclusive of both equity and industrial grants, will be subject to the same rigorous <Col N="1947" /> financial and commercial assessment as that envisaged above for the capital programmes of the commercial semi-State bodies themselves.</P>
    <P>I wanted to read that into the record of the House to indicate that we were thinking of having private investment in the area as well as Government investment.</P>
    <P>Notice that my motion is dated 10 October; <i>The Irish Independent</i> banner headline was on 11 October, and the Taoiseach came into the House on 23 October with his statement.  This is a very rare kind of thing; it is very difficult to understand the purpose of taking it into the House in that way.  I would have thought that, as far as the Dublin port and its hinterland were concerned, the Minister for Communications was the man who should have brought it in here, assisted ably, I presume, by the other Ministers for Finance, the Environment and so on, who would be involved in this area.  The first point that Fianna Fáil decided on when studying this problem &mdash; it is in keeping with the policies we had in 1979 and 1982 &mdash; was that an institute should be established for the development of the port.  I know it is difficult for any Government to get things going quickly and one of the inhibitions to development is the difficulty of getting planning permission, in particular in an area of the city with all kinds of ancient rights and laws applying.  Fianna Fáil are of the opinion that the institute established should have planning powers.  That would speed up decision making and the start of development.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, as reported at column 277, volume 361 said:</P>
    <P>A special development authority will be established to promote and control the development of the site.</P>
    <P>I do not have to emphasise to the House that that is just a straight lift from Fianna Fáil policy.  The Taoiseach went on:</P>
    <P>We will be making available a wide <Col N="1948" /> range of incentives that will stimulate investment in construction.</P>
    <P>That has the benison of the Taoiseach now and of his party but it had his malediction when a similar suggestion came from this side of the House.  The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>Among the incentives we will be introducing for the Custom House site are:</P>
    <P>&mdash; capital allowance on non industrial buildings;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Section 23 type relief on new dwellings</P>
    <P>&mdash;Double rent allowance;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Full rates relief.</P>
    <P>I can tell the House that Fianna Fáil are in full support of those because they are part of our policy for the area.  The number one practical plank in our platform is a tax relief for development in the area.  The actual format of the institute, its ownership, its sale of sites or leasing of them to private companies and so on is a complicated area and one which the Fianna Fáil Party are now studying. We envisage that the Industrial Development Authority will have a major role to play in this development in accordance with our plan.  Emphasis can and should be laid on the port and its potential for exporting and that the type of industry suited to export by ship, whether by container or roll-on, would command support from the IDA.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are proposals that the B &amp; I move from the port of Dublin to Dún Laoghaire for its ferries to Holyhead and Liverpool.  I presume that in the plan a development of the freight business in the port of Dublin is envisaged.  I think I saw a mention that Sealink would be encouraged to use the port of Dublin for freight purposes.  Last week we were debating free ports and while I am not advocating a free port for Dublin I must point out that there is a considerable opportunity there for entrepot trade in the port of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The next agency that the Fianna Fáil Party listed as one that should have an interest in the development is Dublin <Col N="1949" /> Corporation.  Perhaps, I should have started with Dublin Corporation.  In the report of the inner city development committee in 1979, and the progress report of 1981, there is a strong emphasis on having residential development in that area.  I am aware, because the south quays, from the Pigeon House Road to the Sir John Rogerson Quay and City Quay is an area I know reasonably well, that there is housing which is a credit to Dublin Corporation.  The purpose of building those beautiful houses, some in Clanbrassil Street and Ringsend, was to give life to that area.  To paraphrase James Connolly, an inner city without its people is not of much interest to anybody. The interviewer in <i>Industry and Commerce</i> said to the director of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that other cities have succeeded in bringing back life to their inner cities and Dublin Corporation should have that as a prime objective of their own activities.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned section 23 type relief on new dwellings.  I believe it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who introduced that relief.  That type of relief would mean private residential development and I would be fully supportive of that.  We may be a long way from that and a good deal of infrastructural development may have to take place before that can be developed but it can be done. Private housing can be developed attractively in that area.  There would have to be a good deal of development to attract people to do that but it is surprising what the section 23 carrot and tax reliefs can do to people who are anxious to develop like that.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil envisage a whole spread of various types of development in the area. In our policy originally there was an educational factor.  There was a decision to develop as far as I can remember, a community school in the area.  The director of the chamber of commerce said that there was also a great opportunity to develop sports centres and facilities of one kind or another in the area.  I am aware that offices have been built extensively in Dublin 2, out to Dublin 4 and further into the suburbs and it would be foolhardy <Col N="1950" /> for anybody to encourage further office development until the development that has taken place has been absorbed. Fianna Fáil are very anxious to put in place a programme for decentralisation but if there must be office development in the city the area we are talking about should be thought of primarily.  There is enough office development elsewhere in areas that did not need it that much. Considerable Government muscle would be needed to encourage people to go in there because the developments I mentioned in the other areas of Dublin were developments in a kind of free market.</P>
    <P>The question of how ownership will be dealt with legally is one which the House will have the opportunity of considering when the necessary legislation comes before us.  It is necessary that the institutes be charged with the responsibility of using all the pressure points to develop the area.  The capital allowance is one which was mentioned by the Taoiseach &mdash; 100 per cent capital allowance on nonindustrial buildings.  This would command the support of this side of the House.  In provincial Ireland county councils help out as far as industrial development is concerned by giving rates relief over a period and the Taoiseach mentioned rates relief in his speech, I do not know how much all this would cost, but as far as the development of the port area is concerned it would be money well spent, despite all the Cassandra-like prophecies which we have heard about it.</P>
    <P>Dublin is our capital city and consequently commands and should get from all of us the respect that a capital city should get.  Maurice Craig made a marvellous study of the history of architecture up to the middle of the last century. I got this book a long time ago as a present from my wife-to-be who thought that she would improve my mind, but failed.  One of the chapters &mdash; the final one, I think &mdash; was entitled &ldquo;Whose Dublin?&rdquo;  The author was worried about whether there was overall input and an overall plan along sound architectural lines for the development of the city.  I am putting it to the House that for the <Col N="1951" /> kind of development that I am proposing what is needed is the visionary architectural input that a man like Maurice Craig might be able to give, a man with an overall vision and an overall plan.  If we had that, I have no doubt that the mix of industrial development &mdash; which because of the motive power nowadays could be a clean development &mdash; of manufacturing and housing, both Dublin Corporation and private housing, of facilities for conferences and sports, as have already been mentioned, if part of a plan which I would call a visionary plan with logic, where all the parts are made to blend with the overall vision, would provide great potential for that area of Dublin city.  I have the pipe dream that artists' colonies would foster the kind of interest in the area which similar artists' colonies in other cities have brought to specific areas of those cities.</P>
    <P>When the plan came from the architect to me, when I was Minister for Education, for the development of the new College of Art in what was once a distillery, I was more than taken by the interest shown in it by environmental experts, An Taisce and other groups that dedicated themselves to the kind of capital city that we should have.  I sponsored that development and it is already in place.  It would be a left bank type of development which would be suitable in this context &mdash; writers and artists.  Baggot Street and McDaid's commanded in their time a certain kudos from the fact that certain artists and writers lived in, or frequented those places.  There could be facilities made available, as in Annaghmakerrig in my own constituency, for artists from that area.  We could do what has been advocated by me and many others in this House &mdash; give an opportunity to artists in that development also which would attract people to it, make ir more attractive for those who want, for example, to build, buy up or develop private residences in the area.  What I am talking about is mainly the type of sculpture that we tried to encourage in public buildings at one time.  I think there is a big fall-off now.  This was appreciated by the people <Col N="1952" /> who saw the sculptures and of course also very much by those who were using the buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister put down an amendment to my motion as follows:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the measures already taken to restore viability to Dublin Port; the decisions on the Custom House Dock Site announced by the Taoiseach on Wednesday, 23rd October and the intention to introduce early legislation to enable the restructuring of Dublin Port and Docks Board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The measures have been taken already.  The Minister said in the House that the management and the unions dealing with the direct business of a port had it in their power to guarantee the survival of the port of Dublin.  My motion calls for a concerted effort &mdash; and obviously the Dublin Chamber of Commerce is willing to take part in that effort &mdash; to bring back the business that has been lost to places as far away as Carrickfergus, Greenore, Drogheda and so forth with consequent heavy traffic and heavy wear and tear on our roads which are unable to bear them and are becoming, as this Government progresses, increasingly unable to bear them because of the lack of attention to and proper finance for road building.</P>
    <P>I have already said that, despite the fact that we will shortly have reached the third anniversary of the taking over of this Government, until my motion was circulated there was not a word about this development.  Courtesy of the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the following morning we got banner headlines about such a development being envisaged.  It was probably stored away with two centimetres of dust on it and as soon as the motion reached the Deputies it was dusted off, shot into the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the way was prepared for the Taoiseach to come into the House.  Más maith is mithid.  Better late than never.  There are a dozen clichés to cover it.  The parts which we have advocated for some time <Col N="1953" /> will command the support of this side of the House.  I would be interested to hear the Minister on the fine print of this development. I should like him to take the opportunity also of indicating when the legislation will come before the House, because until an institute for development has been established it will not be possible for this House to vote moneys or to know what is envisaged, whether it is to be a public and private mix or whether the institute will own and pay for the grant and then make allowance for the development of the port through joint deals or leases.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the measures already taken to restore viability to Dublin Port; the decisions on the Custom House Dock Site announced by the Taoiseach on Wednesday, 23rd October and the intention to introduce early legislation to enable the restructuring of Dublin Port and Docks Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson is not a man who normally makes excessive claims but it is a little fanciful for him to suggest that the Government had this report lying on a shelf gathering dust and were only scared into action by Deputy Wilson placing this motion on the Order Paper.  That is not the case and Deputy Wilson is well aware of it.  An interdepartmental working party were looking at this question for 18 months.  The report was received in August and an announcement was made the first day the Dáil sat after the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of this opportunity for a short debate on the present position and future development of Dublin port.  Under existing legislation it is the function of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, in common with all other harbour authorities scheduled to the Harbours Act, 1946, to draw up plans for the development of their respective harbours.  Likewise it is the responsibility of the harbour boards to cater for existing trade and to seek to <Col N="1954" /> attract new business.  That is their function and not the function of Government.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that while Dublin Port and Docks Board in recent years may have displayed many weaknesses they have been exemplary in producing and implementing capital development plans.  These plans have been based on rolled-up five year development programmes and the first such programme covered the period 1977-82.  The board's major capital development plan has now been completed at a cost in excess of £17 million.</P>
    <P>Works carried out under the plan include major improvements in facilities at the south bank container terminal where a new container crane and extended cargo handling area have been provided; additional cargo handling space has been provided on the north side and the principal road access has been brought to dual carriageway standard throughout its length; a new headquarters has been built; safety, fire fighting facilities, fresh and salt water supplies within the board's estate have been considerably updated and, finally, the construction of a 200-metre long deepwater berth south of the car ferry terminal capable of taking the largest roll-on/roll-off vessels likely to come into use in the cross-channel sector trade has been completed.</P>
    <P>These works are, by and large, considered sufficient to meet the needs of the port to the end of this century.  The board's capital development programme over the next few years envisages relatively minor works only.  In this way the board plan to pursue a policy of consolidation while at the same time ensuring the most advantageous use of existing facilities without being involved in major expense.</P>
    <P>I think I should say here that it is more than a little amusing that the Opposition should now be talking about the industrial and commercial revitalisation of Dublin.  When it was expedient politically to do so in the past year or two, the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip, both of whom happen to sit for one of the portal constituencies, <Col N="1955" /> namely Dublin North-Central, were to the forefront in committing themselves publicly and strongly to their Clontarf constituents against certain industrial development proposals of the Dublin Port and Docks Board for the foreshore near Clontarf.  Deputies opposite often have very short memories.  Deputy Brady has now left the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>I am glad, since I should like to hear his explanation.  He tabled several questions to me and challenged me on the Order of Business not to approve a harbour works order.  Now we have an Opposition, of which Deputy Haughey is the Leader and Deputy Brady the Chief Whip, proposing the industrial and commercial revitalisation of Dublin port.</P>
      <P>The board still have before me an application for a harbour works order. The matter is at present under consideration and I should be interested to know if Deputy Haughey and Deputy Vincent Brady would, in view of the motion before us, wish to support the granting of a harbour works order or not.</P>

      <P>That has been disposed of since then by An Bord Pleanála. Deputies opposite, and the other two Deputies for the constituency, Deputy George Birmingham and Deputy Richard Bruton, were unanimous in pressing for the refusal of a harbour works order requested by the board.  Now Deputies opposite are pressing for the revitalisation of the port, both industrially and commercially.  Are they for or against a harbour works order?  I should like to know, as would the constituents in the Clontarf area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until recently the financial position of Dublin Port and Docks Board had been a success story in terms of Irish ports, that is up to their decision to become involved in stevedoring through the <Col N="1956" /> establishment of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited which commenced operations in the deep sea section of the port in July 1982.  The port had been so successful up to that time that the Dublin Port and Docks Board were able to undertake their major capital investment programme in 1978 without any Exchequer assistance.  The board were in a position from which they could have survived the recession without major difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is here that the story goes sour. Traffic at Dublin port has decreased from 7.9 million tonnes in the peak year of 1979 to 5.4 million tonnes in 1984.  Three main factors have played their part in bringing about this decline, namely: (1) the international recession; (2) the drop in importation of oil due to natural gas and other factors and (3) persistent industrial relations problems in the deep sea sector over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The first two are matters over which the Dublin Port and Docks Board and those who work in the port had no control. I will refer later to the third issue.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Vincent Brady is back in the House, so I will put again the questions I posed during his absence.  Is he for or against the Harbour Works Order? Does he want the industrial and commercial revitalisation of the port or does he not?  Is it not a fact that he has come in here on umpteen occasions, accompanied by Deputy Haughey, to speak against the Harbour Works Order?  I can understand that, as I can understand the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, and Deputy Richard Bruton opposing that order, but I cannot understand the inconsistency of this motion.  I am sure the citizens of Clontarf would like Deputy Brady to take this opportunity to clarify his position.  Is he for the port or is he against it?  Is he for vote catching&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have lost no opportunity to let them know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the Deputy's stand in this regard.  From the establishment in July 1982 of Dublin Cargo Handling Ltd., a subsidiary of the <Col N="1957" /> Port and Docks Board, until recently, the deep-sea section of the port was plagued with industrial unrest, often affecting the whole port, arising out of disagreement over redundancies and interpretation of agreements.  This resulted in a severe drain on the financial resources of the Port and Docks Board to such an extent that the very solvency of the board was called into question.  That is to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>In March this year the Government decided on a package of measures aimed at restoring financial equilibrium to the Port and Docks Board.  Last May the Government gave further consideration to the financial position of the Dublin Port and Docks Board in response to a plea from the board for further assistance and in the light of a downward revision, on the basis of a report commissioned by the board from Coopers and Lybrand, of the projections upon which the Government's earlier consideration, in March 1985, of the position had been based.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to provide a grant facility to the board of £3 million in the current year, which has already been paid, and equivalent amounts in 1986 and 1987 towards the cost of the board's capital development programme which, as I said earlier, has cost a total of over £17 million to date.  It was never before necessary to provide grant assistance to the board.</P>
      <P>The Government have also agreed to guarantee borrowings of £7 million by the board pending rectification of the board's financial position.  The guaranteed borrowings are to be phased out over the years 1987-1988.  In addition, two Local Loans Fund loans were agreed, but I will refer to this later.  The Government have made it clear to the board that it must itself take steps to rectify its financial position through measures such as disposal of assets as well as cost-cutting and revenue increasing measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial relations problems in the Dublin port were one of the three major components in its severe decline in trade. In several debates and discussions in the House during the past year, when people pressed me to save the port, I said that I <Col N="1958" /> could not save it, that the saving of the port was in the hands of those who manage it and who work there.  Even if it was in the 59th minute of the 12th hour, I am very glad that agreement was reached, and I am encouraged by reports from the port as to how that agreement is being implemented.  If the agreement continues to be implemented in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation we will have the major ingredient in the revival of Dublin port.  So far, I am encouraged by the reports of what has happened in the port since the agreement was reached.</P>
    <P>The State assistance was also contingent on the board putting the affairs of Dublin Cargo Handling Ltd. in order by concluding negotiations through DCH management for the rationalisation of the dock labour force.  I am glad to say that this finally has been achieved.  Now other parts of the rescue package are being finalised.  Naturally there is resistence to the idea of increased charges from users and potential users.  Already having allowed for the increased charges in the profit/loss forecast for the coming years, the board will need luck and firm, consistent and total support and co-operation from all who work in the port if viability is to be restored.  The onus is on those who argue against the increase in charges to show how their option would increase the chances of viable operation.</P>
    <P>This debate provides an opportunity to put the record straight on the board's proposal to dispose of port centre.  Consent was witheld by me for a proposal by the Dublin Port and Docks Board to sell and lease-back the port centre because the terms were not satisfactory from the board's point of view.  The proposed sale was the subject of a lot of controversy and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the circumstances in which the Department of Communications requested the Port and Docks Board to take steps to secure a sale and lease-back arrangement for the port centre.</P>
    <P>The Government rescue package included, as I said, a provision that the Port and Docks Board would take steps, including disposal of assets, to rectify its <Col N="1959" /> financial situation.  The board had identified in December 1984 a number of possible disposable assets, including the Custom House Docks site and the sale and lease-back of the port centre.  Subsequently, in March 1985, in the course of its financial review of the affairs of the board and its subsidiary.  Dublin Cargo Handling Limited, Coopers and Lybrand referred to asset disposal possibilities, again including the Custom House Docks site and the port centre, which had been identified by the finance sub-committee of the Port and Docks Board.  Apart from the Custom House Docks site, the single most valuable disposable asset identified was the port centre.</P>
    <P>It was in the foregoing context that the Department of Communications, in conveying to the board in May last details of the Government's revised rescue package, requested the board to take steps to secure a sale and lease-back arrangement for the port centre and to report back on the outcome.  I must reiterate that it is a matter for the board to select assets for disposal and then to seek ministerial approval in each case.  Consent was withheld on this occasion because the terms were not satisfactory.  I hope this will set the record straight on the issue.</P>
    <P>Non-implementation of the board's proposal, for the present, for sale and lease-back of the port centre has had implications for the board in so far as bank borrowings are concerned.  The board were informed accordingly that favourable consideration would be given to an application for a Local Loans Fund loan of £3 million on the understanding that such a loan would be used to reduce existing bank borrowing.  Such an application is at present being finalised.  This means that through grants, loan guarantees and direct loans, the Government have committed a total of £21.5 million as part of the rescue package for the board.  That is broken up as follows: £9 million in grants over three years, £7 million in guarantees and £5.5 million from the Local Loans Fund because we gave an earlier local loans fund allocation <Col N="1960" /> this year of £2.5 million.  That constitutes very substantial investment by the Government.</P>
    <P>The call for measures to revitalise the undeveloped dockland area seems a bit behind times in view of the package of measures recently announced by the Government which will have just this effect.</P>
    <P>The future of the Custom House Docks site has been considered by the Government in the light of the report of the inter-departmental working party who examined the matter.  The Government decided that the Minister for the Environment should have a Bill drafted to provide for the establishment of a new authority to direct and control the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site.  Details of the transfer of the site from the Port and Docks Board will be addressed in the context of the Bill. A package of measures, already announced, designed to encourage investment in the site will be provided for by the Minister for Finance in the next Finance Bill.  I do not want to go into this aspect of the issue in any great detail because the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment will speak later in this debate.  As he chaired the interdepartmental working party on the Custom House Docks site I am sure he will have a lot more to say on the question.</P>
    <P>In this context I do want to refer to the history of the problems of the port and docks board.  There is no doubt that the political turbulence of the 1981-82 period has contributed in so far as a decision was taken to stop the ports and docks board from selling the Custom House docks site commercially.  That decision was defensible because the 27 acres of the Dublin Port and Docks Board site constitute an extraordinary parcel of land to become available in the centre of Dublin.  It has very great potential for development and for the revitalisation of the core of Dublin.  I am not in any sense criticising the decision arrived at to the effect that this site is too important just to allow it pass out of the hands of a public authority without considering its implications or <Col N="1961" /> potential for the heart of Dublin.  What we do have to say is that it did have implications for the port and docks board.  At the time certain values were placed on that site by certain people, including agents on behalf of the port and docks board.  Those values have been assumed almost into fact, as if they constituted an achieved fact, that that was an offer made to the port and docks board for the site.  Of course, that was not the case.  A valuation was placed on it at that time.</P>

      <P>I have been avoiding criticising the Government of the time in relation to the matter because I feel the decision of the Government to the effect that it was of importance was justified. Unfortunately, it got caught up in a <i>milieu</i> of political turbulence and survival at enormous cost and, in deference to one Deputy, that could hardly be defensible in retrospect.  I do not think Deputy Wilson would now argue that that was something that Deputy Haughey and Fianna Fáil freely entered into, with a glad heart, or would want to do again.</P>

      <P>I am not disputing that nor am I disputing the rightness of the decision to the effect that this was an important site.  I did not want to get drawn into the Gregory deal or anything like that.  But, as a consequence of that decision, there were major implications for the port and docks board.  I was saying that there were estimated values abated for the site at the time.  Suffice it to say that the estimated values today are a great deal less.  But we should not let go unchallenged previous estimates and maintain that if the site had been sold that they would have realised the sort of money about which they were talking at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1962" /> The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment will speak later and, I have no doubt, will want to say a lot more about that.  When next year's Finance Bill is introduced it will contain legislative provisions for the financial incentives for the development of the Custom House docks site as announced by the Taoiseach in this House on 23 October.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will commend the action taken by the Government to safeguard the future of Dublin port and to provide for early development of the Custom House docks site.  However, it would be wrong to think that that is the end of the story.  I have already decided to disband the port and docks board at the earliest opportunity and to create a new Dublin Ports Authority.  This requires legislation and the necessary provisions are being included in the Harbours Bill, the heads of which have already been approved by the Government and the detailed terms of which are at present being drafted by the parliamentary draftsman.  I expect to circulate the Bill during the Christmas recess and I look forward to enactment early next year.  I should say that the principal purpose of this Bill will be the establishment of a Shannon Ports Authority and will have enabling provisions in relation to other major ports, including Dublin.</P>
    <P>The disbanding of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the appointment of a new authority allows us the opportunity to consider further the remit of the authority, including the role it might play in prompting revitalisation of the docklands area, not only for industrial and commercial purposes but also for housing and leisure purposes.  In this regard I am conscious of similar development in docklands elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to revert to the importance of industrial relations in the port to the survival of Dublin port and its revitalisation.  An agreement has now been reached and is being implemented. I hope that the agreement will be observed in its three years duration not only in letter but in spirit because it is in that spirit the future of the port lies. <Col N="1963" /> That is the best way to guarantee the future of the port.  I should like to say to the workforce down there, particularly to the dockers who were involved in the troubled area, that as far as I am concerned, I would hope that everybody can put behind him the experiences, the decline and problems of the past and look forward to the future.  I believe that if the board, management and staff work together in that spirit of co-operation the future of the port will be assured.  The agreement was achieved after considerable and protracted negotiations, after several visits to the Labour Court and including a special report prepared by Mr. Horgan of the Labour Court for the docks group set up under him called the Docks Review Group.</P>
    <P>I have to say that I regretted very much the interventions of the Opposition spokesman on Labour in those debates, a man for whom I have a lot of respect, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  In this case he intervened several times both in this House and on radio in a most unhelpful way and did not at all contribute to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a most important debate and it would be a great pity if either side were to endeavour to score political points.  Mistakes have been made; they are being made and were <Col N="1964" /> made in the recent past.  We must all accept that there are many jobs at stake here.</P>
      <P>Dublin port was formed in 1876 following the merger of a number of smaller companies in the shipping area.  Right into the nineteen hundreds Dublin port provided vast employment for the people of Dublin, particularly people on the north side of the city.  I remember as a youngster, and I am sure the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, also remembers, hearing stories about the men who worked in Dublin port.  Many of these stories were imaginary but there was an image built up about the port and it is part of the history of Dublin.  Therefore, it is vitally important that a debate of this nature on the future development of Dublin port should be taken very seriously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson put forward a motion in that vein in the hope that this House will move the Government to make some decision to start things moving as far as Dublin port is concerned.  The port has been stagnant for far too long and mistakes have been made.  It is up to the Oireachtas to initiate ideas and it is the responsibility of the Government not only to initiate ideas but to put in redevelopment plans and to be responsible for those plans, thus ensuring that Dublin port will continue to be part and parcel of Dublin commercial life and will make progress in the years ahead.  For that reason I support the motion put down by Deputy Wilson that a detailed plan for the redevelopment of Dublin port should be published to attract back lost business and to revitalise the undeveloped dockland area in regard to industrial, commercial, housing and leisure facilities which have been mentioned from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin port was one of the busiest in the country and it occupied a very important position in commercial life.  This was due perhaps to its geographical position and Dublin is very fortunate in being able to house one of the finest and most attractive ports.  By saying it is attractive I do not mean only in appearance but also in relation to industry in so far as the movement of goods is concerned.  The port contributed in a major way to <Col N="1965" /> employment, particularly in the inner city, and also to the many ancillary services arising from shipping in Dublin. The Horgan report published in 1984 was very significant and it is a great pity that the report, which went into great detail, has been lying on the shelves in Government Departments since then.  I know the Minister repudiated that in his speech but the Horgan report has been ignored and no action has been taken along the lines suggested in it.  The report made it very clear that urgent and emergency action was required as far as Dublin port was concerned.  Many ports in other parts of the country have been expanding rapidly at the expense of Dublin.  To a very large extent, Dublin unfortunately has priced itself out of the market as far as the economic costs of shipping are concerned. It is very clear that many firms in Dublin are now using other ports for economic and other reasons.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Dublin Ports and Docks Board for a couple of years and, therefore, I have some idea of what is happening there.  While very genuine and good proposals were put forward from time to time by the manager of Dublin port through the board, a number of other proposals were obviously not commercially viable.  Unfortunately, many of these proposals were accepted by the board which comprised people who had little or no contact with the day to day activities of the company.  That was one of the main weaknesses of Dublin port as I experienced it during my time there.  One of the main problems, as far as administration of the port is concerned, was the absence of any real input into its commercial and day to day activities by the board which comprised representatives of local authorities, the chamber of commerce, trade unions, various exporters' and importers' associations and a number of other vested interests operating in the port.  Talking about vested interests, when any matter comes up before a board there is always a human element involved and decisions can be made regarding vested interests which are totally at variance with and against <Col N="1966" /> the better interests of the port, the users of the port and the employees.</P>
    <P>Board members attended a meeting once a month and at that meeting were presented with wads of documents, papers and reports.  Sometimes these papers were given to them two or three days before a meeting and, when it is remembered that most of these people were very active in other areas of business, it would not be unfair to assume that many of these documents were not investigated properly.  Even if they were read, there was no time or opportunity for a member to have an in depth investigation or inquiry in to what action they should take in relation to the various proposals put forward.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest mistakes in recent years was the setting up of the stevedoring company, Dublin Cargo Handling, which was formed at a time when there were massive liabilities of many millions of pounds.  The Minister indicated that the trouble started with the setting up of Dublin Cargo Handling but this is not the case.  Anybody who looks at the accounts of Dublin Port and Docks Board will readily see that the board were running into serious financial difficulties even at that time.  That is why there was a lot of opposition to the proposal by the management to go into the stevedoring business at that time because it was obvious that we were coming into a time of deep depression.</P>
    <P>Problems were already on the horizon, finances were weak and the financial situation was not as sound as it should have been and certainly not sufficiently sound to embark on a venture such as that which the Dublin Port and Docks Board embarked on at that time, the setting up of a stevedoring company.  In setting up that company, they also took over liabilities of something in the region of £3 million at a time when there was such a serious depression in trade and in commercial business.  That was not a wise move commercially and any private enterprise seeking advice on a similar proposal would have been told to run 1,000 miles from it.  It rubberstamped <Col N="1967" /> and increased the difficulties of the board from that time on.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that at that time trade in Dublin port had been reduced by up to 20 per cent.  It can, therefore, be safely assumed that the management decision recommending the setting up of DCH to the board was disastrous. Later on it also brought in its wake a series of other major problems, not least of which was a continuation of industrial strife in the port.  In fairness to the management at the time, industrial strife had existed in the port for some years previously and one of the main reasons put forward at the time for the formation of Dublin Cargo Handling was that Dublin Port and Docks Board could control the industrial relations and problems and could monitor the situation as they were directly involved in stevedoring. They foresaw that there might not be industrial strife in the port and that the situation would improve radically. However, that was not to be, because industrial disputes multiplied shortly after the DCH were set up.  What happened after that is history and has been debated in the House on numerous occasions.</P>
    <P>Apart from rising costs in Dublin port, industrial stoppages were a major contributory factor in the loss of trade. Exporters and importers could not depend on the port to handle their goods. During a number of disputes many companies were almost put out of business because their goods were locked in a labour dispute which means serious financial losses for the users of the port.  That happened on a number of occasions.  It is clear from a commercial point of view that any customer finding himself in that situation on a regular basis would not continue to use the facilities in Dublin, particularly when alternatives were available at a lower price.  That is why such trade was lost to Dublin port.</P>
    <P>We were in a time of depression.  However, as can be seen from figures published some time ago, while business in various ports throughout the country increased, Dublin port lost considerably. <Col N="1968" /> From 1980 to 1984 there was a 7 per cent increase in trade through other ports but Dublin lost out by 16 per cent.  Dublin Cargo Handling were formed in 1982 or 1983.  During that time Cork increased its port trade by 11 per cent and Drogheda, a small port 30 miles from Dublin that does not possess the facilities available at Dublin, increased its trade by 67 per cent. These figures speak for themselves.  They show that other ports have been very successful with an overall increase of 7 per cent in trade.</P>
    <P>With that background it is not surprising that Dublin port has proved unattractive to its customers.  As we have seen from the figures, the provincial ports were the winners because they offered greater reliability and stability to the customer at a lower cost and this despite the fact that they have not the same kind of facilities that exist in Dublin port.  In that connection I should like to congratulate the engineers in Dublin port and docks for their efforts to introduce modern machinery, cranes and so on.  They did that despite grave difficulties.  They did it independently, relying on the forecasts and budgets of the people in the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Unfortunately the projections in those budgets were not realised.</P>
    <P>There has never been as much discontent in any industry as there has been in Dublin port in recent years.  While dockers worldwide have a reputation for being difficult people to control, I do not subscribe to the view that the cause of the problem in Dublin was one sided. Unfortunately that view is put across far too frequently.  It is said the dockers are difficult to control and manage and that they are unreasonable but from my experience I cannot agree with that viewpoint. I have seen both sides.  It is unfortunate that there has not been sufficient flexibility on the part of management in Dublin port during times of strife and industrial stress.  In recent years management in the port has become very inflexible. On a number of occasions attempts were made to sit out disputes that went on for months and, in the meantime, viable business was lost.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1969" /> management seemed totally unaware of the prospect that business would be lost forever but that is what happened.  That is not a sign of good or experienced management. There must be flexibility where dockers are concerned but that did not exist in Dublin.  What we are dealing with tonight is the consequence of those actions which are part of the overall problem in Dublin port.</P>
    <P>In recent times members of the board have endeavoured to shift the blame to various Governments.  They have referred to the Fianna Fáil Government of 1981-82 when a decision was taken by the then Government to take over a 20-acre site for development.</P>

      <P>An attempt was made by management to pass the buck to Governments.  I have pointed out that there was considerable mismanagement of the port which caused many problems. The Port and Docks Board cannot seriously maintain that the actions of the then Government caused them financial difficulties.  They were operating at a <Col N="1970" /> major loss of £1 million per month.  That was at a time when it was obvious that business activity was totally depressed so far as Dublin was concerned.  That port lost business it would never regain. Budgets by the management at the time were pie in the sky.  The blame for the financial state of the port must be laid fairly and squarely where it belongs. mainly, with the board themselves.  Let there be no mistake about that.  The board produced crazy budgets and crazy forecasts that could not be realised: approximately only 50 per cent or 60 per cent was realised.  This was the cause of many of the problems of Dublin port in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The Horgan report made all of these points.  It proposed urgent action to bring the port to a break even point with the propect of getting into a profit-making situation in the future.  Therefore, it is unfortunate that the Government have not taken action.  The guarantees of the Minister to the port in recent months for small amounts of money will not do anything for the port.  The fact that smaller ports have continued to prosper at the expense of Dublin is in itself an indictment.  It will take firm and novel action to regain the confidence of the business community to return their business to Dublin on the scale needed to develop and to promote Dublin to the standards that should obtain in a capital city.</P>
      <P>This development must also be seen to be beneficial to all parts of the community. I should like to refer to the proposal not long ago by Dublin port to lease part of the reclaimed land for the building of underground caverns for the storage of LPG.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure: Service of Public Debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1971" /> As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure I am very pleased to have this opportunity for a debate on the committee's report on the public service debt.  The report is possibly the shortest we have produced to date but in my view, and in the view of the committee generally, it far outweighs in significance the brevity of its contents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact also that for the first time in the Dáil we have an opportunity, not of discussing the issues in detail but of merely considering the potential role of the Oireachtas which must sanction expenditure and taxation in the area of foreign borrowing and the service charges that follow from that borrowing.</P>
    <P>Because criticism of existing policies on domestic or foreign debt is outside the terms of reference of the Committee on Public Expenditure &mdash; and, I acknowledge immediately with reasonable constraint in our deliberations &mdash; the main concern expressed in the report is the need to establish a mechanism whereby this House, by way of Dáil debate or by way of one of the Oireachtas committees, should have an opportunity at least to discuss and comment on aspects of public debt which have a direct impact on public expenditure generally.  This can only be helpful in that, while we recongnise the Executive authority and responsibility in regard to any expenditure that must be passed by this House, the Oireachtas should not be seen to be merely a rubber stamp in an area which has been growing in terms of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>I should like to put my remarks in the following context: table 3 of the 1985 budget booklet indicates that between 1981 and 1985 the current Government expenditure on the service of the public debt rose from £884 million to £1,991 million, just short of £2 billion.  That is a two and a half fold increase in that four year period.  It is relevant to compare this enormous amount with the other areas of current Government expenditure.  For example, the economic services estimate is £775 million.  That is the estimate about which the public understandably are most concerned in many ways.  Infrastructure <Col N="1972" /> which all of us in the House will acknowlege is of vital importance, costs £102 million.  Likewise, we acknowledge that the social services in respect of which there is a social obligation on us in a variety of ways, totals the very signficant cost of £4,774 million.  The increase in that respect can be a consequence of the policies of the Government of the day. The amount in respect of security is £609 million but that is an area in respect of which, unfortunately, we do not have as yet control as direct as we would wish, particularly in terms of the increasing cost of cross-Border security which is a matter of growing concern not only for the State but for the taxpayer also.  If one includes all those items and the EC budget payments, the total is a gross figure of £8,949 million or, after receipts have been discharged to the Revenue, a total of £7,568 million.  That is the total allocation of what we would regard as the expenditure programmes of the Government of the day.  As will be seen from those few statistics, the very considerable amount being spent this year on the servicing of the public debt must be of continuing concern and something we must address ourselves in so that the Oireachtas, acting on behalf of the taxpayer, will ensure that the best possible decisions are taken in the area of domestic foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>In recent years high levels of borrowing have increased considerably the Exchequer debt.  Consequently, its debt service payments, which are a first charge on current revenue, pre-empt this year almost 40 pence in every £ of tax revenue compared with 26p ten years ago.  That is a measure of the growth of the problem and of the constraint it poses for economic policy.  Even with increasing tax contributions there has been that level of increase.  That is the amount required to service, on the taxpayers' part, our foreign debt.  Obviously the first and basic objective of the service of the public debt programme is to curb the growth of debt service costs by reducing the level of Exchequer borrowing.  The second objective is to continue to reduce the level of foreign borrowing particularly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1973" /> The cost of foreign borrowing is subject to considerable uncertainty and this is one of the areas that we in the committee were concerned to draw attention to. More than 60 per cent of the Exchequer's foreign debt is on a floating interest rate basis and for that reason is exposed to significant fluctuation and cost.  For example, as was pointed out both in the bulletin from the Department and in the Central Bank bulletins, a 1 per cent increase in international interest rates would add £40 million to the Exchequer's debt service charges.  Foreign debt is subject also to exchange rate losses.  We have seen some very dramatic examples of the growth in our foreign debt as a result of the exchange rate fluctuations particularly regarding the dollar in the past 12 months.</P>

We are prepared to take advantage of the luck that may turn with the wheel but we are very concerned also to ensure that we can guard against the excessive costs that follow the appreciation of the dollar, such as has happened in the past 12 months, <i>vis-à-vis</i> our currency, though I acknowledge that this has made a comeback in the meantime.  More fundamentally, however, interest paid on foreign debt represents a significant outflow of resources from the economy and this outflow can be met only by way of increased earnings from exports or from other foreign receipts and by definition must be supported by an increased level of taxation.  The significance of this is that the cost of foreign borrowing is governed by a floating interest rate system which can give rise to significant fluctuations and costs.  That is one of the main reasons for the committee deciding to examine this question of the service of the public debt and to put it in context. We in the committee have been working in an objective and non-partisan way in considering the expenditure programmes <Col N="1974" /> of various Departments.  The amounts concerned are significant in any event though they might not in any one case involve figures in excess of £10 million or £20 million or £5 million.  Nevertheless, we considered ourselves constrained to address the impact of public expenditure in terms of the growing cost of servicing the foreign debt.  We considered ourselves obliged to bring the matter before the Oireachtas so that it would at least have the opportunity of comment, if not effectively of changing the pattern of our borrowing strategy.</P>
      <P>If the Minister, on the basis of the financial expertise available to him within the Department, decides to opt for a foreign loan in, say, US dollars rather than Japanese yen or German Deutsche Marks, a question must arise as to whether he has available to him the most up to date and relevant information on the economies and exchange rate systems in operation in those countries with which we negotiate for our foreign loans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to have a degree of public discussion and public accountability, which is what this House is about.  It was for that reason that the committee brought the matter before the House in what I hope is a non-partisan and objective way at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the committee were considering this question of the service of public debt, the US dollar was extremely strong in relation to other currencies with which Ireland was dealing on a regular basis. The net effect of the strength of the dollar was that we were paying a very high additional cost in terms of extra interest arising from the ever increasing rate of the US dollar compared with the Irish punt.  In fact, it is significant to note that the US dollar component in our external debt almost doubled from £1.674 billion at the end of December 1972 to £3.145 billion by 31 March this year.  That by any standard is a major increase and one which we had to take note of to the extent that it could create an imbalance and an undue preponderance of the US dollar in <Col N="1975" /> our foreign borrowing portfolio.  A balanced mix in our foreign borrowing portfolio would seem to be a prudent guard against undue fluctuations in the exchange rate with non-EMS currencies, such as the US dollar and the Japanese yen.  We have a reasonable guarantee of stability in our exchange rates with the EMS currencies because we all operate within the bands established, but that guarantee cannot be provided when borrowing in non-EMS currencies.  For that reason we were concerned to suggest to those with executive responsibility in this area, the Minister of the day and his advisers, that a balance within the portfolio of foreign borrowing would seem to be a prudent course.</P>
    <P>Because of the significant additional amounts of interest we have had to pay on our foreign borrowing, this led to the obvious question, was there any mechanism whereby Ireland could renegotiate some of the loans or, more importantly, move away from over-dependence of loans in US dollars and Japanese yen? There was evidence at the time that loans were available in European currencies, particularly the German Deutsche Mark, and the opportunity should have been availed of to take up loans in money markets where these exchange rates were known to be more stable.</P>
    <P>Let me acknowledge at this stage that I am speaking personally, and let me digress for a moment.  I recall many occasions during the last 12 months when, as Opposition spokesman, I asked the Minister why we did not have a greater balance in our foreign debt portfolio and the Minister said, more than once, that if we were to borrow in currencies &mdash; and he mentioned currencies which could hardly be called hard currencies &mdash; it would not be very prudent.  I recall on more than one occasion saying in this House that we are not talking about soft currencies but about EMS currencies in which we have traditionally had a certain balance in our foreign borrowing portfolio. I welcome the Minister's belated conversion.</P>
    <P>I notice that in next year's programme <Col N="1976" /> for borrowing, we are balancing our foreign borrowing between the US dollar, the Yen and the EMS currencies and turning to the Dutch guilder and the Deutsche Mark.  We welcome such a move because we will have a relative guarantee against the fluctuations which occur from time to time.  Sometimes we might get lucky if we are dealing with currencies outside the EMS but at other times, as has been the case, we might be very unlucky indeed, either in terms of the exchange rates or the interest rates which apply from time to time.  That is why we are suggesting that there should be at least a balance and a prudent mix in our foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>If we look at the trend &mdash; and this applies to all Ministers &mdash; we will see that there is a need to adhere to the targets we set in terms of borrowing, economic development and controlling the current budget deficit.  Let us look at the trends since 1973.  In 1973 external Government debt was less than £100 million; for 1977 that figure had escalated to almost £800 million, a multiplier of eight in four years; this year it will exceed £8 billion, a multiplier of ten since 1977.  With a growth of that nature it is of vital importance that this House have at least a hand in discussing not just the economic policies in terms of current budget deficit, control of public expenditure and public sector pay, but also to be made aware of the strategy, without breaching confidentiality, which the Government of the day follow in raising their foreign borrowing.  An increase from £100 million in 1973, to £800 million in 1977 and to £8 billion this year, is unsustainable in any economy, but particularly in an economy of our size where it now exceeds the total foreign debt by over £500 million, the total net allocation for Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>If one were to look at any enterprise and see that the total allocation for expenditure in any one year would be less by a significant amount than the total amount being raised from its creditors, in this case foreign creditors, this would raise the fundamental question as to the viability of that enterprise.  A fundamental question arises as to the viability of our <Col N="1977" /> economic enterprise.  We are not arguing this evening as to how best in terms of economic policies to cope with this problem but it highlights the need to address this matter as one of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Another very worrying feature is that within that figure two-thirds of the Exchequer borrowing of £2.1 billion this year would be required to finance the current budget deficit of over £1,300 million, which one can reasonably state will be the figure as far as we can ascertain leaving only one-third available for funding the capital services programme, which we all acknowledge was the original purpose of our borrowing programme.  If one borrows for productive purposes, which in turn will generate economic activity, and which in turn will increase the revenue yield, then one is borrowing for a very positive purpose.  If so much of it, in this instance two-thirds of it, is already pre-empted to meet the deficit in the current budget clearly a major question has to be faced.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the report was to provide the House with an opportunity to discuss whether or not Ministers for Finance of any administration should be more amenable to Dáil Éireann in the control of decisions taken on the national debt.  While respecting the fact that there will always be a system of negotiating domestic and foreign borrowing in an atmosphere of confidentiality I am uneasy that the taxpayer is committed to accepting decisions taken by the Minister for Finance in his corporate capacity on behalf of the Government and the people in relation to very significant loans which have implications for the taxpayer in terms of interest on current loans well into the next century.  For that reason I welcome the fact not only that this debate has been launched in the House but that the Minister is here for what is an historic occasion because it is the first time that the elected representatives of the Oireachtas have had the opportunity, through the presentation of a committee report, of looking at the broad outlines of strategy and accountability to the House of the Minister for Finance.  On other occasions the Minister and I, playing <Col N="1978" /> different roles, will have an opportunity to engage in a more political, perhaps partisan debate but this debate is not for that purpose.  I hope that the fact that we have brought our concern as a committee to the House and that the Minister is here to respond will be of service to the taxpayer and the economy generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a significant and important issue.  I am mindful that the Vice-Chairman of the committee is a former Minister for Finance and that the principle respondent is the current Minister. I speak as a representative of mere mortals who might not necessarily understand high finance but who have a concern about the issue which is whether or not we can make a better attempt at assessing in this House at regular intervals how certain public debt decisions are arrived at, whether in general terms these decisions were good or whether a better formula for evaluation of that decision making mechanism can be arrived at. This is important because the amount of public debt we are speaking about is truly gigantic.  It is in the order of £600 per annum for every man, woman and child, a total of some £2,000 billion pounds.  It is therefore strange that it is reasonable for this House to debate small sums whether in Private Members' Time, Question Time or otherwise at regular intervals but the decision making process which for understandable reasons largely operates secretly, but which can have major implications for the way in which the economy is managed, is never formally debated in this House, even if the rules of that debate were such as would preclude those participating from discussing the obvious sensitive market place type information and data which might very well make for very difficult operation by the incumbent Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we have a public debt of that magnitude and where borrowing decisions are made which are not accountable directly to the Dáil in the way in which certain other decision making processes are, it is reasonable for us to say that we should consider whether we can improve on this.  The report is very <Col N="1979" /> small and its proposal is very modest.  It does not plunge into telling the Minister how things should be done.  It simply suggests that dialogue should commence between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service on the development of a system to examine public debt servicing.  The precise recommendation is that the lack of a specific formalised mechanism for Oireachtas discussion and analysis of decision making with regard to domestic and foreign borrowing policy be corrected. We suggest that some system of meaningful debate on this issue should be developed by discussions between the Minister for Finance, the Leader of the House and appropriate Dáil or Oireachtas committees, if necessary taking into account the sensitivity of those questions to our national economic wellbeing.  We readily admit that we do not know the precise parameters of such a formula but such a formula should be developed.  It is strange that that omission is a feature of economic and political life at present.</P>
    <P>When the Vice-Chairman, Deputy O'Kennedy raised this issue first at the committee meetings and urged that we should develop an attitude to it there was some degree of trepidation as to whether we were overstepping our remit because when we were set up in 1983 we were charged with the task of reviewing on-going expenditure of Government Departments, offices and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  We asked ourselves if this precluded us from examining the central fund services which covered payment of interest on the national debt and sinking fund and we decided on balance that we were entitled to make an observation.  The issue this evening therefore is not whether or not this is borderline in relation to our terms of reference, it is simply a question of the increasing concern by a number of public representatives about the area of decision making by elected representatives which has not been traditionally open to analytical scrutiny in this House.  It is valid for us to suggest that it is time that it should be open to scrutiny in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The service of the debt for 1985 is estimated at just under £2,000 million or a quarter of net Government expenditure. We were right to draw attention to the fact that there is little or no opportunity for the Oireachtas to debate the issues involved in what amounts to an enormous outflow of taxpayers' money. Ultimately that is the remit of the committee, to attempt to justify to the taxpayer how his money is being used and to try to evaluate whether or not we might urge improvements on systems, or better value for money where that may be possible. It may be argued that Members can obtain information on the national debt by tabling parliamentary questions or by contributing on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In neither case is there a proper opportunity for systematic and considered evaluation of the issues involved.  The Finance Bill is wholly unsatisfactory.  On Second Stage it wanders all over the place and does not focus on or give significance to the issue in this report.  Parliamentary questions are by nature somewhat truncated and while they are interesting in the context of ascertaining statistical and other data they are not an appropriate forum for considered evaluation as to whether major decisions made behind closed doors were the best decisions or were the fruit of the best decision making process.</P>
    <P>We subscribe to the view that improvement is possible in all human situations and perhaps even in this context improvement is possible.  We are not suggesting that there is any basic lack of order in the manner in which these decisions are arrived at.  We do not know whether they are the best decisions or whether the mechanism for making those decisions is the best and we are suggesting that there are Deputies who would take the opportunity of assisting the Minister in evaluating that process so that we could be assured that that mechanism was the best available.</P>
    <P>The traditional systems open to us for this evaluation seem to my committee to be inadequate for the purposes of this examination.  We believe that Dáil or <Col N="1981" /> committee time, if that is the appropriate mechanism, should be set aside regularly to discuss all relevant matters relating to domestic and foreign borrowing, again leaving aside the very sensitive marketplace type data which could cause difficulty for a Minister in the crucial job of decision making at the heart of this area.  We are not interested in that; we are interested simply in a system that operates and is used for these decisions.</P>
    <P>We are not suggesting for a second that the Minister for Finance should be expected to tell this House or the public in the first instance about details of confidential negotiations that take place in securing our loans.  That would be preposterous and irresponsible.  It could not happen.  The whole point of trying to have private negotiations is to obtain the best deal, and that cannot be done in public.  It goes without saying that the very nature of such negotiations depends to a large degree on much behind the scenes planning, discussion and eventual agreement.  There has been a long tradition, not only in Ireland but also in other countries, of delicate and highly confidential dealing with the financial institutions in Europe, Japan and the US. All we are interested in is our concern to ensure that the present systems used by the Department of Finance for the planning and securing of loans are the most efficient and effective available.  In effect this means that the committee and the whole House need to be assured that the greatest possible expertise is available so that the best advantage may be gained for us in our domestic and foreign borrowing. Therefore, the kind of questions that the Minister would deal with in the context of this evaluation would be, for example, whether he was satisfied that the advisers available to him are formally trained in the financial skills and expertise needed to deal with the banking institutions at home and abroad, whether they are regularly updated and have access to the latest information and expertise available and whether the staff involved train with outside bodies who would improve those skills or have access to such self-improvement techniques.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> Without going into the thing in detail, the committee are concerned because they have learned in their short existence that there is serious cause for concern about the technical expertise and the capacity in relation to marketplace decision making by many people making such decisions in the Departments of State at this time.  Anybody who wants to drop in to any one of our meetings on a Tuesday afternoon at Setanta House will realise what we are talking about when we say that.  There is serious cause for concern. Therefore we like to think that decisions made secretly, for understandable reasons, are made in the context of having the very best insight and expertise available.  For example, we would be interested to know whether the Department of Finance study in a systematic, regular and moderate way the financial markets, exchange rates and so on to ensure that loans at the most favourable interest rates are negotiated.  Can the Department of Finance pick the best, use the best and have the best expertise in order to progress this area of decision making?  At the moment we are not suggesting that they do not.  It is only fair to say that many of us have a great degree of respect for the present incumbent of the office and for the manner in which he has clearly attempted to tackle the enormous problems of his office.  All we are suggesting is that these fundamental questions should be considered openly, helpfully and co-operatively in this House and that the House, therefore, would be able to accept in good faith arising from that discussion that the necessary expertise and advice are available to the Minister when he is making decisions which will have far-reaching effects not only on today's taxpayers but on the next generation as well.  The amount of money we are talking about is enormous.  There are huge implications for all of us and for our children and our children's children the way things are going.  We believe it is reasonable to debate this situation to whatever extent is possible in this House and to try to come to grips with the decision making process so that the public, the taxpayer and all on this side <Col N="1983" /> of the House can be assured that the best is being done.  The proposal in the report is very modest.  It is couched generally and it urges the Minister for Finance to engage in discussions to procure such a system and have it put in place.</P>
    <P>The foreign borrowing element has been falling in recent years but it is still accounting for a very large outflow of funds which should be available for more productive investment in the country.  At present the area we are talking about is dealt with in a way which, to the committe at least, is unsatisfactory.  Under existing legislative arrangements the payment of interest and principal on the Government's debt is not subject to annual approval by the Oireachtas in the way that most other types of expenditure are.  The Oireachtas has enacted broad enabling legislation to empower the Minister for Finance to borrow money on the domestic and foreign markets without further reference to the House as to the amounts and terms of the loans.  Legislation is enacted from time to time to ensure that the Minister is empowered to avail of whatever new borrowing instruments emerge on the capital market; but the legislation, while up-dated periodically, rests at that.  The basic issues are not subject to scrutiny in this House further to that.  The finance accounts, which are published annually, give details of all service payments on the Government's debt as well as information on all borrowings raised by the Government. They also give a statement of the Government's debt outstanding at the end of the year with a maturity profile and, in the case of foreign debt, an indication of the currencies in which it is held, a matter with which the vice-chairman was particularly concerned earlier this year.  During the year an Exchequer statement is issued for the end of each week showing the broad categories of Government receipts, expenditure, borrowing and debt repayment. The information on the borrowing and debt repayment transactions shown in this statement is to a considerable extent in aggregate form and does not itemise each individual loan.  Therefore, <Col N="1984" /> while Deputies may table parliamentary questions on any aspect of the Government's debt policy, the detail and the detailed scrutiny we are speaking of do not seem to be feasible under present arrangements.</P>
    <P>Of course, all transactions relating to the Government's debt are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who reports directly to the Dáil, but he has no effectiveness function.  His job is simply to ensure that money voted by this House is spent for the purpose for which it is voted.  It is simply an accounting, audit function, although he has to some extent been urged into the area of suggesting efficiency measures also.  In another context we should examine the possibility of trying to broaden the scope of his office to deal with those issues.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have reason to be concerned.  Our committee are in discussion with the Revenue Commissioners at present and some of the data emerging is, from our point of view, a little hair-raising on occasions.  The Minister probably is very familiar with this kind of data. For example, in cases where the Revenue Commissioners pursue people whom they describe to be defaulters, 95 per cent of cases which are pursued in this way do not come to payment or fruition &mdash; they do not pay up.  In other words, about £295 million does not seem to be returned, according to the Revenue Commissioners. We are not going into all the cases and all the figures, some of them very speculative, in regard to tax due, tax cpayable and so on.  All I will say is that if we could ensure that we could make savings and improve efficiency these figures would perhaps be on a much smaller scale.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Government will take note of the central theme of this report.  In our view there should be an acceptance of some procedure whereby this House, through the Dáil or through one of its committees, would have some opportunity to discuss aspects of the service of public debt on a regular basis.  I hasten to add that my committee are not looking for more work, so I hope that if a committee are deemed to be <Col N="1985" /> appropriate some other committee will be formed for such deliberations.  I suppose our basic concern is for the taxpayer, who is ultimately entitled to know in as much detail as possible how the taxes he or she pays are used.  If the committee's views as set out in this report are accepted I have no doubt that the new procedures will provide welcome additional information which will allow the Oireachtas and the public generally to have access to details of how and where their taxes are spent.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this proposal, which is submitted with respect and in a spirit of helpfulness, will evoke a mixed response.  I do not think it is terribly important whether or not this is a borderline case in terms of the jurisdiction of a committee of the House and I have no doubt that there are Ministers, less worthy than this one, who might seek to utilise such a technical device as terms of reference to somehow put offside the submission in this document.  I have no doubt at all that the Minister for Finance will not do that.  Ultimately, it is not important whether a proposal is within or outside the terms of reference or whether it is proper or improper in some way or another.  It is the combined attempt by a group of people working with a small backup team to assist in trying to enlighten the House and, in some modest way, the public on areas which might be open to improvement in evaluated technique.  That is what we are after.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister, on behalf of the committee, that we very much appreciate the time and trouble he has taken to give consideration to reports from our committee.  Working in the committee system is difficult enough. Sometimes it is of dubious value but one does one's best.  Therefore, it is heartening to have the opportunity to have this type of dialogue and to know that recommendations issued in this way will be given respectful and constructive consideration. It is heartening to know that they will be responded to with the standard of courtesy which we have come to expect from the Minister for Finance.  We <Col N="1986" /> expect, therefore, that our request will fall on welcoming ears and that the Minister may find it possible to tell us he believes there is merit in what we say in this case that he will do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping with the tradition of the House even where it is not required I would prefer to ask for it.  I would be less than frank &mdash; it would be impossible for me to do it now in the light of what the chairman and the vice-chairman of the committee have said &mdash; if, in replying to the debate, I did not repeat the reservations which I previously expressed in the House about the entry of the committee into the area of service of public debt.  The central task of the committee, and one which I wholeheartedly support &mdash; that is the official view of the Minister for Finance and the personal view of the current Minister &mdash; is to examine the justification for, and the effectiveness of, ongoing expenditure of Government Departments and certain State-sponsored bodies.  I am very interested to note that Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Keating, vice-chairman and chairman of the committee, have an obvious question mark in their minds about whether or not this matter falls within the committee's terms of reference.  It seems to me to matter whether or not the committee stay within their terms of reference. I would apply that remark particularly to the Committee on Public Expenditure because of the importance of the remit.  I intend to make some more references to the importance of that remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The servicing of debt is not an activity <Col N="1987" /> which falls within any reasonable interpretation of the committee's mandate. Such expenditure is not discretionary; it is obligatory, contractual expenditure which the Government and the Oireachtas have no option but to meet.  It is for this reason that the Oireachtas made it a permanent charge on the Central Fund rather than subjecting it to annual approval and appropriation by the Oireachtas.  Expenditure on debt service is, therefore, fundamentally different from normal discretionary expenditure which may be proposed by the Government and submitted to the Oireachtas for approval.  As is acknowledged in the committee's report, the cost of servicing the Exchequer debt is the result of decisions made by the Government and the Oireachtas about other expenditure programmes and the overall level of borrowing.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, in expressing themselves in the way they have, the committee have been putting the cart before the horse.  What we should worry about is not so much the impact of debt servicing on public expenditure but rather the reverse.  We should be worried about what the impact of public expenditure is on debt servicing.  I note that Deputy O'Kennedy in his remarks laid some considerable emphasis on the need to reduce the level of borrowing and in particular to reduce the level of foreign borrowing.  I agree with him in that concern. I sincerely hope that he can stick to it and can persuade other people to do so.  I hope it will not simply be his personal view but that it will be a view shared by the other side of the House in general.</P>
    <P>The borrowing programme, of course, also involves policy judgments and operational day to day decisions which fall to be made by me and my Department and in relation to which we are answerable to the House, to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, each one with its specific part to play in the process.  These decisions, and many of them are made in the course of the year, are very carefully considered ones.  They are made on the <Col N="1988" /> basis of a very close scrutiny of all the opportunities offered by the market, and, indeed, by a very painstaking appreciation of the constraints imposed by market conditions at any given time.  We have available to us to do this the widest possible range of up to date information from all financial markets.  In addition &mdash; the chairman of the committee asked about this &mdash; we have available to us the expertise to do it.  Of that I have no doubt whatever.  We have the skills that are required to do it.</P>
    <P>I might add that Ireland is regarded as a reliable borrower, as a very expert borrower and in many cases and in many quarters of the financial markets of the world is regarded if anything as a fairly aggressive borrower.  I can fairly say &mdash; and this is something of which I have been very conscious over the last three years &mdash; that our borrowing operations are carried out in a manner which has increased both the respect in which the Irish Exchequer, and the Irish operation generally, are held and in a manner which had contributed in no small way to the improvement to our creditworthiness, a matter of some considerable importance to us.</P>
    <P>If anything I find that our borrowing operation tends to be criticised for getting excessively fine terms.  This is a matter we have had the opportunity to discuss in the House at other times.  It seems to me that it is far better to have that kind of reputation in financial matters than to have any other kind of reputation.  We have in place the expertise and the skills which are applied to the information that we have available on markets that give us the result in terms of the kind of management of our borrowing policy that we see from day to day.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to that, for the benefit of the chairman of the committee &mdash; and I say this in a spirit of constructiveness &mdash; I am rather at a loss to think what mechanisms a committee of this House might have at their disposal to review day to day decisions, particularly given the confidential nature of some of these decisions which the chairman has mentioned. Despite these reservations about <Col N="1989" /> the report and this venture of the committee into that area, I should like to deal briefly with the concerns which are stated to lie behind the report that the committee decided to make.  At the bottom of page 2 of the report, I find the following phrase:</P>
    <P>The committee were asked to what extent this happened arising from decisions taken to switch an increasing proportion of Ireland's foreign borrowing to the US dollar market.</P>
    <P>I wonder who put that question to the committee?  The committee cannot answer it.  Perhaps they should ask the question.  That is possibly a more elegant way of putting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic concern lying behind the asking of this autonomous and self-generating question seems to be that the cost of debt servicing may have been increased as a result of an alleged switch in recent years towards borrowing more US dollars and Japanese yen at a time when these currencies were appreciating in value against the Irish pound and a move away from borrowing EMS currencies against which we have enjoyed greater exchange rate stability.  I have to say quite simply that the alleged switch in borrowing simply did not take place. Official policy has been and continues to be to borrow in a well balanced portfolio of currencies, indeed, a view that was expressed here earlier on this evening by the vice-chairman of the committee, Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>It seems &mdash; and I say this in all sincerity &mdash; that he was about to arrive at the kind of conclusions that I have long ago arrived at if he pursued to its logical conclusion the train of thought he was pursuing. The committee might well have done the same thing, although I am not so sure that it is an appropriate matter for debate by the committee.  The achievement of a balanced portfolio is the best way of ensuring that, over time, the exchange risks necessarily involved in our foreign borrowings are minimised, since appreciation of some currencies will tend to be offset by depreciation of others</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the precise proportions of individual currencies in the debt portfolio <Col N="1991" /> at any particular time may not correspond entirely with our preferred currency distribution.  Even were there to be at any given moment in time a preferred currency distribution, the last thing that I, or any Minister for Finance, would wish to do would be to say publicly what that preferred distribution would be. That would be an extremely bad tactic and a way of ensuring that we did not get the finest terms available on the market. The fact that the portfolio has not at any given time corresponded exactly with a preferred currency distribution simply reflects the obvious fact that we do not control conditions in the international capital market.  A flexible approach is needed to respond to rapidly changing conditions in the various markets and to ensure that we can get the best possible terms.</P>
    <P>There may be good tactical reasons also why we might wish to launch a borrowing operation in a particular market on a given occasion so as to demonstrate our ability to raise funding in that market at competitive rates.  The very fact of carrying out an operation of that kind can quite often have a significant effect on a country's creditworthiness.  We have had experience of that in the not too distant past.  However, if we were to borrow too frequently in a particular market we would simply push up the price we would have to pay for funds.  It is not possible, therefore, to raise all our requirements in any one market, other than, of course, the dollar market.  We could not raise all the funds we need in EMS currencies. There are a great many reasons for this, many of which we have already discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there was a switch into US dollar borrowings seems to be based on the increase in the proportion of our total debt held in that currency from 32 per cent at the end of 1982 to 39 per cent at the end of 1984.  These proportions are calculated by translating the various foreign currencies into Irish currency at the exchange rate in operation on the two dates mentioned.  The proportions are determined, therefore, <Col N="1992" /> not only by the amount of new borrowings undertaken in particular currencies but also by the movement of those currencies against the Irish pound during the period concerned.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the increase in the dollar proportion of our debt between 1982 and 1984 was due almost entirely to the appreciation of the US dollar by about 40 per cent during those two years. It is certainly the case that a number of important new dollar borrowings were launched during that period, but the higher proportion of dollar debt was brought about primarily by the change in the exchange rate rather than as a result of any deliberate policy decision to switch out of the EMS currencies.  Deputy O'Kennedy has been worried about the balance in the portfolio and I am explaining just how that concern with the balance in the portfolio is given effect and what are the other factors which I gather the committee did not appreciate or refer to &mdash; how factors other than the simple amount of borrowing in a given currency can affect the balance of the portfolio.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat a point I made before in this House.  When we compare our performance and the balance in our foreign borrowing portfolio with that of other countries, we find some rather interesting things.  In December 1983 we had 39 per cent of our foreign currency borrowings in dollars, 40 per cent in the EMS currencies, 5 per cent in sterling, 8 per cent in Swiss francs and 7 per cent in yen.  The dollar represented 39 per cent, EMS 40 per cent and the rest about 20 per cent.  At that time we compared ourselves with some of the other borrowers in the market.  Denmark had 69 per cent of its foreign borrowing in dollars and only 16 per cent in EMS currencies.  France, a country which is widely held to have a very expert foreign borrowing programme, had 58 per cent of its foreign borrowings in dollars and 21 per cent in EMS currencies.  Belgium, a country with which we could compare ourselves, had 31 per cent of its foreign borrowings in dollars, 41 per cent in EMS currencies and 23 per cent in Swiss francs.  Even on the basis of the argument being made <Col N="1993" /> here this evening and the argument being made at the end of 1983 and throughout 1984, we had a better balance in our foreign borrowing portfolio than most of our neighbours in the Community and indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Belgium is the country most comparable with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we had a higher proportion, I think it is fair to say, of our foreign borrowings in EMS currencies than most of the other EMS member states with substantial foreign borrowing programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>Including Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>By the end of 1984 how had that position changed?  We still have 39 per cent of our foreign debt in dollars, 30 per cent of it in EMS currencies and 10 per cent in sterling.  Other countries had been tending to move away from the dollar but we had a far lower proportion of our foreign currency borrowings in dollars than most of our near neighbours. In the face of that evidence and in the light of other factors which I have pointed out, I cannot see how or why the committee, the chairman or particularly the vice-chairman, can continue with this repeated allegation which is totally without foundation that there was a deliberate decision at a given time to switch into dollars.</P>
      <P>The weakening of the dollar exchange rate this year has resulted in a dramatic fall in the proportion of our debt held in US dollars, from 39 per cent at end-1984 to 32 per cent at end-September 1985. This is the same proportion as applied at end-1982.  The proportionate fall has come about despite the fact that we have arranged some new dollar borrowings this year.  It simply reflects the fact that the fall in the dollar exchange rate has knocked several hundred million pounds off the value of the outstanding debt in Irish pound terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes in exchange rates have of course implications for debt-servicing costs as well as for the proportionate <Col N="1994" /> distribution of our debt.  As regards repayments of principal, losses from appreciation of the borrowed currency would arise only at the time of the capital repayment.  With the rise in the value of the dollar our 1982 dollar borrowings would, at end-1984, have been showing significant but &ldquo;unrealised&rdquo; capital losses of this kind.  These unrealised losses, about which great play has been made on the other side of the House, have been substantially reduced with the recent weakening of the dollar.  Whether or not a profit or loss in Irish pound terms will actually be realised will be determined by exchange rate movements between now and when the debt is paid off.</P>
    <P>As regards the ongoing cost of interest rate payments on the borrowings, it is true that in the past couple of years the higher dollar pushed up the cost of dollar borrowings from what it would otherwise have been.  On the other hand, US interest rates have fallen considerably since 1982 and, because most of our dollar borrowings are at floating rates, we have been getting the benefits of these reductions.  Had they been in fixed rates we would have been getting no benefit from the reductions.  Equally we might have paid no price for the increase. Because most of them are denominated at floating rates, we are now getting the benefit of those reductions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that, with the reduction in interest rates since 1982 and the recent favourable movement of exchange rates, the interest cost of most of the dollar loans raised in 1982 is now less than it would have been at the time the loans were arranged.  In the same way the increased interest cost of floating rate loans raised in Japanese yen, as a result of the appreciation of that currency, has been offset by the fall in Japanese interest rates since 1982.</P>
    <P>All these things indicate that when one ventures into this field one has to be prepared to spend time looking at all the factors that influence the markets and influence one's obligations, not simply picking out particular ones and looking at them in isolation from the rest.  That is precisely what our borrowing operation <Col N="1995" /> does.  It examines all those factors scrupulously, conscientously and very quickly. In the nature of the operation one cannot spend five or six weeks scratching one's head and wondering whether to carry out a particular operation.  We have a system which allows us, having absorbed all the information about the market, to make decisions quickly as market opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the priority which I and my Department have accorded to the management of the foreign and domestic debt.  The improvement in Ireland's credit standing on the international markets since 1982 speaks for itself.  We have this year been borrowing funds &mdash; including Deutschemarks, ECUs and dollars &mdash; at the finest terms ever obtained by Ireland.  We have also, starting in 1984 and at an increasing pace this year, been carrying through an extensive programme of prepaying older loans before their due dates and refinancing them with loans carrying longer maturities and cheaper interest rates: many millions of pounds in debt service is being saved as a result of this programme.  So far in 1985 we have prepaid the equivalent of £1.1 billion pounds in foreign loans.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to one other specific aspect of debt servicing mentioned by the committee, curiously overlooked by Deputy O'Kennedy and the chairman of the committee, that is the suggestion that sinking funds, should be replaced by a system of depreciation of assets.  The committee advance no explanation or analysis of what exactly they had in mind.  However, I can say that the use of sinking funds is kept under review in my Department as part of our wider reviews of Government accounting procedures.</P>
    <P>While, as I have made clear, I share the committee's view about the importance of debt management, I repeat that the particular concerns that motivated the committee's report are unfounded. In the circumstances I do not see any <Col N="1996" /> need to set up new mechanisms for Oireachtas discussion on debt.  Existing mechanisms are adequate for this purpose. The overall amounts of borrowing follow from budgetary and economic decisions which are already the subject of extensive debate in the Oireachtas.  Details of borrowing operations are published in the Finance Accounts and in Central Bank reports.  I have always been willing, in reply to Parliamentary Questions or in correspondence, in <i>The Irish Times</i> or elsewhere, to give Deputies as much additional information as it is feasible to provide, bearing in mind the confidentiality that must necessarily apply to some aspects such as dealings with individual banks and particular loan deals that may be in prospect.  There is ample opportunity for discussion of these matters in the House.  I would make the point that the Finance Bill debate would not seem to be a place for this kind of discussion. I would venture to suggest that the budget debate would probably be a far more appropriate framework within which to have this kind of discussion.  The suggestion has erroneously been made that this is the first opportunity the House has had to discuss these matters.  We have had this discussion on a number of previous occasions, both at Question Time and in the context of this year's and possibly last year's budget debates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not breaking new ground here.  If Deputy O'Kennedy feels there has been a lack of discussion on this matter in the context and in a manner that he would regard as appropriate, it has been because he has not taken the opportunities that already exist within the procedures of the House to raise these matters in a properly structured way.  On any occasion when he wishes to raise it I will be quite happy to debate the matter in the House, as I have shown tonight by a fairly extensive contribution to this debate, against the background of the <Col N="1997" /> fact that I do not believe this is an appropriate matter for the committee to deal with.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support the committee on the work they have been doing to carry out the remit of the Oireachtas.  I hope the committee will apply themselves with energy to that task.  The committee will find in me, particularly on occasions and matters properly within their remit, the most open interlocutor they could have, the most enthusiastic supporter of the lines they follow.  I can assure the committee that I am a firm supporter, even on the odd occasions when perhaps the lines committee members take in this House are not quite the same as the lines they take during committee meetings.</P>

      <P>Though we regret that the Minister does not see the need for a system of reporting or explanation, we made it quite clear in the committee report that we were not purporting to supervise the Minister for Finance or his experts.  Our main suggestion is that the committee should report to the Dáil occasionally throughout the year for the purpose of a debate of this kind.  This is the first time we have had a debate here on this matter.  Of course, we have discussed these matters on Finance Bills and budgets.  We have discussed these matters during Question Time but, until we have revised the procedure, relevant questions do not arise more frequently than once in one and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Next week the Minister and I will lock horns on a different matter.  During Question Time we have only about five minutes at a time in which <Col N="1998" /> to discuss foreign borrowing.  Having regard to the impact our foreign borrowing has on the current budget, I am sure the Minister will agree that one contribution by each Deputy during the budget debate is not sufficient to deal properly with this vital matter.  Neither can we have a satisfactory discussion during the passage of the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise again that in no part of our report did the committee suggest we have the expertise or the capacity to supervise what is being done by the Minister or his experts.  What we want, if possible, is a public explanation and public accountability to the citizen taxpayer through this House.  This evening the Minister went into considerable detail.  He was interesting and informative and he said more than we were able to digest in one go.  It was perhaps one of the most detailed explanations we have had on this one issue in my experience of 20 years here.</P>
      <P>That, in itself, is not a bad thing, but what we in the committee want to achieve is a debate here every three months or every six months when we would report generally to the House on the exact trends in foreign borrowing, why these trends are developing in the way they are and what control we can possibly have over international trends.  That is what we are seeking and I do not think it is too much to ask.  Irrespective of who sits in the Ministerial chair, it is of great importance that we discuss these matters here at least once every six months so that we can test the consistency of Ministerial policy on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall just give a few of my opinions on the servicing of foreign debt.  This is not a matter that falls within the committee's mandate and we never suggested it was.  Though the servicing of our debt is very important, we are talking about an explanation to us of decisions that have been made, without prior sanction, to borrow in particular currencies. <i>The Irish Times</i> has a limited readership &mdash; it is not very big in my constituency &mdash; but the readers seem to be getting instruction and information from the Minister.  It would be no harm if the Oireachtas, and the public through us, got the same type of instruction.  That was our purpose in bringing this report before the House.</P>
      <P>A currency which is appreciating consistently would have a pattern of falling interest rates.  Therefore, we must make a measure judgment on the impact this would have on our capital repayments when they happen to be made.  Falling interest rates would give us relief in the short term.  These are matters which the Minister and his experts must consider.</P>
      <P>We should like to know why judgments in regard to the currencies affecting our foreign borrowing were criticised in the way they have been.  Personally, I think the Minister tends to ignore the fact that there has been a switch &mdash; though not dramatic, a significant switch &mdash; in the total portfolio towards the dollar.  In his speech the Minister picked specific dates and specific currencies, particularly in relation to 1982.  He might as well have mentioned the Federal German Republic, which would not be borrowing too much in EMS currencies.  Belgium is the only country of those which he mentioned that could really be considered to be in a similar position to ourselves.  Unfortunately for them, like us, they have a very high level of foreign borrowing.  The United States dollar component has not increased proportionately to the same extent in their total debt as it has in our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>At a time when the same judgments must have been made by the advisers to the various Treasury Departments, whether in Ireland, Belgium or elsewhere, obviously they made a different judgment.  We simply asked if we could have, perhaps on a regular basis, explanations as to why these judgments are made.  It may well be the advisers presenting them to the Minister, but in the final analysis the Minister of the day should make the fullest possible disclosure to this House.  Let us then be judged on the prudence of those decisions.</P>
      <P>I believe the public are anxious that we will have fairly regular discussions on what has become perhaps the major component of the whole of our expenditure programme &mdash; and we acknowledge that &mdash; the service of the foreign debt.  I would hope that it would not be confined to Question Time, the context of the Budget debate or that of the Finance Bill.  On reflection when the Minister sees what we are at he might consider that every six months, either in this House or in a committee thereof, we would have the opportunity to debate on the basis proposed in this motion.  While I regret that the Minister is not prepared to do so this evening, I appreciate the opportunity our chairman has given me to raise this matter.  We welcome the fact that the Minister has come in to take the debate. As far as I know, he has already created a record, being the first Minister to appear before our committee to subject himself to what might not have been for him a very rigorous cross-examination but what was for us a very stimulating afternoon. Our thanks are due to him.  Perhaps he will realise we have, as we had on that occasion, a common purpose to discharge irrespective of changes of administration and that this House will fulfil its role at all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad to have the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment the question of the implementation of the EC young farmer establishment aid scheme and, hopefully, having it included in the farm improvement scheme which we hope will be announced very shortly.  There seems to be a certain amount of public concern among the farming community &mdash; indeed, I might say anger and dismay &mdash; at recent reports that the Department of Finance are refusing to include provisions for young farmers' establishment aid under the new scheme to replace the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is seldom I have an opportunity of giving the Minister for Agriculture a pat on the back.  On this occasion I should like to commend him for the excellent response he obtained from the Council of Ministers and the European Commission, including that at the recent structures discussion which took place some months ago in Brussels.  Under Article 7 of the European Council Regulations, No. 797/85 of 12 March 1985 &mdash; that is EC support for installation aid in the form of a flat rate premium and an interest rate subsidy the Minister obtained this aid.  I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, will allay my fears and will come out and say constructively that this aid will be included in the package to be announced shortly.  But there are worrying reports that the Department of Finance are opposed to the implementation of Article 7 which would give our young farmers at least some of the financial help their EC counterparts have received.  I should say also that the EC will contribute 50 per cent of the cost so that the Exchequer element would be small, approximately half a million pounds in one year.  I will give shortly a comparison of the costs of <Col N="2002" /> training in agriculture as against those in industrial employment.</P>
    <P>This is a vital measure for young farmers attempting to get established in farming in a very difficult economic environment.  The small amount of public expenditure involved will be recouped many times to the country by those same farmers.  The policy of this Government, as outlined in their document published about 12 months ago, <i>Building on Reality,</i> was that this establishment aid would accelerate the process of early inheritance and the transfer of land to young, trained farmers, thus helping to achieve a central objective of agricultural policy.  In my opinion it will constitute a vote of confidence in young farmers at a time when their options in different farming enterprises are very restricted. The Minister has a golden opportunity, as have the Government, to demonstrate their faith in our young farmers, those who will be the leaders of that industry in the future.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are totally committed to this scheme.  I might reiterate what our leader, Deputy Haughey, had to say at the recent young farmers' conference in Cork.  He gave a commitment that in the event of this Government failing to implement the scheme, or to deliver on their commitment as outlined in the document <i>Building on Reality,</i> this party on returning to Government would introduce this scheme and that, in the event of its being introduced by this Government, that we would ensure its continuance.</P>
    <P>As was outlined in the Government's document <i>Building on Reality</i> this country and the development of agriculture are in the hands of well trained young farmers.  For the benefit of the house I should state specifically what exactly is young farmer establishment aid.  It is a package of aids rendered possible by the latest EC regulation on agricultural structures, a package which will be 50 per cent supported by the EC.  It involves a premium on first installation in the region of approximately £5,000 and would include also an interest subsidy on loans, again in the amount of approximately £5,000.  Therefore, we are talking about <Col N="2003" /> very small amounts of money indeed. The regulation also provides for additional investment aid of up to 25 per cent for young farmers submitting a first farm improvement plan over what would be obtained by other farmers.  This additional investment should not be seen as a replacement of establishment aid.</P>
    <P>One might pose the question: why do we need this young farmer establishment aid?  It is for the benefit of young farmers, under 35 years of age, representing less than 10 per cent of our total farmers.  This is very low compared to other countries who have much more generous aid for young farmers.  In this country approximately 2,000 young people enter farming each year and economic conditions in all farm enterprises make it difficult to get established in farming.  This is why we need the establishment aid which will help to realise a central agricultural objective, the transfer of farms to young trained farmers.</P>
    <P>This aid is a test of the Government's commitment to a youthful land policy.  It would cost very little and would create jobs on the land and extra output for the agricultural industry.  It would cost something in the region of £1 million in 1986, half of which would be recouped from EC sources.  We have the option of implementing this aid and we would look ridiculous if we did not implement it having fought to have it included in the structured aid.  If we do not implement it we would also lose the 50 per cent contribution from the EC.</P>
    <P>It costs much less to establish a person in agriculture than in an industrial job which can cost in excess of £15,000.  The cost of State aid to a university graduate is between £9,000 and £12,000 whereas the cost of training a young farmer to participate in our basic industry would cost about £1,000.  I hope the House understands my argument in requesting the Government and the Minister to implement this scheme.  If the commitment to young farmer aid is now reneged on it will be a serious blow to the confidence of young farmers, who will feel <Col N="2004" /> betrayed by the Government.  Can we afford to strike at the future of agriculture in this way?  It is vital to implement this scheme for the reasons I outlined.  It is time that the Minister for Agriculture and his Department asserted themselves and ran the Department independently of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the very forceful and effective case made by Deputy Michael Noonan for aid for young farmers. It is almost a cliche in farming circles that the one thing which has retarded the development of agriculture has been lack of education in young farmers. Steps have been taken recently to improve that situation and it has been a tradition among agricultural graduates to develop a sense of mission in this regard. Macra na Feirme have done a great deal to provide informal education and inspiration for young farmers.  Our spokesman was president and pressure is coming from the people in that organisation for this young farmer installation subsidy.</P>
      <P>As well as the informal education provided through attendance at agricultural courses by Macra na Feirme, ACOT have also developed a number of courses either of the continuation variety or courses taken in 100 hour packages.  This has stimulated the interest of young people in starting agricultural ventures and this scheme is ideally and admirably suited for that purpose.  As Deputy Noonan said, 50 per cent of the cost would be provided by the EC.  This is an added incentive and I am sure the Minister of State and the Minister will have added muscle in extracting the necessary funds from the Minister and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people who have contacted me about this scheme are serious minded and well equipped to take advantage of the installation money if it is made available to them.  The last person who asked me about this scheme said that he did not care what Government introduced it and that he did not want me to promise for political purposes that Fianna Fáil would bring the scheme into effect if elected to <Col N="2005" /> Government.  He wanted Fianna Fáil to introduce it because it is a worthwhile scheme which would benefit young farmers. I wrote to Deputy Noonan, our spokesman on agriculture, and asked him if he was incorporating it in his agricultural policy for Fianna Fáil in Government. His reply, which I sent to the young man who had approached me, was that Fianna Fáil would implement the scheme when in Government.  I appeal to the Minister of State and through him to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Finance, with whom the buck stops, to make this money available.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always sustained the young people in Macra na Feirme.  They have given them financial aid to develop the various educational ventures on which they have embarked since they were founded in Mooncoin in County Kilkenny many years ago.  I wish to add my few words to those of our spokesman urging the Government to introduce a scheme and to see to it that it is done at once so that money will not be lost from the European fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank both Deputies for their contributions. The new Community structural aid policy is contained in Regulation (EEC) No. 797/85 of 12 March 1985 which was adopted by the Council of Agricultual Ministers earlier this year. The main thrust of the new policy which replaces Directive 72/159 &mdash; implemented here through the farm modernisation scheme &mdash; is to make Community aid for on-farm investment available to a wider band of farmers than was possible under the rather restrictive terms for development farmers under the directive.  The terms of the scheme to be implemented here are at present being finalised and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on it shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the measure on farm investment aid which I have referred to and which is mandatory, the new Community policy also includes a number of optional provisions which it is open to member states to implement or not. <Col N="2006" /> Including among these are the special aids for young farmers.  These aids can be made available to farmers under 40 years of age who meet certain occupational training criteria and who are installed on a farm for the first time.</P>
    <P>The young farmer aids consist of two elements.  First, there is a provision to allow member states to increase by 25 per cent the normal rates of capital grant for young farmers who undertake to follow a farm improvement plan within five years of first installation on the farm. The second element is an installation premium payable to a young farmer whose holding has a minimum work requirement of one man work unit.  This requirement of one full labour unit in order to qualify for the installation premium is quite restrictive but it was insisted upon by other member states.</P>
    <P>There are two parts to the premium, a cash grant of up to 7,500 ECU equivalent to about £5,600, and an interest rate subsidy of an equivalent amount payable on loans taken out to meet the costs of installation. The interest subsidy may be converted into a capital amount at the option of the member state.  Fifty per cent of expenditure on the extra investment aid for young farmers and on the installation premium is eligible for FEOGA reimbursement.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, it is open to each member state to implement these young farmer aids or not to implement them as they choose.  In fact, I understand that only one or two countries so far have indicated that they are operating the installation premium.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the complete package of measures to give effect to the new Regulation 797 is now in the final stages of preparation.  It will be a good package and of greater benefit to farmers than the farm modernisation scheme.  The question of including young farmer aids in the new scheme is obviously also under consideration by the Government.  A decision on that and on the whole package of measures will be taken very soon. The various representations that have been made about young farmer aids &mdash; and particularly the installation premium <Col N="2007" />&mdash; and the consideration advanced during this debate will be taken into account in reaching that decision.  That is all I can say at this stage.  The Government will give the matter their most careful consideration and I expect that details of the <Col N="2008" /> entire package can be announced in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Dáil Adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 November 1985.</P>

      <P>An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is a component of the Reserve Defence Force with conditions of service different from those of the Permanent Defence Force.  Service in An Forsa is normally part time and even when a member is on full time service, he is in a position which is fundamentally different from that of a member of the Permanent Defence Force.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate to seek to apply to FCA personnel provisions similar to those in the Defence Forces pensions schemes which cater for the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

      <P>While a final decision has not yet been taken in the matter, I do not anticipate that it will be possible to extend the duration of FCA annual training for 1986. It would be, of course, my intention to continue arrangements for the payment <Col N="1750" /> of the full amount of the gratuity to members who undergo annual training.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the normal training period in recent years has been necessary as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure.  Naturally, I would be anxious to see the normal situation restored and I regret that the restrictions continue to be necessary.  I am satisfied that an acceptable standard of training is being maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As announced in the series of decisions in its White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better,</i> the Government intend to extend to all commercial State-sponsored bodies the statutory requirement, which already applies to some, whereby the boards of such bodies are required to have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines or Government policy on remuneration and conditions of employment, and to comply with any directives on these which may be issued. In this way, it is intended to standardise and give a statutory underpinning to the responsibilities in these matters which the commercial State-sponsored bodies are expected to discharge in conformity with Government policy.</P>
      <P>The policy in regard to the commercial State-sponsored bodies has not in fact changed over recent years and the proposed legislative measure will be modelled on that first used in section 16 (4) of the Gas Act, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The national plan provided £2,400 million for the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1985.  Following the announcement in the 1985 budget that the Government were prepared to make provision for a 24th pay round settlement based on the arbitrator's finding for certain Civil Service grades and subsequent expenditure adjustments, the figure for pay and pensions in the revised volume of Estimates for the public service was set at £2,464 million.  It is hoped that the outturn will be of this order.</P>
      <P>It will not be possible to indicate the Exchequer provision for 1986, until such time as the Government has completed its examination of departmental expenditure proposals and published the volume of Estimates for the Public Services for 1986.</P>

    <P>(c) Special/grade claims that are committed by the Government under previous pay rounds</P>
    <P>I take it that, in this part of the question, the Deputy is referring to claims which are still in the process of being negotiated and which may be regarded as committed under the national plan.  As publication of any such list might itself prejudice the outcome of the cases involved it would be inappropriate to provide a list at this stage.</P>

      <P>The main terms of employment of the new temporary clerical trainees are set out in paragraph 7.7 of the White Paper, <i>Serving the Country Better.</i> Further details are set out in the formal conditions of service which apply to them.  These conditions are set out hereunder.  Selection of trainees is being conducted by the Civil Service Commission. About 6,000 young people applied for 950 traineeships.  Testing of applicants was completed on 8 November 1985 and the first trainees commenced training on 11 November 1985.  I expect <Col N="1759" /> that all trainees will have commenced training by the end of the year.  I have reserved 50 traineeships for disabled persons. A special competition to select such persons was advertised by the Commission on 30 October 1985.</P>
      <P>Temporary Clerical Trainee in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Conditions of Service.</P>
      <P>1.  An allowance of £60 per week will be paid.</P>
      <P>2.  The training period, which is strictly temporary, will last for a period of one year but may be terminated at any time by either side.</P>
      <P>3.  In the event of misconduct the assignment may be terminated at any time in accordance with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.</P>
      <P>4.  A trainee's headquarters will be such as may be designated from time to time by the head of the Department.</P>
      <P>5.  A trainee will be required to undertake such work as may be assigned from time to time.</P>
      <P>6.  Subject to the usual conditions regarding the granting of annual leave, the leave allowance will be 15 days a year, exclusive of the usual public holidays.</P>
      <P>7.  Hours of attendance are as fixed from time to time.  At present they amount to 41 hours a week.</P>
      <P>8.  Payment of the allowance during illness may be allowed as follows during the 12 months training period:</P>
      <P>after three months training &mdash; full payment up to four weeks.</P>
      <P>The amount of any benefits payable under the Social Welfare Acts is deducted from the payments during illness.</P>
      <P>9.  The assignment is whole time and the trainee may not be connected with any outside business which would interfere with the performance of official work.</P>
      <P>10.  The assignment will not be pensionable, but having regard to performance during the training period, a number of trainees will be afforded an opportunity to compete for permanent and pensionable positions in the Civil Service.  However these arrangements do not imply any entitlement or claim to established status on completion of the training period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regrettable closure of Mostek Ireland arose from the decision in October 1985 by the parent company of the Mostek Corporation &mdash; United Technologies Corporation &mdash; to discontinue the manufacture of semi-conductors and to close permanently all the Mostek plants, including that of Mostek Ireland.  This decision was taken on commercial grounds and arose from</P>
      <P>&mdash;the current recession in the semiconductor market in the US and in particular the severe downturn since the end of 1984 in the prices of commodity memory chips, the product on which Mostek Corporation had been concentrating</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" />&mdash;substantial trading losses incurred by Mostek Corporation.</P>
    <P>Capital and training grants totalling £5.4 million have been paid by the IDA to the company but United Technologies have agreed to meet the outstanding liabilities to the IDA and the authority expects repayment of a substantial proportion of its outlay on the project.  The closure of Mostek, due as it was to market forces, does not imply that a review of industrial policy is now required.  On the contrary, this closure emphasises the need for the more selective approach to industrial development set out in the White Paper on industrial policy.</P>

The figure for 1984 is provisional, pending finalisation of the 1984 blue book.  Details for the year 1985 are not yet available.  A breakdown of these figures, as between the different categories of general liability business, of which public liability and employers liability insurance form the bulk, is not available.  It should be noted that premium levels are influenced by factors such as premium rate increases implemented by insurers due to adverse underwriting experience; changing insured values (for example wage costs, turnover) on which ratings are based; and overall market volumes in each year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that following the closure of the Snia plant, a task force was established in Sligo in October 1983 comprising representatives of IDA, Sligo and Leitrim County Development Teams, AnCO, the National Manpower Service, Sligo Chamber of Commerce and Sligo Council of Trade Unions.  Its specific terms of reference were to make an immediate response to the closure of Snia through intensively promoting the small industries programme among the ex-Snia employees and generally in the Snia catchment area.  The task force met ten times, the last meeting being in September 1984.</P>
      <P>During the period the Task Force was in operation, employment workshops were held in Sligo and Manorhamilton at which over 200 unemployed people were given individual counselling by representatives of the organisations involved.  The IDA and the county development teams in Sligo and Leitrim advised and assisted those who were interested in starting their own businesses.  Moreover there was intensive promotion of the assistance available from the State agencies for manufacturing enterprises.  In the year during which the task force was in operation the IDA approved 25 small industrial projects with a job potential of 180.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman, in his annual report for 1984, adverted to two matters of concern to my Department where he felt that change should be affected. These are referred to in chapter 5 of the report under the headings &ldquo;Valuation of Property&rdquo; and &ldquo;Antiquated Law&rdquo;. Under the heading &ldquo;Valuation of Property&rdquo; the Ombudsman drew attention to the fact that some rating authorities did not go beyond their statutory obligation to publish revised valuations in the local newspaper, so that persons were unaware <Col N="1773" /> that a revision was in progress, whereas others operated a practice of notifying the occupiers of property so affected individually. He also recommended that the dates in regard to the revision of rateable valuation of property should be altered. My Department issued a circular on 1984, to each rating authority requesting them to adopt the practice, under which each occupier whose valuation has been listed for revision will receive an individual notification of the fact together with details of the rights of appeal.  The question of the dates in regard to the revision of valuation of property would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The second matter of concern to my Department referred to under the heading &ldquo;Antiquated Law&rdquo; in the report refers to a situation where a private householder can be liable for the state of repair of that part of a branch water pipe serving his premises which is outside the curtilage of his house even though damage may have been incurred by factors outside of his control such as heavy traffic on a road.  I intend to include provision in forthcoming legislation to confer a new general power on local authorities to assume responsibility for repairs to the relevant portions of such branch water pipes.</P>

I would also draw the attention of the Deputy to the reply of the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy to Parliamentary Question No. 19 of 10 July 1985 in which he indicated that, because of efficient dispersion, the effect on air quality of emissions from the plant will be well below the stringent levels set for ambient concentration by Clare County Council and even below the long-term goals for air quality prepared by the WHO.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive regime has been established in the vicinity of the Moneypoint plant to monitor air pollution.  An additional monitoring station is also being established in the Slieve Bloom mountains under the European programme for the monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in which Ireland has participated for many years.  The establishment of a further such station on the east coast is currently under examination by my Department in conjunction with other Departments and bodies concerned.  I intend that the position will be kept under review by my Department in the light of the monitoring results.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not available in my Department. Under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, Sligo County Council is responsible for all management aspects of waste disposal operations in County Sligo, including Sligo Borough.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided in Febuary of this year to defer the making of a decision on the extinguishment order submitted by Dublin County Council so as to enable the implementation on a trial basis of appropriate traffic management measures in relation to Knockmeenagh Road and Knockanagh Lane (St. Bridgid's Cottages). I understand that Dublin County Council are considering such measures in conjunction with the Garda and when they have been in force for a suitable trial period I will review the matter again.</P>
      <P>I should also explain to the Deputy that there is at present no power in legislation to erect bollards.  However, there is a provision in the Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985, which is at present before the Dáil, which would allow the authority, with my approval, to provide bollards as a traffic management measure. When a right of way is extinguished, it affects all road users (including pedestrians), whereas the use of bollards can restrict the use of a road by certain categories of road users while permitting continued use by others (such as pedestrians or possibly pedal cyclists).</P>

      <P>The two items referred to by the Ombudsman in chapter 5 (&ldquo;Suggested Review of Legislation in Particular Areas&rdquo;) of his 1984 report which relate specifically to the Minister for Finance are in respect of a tax anomaly and valuation of property. Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1985, has removed the tax anomaly referred to by the Ombudsman by which some widows and other single parents had been deprived of the one parent family tax allowance.</P>
      <P>In his report for 1984 the Ombudsman refers to changes made in that year in certain statutory dates affecting the valuation of property which he recommended to my Department following a complaint made to him by a person whose rateable valuation was revised at a time when he was abroad and who did not become aware of the revision in sufficient time to appeal.  The Ombudsman suggested that the statutory date of 1 December for revision of valuation lists was inappropriate given that the statutory appeal period is 28 days from that date and falling within the Christmas holiday period is substantially reduced.  This view was also represented to me by some local authorities and professional bodies involved in valuation.</P>
      <P>Following consideration in consultation with the Commissioner of Valuation the dates for publication, revision and completion of valuation lists were amended by the Local Financial Year (Adaptation) Order, 1984 (S.I. No. 265 of 1984) which, among other things, moved the appeal period to November (i.e. from 1 November to 29 November).</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he agrees that the levying of value-added tax on the fees of consultants employed by voluntary community-based organisations acts as a major disincentive to these community bodies; and if he will have this unjust taxation removed forthwith.</P>

      <P>VAT applies to the fees charged by most consultants, generally at the 23 per cent rate.  It would be neither possible nor desirable in the context of the operation of a general sales tax such as VAT to require that the tax should or should not apply simply on the basis of the status of the person or persons to whom a consultant was providing his services.  VAT applies to the supply of most goods and services, the bulk of which are liable at the 23 per cent rate.  I do not consider that the application of this rate to consultants fees is any more unjust than the application of the same rate to these other goods and services or acts as a major disincentive.  I do not propose therefore to remove VAT from the fees of consultants employed by voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the following table.  In interpreting the information, the Deputy should bear in mind the fact that export sales relief applied on manufacturing profits until 1980, and that companies which benefited from it on that date still retain the benefit until the termination of their span of the relief, subject to an overall termination date of 1990.  Since 1981, we have had a uniform 10 per cent rate of corporation tax on manufacturing <Col N="1793" /> as an incentive to the setting up and expansion of manufacturing companies <Col N="1794" /> (now extended to certain service activities).</P>
      <P Just="Center">Taxes on corporate income as a percentage of total tax revenue.</P>

On 5 November 1985, a tax repayment claim on the grounds of unemployment was submitted to the inspector of taxes.  The claim will be processed as soon as possible. It will also be necessary to review the taxpayer's liabilities for the years 1982-83 to 1984-85, inclusive.  If tax is found to have been overpaid, the appropriate refund will be made.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the point at issue in this case appears to be the reallocation of portion of the husband's tax-free allowances to his wife.  A certificate of tax-free allowances granting the PAYE and PRSI allowances was issued to the wife on 29 October 1985.  As it is unclear from the correspondence received in the tax office as to exactly what balance of allowances is to be allocated to the wife, the inspector of taxes will communicate with the taxpayer as soon as possible to clarify the position.</P>

I assume the Deputy is seeking to know if the proposed international services industrial park in Galway could also be designated on the enactment of that Bill, thus qualifying for relevant tax concessions.  The designation of areas as free ports will be a matter for the Minister for Communications.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Second Stage speech made by the Minister of State at the Department of Communications in the Dáil on 7 November 1985 in connection with that Bill, in which he stated that there are no plans to establish any other free ports for the moment.</P>

    <P>When construction works on the Boyne catchment drainage scheme are completed a small number of skilled and experienced workers may be transferred to the Monaghan/Blackwater catchment drainage scheme.  Approximately 58 others will be retained for maintenance work on the completed Boyne scheme and the remainder will be made redundant. It is expected that all works on the Boyne catchment drainage scheme will be completed in January 1986 and only routine maintenance works will be carried out after that date.</P>

      <P>The choice of optician scheme for eligible adults has been suspended by the Western Health Board due to a shortage of funds.  However, a service continues to be available through the health board's community ophthalmic scheme.  A waiting list is maintained but priority is given to persons with a medical condition of the eye, the elderly and the handicapped. At present there are 2,484 persons on the waiting list for sight tests.  It is not possible to say how many of these will require glasses.  The possibility of resuming the choice of optician scheme will be examined by the Western Health Board in the light of its budget allocation for 1986.</P>

      <P>The annual report of the Ombudsman 1984 suggested that legislation be reviewed in relation to the following matters affecting the Department <Col N="1808" /> of Social Welfare: (i) qualification for old age contributory pension; (ii) the deserted husband; (iii) trade disputes; (iv) entitlements based on the law of domicile; (v) the question of interest on delayed payments under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>The problems regarding old age contributory pension and the deserted husband are being examined by the Commission on Social Welfare and the position will be reviewed in the light of the commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The legal provisions regarding trade disputes are being examined.  Discussions with the trade unions and employers' representative bodies will be necessary and any changes which are agreed will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The law on domicile can affect claims for widows' pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.  As indicated in the Ombudsman report, the Law Reform Commission has put forward recommendations for change in regard to the question of domicile, and the question of implementing the recommendations of that commission is currently being examined by the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Having regard to available staff resources every effort is made to minimise delays in social welfare payments. There is no provision in existing law for the payment of interest in such circumstances, many of which are outside the control of the Department.  In the present state of the public finances the introduction of interest payments is not regarded as a priority item.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions at the appropriate class paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>According to the Department's records the person concerned has only 8 weeks of insurable employment at a class that provides cover against unemployment, during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed entitlement to unemployment benefit on her claim of 12 September 1985.  She had a further 34 contributions paid on her behalf during the contribution period but these were not insurable at a class which provides cover against unemployment.</P>
      <P>She then applied for unemployment assistance and was assessed with means of £15.85 weekly effective from 12 September 1985, derived from the value of board and lodgings on her parents holding. She is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance, which in respect of a full week would amount to £15.90 being the appropriate rate in her case of £31.75 less means of £15.85.</P>

      <P>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned, who was single at the time, applied for unemployment assistance on 15 April 1985.  Following investigation by a social welfare officer, his means derived from self-employment, were assessed at £53.80 weekly, and as this exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable, his claim was disallowed.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the means assessment and arising from contentions made in support of his appeal, the case was returned to the social welfare officer for investigation.  However, on the three occasions that the social welfare officer called to the home of the person concerned, he was not available for interview. He is being afforded another opportunity to co-operate with the social welfare officer and has been advised by his local office to make himself available for interview.  When the necessary inquiries are completed, the appeal will be referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>
      <P>When the person concerned appealed and applied for a review of his means on 2 August 1985, due to an oversight at his local office it was not noted that he had married since he first applied for unemployment assistance and was therefore entitled to payment.  The oversight has now been rectified and his claim to unemployment assistance was authorised at the weekly rate of £9.15, being the appropriate rate in his case of £62.95 less means of £53.80.  A voucher in respect of all arrears due was recently posted to him, and weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The means of the person concerned were assessed with effect from 11 March 1985 at £38.20 weekly derived from the profit from his holding and from the value of capital.  In calculating the means, the deciding officer took into consideration the gross income of the farm at £5,345 per annum less expenses amounting to £3,560 per annum incurred in earning that income.  The net income from the farm was calculated therefore at £1,785 per annum and in addition the value of his capital calculated in accordance with the statutory provisions, amounted to £203.74.  The means of the person concerned were accordingly assessed at £1,988.74 per annum, or £38.20 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means of the person concerned exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him and accordingly his claim was disallowed.

An appeals officer assessed his means with effect from 12 December 1984 at £57 weekly derived from the profit from his holding and all arrears of unemployment assistance due were paid on 9 April 1985. He is currently entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £49.25, being the appropriate rate in his case of <Col N="1815" /> £106.25 less means of £57.  The profit from his holding was calculated on the basis of a gross income of £6.970 per annum less £4,006 per annum by way of expenses incurred in earning that income. Accordingly, he was deemed to enjoy a profit of £2,964 per annum or £57 per week from his holding.  Weekly payments of £49.25 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>To qualify for a free electricity allowance, a person must reside alone or with categories of persons whose residence is excepted for the purposes of the scheme.  Free electricity allowance was terminated in the case of the person concerned as his two daughters who resided with him ceased to come within the <Col N="1819" /> excepted categories for satisfying the living alone condition of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In August, he informed the Department that his daughters were no longer resident at home.  However, at this stage another child had reached eighteen years of age and further inquiries were necessary to confirm the make-up of the household. These inquiries indicate that this child, a son of the claimant, is still residing at home and as he no longer comes within the excepted categories for satisfying the living alone condition of the scheme, free electricity allowance cannot be restored in this case.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a person's husband must have left her on his own volition.  The claim of the person concerned to a deserted wife's payment was disallowed because the deciding officer held that this condition was not satisfied in her case.</P>
      <P>The claimant appealed against the decision and an oral hearing of her case was held on 8 August 1985.  Based on the available evidence, the appeals officer considered that the separation was caused by a mutual breakdown of the marriage and he accordingly upheld the decision of the deciding officer.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence being made available to him since the appeal hearing.  Should the person concerned wish to make any further statement or submit any other evidence she should forward it and it will be referred to the appeals officer for consideration.</P>

      <P>The appeal of the person concerned against the assessment of £46.75 means was recently decided by an appeals officer who reduced the assessment of means against him to £36.35 weekly effective from 24 April 1985.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £35.90 weekly being the appropriate rate in his case of £72.25 less means of £36.35 from 24 April 1985 to 2 July 1985, increased to £40.60 weekly being the appropriate rate of £76.95 less means of £36.35, from 3 July 1985.  All adjusting arrears due to him will be paid this week and weekly payments of £40.60 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay-related benefit is calculated on the basis of reckonable weekly earnings during the relevant tax year and entitlement to this benefit with flat rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of a claimant, since the beginning of the income tax year in which the claim is made.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned could not be determined until inquiries had been made to establish his earnings in the relevant tax year 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 and the 85 per cent limit applicable in his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These inquiries have recently been completed and on the basis of his earnings in the relevant tax year and the 85 per cent limit he is entitled to pay-related benefit at the rate of £21.66 weekly. Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due this week.  Further combined weekly payments at £106.66 being flat rate unemployment benefit, £85, and <Col N="1842" /> pay-related benefit £21.66, will be made as they become due.</P>

Her mother may, however, accompany her as she is over 66 years of age and holds a free travel pass in her own right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit from 21 September 1981.  Payment has been made to 16 November 1985.  A claim form for invalidity pension has been forwarded to her.  However, her husband is also in receipt of an old age contributory pension at the married rate of £84.20.  Regulations provide that an increase in old age contributory pension is not payable in respect of a wife who is receiving invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the person concerned be awarded an invalidity pension payment would be made at the weekly rate of £39.90 per week, that is the rate appropriate to a married woman who is living with her husband.  His old age contributory pension would therefore be reduced to the single rate of £51.40 per week.  Their combined income from the Department of Social Welfare of £118.60 would be <Col N="1843" /> reduced by £27.30.  However, all invalidity pensioners are entitled to a free travel pass.</P>
    <P>The position has been explained to the person concerned and if she wishes to claim the pension she should complete the form and return it to the Department.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 25 November 1984 and as she was a part time worker inquiries had to be made to establish if her employment during the contribution period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983 was insurable at a class providing cover against unemployment.  These inquiries were recently completed and it has been established that she has only 20 contributions paid during this period which provide cover for unemployment benefit.  In addition, she has 17 other contributions paid on her behalf during this contribution period which do not provide cover against unemployment and accordingly her claim to unemployment benefit has been disallowed.  Arrangements are being made to notify the claimant of this decision.</P>

      <P>Payments under the 1984-85 ewe premium scheme and the 1985 sheep headage scheme have already been made while payments under the 1985 cattle and beef cow schemes in the disadvantaged areas and also under the EC suckler cow scheme have commenced and will continue over the next two to three months. As regards the EC calf premium scheme, grants will be paid after 15 December 1985 when all calves born in the period 1 January 1985 to 15 June 1985 have reached the age of six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the uncertainty of the future of the IMP meat processing plant at Leixlip, County Kildare; if he feels it necessary that the plant at Leixlip should continue in operation; if his Department will contact the directors in an effort to ascertain the future of the plant notwithstanding the fact that the factory in question is privately owned: and if he can suggest any changes with regard to operation, including processing and marketing which might have the effect of ensuring the future employment of the workforce at Leixlip.</P>

      <P>The question of reopening the IMP plant at Leixlip is primarily a matter for the proprietors.  State aid would, of course, be available through the IDA for a wide range of improvements at the plant.</P>
      <P>My functions relate to the creation of the condition in which cattle production can expand and the meat factories can prosper and develop.  Every effort has been and will continue to be made to ensure that these conditions are as favourable as possible both for cattle producers and for the beef export industry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the number of tonnes of casein exported in 1984-85 and the cost to the Exchequer; the number of tonnes rejected by the purchaser and the cost to the Exchequer; if the manufacturers of the rejected casein can be identified and the action being taken; and the amount of affected casein in the country at the moment and the cost to the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 25,000 tonnes of casein were exported during the marketing year 1984-85. <Col N="1855" /> There was no cost to the Exchequer and I am not aware that any of the casein was rejected by the purchaser.</P>
      <P>In the current year, however, some difficulty arose in respect of casein produced at one plant.  No cost to the Exchequer resulted from this and appropriate action has been taken to deal with the difficulty.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The only matter within my area of responsibility is the suggestion of the Ombudsman that the rule of law under which a married woman takes the domicile of her husband should be reviewed.  That suggestion was made in the context of deserted wife's allowance and widow's pension in the case where a husband has obtained a recognised foreign divorce and his wife is resident here. The suggestion does not indicate how a change in the law of domicile would be likely to improve the situation of women in these circumstances.  However, proposals for legislation to abolish the domicile <Col N="1865" /> of dependency of married women are at an advanced stage and I hope to introduce that legislation very shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 to 227, inclusive, together.  My Department has received no complaints along the lines suggested in these questions and I find it difficult to see how such complaints could arise.</P>
      <P>As in all such systems some initial errors must arise in the issue of summonses by computer but, so far, the numbers concerned have been well within the level of tolerance normally applied to these systems in the judgment of persons qualified to assess such matters.  But I must emphasise that these are only initial errors and that the system contains a built-in corrective for errors of this kind. When the garda who makes the complaint on which the summons is issued receives a copy of it, he is required under standing instructions to check it carefully and bring any error to notice immediately so that it may be corrected before the date of hearing.  In the circumstances any error that persists to the date of hearing must be the responsibility of the gardaí concerned and I fail to see how gardaí could have a reasonable cause for complaint about the new system.  Indeed, my information is that the Garda authorities are satisfied that the system has resulted in a substantial improvement in effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
      <P>Statistics of cases struck out because of error are not available for periods either before or after computerisation, and they could not be assembled without an inordinate expenditure on staff time and resources.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of additional technical support staff in Athlone RTC as in all other VEC colleges falls to be considered in the context of the Government's policy on the limitation of public service numbers.  In this regard a request by County Westmeath VEC for authority to recruit additional technical support staff is under urgent examination. The creation of an additional post would be required before there could be <Col N="1878" /> any question of a person being appointed as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The statutory redundancy lump sum paid to the employee concerned was the equivalent of nine and a half week's gross wages, which amounted to £812.06.  The amount of that lump sum was calculated by my Department in accordance with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1984, based on the information supplied to the Department in respect of the employee's age, service with the firm and normal weekly pay.</P>
      <P>The amount of lump sum claimed by the employee as calculated by the receiver of the company in which she had been employed was the equivalent of 10 weeks' pay but that calculation was incorrect. The receiver may in his calculation of the employee's reckonable service have omitted to take account of two periods of lay-off from 17 December 1984 to 4 January 1985 and from 25 February 1985 to 26 July 1985.  Such periods are non-reckonable for the purposes of calculating a statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the social employment scheme.  In order to accelerate the processing of work projects under this scheme some project sponsors, particularly local authorities, have entered into negotiations with local branches of trade unions as a result of which agreements have been reached on <Col N="1881" /> matters such as staffing levels, supervision and union membership.  Any such commitments have been entered into freely by the employing bodies.  Since it is intended that the normal employer-employee relationships should prevail under the scheme it is not my intention to interfere in this process.</P>
      <P>To ensure that all projects comply with the conditions of the scheme a monitoring committee comprised of representatives of the Department of Labour, Department of the Environment, AnCO and ICTU oversees the operation of the scheme on a national basis.</P>

      <P>An application under the social employment scheme by Kerry County Council in respect of the project referred to was originally submitted to the local National Manpower Service office at Killarney in April 1985.</P>
      <P>At the request of the county council, the project was deferred, however, indefinitely so that priority could be given to other Kerry County Council sponsored projects which were considered more urgent.</P>
      <P>The Manpower Service confirmed to the county council that it would postpone the processing of the application in favour of the council's subsequent, more urgent applications, and informed the council that should they wish to reactivate the Rathmore-Barraduff-Killarney project at a later date, they should resubmit it to the local NMS office.  To date no request to reactivate the project has been received by the Manpower Service in Killarney.</P>
