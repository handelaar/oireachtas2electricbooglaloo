    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that he promised the House that a debate would take place on the Dooge report before the next European summit. Is it still his intention that that should happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is proposed that there should be a discussion on the Dooge report and other related matters.  It is a matter for the Whips to arrange an appropriate time which would be convenient to both sides during the weeks immediately ahead.  I trust the Whips can get together and arrange for such a discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach or the Minister for Communications let the House know why the <i>Irish Rowan</i> was given away in Hong Kong at £2.5 million as its real worth was £15 million according to the best assessment?  Would the Chair allow the Taoiseach or the Minister for Communications to give the House that information?  This is a very serious matter.  In these days auditors and accountants are supposed to be used for this kind of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister liquidate the company?  Even if he made the decision to liquidate, why did he not bring the ship home so that the robber barons of Hong Kong would not be in a position to force the sale of it at one quarter of its value?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage I indicated that <Col N="1708" /> I would be prepared to increase the representation of the clinical panel from one to two for general nursing and psychiatric nursing but that I could not go beyond that increase from 27 to 29 because to do so would unduly enlarge the board.  The amendments make the necessary provision to increase the overall membership of the board from 27 to 29 and to increase the clinical panel from five to seven.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of points in relation to the section as it will be following acceptance of the amendments and relative to matters raised specifically on Committee Stage.  At that time Deputy Kelly queried a number of issues and asked for elaboration as to the rules for election.  He asked, for example, who would be entitled to vote for the elections. He asked if the rules would specify the minimum experience required for election to the clinical panel.  In general it is intended that nurses from particular disciplines &mdash; for example, general nursing, psychiatric nursing and mental handicap &mdash; will be eligible to vote for the candidates representing those disciplines in the three panels.  Where nurses have multiple qualifications &mdash; for example, where they are qualified for general nursing or midwifery or for general nursing and psychiatric nursing &mdash; they would be given the option as to which discipline they wished to vote for.  The intention is to ensure that a nurse will be able to vote for candidates representing the disciplines in which he or she is practising whether in the teaching, administrative or clinical areas.</P>
      <P>The prescribed qualifications and the minimum period of experience both for eligibility for election and for entitlement to nominate will be specified in the rules. The present board's rules specify prescribed qualifications with a minimum of three calendar months experience for entitlement to nominate and two years experience for eligibility for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon asked me to look on Report Stage at the possibility of providing in the Bill that the Department's nursing adviser would be officially a member of the board.  The Deputy will recall that he related my comments to the embargo <Col N="1709" /> problem.  While I have every intention of appointing the Department's nursing adviser to the first board, I am reluctant to nominate one of the Department's appointees as a nursing adviser in the Bill because there may not always be a nursing adviser in that post at the time of nomination.  A vacancy might occur and the competition might not produce a suitable candidate for some time or there could be considerable delay between a vacancy arising and a person being appointed.  I thought I would deal with all these points at this stage because we are restricted in our interventions on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome these amendments, but they do not go far enough.  The Minister is increasing the number of nurses engaged in clinical practice and general nursing and is increasing the representation of nurses in clinical and psychiatric nursing by one.  We welcome this.  It is important that nurses in clinical practice should be properly represented on the new council.  There are approximately 25,000 nurses who are so engaged representing the largest section of the nursing profession.  I should like the Minister to tell us what category of nurses will be included in the nurses engaged in administration and in training. As it is important to ensure that there is broad representation on the nursing council, these categories should be wide. For example, would a sister in charge of a ward be considered to be involved in teaching or administration?  If the Minister took a liberal interpretation of teaching and administration this would go some way towards having a better representation of all the nurses involved in clinical nursing practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disappointing that the Minister has not acceeded to our request to change the composition of the 12 members of Bord Altranais which he appoints.  I can see no reason why it should not be written into the legislation that one of the two persons appointed from the Department of Health should not be the nursing adviser. The Minister said there could be a vacancy and that these might not be <Col N="1710" /> anyone to fill it.  When the Minister took office there were three nursing advisers in the Department but now, directly as a result of the embargo, two of the posts became vacant and were not filled.  That is why there is only one nursing adviser there at present.  Surely the Minister does not contemplate doing away with the post of nursing adviser altogether.  From what he said today it would appear that we can expect that if a vacancy occurs it may not be filled for a long time.  Therefore there would be no nursing adviser in the Department and consequently there would be a vacancy on the board.  The Minister was responsible for reducing the number from three to one and I would have thought that if a vacancy occurred it would be filled rapidly and that the board would not suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider that. If the role of nursing adviser means anything surely that person should be on the board which will regulate the nursing profession.  She should be in a position to know their views on the various aspects of nursing activity so that in the preparation of legislation, regulations or whatever she would be in a better position to advise the Minister.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon so ably put it in relation to the proposed amendments, we would like to know where these people will be appointed from and what their role will be.  The <Col N="1711" /> Minister is aware that in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire we had a full discussion, lasting for over two hours, with a very large and representative group of the nursing profession.  Loughlinstown, County Dublin, is probably one of the finest hospitals, in medical and staff terms, which we have in the country.  If that meeting is representative of the views of the medical profession nationwide the Minister would be wise to take account of what Deputy O'Hanlon said.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Hanlon, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health, in relation to what he said and I ask the Minister to take serious note of it.</P>
      <P>I am not certain whether the Minister was present but there was a very strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction and disaffection at that meeting in relation to the membership of the board and the type of representation which would be given on the board.  If we are dealing with a Nurses Bill it should be nurse-orientated, and the professionals, in the final analysis, are the people to be consulted and subsequently appointed.  If there are to be additions to the board, nurses should be appointed and that is the thrust of the contribution by the Opposition spokesman for Health.  That is a good point in the sense that he is supporting a profession which the nation has not taken into account over the years.  I put the nursing profession on a par with the medical profession and that is paying both of them a compliment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy O'Hanlon and ask the Minister to take account of the fact that there is a very strong feeling in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and south County Dublin generally regarding the views expressed by Deputy O'Hanlon. I am not attempting to intimidate the Minister by saying that and anyway I do not think he would be intimidated.  If the Minister has a point of view in relation to any area he should stick by it, taking account of the views expressed by various groups, in this instance, the nursing organisation in his own constituency.  If he does not agree with them, so be it.  We <Col N="1712" /> appreciate the Minister's integrity and I am not attempting to move him in a direction in which he does not want to be moved.  I also wish to pay the Minister this tribute, that when he makes up his mind to do something he does it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the amendments on the basis that they consititute an improvement in the representation on the board.  Having regard to the tremendous implications in the Bill and the importance of having a confident, contented nursing profession, an improvement in the representation on the board is obviously worth while.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Andrews in relation to this matter but I should also like to refer briefly to the queries raised by Deputy O'Hanlon in relation to the particular categories of nurses which might be represented. Would it be at senior or junior level? Would there be representatives at matron or junior training level?  This is important because the constitution of the board will affect their attitudes and it is important that the nurses represented have confidence in the people appointed to represent their views in so far as they can.  I fully appreciate the Minister's right to ensure that all aspects of the services, especially health services, are updated and streamlined to meet modern requirements to provide an efficient and effective health serivce.  It is, nonetheless, equally important to have the confidence and support of the people involved in providing the service as, without that, it could be extremely difficult to implement it.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that the nursing profession are adequately represented at all levels in the service, thereby giving a fair representation.</P>

      <P>I also welcome these amendments.  On Committee Stage there was quite a long discussion on the representation of nurses and I had a number of amendments down in this area.  While this amendment does not <Col N="1713" /> fully meet the provisions of my amendment, it goes some way towards them because my main argument is that the vast majority of nurses are in the general nursing and psychiatric areas and the representation given to them in the original Bill was not in accordance with their numbers.  Much higher representation was given to nurses engaged in training, administration and so on.  In regard to the general body of nursing, there will be one extra from the general nursing and clinical practice and one extra from those engaged in the practise of psychiatric nursing.  Those two areas absorb perhaps 90 per cent of nurses and, while they are not represented in accordance with their great weight of numbers, they certainly have a stronger representation.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure Deputy O'Hanlon that I am not excluding ward sisters from eligibility for the administrative or teaching panels of the board.  Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Andrews and Loughlinstown Hospital, one of the biggest problems in the Bill has been the quite exceptional difficulty I have had in explaining to the nursing profession what has happened since 1950 and what is needed now in terms of a body which is not a negotiating body.  It is not composed of 50 per cent from the employer side and 50 per cent from the workers' side.  It is not a joint industrial council.  Many nurses at the trade union end of the INO or the psychiatric nursing organisations hold that view but this body are essentially dealing with the question of training and fitness to practise, registration of nurses and the general provision for education of nurses and persons engaged in those differing professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This body will consist of 29 people, a very large board.  There will be five nurses on the board engaged in training nurses &mdash; one from general nursing, one from paediatrics, one from the psychiatric side, one from the mentally handicapped side and one from midwifery.  These are speciality areas and we have to have one from each.  Then there are five nurses engaged in nursing administration &mdash; one <Col N="1714" /> general nursing administrator, one from the administration of public health nursing, one from the administration of psychiatric nursing, one from the midwifery side and one from the mentally handicapped side.  As amended, now there will be seven on the clinical side &mdash; one from each of the following specialities: general, psychiatric, midwifery, public health and mental handicap.  There has to be a balance because all hell would have broken out if the various specialities did not have representation.  I know general nurses ask why they do not have greater representation but the purpose is to develop the profession, not simply to have a <i>pro rata</i> representation in accordance with the number of general nurses in the overall profession.</P>
    <P>I can see the point which has actively stirred the minds of a large number of nurses and I can see why so many ask why they should be told what to do in their professional practice by nurse administrators or by the three doctors on the board of 29.  One doctor will be a specialist on the psychiatric side, one on the obstetric side and one on the general side.  In this country, unfortunately &mdash; and I want to repeat this &mdash; we have a fragmentation of professional isolation. Politicians themselves are an example of this.  Everybody wants to be closetted exclusively in his own professional role and is very reluctant to have an interaction with other professional structures.</P>
    <P>With the 17 directly elected nurses and three doctors there will be representatives from the following specialists: one from the management of health boards, one from the management of hospitals, other than hospitals administered by the health boards, obviously a person from the voluntary hospital, two representative of the Department of Health, one person from the nursing side and one experienced in the field of education, two representing the interrests of the general public, one representing third level educational establishments, and one additional nurse.  I think the profession is very effectively represented in a balanced way in section 9 and accordingly I recommend the amendments to the House. <Col N="1715" /> Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Every person who is a national of a Member State and has been awarded a qualification in nursing in a Member State which, pursuant to the provisions of any Directive adopted by the Council of the European Communities, the State is obliged to recognise, shall, on making an application in the form and manner specified in rules made by the Board, and on payment of such fee as may be so specified, be registered in the register.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments provide for the deletion of section 29 and the inclusion in section 28 of qualified EC nationals. <Col N="1716" /> The amendments arise out of the Committee Stage debate on those two sections which led to questions being asked about two issues: first, whether the persons mentioned in section 28 (3) will be automatically registered and, secondly, if the saver provision in section 28 (4) is intended to cover EC nationals at present referred to in section 29.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I would consult with the parliamentary draftsman before Report Stage.  I have now done so and have been advised that it would be preferable to delete section 29 which is not, as at present drafted, included in the provisions of section 28 (4) and recast section 28 to include EC nationals among the other categories of persons eligible for registration comprehended in that section. This would also mean that all persons eligible for registration would be subject to the provision in subsection (4). The effect of the amendment is to tighten up the functions of the board in relation to registration and to bring the provision into line with the analogous provisions in the Medical Practitioners Act and in the Dentists Bill.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment because its effect will be to ensure that everybody who registers will have to fulfil the same conditions.  In the original Bill a nurse who is a national of a member state of the European Community could conceivably be registered without having fulfilled the same conditions as other nurses.  But why did the Minister change the wording from &ldquo;Every nurse who is a national of a member state and has been awarded a qualification in nursing in a member state...&rdquo; to &ldquo;Every person who is a national of a member state and has been awarded a qualification in nursing...&rdquo;.

      <P>The Minister mentioned a drafting point in the proposed amendment.  My colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, said this is lifting the first part of section 29 to become section 28 (4).  As I said, this is a drafting point and I do not wish the Minister to think that I am being pernickety about this, but sometimes the intended meaning is lost in the drafting.  That is why I offer my piece of wisdom, or unwisdom as the case may be, in relation to this drafting point. &ldquo;Every person who is a national of a member state and has been awarded a qualification in nursing in a member state which, pursuant to the provisions of any Directive adopted by the Council of the European Communities, the State is obliged to recognise...&rdquo; I think the words &ldquo;the State is obliged to recognise&rdquo; are wrongly placed in this sentence.  This is awkward drafting.  I would juxtapose the phrase &ldquo;that the State is obliged to recognise every person whom the State is obliged to recognise&rdquo; and &ldquo;who is a national of a member state&rdquo; and so on.  I appreciate that the parliamentary draftsmen or women have to do their job and have to produce the meaning which the Minister intends to give to a particular section of a Bill.  I offer my views in the sense of helpfulness rather than obscurantism or obstruction.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to comment on the suggestion of the proposed curing, as I would see it, of what appears to be a defect in the continuity of the sentence.</P>

    <P>Could I ask the Ceann Comhairle for a ruling on a point of order in regard to Report Stage?

      <P>On Committee Stage, at various points in the debate the Minister said that he would have a look at that matter on Report Stage.  I marked a number of instances where he mollified the Opposition by saying this.  Section 12 was one of these, where he said that it would be examined on Report Stage to suggest a date or time at which the first meeting of the board would be held.  He has not commented.  Would he comment on why he felt it was necessary to do that?</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment to section 28 to include the former section 29, I would refer to another point raised on Committee Stage on that section 28.  The Minister has conceded and included this section, but subsection (4) of the old Bill which under the amendment would be after that amendment, says that &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall operate to prevent the Board from refusing to register the name of any person,&rdquo;&mdash; that would include any person referred to in this amendment &mdash;&ldquo;who is otherwise entitled to be registered, on the grounds of the unfitness of that person to engage in the practice of nursing.&rdquo;  I recall well and took a note that on Committee Stage it was suggested that the Fitness to Practise Committee should be consulted by the board before such a decision was made.</P>

Amendment 5 deals with the registration here of nurses qualified in other member states whose qualifications are acceptable here.  Amendment 6 deletes amendment 29.

      <P>Right.  Under section 26 before, it did not apply to persons who are nationals of a member state and have been awarded a qualification in nursing in that member state pursuant to provisions of any Directive adopted by the Council of European Community. By accepting this amendment on Report Stage, those people, despite the fact that they have a qualification in nursing in a member state, will now be covered by a clause in subsection (4) of section 28 which says that nothing in this section will prevent the board from refusing to register any of these people who have a qualification in nursing in a member state of the EC on the grounds of unfitness to engage in the practice of nursing.  The board can still refuse to register them on the grounds of unfitness to engage in the practice of nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am suggesting that the board should not be entitled to refuse to register the names without referring to the Fitness to Practise Committee.  This matter was raised on Committee Stage in connection with people in the nursing profession at home and was not accepted by the Minister. I am asking if he would accept that <Col N="1720" /> people who have full qualifications for nursing in member states could not be refused registration on the grounds of unfitness to practise without the board first having consulted the Fitness to Practise Committee.  I do not see the purpose in having such a committee if the board can make decisions without consulting them on the particular issue of fitness to practise.  We made this point on Committee Stage in relation to nurses generally on the register.  I still feel that should be done with regard to such nurses.  However, I am prevented from making that point now.  I can only make the point in connection with the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to be associated with the words of welcome for the change in this case.  It is important not just that there should be common registration for every person, whether trained in the State or outside it or whether they are nationals or non-nationals, but it is also important that it should be seen to be done.  Will the Minister confirm that the only reason the word &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; in section 29 has been changed to &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the new subsection is to bring it into line with the other subsections in section 28 which used the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the change from the word &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; to &ldquo;person&rdquo;, I can assure Deputies that it is the view of the parliamentary draftsman that it would be a much more effective statement of statutory intent for the simple reason that a person who is a national of a member state is not a nurse until that person holds a qualification in nursing of the member state and then <Col N="1721" /> becomes a nurse.  The reason for the change was to make the wording more precise.  As Deputies know, the parliamentary draftsman jealously guards his right with regard not only to the composition of the section but also as far as wording is concerned.  The change is purely for the purpose of clarification.  The rest of the section differs slightly from earlier similar provisions in medical and dental legislation because different draftsmen were involved.  However, the meaning is exactly the same.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Mac Giolla, I know the amendment may give rise to comment on the need for protection for nurses or persons seeking initial registration against an adverse decision of the board under subsection (4).  As Deputies will recall, there was considerable debate on Committee Stage about the advisability of the board notifying a person of their intention to make a decision under subsection (4) in order to give the applicant an opportunity to appeal to the board before the decision was made.  The provision in the section is for the person to appeal to the High Court after the decision is made and notified to him.  Deputy Mac Giolla in particular was anxious that the person concerned would have the same rights and protection as that afforded in the part of the Bill dealing with the fitness to practise committee with regard to the registration of nurses.</P>
      <P>I agreed it was most desirable that the person be informed in advance of the intention of the board not to register him or her and I undertook to direct the board to incorporate procedures in their rules for registration to this effect.  I want to convey that assurance to Deputies once again.  I would be reluctant to build in all procedures into the Bill itself but they can be incorporated in the rules, especially in relation to persons applying for initial registration.  It could happen that a person who was clearly unqualified would apply, in which case the board would be within their right to refuse registration. Deputy Kelly raised that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat to Deputies my assurance that I will insist on the board setting down <Col N="1722" /> procedures for informing qualified nurses of their proposed decision not to register. Perhaps I can write to Deputies with regard to the points raised by them.  I have some difficulty in relation to the Bill because many points were raised on Committee Stage and I undertook to comment on them on Report Stage. However, under the rules of the House the debate is rather restrictive in that regard and I may have to write to Deputies on the points they raised.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has said, he has gone part of the way towards meeting the opposition to the section from this side of the House.  Section 31 is probably the most important section in the Bill because under that section a decision will be made on who is entitled to have their name entered in a register of nurses.  This section gives the board the power to register the names of persons in a profession or calling which is ancillary to nursing.  We welcome the fact that the Minister has removed from the section <Col N="1723" /> the power he was given to whatever Minister would be in office to request the board to register; but I do not understand why the Minister has not removed the other part of the section that we wanted removed, namely, that his consent is still necessary.  We asked the Minister to remove the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  The Minister has told us the discretion is now entirely with the board but that is not absolutely correct because they still need his consent.  I do not see why that should be necessary. The end of this section reads:</P>
      <P>and the provisions of this Act, subject to such modifications as may be specified in rules made by the Board, with the approval of the Minister, shall apply to any such registration.</P>
      <P>That gives the Minister a certain amount of power &mdash; to which we are not objecting &mdash; in the rules that would be approved by him.  I do not see that it is necessary for the Minister to give his consent to the board in regard to whom they might wish to register.  We have already spent a long time debating the composition of the board and the Minister did amend the section to ensure that the board would be more representative.  I believe we should show confidence in An Bord Altranais, leaving them discretion to decide whose name should be registered in a register of nurses.  We believe that only those who are qualified nurses should be registered in a register of nurses.  The Minister should delete the other part of that section we opposed at the time, namely, that his consent is necessary before the board register any person or category of persons in the nursing register.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment, which appears to delete what is probably the most offensive phrase in the Bill as far as nurses are concerned.  It is reasonable that the Minister would want to retain power at least to look at what the board might be doing in that matter and give his consent, <Col N="1724" /> but they would be initiating the proposals. What appeared in the original drafting was that the Minister could order the board to register whomsoever he wishes. That has been deleted and improves the section enormously.</P>
      <P>In regard to the procedures on Report Stage, I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would not have stopped the Minister had he made a comment on the various sections on which he said he would comment or re-examine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was considerable debate on a number of matters. For example, it is very unfortunate that the Minister could not comment on why, a few lines above that, he has not changed &ldquo;whenever&rdquo; to &ldquo;before&rdquo; which would have been a very important alteration and which would mean that people would know beforehand whether they were being struck off the register.  It is unfortunate that promises were given on Committee Stage and we have gone over quite a number of sections where such promises were given by the Minister.  What is the point of the Minister saying on Committee Stage that he will look at it again, requesting his draftsmen to re-examine it, if he does not then come back and comment on Report Stage?  In the future I hope some method can be devised whereby, when the Minister says so, he will be enabled to adhere to his promise.</P>

But when one debates an amendment on Committee Stage over a long period and the Minister finally says &ldquo;I <Col N="1725" /> will have a look at that again on Report Stage&rdquo; one does not put down another amendment, one assumes that the Minister will do this.  Now it is obvious that, in order to do so, one must put down the same amendment on Report Stage.  I have learned that much.

      <P>This was a very controversial section in the original Bill, as drafted, giving rise to much comment and anxiety on the part of Members who contributed on Second and Committee Stages.  The amendment now proposed by the Minister overcomes the difficulty. The main problem, as I saw it, was that the Minister could request registration. These people were referred to as second class nurses, a sentiment with which I did not agree.  The Minister's proposed amendment overcomes that problem. The Minister is correct in retaining a certain power to have a look at the register if the board decide to register people who are ancillary to nursing.  That amendment should be acceptable to all concerned because it eliminates a power that could be abused by any Minister.  This amendment means that the Minister reserves the right to have a look at it.  The Minister should be entitled to retain that power.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the amendment proposed by the Minister on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect that a Minister will have some control or that there be some provision for the granting or withholding of his approval.  His consent is acceptable.  I fully agree with the deletion of the words &ldquo;or shall, whenever the Minister so requests,&rdquo;.  Were this phrase to remain it could lead to a certain amount of abuse or leave the way open to allegations of abuse.  The Minister's amendment leaves sufficient room for control to be exercised by him and his Department, at the same time eliminating an area which might have led to suggestions of abuse of that control.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with Deputy Mac Giolla's points.  I can assure him that I have delivered on any assurances in terms of actual amendments I promised on Committee Stage.  I have put down no less than 13 amendments for Report Stage.  There has been no reluctance on my part to elaborate repeatedly on various sections.</P>
      <P>In regard to the viewpoint of Deputy O'Hanlon that ministerial consent should be removed from the first and second lines of this section, I might make the point that the consent of the Minister of the day is also necessary to the establishment of the named register in so far as the Minister must approve the rules of registration.  It would be unwise of the House to suggest that that should be deleted from this or other sections.  In very large measure An Bord Altranais is a self-regulated body.  Unless the Minister of the day was a most pernickety or bureaucratic individual, or his officers deteriorated alarmingly in the interim, it is unlikely that there would be enormous circumspection exercised by the Minister over the rules.  By and large, the consent of the Minister will be readily given on the vast majority of occasions.</P>
      <P>That is why I am very anxious to get ahead with setting up the new Bord Altranais as quickly as possible.  Therefore, I commend the section as now amendment to the House.  I consider it a reasonable amendment.  Section 31 is a forward looking amendment taking into account eventualities which may never happen but if they happened would at least provide a framework for dealing with them under the Bill.</P>

The effect of these amendments is, accordingly, to remove the word &ldquo;body&rdquo; from sections 35 (3) and 37 (1) (a) and (c).  The parliamentary draftsman considers that &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; adequately covers training areas other than hospitals.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 26, after &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but in the selection of candidates for nurse training, no candidates shall be selected without the approval of the Training Schools&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an amendment to section 36 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>The Board may, if it so determines, establish a central applications bureau to process applications from persons wishing to undertake training as a nurse.</P>
      <P>My amendment would add after nurse:</P>
      <P>, but in the selection of candidates for nurse training, no candidates shall be selected without the approval of the Training Schools&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would welcome the setting up of a central applications bureau to receive applications and to process them to ensure that the applicants qualify under subsection (1) of section 36 which gives the board the power to determine the minimum educational requirements necessary for entry to training as nurses. We believe it is only right that there <Col N="1728" /> should be some central method of receiving applications.  The present method is most unsatisfactory, where the boy or girl who wants to train as a nurse writes to one of the training schools and usually receives a reply in the negative, that there are not any places or the training school are not taking in trainees in that particular year.  We feel it is only right that applicants should apply to one central bureau for the purpose of having their applications processed.</P>
    <P>This side of the House are very concerned that there would be a situation like there is in the universities where the central applications office decide the particular university the students will go to based on the number of points.  People with a certain number of points go to one university and those with a lower number of points go to a different university.  On Second Stage the Minister drew an analogy with the universities.  The important thing about training of nurses is that it is an employer-employee relationship.  The student nurse is an employee of the hospital and the hospital must have rights as an employer and must have those rights protected.  It is also important in a hospital that the hospital should have the right to protect the character and ethos of that particular hospital.  This was written into legislation in the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, which stated that &ldquo;the Council shall take no action which would operate to interfere with the autonomy of a nursing school attached to any participating hospital of a particular denominational character&rdquo;. That was the sentiment expressed by this House in 1961.  I have no doubt that it is still the view of the majority of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>In this particular subsection we are moving away from that and we are giving the power to the nursing board to select students and to send them to any hospital they like without any reference to the character and ethos of the particular hospital and without giving any rights to the hospital as a training school attached to the hospital, which would be an employing authority, because it is an employer-employee relationship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> When we were discussing section 36 on Committee Stage the Minister said the central applications bureau must be something more if it is to have any meaning in the training of nurses, that it must mean something more than just collecting applications and processing them in relation to educational standards.  When we were discussing section 52 and he was pressed by Deputy Tunney and Deputy Glenn, who were concerned about the effect of that particular section on the ethics of the hospital, the central applications bureau was debated again, and the Minister then said that he could assure the Deputies that section 52 &ldquo;does not interfere with the freedom of health agencies &mdash; and voluntary hospitals are part of those agencies &mdash; to insist that their code of ethics shall predominate in respect of employment in their hospital. That is already there in terms of the common contract for consultants&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an assurance to Deputy Alice Glenn and Deputy Tunney that the <i>status quo</i> would be maintained at voluntary hospitals in respect of their right to select nurses or students whom they regarded as suitable to their particular requirements.  I understand he also promised that he would confirm that assurance by letter.  Deputy Tunney informs me that he has not received such a letter to date.  He apologises for the fact that he cannot he here this morning to bring the matter up.  There is nothing in section 36 which gives any rights to the training school or the hospital as an employing authority.  If the Minister is serious that the Bill will not interfere in any way with the rights of training schools to have the final selection of their own students I believe it is only right that he should accept this amendment.  The amendment seeks to insert in the Bill a view expressed by the Minister in reply to Deputy Tunney on 6 March when we were debating Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to confer total control on the training schools.  The Bill proposes the setting up of a board to examine applicants but the amendment seeks to give a right of veto <Col N="1730" /> to the hospitals or training schools.  I do not think we should accept such a suggestion. I would be apprehensive about it and I am anxious to hear the Minister's views on it.  With regard to the training of nurses I must point out that the method of selection and qualifications required leave a lot to be desired.  Health board hospitals have a different method of selection from hospitals outside that system.  I would like to see a standardisation of the qualifications required, whether they are based on the leaving certificate or not.  We should decide if certain leaving certificate subjects are essential and if there is a need for additional qualifications in regard to subjects like mathematics and biology.  If applicants do not pass those subjects in the leaving certificate they are almost totally excluded from consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people apply for the few places in the training schools and more and more people are becoming disillusioned with the method of selection.  For that reason I agree with the suggestion that we should have a type of central selection board.  If we adopt Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment we will be brought back to the position that obtains now.  While people may be accepted by the central bureau they may not be accepted by a hospital. I do not see any justification for some private hospitals objecting.  I know they want to retain control in the selection of trainee nurses.  Matrons, and boards, of some of these hospitals have had that important power for a long time.  There has been equilisation in many other areas of selection to public service positions and I do not see any reason why we should not have equalisation in regard to selection of trainee nurses.  While I am seriously concerned that we have a standardisation of the qualifications required, I believe that once a person is qualified and suitable for a position that person's selection should not be based solely on a points system.  Other aspects must be taken into consideration when choosing an applicant for the nursing profession. Some people who had little more <Col N="1731" /> than the intermediate certificate in the past made excellent nurses.</P>
    <P>The schools and the students should be made aware of the qualifications required so that those who apply are not disillusioned when they discover subsequent to the leaving certificate examination that they do not qualify for certain hospitals. When hospitals and health boards operate different methods of selection, confusion follows and that has been the position for many years.  If a central selection board resolves that I would be in favour of it.</P>

      <P>Many of the points made by Deputy Dowling have been agreed by both sides.  Section 36 (1) clearly standardised the educational, or otherwise, qualifications needed from now on.  We will not have training schools insisting on their own set of qualifications and we all welcome that.  We have all experienced the same problems mentioned by Deputy Dowling in regard to training schools.  I support Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment because I am aware of a number of things that have happened in regard to the central applications system that operates for entry to university.</P>
      <P>The only training school I have had any experience of is that run by the health board in my area and I am aware that it has been outside of political interference as far as the training school is concerned. I am sure all Members will agree that interference, political or otherwise, is not successful in the section of candidates for nursing and that is welcome and essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have always been conscious of the need to have a full geographical spread of nurses to give all candidates a fair chance and in some health board areas it has to be realised that a substantial number of patients are fluent in the Irish language.  It is important that their needs are catered for.  For many years patients who wanted to communicate through the Irish language in hospital could not be catered for.  One such case was well publicised some years ago.  That did not arise through any fault <Col N="1732" /> of the hospital authorities but training schools did not take that into account when selecting trainees.  I am concerned that that area is taken into consideration by the central applications bureau.  It is important that the geographical spread and language requirements needed in different parts of the country are taken into consideration by the central applications bureau.</P>
    <P>We are all happy with the way the training schools run by the health boards operate and it would be a tragedy to take their independence from them.  I welcome the fact that from now on the board will determine the qualifications necessary.</P>

      <P>The proposals to establish a central applications bureau is laudable but it appears to run counter to Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment.  If we accept the amendment the training schools will have a right of veto.  In that event why is there a necessity to set up a central applications bureau?  A central applications bureau is the best way for administering the system and screening applicants.  If we accept the amendment we will be maintaining the status quo and a training school can apply their own criteria and ensure that their line of thought prevails.  It is a contradiction of what is proposed in the earlier sections of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The House would be unwise to accept Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment.  Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn made a point in relation to some hospitals requiring as a pre-condition that a student nurse be proficient in Irish. Under this system to be inaugurated by An Bord Altranais those hospitals would have an opportunity to enforce that regulation. Both An Bord Altranias and the central applications bureau would be composed for the most part of representatives of the training schools and there would be an opportunity to refuse to take in a person who did not speak Irish on the grounds of unsuitability for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to take this issue head on and at the same time take in a democratic and <Col N="1733" /> reasonable framework.  There should not be privilege in selection for student training posts either in a private hospital, a public voluntary hospital or health board hospital.  It is time that in relation to an area of employment, which is a huge area of employment, we did away with privileges.  There are 26,000 nurses employed here and there should be absolute equality of opportunity for training posts in that area of public employment. It is public employment to the extent that the private hospitals for the most part are paid out of VHI moneys so there is public money going into them: the voluntary hospitals get 98 per cent of their budgets from the taxpayer and the health board system is wholly funded by the State.  The amendment should not be accepted.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Hanlon tabled a similar amendment which read:</P>
    <P>but the Training Schools shall select their own candidates for nurse training.</P>
    <P>That was defeated here by 70 votes to 61. I do not accept that the CAB should be a sorting office with a vague reference system but at the same time we envisage that of the 20 members of the CAB about 150 will come from training schools.  They would be appointed on the nomination of the nurse training schools and they would represent the teaching element, the administrative element and the service element in the nurse training schools.</P>
    <P>The provision in this Bill is an enabling provision.  I have not set out a CAB structure. This is a very big Bill which would be unending if we put everything into it. It will be for the board to specify the functions and the limitations of a central applications system.  The board will be guided by the recommendations of the working party on general nursing who were very emphatic about the need for a central applications bureau, and they will take into account the views of the training schools on the operation of the bureau. It would be a tragedy if the concept were to fail because of unwillingness on the part of some training schools to overcome their reluctance to modify the selection procedures.  There will be modifications <Col N="1734" /> and it will come in a beneficial way because for the first time An Bord Altranais will have the power to set down minimum standards of education for nurse training.</P>
    <P>One advantage of a CAB is that there will be a known standard to be attained for entry into nurse training and individual hospitals will not be allowed under that system to impose their own special qualifications.  This will be much fairer to students.  At the same time it will not be draconian because a student may well get an option of three or four hospitals and the hospital will still have the opportunity to say she is not suitable, but they will not have the opportunity to select candidates from a closed circle.  There is a great need to open up the prospect of equality of employment and training opportunity. The House will be doing a good day's work in devolving that responsibility on An Bord Altranais.  I am surprised at the reluctance of some people to devolve that responsibility on the nursing profession. The overwhelming majority of those on An Bord Altranais are members of the nursing profession and it will be self-regulatory in that sense.  Accordingly, I commend the non-acceptance of the amendment at this stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the point raised by Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Alice Glenn asked me for an assurance that this procedure would not impinge on the general ethos of a particular hospital.  That is the fear. It is an unnecessary fear but it is there.  I wrote to Deputy Glenn assuring her that this interpretation could not be read into the section and that there is still ample opportunity for the employing authority to protect the general ethos of their own institution, the ethos of the employer. The applications go forward and a decision is taken on employment.  There is a legitimate restriction in it.  I will send Deputy Tunney a copy of that letter by way of explanation.  I will also be writing to a number of Deputies outlining the interpretation of a number of different sections.  I hope to do that in the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal <Col N="1735" /> briefly with some of the points raised. Deputy Dowling agreed that there should be standardisation of qualifications.  We all agree with that.  Section 36 (1) makes it very clear that:</P>
      <P>The Board may determine the minimum educational requirements necessary for entry for training as a nurse into a hospital or institution approved by the Board pursuant to section 35 of this Act.</P>
      <P>We support that fully.  Neither on Committee Stage nor on this Stage did we put down amendments or say anything which would lead anyone to believe we did not agree with that.  We supported that fully all along the line.  It appears from the debate here this morning that some people feel we are opposed to that section. We are not.  My colleague Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn dealt with that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling raised the question of the small number of private hospitals involved.  I would not see this amendment as being specific to any group of hospitals. We have large health board hospitals. We have large public voluntary hospitals. We have a small number of private hospitals. They employ stundent nurses.  We wish to protect all of them.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn made the point, with which I agree, that the health boards have been very meticulous about the manner in which they selected their trainee nurses.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say he was not certain about some health board hospitals.  I am not aware that there is any irregularity in the method of selecting nurses for the health board hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Durkan said that if the House accepted my amendment we would be giving the training schools the right of veto.  That is exactly the purpose of my amendment.  Nurses should not be imposed on a particular training school.  I do not believe that if there are 500 vacancies this year, the central applications bureau should send 50 candidates to the Mater, 50 to Galway, 25 to the Adelaide and 25 to the Regional in Cork.  I do not think that would be correct in the interests <Col N="1736" /> of the patients.  The central applications bureau do not have to decide on each individual applicant and select each individual applicant.  There is no reason why the central applications bureau should not receive applications from those wishing to become trainee nurses, assess the applications in terms of educational qualifications, and let the training schools and the health boards select their students as they do at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us there was no agreed structure as to how the central applications bureau should work.  He said the selection committee would be representative of the training hospitals.  He mentioned 20 members of the central applications bureau.  I wonder did he get that figure off the top of his head or has he some preconceived idea that there will be 20 members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That was envisaged by the outgoing board.  That is the general intention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it appears there is some form of structure at the gestation stage at least, and that there is an intention to have 20 members of the central applications bureau.  The Minister said public money was funding the voluntary hospitals.  We accept that.  In terms of selecting their own staff they have certain rights in relation to the common contract and the selection of medical staff, that is, the voluntary hospitals.  What we are proposing here will not give them those rights in terms of selecting nurses.  It is not correct to say in relation to the funding of the small private hospitals that the money paid out by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is public money.  The public subvention to the VHI has been removed, and they are now funded totally by the members of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point, also made by Deputy Dowling, about standardisation of qualifications.  We are not opposed to that.  We fully support An Bord Altranais laying down the guidelines, particularly in relation to education, as to who may be trained as a nurse. I agree fully with the Minister that there <Col N="1737" /> should not be privilege in determining who should be trainee nurses.  Everybody in the House will accept that nurses should not be trained on the basis of any form of privilege such as family connections with employees in an institution. That would be entirely wrong.  I do not think it necessary to introduce what I would see as a draconian measure to get over that.  We are concerned that each hospital in the State should be able to select trainee nurses who are suited to their needs.  The needs of hospitals are different.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has pointed out the need for Irish speaking nurses in different parts of the country. The training school should have some rights in the selection of trainee nurses.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he had written to Deputy Glenn and will be writing to Deputy Tunney assuring them that there will be no threat in the Bill to the character and ethos of any hospital.  If we were to widen the debate and move into other sections like section 54, which gives the Minister power to abolish the nursing board, we could have quite a long debate on what protection there is for the character and ethos of any hospital.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill that will <Col N="1738" /> give to hospitals the right either to select their employees or to protect their character and ethos.  It will be a matter for the board and while I do not doubt the Minister's sincerity, he could abolish the board if he so wished.  I would regard the passing of this legislation as a threat to the character and ethos of hospitals.  We have quoted from previous legislation which set out clearly the manner in which the character and ethos of the Federated Hospitals was to be protected.  There should be a similar section in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any provision in the Bill that is similar to the common contract for consultants.  We regard the selection of trainee nurses as being the prerogative of the employing authority, that is, the hospital concerned.  That right, too, should be protected.  Our hospitals are all of the highest standard.  They are fulfilling their functions admirably, and we as Members of this House owe it to them to protect their character and ethos.  For that reason, the amendment should be inserted.  It is not proposing any more than the guarantee promised by the Minister in a letter to Deputy Glenn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 27 and 28, to delete &ldquo;Any hospital or institution approved of by the Board pursuant to section 35 of this Act may not&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;If the Board establishes, pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, a central applications bureau, a hospital or institution approved of by the Board pursuant to section 35 of this Act shall not&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be recalled that on Committee Stage I was unable to accept Deputy O'Hanlons amendment because the intended provision of the subsection would be necessary if a central applications bureau were established.  However, the intention of the provision at the time <Col N="1741" /> was not sufficiently clear, and this amendment is proposed in order to establish beyond doubt that training institutions may only accept students who are approved of and recommended by the board, that is those who come through the central applications system where the board establishes a central applications bureau. That is the nub of the amendment.  They must first of all establish a CAB and only then can the process be developed.  It follows that if a central applications bureau is not established this obligation will not be imposed on the training institutions.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's amendment or with the subsection because, if it is accepted, hospitals like the International Missionary Training Hospital, Drogheda, will be unable to take students from a Third World country, like, say, Africa without the prior consent of the board, which might not be forthcoming.  I regard it as a retrograde step.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy remembers an amendment tabled on Committee Stage to delete subsection (3).  I did not accept the amendment then but I said that I was prepared to examine it on Report Stage on the ground that the provision of the subsection would be administratively undesirable to operate if a central application bureau was not established.  Accordingly, we introduced this amendment now.  I assure the Deputy that the board are conscious of the need to provide for foreign students.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that amendments were tabled by a number of Members, including Deputy O'Hanlon, in regard to <Col N="1742" /> this section on Committee Stage.  They wished to delete the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;at least once in every four years&rdquo;.  Deputy O'Hanlon wished to insert &ldquo;but at least once in every five years&rdquo;.  I indicated that I was amenable to an amendment, and I accept the arguments put forward by the Deputies in favour of inserting a minimum period in which the board should take steps to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy and suitability of nursing education and training programmes.  In proposing this amendment, I have tried to strike a balance between the amendments tabled on Committee Stage by the Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that in the case of an employed nurse, the name of whose employer is known to the board, the board will notify the employer of the relevant actions specified in the section in addition to notifying the Minister.  While it would be expected that the Minister would take steps to notify the relevant authorities, it is accepted that it is desirable to make <Col N="1743" /> specific provision in the section in relation to employed persons.</P>

      <P>In page 28, lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;, after consultation with the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises out of a discussion on Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment on Committee Stage in connection with the method of filling casual vacancies.  In response to a query from Deputy O'Hanlon as to the necessity for consultation with the Minister before the board would fill a vacancy among elected members, I indicated that I would consider removing the phrase &ldquo;after consultation with the Minister&rdquo; on Report Stage.  Since I agree with the points made on Committee Stage I put down this amendment as I would have no function in the election of members or in relation to their replacement.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. We should like to see a practice established whereby the person next in line to the person elected is nominated to fill the next vacant position.  If consultation with the Minister was necessary it could, in certain circumstances, interfere with that practice.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Desmond would interfere, because I believe he supports that practice. However, this Act will possibly be in operation for 50 years, and perhaps some future Minister might interfere with what we hope will become the established practice in all bodies like this.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Members of the House for their contributions to the lengthy and thorough debate <Col N="1744" /> which we had on this Bill since it came before the House almost 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>Following Second Stage on 7 June 1984, the Committee Stage debate was spread over five days and involved many hours debate.  We also had many hours discussion on Report Stage.  Consequently, we are all agreed that the Bill is much improved.  On Committee Stage, I accepted a number of amendments suggested by Deputy O'Hanlon and from other Deputies which, together with my amendments &mdash; many of which were engendered by the debate &mdash; have served to produce cohesive and comprehensive legislation.</P>
      <P>I also wish to thank the nursing profession and the many representative bodies and individuals who made representations to me and to Members on all sides of the House in relation to the Bill.  From the early stages, I invited comments from interested parties on the Bill and I certainly receive them in abundance, both written and verbal, since the Bill was initiated.  It was gratifying to Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and to me to find such an extraordinary interest in the Bill among nurses at every level and from every discipline of the profession.  Although our exchanges have not been without contention, that is part of the democratic framing of a Bill, and I would have been very concerned if the Bill had been received apathetically by nurses.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle and you, Sir, for your assistance in facilitating a constructive debate on this Bill. I also wish to thank the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health, Mr. O'Dwyer, and the Assistant Principal Officer, Sylvia Kelly, who, over a substantial period, have done outstanding work in relation to the Bill.  I should also like to thank Mr. Noel Daly, CEO of An Bord Altranais, who has been most helpful in relation to the Bill.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through the other House and that the new Bord Altranais will be elected in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The last day I proposed this amendment the purpose of which was to delete &ldquo;mail or other cargo&rdquo; from the provisions of this Bill.  We had a very short debate, a few minutes, before the debate concluded.  The Minister said in reply that at the moment there was no control on cargo and mail rates but that it was thought appropriate to extend these powers and he referred to the danger of what he called predatory pricing and said he wished to have these powers.  His position seems to be perfectly clear.  He is concerned that rates charged for mail and cargo might be too low.  He made no mention of seeking powers or being anxious to have powers, in respect of cargo and mail rates which might be too high, which I would have thought would be the more appropriate approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sought to inquire as best I could who wants this proposal to introduce control of cargo and mail rates, to keep the rates up rather than down, because when we talk about control in this Bill we are not talking about price control in the normal way, which is to keep prices down, but about control to keep prices up.  I cannot find anybody who asked for this control, other than, presumably, the Department of Communications who would see it as ideal to have further control in this area, to have it spelled out more clearly, and to have their already <Col N="1746" /> extensive powers in relation to the regulation of airlines made more extensive and copperfastened to an even greater extent.</P>
    <P>The CII, one of the groups most affected, have not asked for this.  They have not had very much to say.  Some major airlines are members, and in particular one major airline, and as a result they do not want to comment, as a matter of policy, in a way that would not have the approval of the airline.  As a result, they have not been commenting publicly but other members have been making it very clear that they are concerned about what will arise from this situation.</P>
    <P>We have the unusual situation that when the Second Stage debate on this Bill was taken last June it was described as an emergency measure, but this year the Minister said that some of the most important powers in this Bill are not intended to be exercised.  It is very hard to reconcile what we were told last June with what we were told here the last day. If it is not intended to exercise these powers, I ask the Minister why have them?  Is it not an example that from a bureaucratic viewpoint everything must be tied up and every t crossed and i dotted?  Is it appropriate to our general economic needs?</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking industry to accept for no good reason he has given and against the wishes of industry, the possibility that fines, originally of £100,000 but now proposed to be reduced to £50,000, can be imposed for the crime of charging too little, not too much, for air freight.  It was intended that two years in jail would also be imposed but in a ministerial amendment it is intended to drop that.  Therefore nobody will get two years in jail for charging too much for air freight, but a person can be fined £50,000. I wonder what the attitude of the IDA and other promotional bodies would be to measures like this.  Will they have to go to some lengths to try to keep them secret, or will they try to give the impression that they are of no consequence because these measures will be a deterrent to our development drive?  There is no doubt that all industry will lose under <Col N="1747" /> this provision if this amendment is not accepted.</P>
    <P>In particular the Minister has made Shannon the target for his urge to control prices in the sense of keeping them up. At present Shannon is endeavouring to develop a hub of freight services which was recently described by Mr. Tony Ryan of Guinness Peat Aviation, the most successful individual in Irish aviation.  He described the efforts being made to bring large cargo aircraft flying the Atlantic to Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but he is beginning to make a Second Stage speech.  We are dealing with one specific amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are dealing with cargo and mail, and I am discussing cargo.  There is a proposal which has been negotiated on and off over the last few years.  When I was in Government I recall being involved in it to some extent.  It died after a while but happily I understand it is being actively negotiated again.  This is a proposal by an American company, Federal Express based in Memphis, Tennessee, to use Shannon as their European base for cargo distribution throughout Europe.  A company like that would be very frightened by the provisions suggested in this Bill and would be reassured if the Minister were to indicate that he would accept this amendment.  That would make it clear that they would not be subject to penalties of £50,000 for charging too little for their services.  I understand another American organisation, United Parcels Services, a company which is not as big as Federal Express but would be a valuable acquisition to Ireland, have shown an interest.  The idea is that each day flights of large aircraft would arrive from the United States with various cargo which would be distributed in smaller aircraft from Shannon to different European destinations.  This would ba a most valuable acquisition for Shannon. If we subject cargo operations to this kind of minimum charges as suggested in <Col N="1748" /> this Bill, we could well frighten off any such proposals which, hopefully, might come about.</P>
      <P>Failure to accept this amendment would be a major blow to the negotiations and perhaps to the project.  The Minister, who has agreed that no rules in relation to cargo charges are in force at the moment, would be rewriting the rules at this late stage in any way which would be incomprehensible to Americans in particular and, indeed, to very many Europeans.  It would be the direct opposite to their own experience in the operation of cargo.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister seriously expect a large cargo airline to submit to the same kind of outdated regulatory regime which operates in this country in respect of passengers? Carriers of that type simply will not do so, and we should remind ourselves that there is no shortage of other airports in Europe which are quite prepared to take this business away from Shannon and certainly would not seek to make rules of this kind.  The one which obviously springs to mind is Schipol in Holland.  That airport is prepared to accommodate anybody, as the Dutch regularly are in respect of any matter like this that will be beneficial to their economy.</P>
      <P>On this question of cargo rates, which this amendment is trying to avoid, I refer the Minister to page 64 of the CAB report on airline deregulation of 1984, which states:</P>
      <P>The domestic cargo rates were deregulated in 1977 as a result of the cargo deregulation amendments of the 9th of November, 1977.  Tariff filings were eliminated by rule in the United States in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now seeking to introduce in 1985 the very matters that were done away with in the United States, who are the people that we will have to do the most business with in regard to cargo &mdash; and the most important business.  They find these kinds of provisions incomprehensible. That is why it is important that this amendment be accepted.  That report goes on to say that on 27 February 1983 <Col N="1749" /> and on 3 June 1983 the Civil Aeronautics Board established an international rate flexibility policy which created &ldquo;a zone of flexibility within which rates may be set without a requirement for economic justification&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My efforts on this Bill to get something similar introduced here by fixing maxima, where there would be flexibility below the maximum fare in respect of passenger traffic, have failed so far.  My amendment on the last day was rejected by the Minister. By seeking to apply these provisions to freight, I suggest that the Minister is seeking an unnecessary confrontation with US cargo airlines internationally.  By accepting the amendment, the Minister would be retaining some credibility in his claims to be a friend of the consumer and, in this case, of industry.</P>
    <P>Cargo deregulation gave us an early example of the wider deregulation which subsequently followed in the United States.  By introducing fines, which are very substantial indeed for rate cutting in cargo, the Minister would be turning his back on what has become the accepted practice in much of the western world over the last seven or eight years.  It is worth noting that industry here &mdash; the business sector generally who are the people mainly affected by this and who would mainly benefit by the amendment &mdash; have been very badly hit in terms of their ability to avail of air transport in recent years.  Some interesting figures were published by the Central Statistics Office, some of which I should like to quote.  They show the number of trips and the expenditure on overseas business trips by Irish residents in the years 1980-83. We are constantly given the idea that air transport is increasing and going from strength to strength, but the number of cross-channel business trips made by Irish residents in 1980 was 149,000 and the number of such trips made in 1983 was 114,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, we are still dealing with cargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  The <Col N="1750" /> people making these trips who, unfortunately, are declining very substantially in numbers, as those figures show, are the people for whom even further difficulties and hardship will be created by the introduction of these provisions applying minimum rates to cargo where no rates apply at the moment.</P>
      <P>On the question of mail, there is no demand whatever for any legislation governing this.  An Post have not sought it, nor have the CII nor anybody else to my knowledge.  It seems very bad economics and also very bad proposed law for this reason.  International mail carriage is, and has to be, by competitive tender. Many Governments, including the UK Government, require the postal authorities to accept the lowest tender that they get for the carriage of mail.  However, the Minister here, if he does not accept this amendment, proposes effectively to fine the applicant with the lowest tender if this part of the Bill is applied to him, because if you have a lower tender than the controlled figure or rate prescribed by the Minister, you are in breach of this Act.  On the other hand, if you do not tender below what others abroad are tendering, you will not get the business. Other Governments will give the business, irrespective of nationality, to the lowest tenderer.</P>
      <P>It puts people operating from this country &mdash; and this primarily includes Aer Lingus &mdash; in a very invidious situation. If they want to comply with the law of other countries, they inevitably have to breach the law here because if this amendment is not accepted the law here is quite at odds with what it is in every other country where the encouragement, understandably enough, is to keep prices down and get people to tender as low as possible.  Here you have to keep prices up and cannot go below a certain figure or you will be in breach of the Act.  Inevitably, this measure will push up postal and freight rates, just as in the past this kind of approach, as we well know, pushed up passenger rates to and from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the EC rules governing tendering for public service contracts, such <Col N="1751" /> tendering cannot be the subject of ministerial interference in the way proposed here by the Minister.  That will be rejected by the EC.  Public service tendering under the EC must be open to all members of the Community in a nondiscriminatory fashion.  I would think it pretty certain that, for example, the Commissioner who is currently responsible for competition would feel it his duty to intervene if this measure were passed and implemented in the way in which it is set out, if this amendment were not accepted.  Commissioner Sutherland would be bound to intervene because it would be a breach of the EC rules on public tendering.</P>
    <P>The enforceability of this provision, if this amendment is not accepted, is quite clearly in the most serious doubt because I have demonstrated that it would be in breach of EC rules which insist on competitive tendering and one would have to justify pretty strongly not giving the contract to the lowest tenderer.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to read the statement of the chairman of Aer Rianta in their annual report for 1984, published in the last week or so, on the question of cargo:</P>
    <P>Over the years we have been disappointed with the volume of freight business at our three airports.  This also lagged behind the developments worldwide.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that the gap was closed slightly last year when a 9 per cent improvement was achieved over 1983.  The hope now is that this positive trend will be sustained by the airlines and by the cargo industry generally.</P>
    <P>I concur with the chairman in that hope. I say to him and to anyone else who is interested that if these controls are brought in we will be back to the situation we were in up to 1984, of no growth or an actual decline in cargo at a time when air cargo is increasing significantly throughout the world.  For example, there are huge increases annually in the <Col N="1752" /> amount of air cargo to and from the United States, and the same applies in respect of Britain.  We are between the two countries but we have had no increase other than one increase last year after several years of decline or a static situation.</P>
    <P>For these reasons there is a compelling case, in terms of economics and of law, why this amendment should be accepted. If it is not, we will be in breach of the EC rules with regard to competitive public tendering.  It is futile to try to enact into law provisions that will be of no effect or that will have the harmful effect of frightening off possible developments for Shannon airport which would be most beneficial not only for Shannon but for the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point that on this simple amendment Deputy O'Malley has spoken for 25 minutes.  It is clear he is filibustering this Bill.  He has made a Second Stage speech, an attempt at a filibuster by one Member of this House who is the only person in opposition to this Bill.  He is a lone ranger, jumping fences that are figments of his imagination. The points he has raised have no validity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that on the last day we discussed this Bill there were banner headlines in <i>The Evening Press</i> that quoted the Deputy as saying that Aer Lingus had stopped Dan Air.  The Deputy has not apologised or made a personal statement withdrawing the allegations he made, which had no substance in fact.  I told the House what I knew.  No cheap fare application was filed with me, as the Deputy had suggested.  Aer Lingus were subsequently asked to comment and they vehemently denied the allegation made by the Deputy that they had blocked Dan Air's cheap fare, and Dan Air themselves issued a statement denying what the Deputy said.  It is important that I make all of this clear.  It was one of three major points made by the Deputy which were absolutely incorrect.  He also talked about the famous London-Amsterdam <Col N="1753" /> fare now accounting for about 30 per cent of the number of seats, perhaps going to 50 per cent in 1985, but the figure is much lower.  I told the House I understood it was of the order of 5 per cent but I am told now it is about 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Malley was talking about his previous amendment dealing with the insertion of the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo;, he said that most countries had this provision in their regulations.  I asked him to name one such country but, of course, he could not do so.  I am making this point to give the background to the points now being made by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    <P>He talked about flexible rates for cargo agreed by the CAB in the United States. The fact is that the CAB have the power to control rates and to allow for flexible rates.  That is the kind of power we are seeking.  As I have said, what is important is how the power is used.  We have the power under the 1965 Act and we are repeating it in this Bill to clear up any doubt about the powers in the 1965 Act. Up to now we have not used that power. We have had an uncontrolled situation in the cargo area and that is what we propose to continue.  However, it is important that we have contingency power if predatory pricing takes place which would mean that people were charging too low a price.  Deputy O'Malley has made a meal of this, that we were going to send people to jail for charging too little.  That is an emotive way of describing the situation and one that is totally at odds with the truth.</P>
    <P>All of us want fares and charges to be as low as possible.  Since I became Minister I have insisted on increases below the rate of inflation, and I note that Deputy O'Malley does not dispute that.  However, we have to guard against predatory pricing that could scuttle all services to this country, as we have to guard against overcharging.  This contingency power will give us the right to intervene in the event of people charging too much or of predatory pricing in order to push out all competition on particular routes, with the operator subsequently being able to charge what he liked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> I should like Deputy O'Malley to realise that 1984 was the best year ever for Shannon airport.  That was because of policies we have pursued and allowed, not least because of the big influx of Aeroflot aircraft into Shannon.  Despite the very difficult situation following the Korean air disaster, that operation has continued to grow.  It took some considerable deft diplomatic handling because, as Deputies will remember, the situation was extremely tense and the pressure was great to boycott Aeroflot completely. That operation, among other factors, has contributed to the enormous success of Shannon.  Our policies have allowed the airport to prosper and to have had the best year since 1946.</P>
    <P>It is wise to have this contingency power.  Of course it is important how it will be used.  I can only assure the House that I and my predecessors from all the parties, so far as I can check, have used this power prudently and in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Since the matter was raised, I should like to ask the Minister the position with regard to Federal Express.  When I was Minister for Transport the Federal Express venture was mooted but I gathered that at that time and since there were considerable obstacles either on this side or in the United States.  Am I right in thinking the Federal Express people finally made a decision not to go ahead at Shannon or is the matter still ongoing?</P>

I do not think it is unreasonable that we should not have figures available for the year 1985 in May 1985.  The estimates are there.  Deputy Molloy is talking about emigration.  We are talking about net migration and, as the Deputy well knows, emigration and net migration are two different things.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the number of non-nationals who have acquired Irish farmland since his order in May 1983 adding citizens of other EC countries as qualified persons under the 1965 Land Act; and the total acreage involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  In the period since May 1983 Land Commission consent was granted to 150 non-qualified persons, including citizens of EC countries and other non-nationals, to purchase an aggregate of 3,588 hectares.  The figures do not include non-nationals from <Col N="1763" /> EC countries who are qualified persons and did not seek consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that that is a fair amount of land?  We accept that there was no choice but to make that order; but with the fragmentation of farmlands and the small size of holdings, a special case should have been made to limit the sale of Irish farmland to non-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is a very small amount.  All the Deputy is speaking about is an average of 24 hectares.  Many people thought it was much larger than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister comes from a small farming area.  Would he not agree that some of the journals writing about this matter spoke about this land war threat by non-nationals, which will be serious.  While the Minister might write off 3,588 hectares, if that was added to land in the west or in the Cavan-Monaghan area to increase holdings it could mean 100 extra people being maintained on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many answers involved in that question.  For obvious reasons the Land Commission would not give consent if there were small local farmers in a position to purchase that land.  There are obviously many areas throughout the country, as the Deputy is aware, where the demand for land might not be as great as in some of the small farming areas.</P>

      <P>For obvious <Col N="1765" /> reasons I cannot give the Deputy the exact amount but I would like to inform the House that there is an accelerated plan in operation at the moment to get a lot of land off hands.  It is quite possible that there will be a very small amount on hands at the end of this year.  That also comes up in a later question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question about the number of Land Commission inspectors to divide the land.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am anxious to give the Deputy a reasonable answer, I must point out to him that the reply <Col N="1766" /> would have to be my own because the Bill will be coming before the House later.  I do not know when that will be but the Bill has a direct bearing on the amount of land left for division.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  It is true to say that there is a slightly different system for some estates but that does not mean that they are not being divided or that the people who are getting the land are any worse off.  The Deputy is aware that a certain amount of fencing and drainage work is going on all the time.</P>

      <P>The EC have given more aid to Africa than have any of the other economic blocs in the world and within the EC, Ireland has given more aid than any other member.  In other words, we have given more in terms of the whole world economy than has any other country in the world.  The point is that, if the <Col N="1783" /> product is given away, it would not be possible to finance the Common Agricultural Policy.  Therefore, we give as much as we can possibly give without undermining either our own economy or the CAP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture under the new super-levy quota milk regime the position of farmers who participated in his Department's scheme of premiums for non-marketing of milk and milk products for a period of five years, which period included the years 1981 to 1983, inclusive; whether it is the case that such farmers are now being denied any quota of milk production at all notwithstanding the fact that <Col N="1784" /> the period of non-marketing of milk applicable to them has expired; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Milk quotas are based on deliveries made during 1983. Accordingly farmers who participated in the non-marketing scheme and whose non-marketing period expired before or during 1983 are entitled to a quota based on their actual 1983 deliveries.  Other participants in the scheme whose non-marketing period expired after 1983 are in the same position as new entrants to milk production and are dependent on sharing in the &ldquo;flexi-milk&rdquo; available to their co-operatives or dairies.  I am, however, examining whether changes can be made in these arrangements for 1985-86 and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where the Department entered into agreements with farmers in 1980 under the milk cessation scheme, whereby these farmers would be paid certain allowances if they agreed not to produce milk for a five year period, is it not unfair to such farmers who have dairy units on their farms not to permit them to return to milk production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that this is unfair.  The situation has changed.  People were compensated for agreeing not to engage in milk production for a five year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that one of the consequences of the super-levy regime is that farms in respect of which there are no milk quotas are effectively devalued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is open to argument. It may be that they have changed to some other system of farming and are quite happy, so the question could be hypothetical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding those farmers who are not happy now that the five year period has expired, would the Minister <Col N="1785" /> be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to their cases?

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Is there any possibility that the price negotiations would be brought forward so as to ensure that dairy farmers particularly, because of the pattern of calving, would have an indication at the beginning of the year of what the milk prices for that year would be?  In other words, could the price fixing be brought forward, say, to November or December?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that will have to be considered very carefully having regard to the continuing delays in price fixing.  I am very much aware of the losses which farmers and especially dairy farmers suffer as a result of these delays, delays that sometimes go beyond 1 April. The price fixing negotiation system will probably become much more complicated with the accession of Spain and Portugal because there will then be 12 rather than ten members involved in the negotiations.  The matter is something that I will be putting forward because I agree that we should seek an early price fixing date from the Commission.</P>

      <P>This morning in his reply, almost none of which was devoted to what I said today but rather to what was said by Aer Lingus and others arising from the debate the last day, the Minister referred to the fact that I referred to the CAB in 1983 as regulating the fares with zones of flexibility.  The Minister said to the House that here was Deputy O'Malley who would allow the CAB to make these regulations and expect us to have no controls here.  It is a matter for outsiders to judge who is right and who is wrong in this matter but the fact is that the Minister's familiarity with the situation in spite of all the advice available to him in the House is, not for the first time, somewhat suspect.  The CAB was abolished on 31 December 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot regulate charges or anything else.  Therefore in asking that cargo charges be not regulated here in the sense of minimum charges being fixed for mail or other cargo, I am only asking that the same be done here as is done in the United States which is where a lot of our cargo traffic is to and from. It does not put us at a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind the Minister that the thinking in the US is so strong against regulation that it was abolished last December by the President with the full agreement of Congress and with what was described as the enthusiastic support of the administration in the US.  That is the reality and not what is represented in this Bill which is the opposite of the trend in the US and Europe.</P>

      <Col N="1832" /> On the Second Stage debate here last June, there was a long argument between myself and the Minister of State on the question of fares between London and Amsterdam, when I said that it was £49 for the return fare.  I was interrupted on two or three occasions to be assured that that was not the case.  A month or two later I got a letter from the Minister stating he regretted that he was wrong and that he was sorry.  There are many instances of that kind of thing and it is not enough for the Minister to assert blandly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section merely defines certain expressions or words.  The relevant matter now is whether airline tariffs should apply to mail or other cargoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been arguing that it should not apply to mail and cargo.  I have sought to delete those words and I have given a lot of reasons why it is inappropriate that mail and cargo, which on the Minister's admission are not controlled at present, should be controlled in future.  The Minister has not replied beyond saying that there was no validity in what I said.  He then launched into matters which were discussed the last day, which are not connected with this, and I hope to reply to that if I am allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made compelling arguments this morning why it would be damaging to this country to control cargo and mail charges.  Control in this context means keeping them up and over a certain level, not under it.  This is damaging to industry and, although the IDA cannot say anything publicly about it, I am sure they are horrified at the prospect.  The CII do not <Col N="1833" /> want to say anything about it publicly either for reasons which some of them explained to me.  A particular airline is one of their members and the member does not want to say anything publicly but, privately, they are very annoyed. CTT are also annoyed, but again because they are a public body they cannot say what they feel about it.</P>
    <P>Under EC regulations the carriage of mail has to go for public tender and, unless the airline which provides the lowest tender is very unsuitable from a safety point of view, the contract would have to be awarded to them.  However, there cannot be a lowest tender if this Bill is passed containing this provision. Everyone will have to tender the same amount; they will all be lowest tenders. That is wrong and in breach of EC regulations. It is a bit of a joke because other countries are dying to get people to tender lower and lower for various services and here we are pushing them up.</P>

      <P>I am trying to deal with the amendment and perhaps you would bear with me for a moment. Deputy O'Malley revealed to the House that the CAB were abolished on 31 December 1984.  I am aware of that.  The powers of the CAB have been transferred, lock, stock and barrel to the Department of Transportation.  Therefore, there is no change in the powers and the Department of Transportation in the United States have precisely the same powers which I am seeking here.  I should like to ask Deputy O'Malley if the civil aviation authorities in Britain or France have these powers.  I can tell him that they do have these powers and we are seeking the same powers.  I tried to cite three major errors of fact in Deputy O'Malley's contribution the last day which got very wide publicity, because he is a highly respected and newsworthy Member and what he said is more likely to be reported than contributions from other Members.  It is a pity that these errors are stated as fact in the daily media.  Aer Lingus and Dan-Air made corrective statements which did get publicity but not nearly as much as the original statement.  Deputy O'Malley is again making errors of fact and, although I have the highest personal regard for him, he is wrong in relation to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This statement was not published so I am anxious to refer to it. I said that I noted with interest the partial denial by Aer Lingus of my statement to the Dáil regarding proposed additional services to Ireland by Dan-Air.  I said that in the early part of the year discussions took place at a high level in relation to <Col N="1836" /> this proposal in which two Irish State agencies were involved and that I was satisfied as to the accuracy of my sources.</P>
      <P>I also said it was noteworthy that the Aer Lingus denial as reported does not make reference to what I said regarding the withdrawal of Dan-Air from the booking computer.  It is worth making passing reference to the Dan-Air statement which was very short.  It said that discussions with British Airways and Aer Lingus did take place in January to consider a proposal by Dan-Air to introduce lower promotional fares to and from Ireland, but after careful consideration of all the implications, including the response of other carriers and the present Ireland-UK bilateral position governing fares, it was reluctantly decided not to proceed with a formal filing to British and Irish authorities.  It went on to say that, if, however, a more liberal tariff régime were to exist, Dan-Air would welcome the opportunity of being able to introduce a more innovatory package of air fares for travel between the two countries. That is the entire Dan-Air statement.</P>

I had what I said the last day confirmed once again by reputable sources in this country.  In so far as that statement says positive things, it agrees with everything I said the last day.  I did not make the suggestion, as the Minister implied this morning, that he had turned down these fares.  He did not.  He never got them.  I made that point the last day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points I made about cargo and mail have not been replied to and if the Minister feels he cannot reply to them, or that there is not much to say in reply to them, then he should accept the amendment.  He told us these are not subject to control at the moment and that he does not propose to use the controls relating to cargo and mail, but if that is so, there is no need for them and they <Col N="1837" /> should not form part of our legislation. In my view, he should leave out the few words I suggested in my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert a new section as follows;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;This Act shall not apply to travel agents.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to exclude travel agents from being covered by the Act.  Under the 1965 Act it was held apparently by the Supreme Court that they were not covered by its provisions and that they were entitled to give discounts to their customers as they saw fit.  It was, of course, the practice of travel agents here, as it is in every country, to give discounts where they thought it appropriate to customers of theirs, in particular to the good customers.  In this connection the Minister decided that this was a loophole in the existing legislation, as he put it.  It is clear when you read the 1965 Act that it was never intended to cover travel agents.  It was a very erroneous belief on the part of the Minister and the Department that it should be. <Col N="1840" /> It is not a loophole, and bringing travel agents into this whole system of control, which will be unique in the world, is a new scene.  It is not closing a loophole or clarifying a situation that existed before.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of competition between travel agents, complaints were made some years ago &mdash; in fact, when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; by various firms and members of the public to the Department and to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices about insufficient competition, as was alleged, between travel agents here.  I had no great interest in the matter at the time, but apparently it was referred to the Examiner of Restrictive Practices who investigated it and decided that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case, at least, in relation to it.  He thought he should make an order having it examined in turn and an inquiry held by the Restrictive Practices Commission into whether there was sufficient competition between travel agents.</P>
    <P>A public inquiry was held by the Restrictive Practices Commission into the whole question.  That commission produced a report and presented it in June 1984 to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  On 1 November last in this House I asked that Minister a Parliamentary Question about when he intended to publish the report and, in particular, if he would publish it before Committee Stage of this Bill was to be taken.  At that stage I understood that Committee Stage would be taken a week of two after 1 November, as we were led to believe at the time.  The Minister replied saying that he would publish the report as soon as possible, would comment fully on it then, that there would be a debate on it and so on. I asked him in a supplementary question would he not agree that it was essential that it be published before Committee Stage debate on this Bill, as it was entirely pertinent to it.  He hummed and hawed a little about that and said that he would operate independently and did not know much about this Bill which, while he agreed was connected, was a matter not <Col N="1841" /> for his Department but for the Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>We are now in the second half of May, six and a half months later than the date of my Parliamentary Question, and we still have not seen the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission on the lack of competition between travel agents.  While it has not been formally published, many people know what it recommends.  It recommends that in recent years there was not enough competition between travel agents, there should be far more and that the cartel situation in which airlines and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that Bill.  We are discussing the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the Bill before us deals with whether to confine travel agents or not, whether there should be competition between them or not.  I am speaking about a report of the commission, not a Bill.  The report recommended that there should be far more competition between travel agents, not less.  If this Bill is passed, and particularly if it is passed without this amendment taking its application away from travel agents, it will be impossible for a travel agent, even if he wanted to, to compete with any other.  They will all have to do exactly the same, charge exactly the same for everything, and if they give any kind of discount they are liable to a fine, which originally was £1,000 and two years in jail but now to a fine of £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the only country, as far as I can ascertain &mdash; with the exception of France where an action was taken in respect of these matters against travel agents last year &mdash; where you can be prosecuted for charging too little.  The French court was of opinion that the French law sustaining this matter was in contravention of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome and they referred it to the European Court for confirmation of that view.  The European Court will hear the case next month and give its decision in October.  Otherwise, I cannot find any instance of travel agents being prosecuted for charging too little. <Col N="1842" /> At the moment they cannot be and they are recommended strongly by the Restrictive Practices Commission to see that they compete more and issue more discounts more readily than they do.</P>
    <P>It seems quite unreal that we should have an official report of that kind available to the Government for the last 11 months and that it should not be before this House when this House is being asked to legislate on something which is entirely relevant to the very point of that report and when the legislation that we are now being asked to pass is in direct confrontation with and contradiction to the report that was produced and given to the Government last June.  The thing is a bit of a joke.  What is the point of a Restrictive Practices Commission going to all the trouble and expense of holding a public inquiry?  I suppose it lasted a couple of weeks and they spent a lot of time afterwards drawing up the report and coming to conclusions.  The whole thing is cast aside and hidden because it would be a joke if one could stand up here and formally read out from the published report all the things which it said should not be done, including the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The report is suppressed in the meantime, but everyone who is interested knows what is in it.  It is the direct opposite of what is in this Bill &mdash; more competition, less regulation, more freedom. The thing is a farce.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is reputedly annoyed about this Bill, and I can well imagine that.  One can imagine the view taken by the Restrictive Practices Commission.  What is the point of their holding an inquiry?  I do not know where else such a situation could arise.</P>
    <P>Discounting of airline tickets, which we are told in this country is a very serious crime, is a normal commercial transaction in Northern Ireland, as it is in most countries.  In 1984, five million discounted tickets were sold in Britain &mdash; not just a few hundred or a few thousand by some kind of backstreet operators.  It is not uncommon in this country, either. It has been regarded as a fairly normal practice by not all travel agents but many <Col N="1843" />&mdash; so much so that some were prosecuted for doing it.  So little was thought of it that others considered it worth while to complain about them to the Restrictive Practices Commission for not giving enough discount.</P>
    <P>The travel agents who were prosecuted by the present Minister, a firm called Club Travel, who were selling airline tickets too cheaply had the case dismissed. That is why this Bill has been brought along.  That agent was merely extending to the general public discounts which were already widely available and, according to such inquiries as I have made, will continue to be available privately to certain privileged classes even if this Bill is passed, but are not available to the general public.  Among the privileged classes, of course, are airline staffs, civil servants and Members of this House. Why should Members of this House be entitled to discounts?  Why, for example, should former Ministers for Transport be entitled to considerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These selective discounts will be available to certain groups but any travel agent who gives a discount to a member of the public will commit an offence.  That is ridiculous. There was an interesting item in <i>The Irish Times</i> last September which referred to certain well-known people who enjoyed the benefit of very heavily discounted tickets to Nice last July.  The full fare was more then £600 but the fare paid in that instance was in the region of £180.  The question was asked in that slightly amusing snippet: who would have gone to jail <Col N="1844" /> in those circumstances, the distinguished Member of this House or the travel agent who sold him the ticket?  This Bill was meant to be passed before the end of June.  If it had been, a leading Member of this House would have committed a criminal offence, as would the travel agent who sold him the ticket.  That is all documented in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  However, because the Bill was not passed, neither of them committed a criminal offence.  If the Bill is passed by the summer and if the same distinguished Member of this House wants to do the same thing this summer in respect of his holiday he could be in trouble then.  I think that might bring home to the public the silliness of all this business.</P>
      <P>As the Bill is drafted the sale of any discounted ticket to anywhere in the world by an Irish travel agent will be illegal.  That applies to routes on which Aer Lingus do not operate.  It applies to places such as the Far East, Australia, South America and such places where it could not conceivably be suggested that Aer Lingus would be affected.  Tickets for these routes are not available through airline offices in Ireland except at full IATA rates.  If the Bill is passed and applied to all travel agents here it will have the effect of raising the Dublin-Tokyo fare.  I am talking now of figures operating last October but I do not think the situation has changed materially in the meantime.  It will have the effect of increasing the fare from £814 to £1,994 which is the IATA undiscounted fare.</P>

      <P>That is the point I am endeavouring to make, namely, how futile and silly is this Bill.  If the ticket is sold in Ireland by a travel agent based in Ireland he cannot discount any of it even though five-sixths of the route will have nothing to do with Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; there was an amusing incident which has a bearing on what I am talking about.  I said it was a pity the Minister for Communications was not in the House and I was told by the Minister of State he was in Japan.  He said the air fare from Japan was terribly high and that it would be too expensive to bring him home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a good joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  The difference between the full undiscounted fare to Japan and the discounted fare is that one is £1,994 and the other is £814.  If I were going to Japan I would wish to pay the £814 fare and I would prefer to buy my ticket in Ireland.  I do not know what benefit it is to our country to operate in this way.  It is simply increasing Irish payments to foreign carriers.  There can be no argument in this case of acting in support of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the replies the Minister will probably make to this amendment is that the travel agents' association have not <Col N="1846" /> asked that this Bill should not apply to them.  As I understand it, that is correct. However, they are extremely divided about the matter.  They had a prolonged private debate and it appears a majority took the view that, even though it will stop them going through even a semblance of competition from now on, that will suit a majority of them.  They will not have to compete or give even the relatively limited discount they have given up to now.  From now on they will be able to tell their customers they have to charge the full fare, that otherwise they will commit a criminal offence if they reduce the fare even by £5 or £10. On that basis a majority probably took the view that they would be better off financially to some extent and for that reason they were not prepared to ask that the Bill should not apply to them.  Of course many travel agents see the dangers in the Bill.  They see the damage it will do and they look at things a little more widely than just their own interests.  They would prefer that this Bill should not have been introduced or that it should certainly not apply to them.</P>
    <P>I see a note I have here in relation to the Dublin-Tokyo run.  If the Bill were applied only in respect of the Dublin-London leg of the journey we would have a fare of £204 as part of the total £814 fare to Tokyo.  The mileage from Dublin to London is 279 miles and the mileage from Dublin to Tokyo is 6,274 miles. Therefore, for 4 per cent of the journey we would have 26 per cent of the fare, that is, assuming that the Bill will apply only to the Dublin-London leg, as the Minister has suggested.  I have suggested it applies to the whole journey.  However, assuming that it will apply only as the Minister has said, for 4 per cent of the journey we would have 26 per cent of the fare.  That is lopsided and ridiculous.  It demonstrates how out of touch we are and at what extraordinarily high levels fares are charged here.  It was interesting to see in <i>The Irish Times</i> only on Saturday last a report of the fact that Virgin Atlantic were applying for a licence on the London-Dublin route.  Mr. Branson, their chairman, was asked why and he <Col N="1847" /> said because London-Dublin is one of the highest priced routes in the world.</P>

      <P>It would be a misuse of the time of this House were I to spend minute for minute replying to Deputy O'Malley, especially when so many of his points are errors of fact.  It is very hard to believe that a person of Deputy O'Malley's stature can come into this House with so many errors of fact.  I have drawn attention to the errors contained in his contribution the previous day.  He has not been gracious enough to admit that he was wrong.  He misled the House on three major points and has not withdrawn them.  Today we have again an assertion that we control fares all the way to Tokyo when everybody knows that there is no direct service from this country to Tokyo, that there are connecting flights.  We would control only those air fares to, <Col N="1848" /> say, London, Frankfurt or some other European city.  Does anybody think there is any substance in Deputy O'Malley's assertion that we control the onward journey from, say, London to Tokyo? Does anybody think that the British Government or the British Aviation Authority would tolerate that for one moment?  I am sorry that Deputy O'Malley persists with such misleading points.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment, which seeks to delete the coverage of travel agents from the provisions of this Bill, would be to subvert a central part of this Bill and, therefore, is not acceptable.  I think I am not misquoting the Deputy when I say that he has said also that the only place of which he is aware where this control exists is France where it has been challenged.  Deputy O'Malley is a solicitor.  I am not sure if he is familiar with British legislation.  I would ask him if he ever heard of the Civil Aviation Act of 1971 and, if so, if he is aware of its provisions?  Is he aware that its provisions have the very same control over travel agents as we seek here?  Deputy O'Malley is repeating assertions which are incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the British Secretary of State for Transport, I do not <Col N="1849" /> know how many and, given the other incorrect assertions by Deputy O'Malley, I would have to treat with a great degree of caution any figures he suggests in the House.  I do not know.  Certainly figures have been bandied about as to the number of illegal tickets, but they are illegal tickets, sold by British travel agents.  I have no doubt that there are illegal sales and that there are illegal sales here, as the Deputy has said.  But that is not a reason that there should not be the power to protect the air services in and out of this country.  We have a duty to ensure a continuity of air services in and out of this country.</P>
      <P>I might refer to one or two other points Deputy O'Malley made previously.  He referred to concessions available to Members of this House and former Ministers of Transport.  I have to say in this respect that certainly I am learning all the time; I was not aware of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy also talked about a distinguished Member of this House &mdash; whoever that is &mdash; who went to Nice for £180, not for the normal fare of £600. What is the normal fare to Nice?  Where did Deputy O'Malley get that figure?  We do not have any direct air services to Nice.  Therefore, we do not have any control over air fares to Nice.  If it was a chartered flight to Nice, then we do not control charter fares.  It really is extremely difficult to carry on a rational, logical, intelligent debate if these assertions are going to continue, incorrect, non-factual assertions.  I am very disappointed that Deputy O'Malley has continually put forward points which, in many cases, are totally incorrect, and in other cases, must be suspect and are unsubstantiated.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat sterile, instead of answering points I made, that the Minister's only <i>modus operandi</i> is to <Col N="1850" /> get up and say: Deputy O'Malley is nonfactual; he is making mistakes or errors of fact.  We are never told what they are; I do not know.  I asked him how many British travel agents were prosecuted last year for selling tickets under cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He says he does not know.  I can quite accept that the Minister does not know because I would suggest to him that the answer is zero.  If any of them was prosecuted we would know about it because there would be an outcry.  Can one imagine the British at present prosecuting somebody for charging too little for a particular service? There would be an outcry in every paper in Britain.  Therefore we can safely take it that the answer is none.  The only place, apart from France, of which I am aware where prosecutions were taken for charging too little was here by the Minister himself.  When he found that he could not succeed in that he did an extraordinary thing: he brought in this Bill to ensure there was no way he would fail in the future, that he would be able to convict, have fined or sent to jail anyone who charged too little for a ticket.  That is just silly.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to get up and say: &ldquo;Deputy O'Malley is factually wrong every time he opens his mouth&rdquo;.  I am not.  I have spent a lot of time on this.  I know a fair amount about it, and I do not just hit it in spots, as does the Minister when it suits him, and make broad assertions of this kind.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if his attention was drawn to a news item in yesterday's <i>Financial Times,</i> a very interesting one, another interesting development in Britain in relation to these matters we are discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the selling of tickets under the full IATA cartel figure, that is, that complaints against <Col N="1851" /> travel agents and airlines for not competing, for charging fares that are regarded as too high, for maintaining a cartel, or for conspiring together to keep up prices or not to compete genuinely, are to be referred now, not to the Department of Transport but rather direct to the Office of Fair Trading, which is the equivalent in Britain of the Restrictive Practices Commission here.  That very interesting news item appeared in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i>.  It needs to be pointed out that it is a matter of some significance because, if the same were to happen here, if we did not have just the fairly hopeless option open to us of complaining only to the Department of Communications &mdash; whose concern is to keep prices up and to prevent competition &mdash; if we could go to the Restrictive Practices Commission and say &ldquo;I do not like this, these two airlines are in a cartel, they are joining together to keep up prices&rdquo;, we all know the kind of reply we would get because we already know what they have said in relation to travel agents not competing sufficiently with one another.  That is a very significant development in aid of the consumer, in aid of lower costs all round for everybody, in aid of competition and in aid of the general development taking place in aviation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about travel agents because the tickets will be sold through them and I am suggesting that instead of the complaints being made to the Department of Communications, if the Minister sees fit to follow that particular move, they should be made to the Restrictive Practices Commission who will have a lot to say about it.  When we are complaining about costs and about everything being so dear we are introducing legislation on our own in order to ensure that people will be prosecuted if they charge too little.  This seems to be a fairly ridiculous situation.  By bringing <Col N="1852" /> travel agents within the ambit of this Bill we are putting an end to any possibility of competition.  Competition is of growing importance in the EC and is one to which Commissioner Sutherland is making a considerable contribution.  He has made a very marked contribution in the four and a half months he has been in that position.  With regard to this question of competition could I read one short paragraph from an article which Commissioner Sutherland wrote in Community Report, May 1985?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very lenient with the Deputy.  He is making a Second Stage speech again.  We are dealing with amendment No. 4 which is that this action not apply to travel agents.  Would the Deputy confine himself to that amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I brought up this point about travel agents is that I feel there should be competition and I am not alone in thinking that.  It is the very predominant view within the EC that there should be more competition. The name of the article is &ldquo;How I will Deal with the Black Hole&rdquo;.  What Commissioner Sutherland refers to as the black hole are the areas where there is no competition.  He identifies air transport as one of the worst black holes in Europe.  I hope he can do something about this but he will have to start here. He will have to start with this Minister and with this House.  It must be very discouraging for a man, who was closely allied with the Government until quite recently, to find that some of the implacable opponents he has to his philosophy in his job are some members of the Government.  There is no way the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would support the principle of this Bill applying to travel agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to answer more of the points I made earlier.  We would get through it much quicker if he did.  I do not want to prolong the matter.  I already agreed that we pass one of the earlier amendments without discussion.  Would the Minister deal with the point I made <Col N="1853" /> about the report of the Restrictive Practices Commission given to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism last June which recommends the direct opposite of what is suggested here?  How does the Minister reconcile the recommendations of that report with his refusal to accept my amendment now?</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Malley's proposal were accepted it would dilute the whole thrust of this Bill, which is to continue what has been the case in the past and what needs to be confirmed resulting from the court decision, that is that our air transport is controlled for the benefit of the country.  It is right and proper in the national interest that our air transport be controlled in a proper manner, realising the consumer interest but also balancing that against the national interest.  They do not conflict.  In my view on most issues they are compatible. It is for the Minister to argue against the amendment but that is my view on it. I feel strongly we should have the controls the Bill envisages.  I am not in favour of this amendment because I believe it would water down the types of controls that are required for air transport in the country.  Various statements have been made by Deputy O'Malley during his contribution on this amendment.  One was with regard to discounts which are apparently available to Members of this House and also available to former Ministers for Transport.</P>

      <P>He said they got discounted travel.  I have done a fair bit of travelling, both official and personal, in my time.  As I am in the constituency where Dublin Airport is I have been as closely associated with the national airline as most Members of this House.  I want to put it on the record that there was never a question of discounted fares on any social travel I have undertaken. It is important that the Minister clear the situation with regard to all Members of the House in relation to the statement <Col N="1854" /> made by Deputy O'Malley.  If the Deputy has some information it is important that he put it on the record because he made a sweeping statement which is supposed to include the Members of this House.  I have no knowledge of the type of travel he is suggesting.  The public perception of it will be that the Members of this House are flying around free, gratis and for nothing.  That is not the fact.  It is incumbent on the Minister for the protection of Members of this House to put the record straight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had time to check since Deputy O'Malley made that assertion.  There is no such facility available to Members of this House.  There is no discount travel or free travel available to Members of this House.  This is the fourth major error during Committee Stage by Deputy O'Malley.  It is quite disgraceful from a person of his particular standing to repeatedly make assertions which do not stand up to examination. He said I did not deal with any of his complaints.  He also said there was no legislation like this in other countries.  I have already replied that there is in Britain the Civil Aviation Act, 1971, which gives precisely the same powers I am seeking here.  The vast majority of the civil aviation authorities in Europe have these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of Deputy O'Malley's argument has been that we are seeking extraordinary powers that no other country has. That is not the case.  We are seeking the same powers that other countries have in order to clarify that we have them because of some doubt in the absence of a court decision.  Deputy O'Malley as a solicitor can be presumed to know the law.  He has made much of the report <Col N="1855" /> of the Restrictive Practices Commission, the responsibility of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, but the Deputy should know that restrictive practices legislation, for which he was responsible for many years, excludes air services.  As Minister he did not make any attempt to amend that legislation to include air services.  It is a bit much to take these repeated fallacies which do not have any basis in fact.</P>
    <P>If we were to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment we would be up-turning the Bill.  The fact is that a ruse was used by one airline with one travel agent to the exclusion of all others.  There was no competition, with an offer to increase the commission to 20 per cent or whatever, and the agent was told to keep half of it and pass on the other half.  It was a way of circumventing the legislation which exists to protect the continuity of air services to and from the country.  As a former Minister for Industry, Deputy O'Malley should know the crucial importance for industrial development of having a continuous air service east and west of the country.  The Deputy has fallen for propaganda. When he looks at what the British, the Dutch, the Americans or the Germans do he should realise that none of them is running to abandon their national interests.  He is proposing that we abandon ours but I am not going to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As it has been mentioned I should like to say something about the contribution of Mr. Sutherland to <i>Community Report</i>.  He started off with the laudable sentiment that competition was not to be pursued for its own sake but rather because it is an instrument for promoting a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, and an accelerated raising of the standard of living.  He went on to say that he would concentrate on three areas &mdash; legislative framework, enforcement of the law and distortions. With regard to &ldquo;black holes&rdquo; he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> One example is the missing regulation of the Council of Ministers regarding the introduction of a control on concentrations and mergers;</P>
    <P>He went on to mention the one which I presume Deputy O'Malley was referring to:</P>
    <P>another is the missing regulations for the application of the competition rules in the fields of air and sea transport.</P>
    <P>What we want to advert to is the fact that that is spoken in a European context and that he is not speaking to Dublin merely but to ten capitals as Commissioner.  It is our view, and I am sure it is the view of the Minister, that a limited form of regulation is necessary.  When Mr. Sutherland is speaking to the Ten I am sure he is aware that all ten Governments in one way or another practice some form of protection policy.</P>
    <P>The Fifth Freedom of the Air is the privilege of one State to take on passengers, mail and cargo in another State destined for the territory of a third State and the privilege to put down passengers, mail and cargo coming from any such territory.  It is well known that other members of the Ten have refused that type of right to our carrier, Aer Lingus. As I understand it, Aer Lingus are anxious&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to interrupt the Deputy but, while I appreciate the argument he is making, he is moving away from the amendment which states that the Bill shall not apply to travel agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely about travel agents, and their freedom to act, that I am talking.  I am talking about travel agents.  If a travel agent wants to pick up somebody in Manchester and to take that person to Frankfurt he is in trouble because of restrictive practices, not by an Irish Government but by the UK Government.  If a travel agent wants to pick up somebody in Manchester and drop that person in Brussels he is not <Col N="1857" /> permitted to do so by the UK Government. The same is true of restrictions that travel agents have to operate under as far as flights to France are concerned.  Air France made a pitch into the business of Aer Lingus, to Lourdes specifically.  If a travel agent wants the freedom to book Aer Lingus to Lourdes he is not free to do so except to a limited extent because Air France, backed by the French Government, has pitched in and said &ldquo;No, Air France must get part of that business&rdquo;.  The same is true of the Spanish Government.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that when Mr. Sutherland is speaking, as in the article quoted; he is speaking in the full context of the Ten.  There is a certain tone in the final paragraph of his article &mdash; I will not expand on it &mdash; which I find slightly disturbing.  As a Commissioner he is challenging the power and right of Ministers. The Minister for Communications is the person who makes the decisions, not the Commissioner.  There are threats in that paragraph.</P>
      <P>As far as travel agents are concerned, there may be restrictions here and I will be pushing that the type of restriction will be one that will not interfere with competitive fares and tariffs.  We must remember that there are also restrictions on travel agents as far as the Governments of the Ten are concerned.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy O'Malley, I should like to make it clear that I am all for a very liberal air transport regime provided it is done together.  Therefore the proposals of the Commission are welcome.  The only way is to get progress throughout Europe together.  We cannot unilaterally abandon our controls, as Deputy O'Malley suggested.  If everybody else will accept Fifth Freedom rights, Sixth Freedom rights or Fourth or Third Freedom rights, we will welcome it and Aer Lingus will welcome it.  The freer the position is in Europe the better, but it cannot be done unilaterally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply to that is that we should all do what the Commission <Col N="1858" /> want us to do.  Commissioner Sutherland made it quite clear that it was depressing for him to find that Memorandum II put forward last year by the Commission was rejected by a majority of the Council of Ministers of which the Minister is a member.  That is a great pity.  Will the Minister not go so far as to go along with Memorandum II?  That memorandum is under criticism by some European Governments because it does not go far enough.  They say it is useless, but we are not even prepared to go that far.  The Minister could go that far.  He is not being asked to do anything unilateral.  He would then be acting in conjunction with the Commission and the other member states.  Why not do that?  There is no question with memorandum II of giving up controls or regulations.  One only takes a very limited number of steps along the road, so limited that some Governments think it is a bit of a waste and that Europe should go far beyond that.  I am only asking as a first step, and a very important first step for this country, that we go as far as the Commission ask us.  Commissioner Sutherland will go to some lengths to ensure that that will happen.  He says in the article:</P>
      <P>Take one example, the air transport sector.  The objective being pursued now is to open up the extensively regulated market to fresh competition within the structure of the Treaty.  This is by no means an obstacle to deregulation.</P>
      <P>I shall therefore urge the Commission to press the Council to adopt the three regulations now before it, dealing with the merger control and the application of Articles 85 and 86 to air and sea transport.  Their adoption before the end of the year will be one of the Commission's priorities and far from leading the overregulations the adoption of these instruments will open up business opportunities and will constitute a positive dynamic.</P>
      <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation as regards air transport should also be adverted to.  Should the proposals made by the Commission in <Col N="1859" /> Memorandum II not succeed, the Commission will have to consider taking further legal action.  It will be recalled that its existing powers include the use of Articles 169, 89, and and/or 90.</P>
    <P>He goes on in that vein at length in the article saying why all these regulations to air transport will have to be broken down in Europe, how it will be for Europe's benefit if that happens and how that is being recognised fairly generally in Europe; but not, unfortunately, very widely as yet in some countries.  The Commissioner finishes by saying:</P>
    <P>Freedom of competition within the market place is as crucial an element in the development of the European economy as is the elimination of non-tariff barriers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;terms or condition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;term or condition&rdquo; in section 2 where it says that the Act applies to any fare, rate or other charge, term or condition contained in an airline fare.  While one would prefer that this Bill, if it is passed, did not apply in the way that it is intended to apply to all fares for the purpose of keeping them up and preventing people charging less than the approved fare, certainly if one is forced to go along with that one is not forced to go along with the enforcement of all these terms and conditions, which under this definition will form part of the overall fare and without which certain lower and more attractive fares and not available.  These include things like various advance booking requirements, the necessity to stay over a Saturday night, for example, in certain destinations and various other terms and conditions of that kind which are attached to a great deal of travellers or at best are very awkward and unsuitable, so that people cannot avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not be for the Minister to involve himself in applying legal penalties to those who find it impossible to comply with those conditions.  Provided one can comply with very strict conditions, there are quite substantial reduced fares available, on paper at least, but in practice we find that they are hardly ever availed of <Col N="1862" /> because of the onerous conditions.  For example, we saw advertised in recent months a return fare of £69 between London and Dublin.  It exists all right on paper.  I understand that each weekend a handful of people avail of it because they have some reason for going to London. Scarcely more than a handful avail of it. It comes to less than 1 per cent of the people using the service.  These conditions and terms which are applied as part of the tariff, and therefore of the application of this Bill, are so onerous as to be quite misleading.  They do not deserve the sanction of the law.</P>
    <P>On the £69 fare, the difficulty is that you must travel outward on a Saturday and back the same day or the following day, Sunday. If you go outside that, the fare does not apply to you and the normal fare of £204 applies, which is very different. Last November in a series of written questions to the Minister I inquired what proportion of people using particular routes used these different categories of fares and I was told the information was not available to the Minister and he did not know at that time what the different proportions or numbers were.  I accept it when he tells me that.  I find it difficult to understand why he wishes to try to underwrite all those various conditions.</P>
    <P>The strange thing about it is that, although some of these conditions are very particular, very onerous and obviously tremendously restrictive in the number of people they could apply to, or who would be able to comply with them, airlines operating in the same cartel all have exactly the same restrictions, even though they are very unusual.  One of them is this outward on a Saturday and back on Sunday.  That is very unusual. When you read that there is a £69 fare available, you think it is great until you find it is impossible.  I wonder whether all these conditions, including the pre-booking conditions and others that apply to other fares, should have the force of law.  If a breach of them by a travel agent, or an inadvertent breach by somebody or other, or even a breach which was not <Col N="1863" /> inadvertent, should result in a criminal prosecution, that is going a bit far.  When we move in the direction of having a smaller variety of fares, but a much more reasonable level of fares, we will have arrived at a more sensible position.</P>

      <P>Terms and conditions are a fundamental part of airline pricing. To accept the amendment would make a nonsense of the approval process, since it would be open to an airline or agent to disregard conditions on matters such as advance purchase period, minimum stay, penalty for cancellation, and so on.  This is important.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley made a great meal out of the £49 return fare between London and Amsterdam.  If what he is now proposing were accepted, that would not be possible.  That sort of fare is possible only under certain conditions and in certain circumstances.  There is a conflict. Deputy O'Malley is making what sounds like a very liberal proposal but it is completely inconsistent with his stance on other matters.  It may be that Deputy O'Malley does not know the sort of conditions that can apply to the celebrated cheap fare of £49 between London and Amsterdam which happens to be much dearer than the £69 restricted fare between London and Dublin on a per mile basis.  We have to have this provision.</P>

      <P>It is almost without restriction or with very minimum restrictions. To say that I would abolish that because I object to fares with very onerous restrictions is not logical.  It is absolutely illogical.  To argue against something which is enormously onerous and to be told by the man fate has ordained that you should argue with, unhappily for me, that you are also arguing against something less onerous is not logical. I am trying to make these fares less onerous.  Consistently, but without any success, I have been trying to bring about the situation which exists under the Anglo-Dutch agreement which the Minister said he was all in favour of last November.  I have cuttings here of what he said on the Anglo-Irish free trade agreement on air transport.  Apparently he has forgotten about that now.</P>
      <P>It is precisely because I am trying to bring those things about that I make these arguments for the benefit of the people in this country.  If the British are prepared to enter into these arrangements with the Dutch, is there any reason to believe they are not prepared to enter into them with the Irish?  Of course they are.  The Minister should give up this childish thing he goes on with of telling me that because I argue against one thing, inevitably I am arguing against something else altogether. It really is childish and I do not know who it impresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of onerous terms and conditions of this kind should not be through the criminal law.  It would be to the benefit of all concerned if it were not through the criminal law.  I do not know why the Minister wants to enforce all these restrictions through the criminal law.  The restrictions have nothing to do with the cost of the transaction or the cost of the flight.  They are simply devices by airlines to split markets.  They should <Col N="1865" /> not be supported by the force of law and, in particular, they should not be supported by the force of the criminal law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3 between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This Act does not apply to any airline tariff in respect of any flight to or from the following airports, namely, Shannon, Cork, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Farranfore and Connaught Regional Airports.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try to ensure that the Bill does not apply to airports other than Dublin.  I do not think it should apply to Dublin because the Bill is wrong in principle.  I have to wear the fact that it is likely at some time or another to pass through the Houses if the Government so decide.  I want to try to see that it does the least damage possible.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that, apart from Dublin, all our other airports are seriously under-utilised and could do with substantially more traffic than is available to them.  For that reason the provisions of this Bill should not apply with all the controls, regulations, and so on, to our airports other than Dublin.  I set them down: Shannon, Cork, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Farranfore and Connaught Regional on the basis that presumably the latter will open at some time in the future.  When it does open, it will be fairly substantial in size by comparison with all the others except Shannon and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very disappointing to look at the smaller airports like Waterford, Galway, Sligo and Farranfore and see how little business they do.  What possible use or <Col N="1866" /> advantage is it to have all these regulations, all these criminal offences, criminal sanctions, fines and jail sentences applied to people who use those airports?  Why should fares be kept up to a certain level at a place like Farranfore?  What we want is to see the airports used.  Similarly with Shannon and Cork; we want to see more use made of them.</P>
    <P>For example look at the attitude Aer Rianta take in their annual report published fairly recently.  Judgments on matters of this kind tend to be made, as so frequently in this country, in the Dublin context only.  If it is appropriate in Dublin, it is appropriate everywhere else. If it is inappropriate in Dublin, it is inappropriate everywhere else.</P>
    <P>I should like to look at some of these other airports and, in particular, Shannon which is mentioned in the amendment as one I should like to see not covered by the Bill if it is passed.  Aer Rianta reported in 1984 a 17 per cent increase in passengers on the Atlantic route into and out of Shannon.  For the same year they reported no change in Shannon's European traffic, no growth at all, and a 1 per cent increase in transatlantic traffic at Dublin.  It is worth comparing the situation in Shannon between 1983 and 1984. On the transatlantic route there was an increase of 17 per cent.  On the domestic, European and British side, no change, and on freight an increase of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta attribute this to what they describe as the more competitive fare structure operating on the Atlantic into and out of Shannon.  The Minister takes a lot of credit for that and by all means. I am delighted.  There was some competition in 1984.  There were new people. They were beginning to compete with one another.  What is the result &mdash; plus 17 per cent, a very worth-while increase at Shannon on the Atlantic because there was some competition, because fares were lower, because new people were allowed in to operate there.  There was no competition on all the other routes, the domestic, British and European routes from Shannon.  The whole lot of them were in a cartel situation with no new people allowed in.  What was the <Col N="1867" /> result?  Stagnation, no change, in a year when air traffic generally and movement of passengers increased.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister and the House can see a moral in that.  In the part of the business where competition was allowed, even if only to a limited extent, and where new entrants were allowed, there was a spectacular increase.  In the part of the business where the cartel situation was maintained and no competition was allowed, there was no increase.  Surely we are not so blind that we do not see the significance of that, and should we not act accordingly?  Therefore should we not exempt Shannon, Cork and the other airports I have mentioned from this situation and allow them enter a more competitive scene because there will be competition anyway?</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta say that this happened at Shannon in response to a more competitive fare structure and that it was a welcome development.  I agree thoroughly.  Aer Rianta will be looking for a more competitive fare structure.  They greatly regret that the situation there is not more competitive.  They believe that because we are not more competitive our airports are losing out.  This is an example of one airport that is more competitive in a given year and all credit is due to the Minister for helping to make it more competitive by not blocking the new entrants which is what happened in earlier years.  He allowed some competition at least in terms of fares.  There is a spectacular increase and that situation could apply in all our airports all the time.</P>
    <P>Would there not be an increase of at least 17 per cent in British and continental traffic into Shannon and all other airports if there was competition?  Of course there would and that would be to the benefit of the country.  There was not a major upheaval when this was allowed in respect of transatlantic traffic but why can we not do the same in respect of all traffic and all our airports?  The Minister may not wish to make the change in relation to Dublin but that is unfair to Dublin because that airport would take more traffic if it got it.  It is unfair to impose <Col N="1868" /> the restriction on Shannon, Cork and the other airports who could do with many times the business they are doing now and who are only utilised to a small proportion of their capacity.</P>
    <P>The lesson we should learn from this is that the liberal regime in respect of charters to Shannon promoted by tourist interests and the pro-competition policies of the US Government and airlines, with credit supported by the Minister in the past year, is the way forward for Shannon but Shannon's European traffic will not grow while present policies which are so different from Atlantic policies apply there.  Ministerial interventions against US carriers serving European points onward from Shannon mean that these services cannot develop.  Aer Lingus, though protected by the Minister, have been withdrawing from direct services to the Continent from Shannon and from Cork.  The desirable development for Shannon is that it would become a hub in the US system of hubs and spokes. We need as many services as possible to Britain and Europe direct from Shannon for passengers and also in the area of freight feeding for transatlantic services but this will not happen if the pressure on carriers to charge high fares on the airport's European services is maintained.</P>
    <P>A recent paper to the Regional Studies Association by Donal Dineen of the NIHE, Limerick included the comment that it is well known that eastbound traffic from Shannon makes London, not to mention central Europe, quite inaccessible to time-conscious business users because of poor scheduling of flights. Removal of Shannon from the scope of the Bill would help that airport's case in the freight area also.  I had intended saying that projects such as Federal Express could then go ahead but I was very distressed to hear the Minister say this afternoon that that company have apparently decided to locate the hub of their European operation in Brussels.  As the Minister spoke in a low tone, I am not sure that that is what he said, but if it is the case I am very disappointed <Col N="1869" /> because the loss involved for this country is huge.</P>
    <P>Shannon was absolutely ideal for that operation and it is surprising to find Federal Express go so far into Europe.  Brussels in terms of time is about one hour and 15 minutes east of Shannon and this means much additional distance and fuel usage.  Shannon's geographical location is ideal, so it is a profound loss that this operation is siting its operation elsewhere. I understand there is one other smaller body of that kind who have indicated at least some interest in Shannon and I trust that since we appear to have lost Federal Express every possible effort will be made to obtain the United Parcels operation.</P>
    <P>Shannon seems to me to be ideal as a hub for freight coming from North America, but anyone operating such a service and their customers would not welcome the prospect of being bound by the legislation which is now before the House. The contrast between a 17 per cent increase in transatlantic traffic and no increase in European and British traffic at Shannon is remarkable.  It occurred because the western route across the Atlantic is price competitive and the eastern routes are not.  The experts in this field, Aer Rianta, leave no one in any doubt as to which policy they prefer. They have set it out clearly in their annual report for 1984, which was recently published.</P>
    <P>In 1978 Cork Airport handled 260,000 passengers on its international services. By 1983 this had dipped to 227,000 and last year it increased slightly to 243,000. Thus there has been seven continuous years of zero growth at that airport.  That is a serious matter.  The international passenger figures at Cork are lower in 1984 than they were in 1978.  There are few if any airports in Europe in that position. The growth in most European airports has been phenomenal.  I am afraid it is the kind of policy enshrined in this Bill which is the obstacle to expansion.  Aer Rianta feel the same way.  In their annual report they stated that Cork Airport has the plant and manpower today to handle increased traffic without any significant <Col N="1870" /> increase in costs.  It should be said that every credit is due to the managers of Cork Airport for cutting expenditure by 16 per cent in 1984 to bring the airport close to a break even position.  To ensure this break even position in 1985 the House should support this amendment and allow freedom of competition and new entrants on to the routes into Cork.</P>
    <P>The various other airports are ones to which the level of fares deemed desirable by the Minister will be subject to what is set out in the Bill, but they will be unable to sustain scheduled services.  They gain nothing from present policy and will be no worse off if the amendment is passed. Waterford is ideally situated for a low cost link to South Wales and the Minister should not stand in the way of such development simply because he is told by the major airline in Ireland that they do not want any international service from any other Irish airline.</P>

      <P>Their ability to stop outside airlines is rather more limited than their ability to stop Irish ones.  One would like to see an airport like Sligo utilised to a far greater extent than it is at present.  There are prospects of Galway being expanded.  Further money has been made available to it and that will make it a more attractive place; but when that happens why should it be subject to all these rules and regulations?  It will still be a small airport.  It is the same with Farranfore, although that has no scheduled services.  What is lost by excluding it, even from the Minister's point of view? I am one of many people who thought Connacht Regional Airport should not have been started, but since it is for the most part already built I presume it will be used and we should try to make the best use of it we can.  If the ordinary cartel rules which will be underwritten by this Bill are to apply to it we should look at some of the figures.  The ordinary return fare from Dublin to London is £204, but <Col N="1871" /> from London to Connacht Regional Airport in County Mayo is a journey of about 50 per cent further in terms of miles.  One would assume that if the rules in this Bill apply the same kind of fare structure will apply.  Add 50 per cent to £204 and the figure is £304 approximately, which would be the ordinary return fare between Connacht Regional Airport and London.  That is not attractive and will not generate much business there.</P>
      <P>I suggested before to the Minister that exemption of the Mirabel Airport outside Montreal from the ordinary rules worked wonders for it and transformed an under-utilised airport into one which is now extensively used.  The controls in regard to fares were removed and people were allowed to come in subject only to safety and other regulations of that kind.  It made a vast difference to the airport and it could do the same for Shannon, Cork and any of the other smaller airports.  I do not know why we do not see our future in terms of growth or why we have a defensive attitude all the time, saying it is necessary to have regulation, protection and monopoly, instead of going out and competing, bring in business, surviving and prospering on additional business rather than surviving but not prospering on regulation and the protection of monopoly. That is wrong.  There is a glorious opportunity in this amendment to have a different kind of approach for all our airports other than Dublin.  It would be to the benefit of all of them and to the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>I have power under section 3 of the Bill to exclude an airport if I feel it is appropriate.  I could not exercise that power in respect of external flights except by agreement with other countries with whom we have bilateral air agreements.  We would be in breach of our international commitments under the bilateral agreements if we deregulate certain airports just like that.  However, I have power to do what the Deputy suggests provided, in respect of external flights, we get agreement from our bilateral partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> In relation to some of the regional airports &mdash; Sligo and Waterford are cases in point &mdash; there are very few applications for services but when there are they are usually accompanied by the maximum fares they think they can charge together with a request for a subsidy.  It sounds very grand and exciting to deregulate these airports, but the fact is that even if we did it in respect of internal flights it would not attract the kind of business Deputy O'Malley seems to think it would.  There is effectively no restriction on internal services out of those airports. There are many local bodies in those areas seeking airlines to provide services but they have proved time and again not to be viable.</P>
    <P>In relation to Shannon we have given to any American or other carrier who wants it Fifth Freedom rights out of Shannon onwards to Europe but none of them has taken that up.  It is very rare to offer such rights, but we have done so and they were not taken up.  We have given approval to Dan-Air to operate the London route but they have not taken it up.  If we accepted Deputy O'Malley's suggestion Shannon would suffer dramatically and that is a risk which I am not prepared to take even if I was not bound by bilateral constraints.  I have used my powers with regard to Shannon, as I have done in regard to London-Dublin, to keep fares down.  Various authorities had approved increases out of Shannon of between 15 and 20 per cent but I forced them down to sub-inflation increases, as I have done in almost every fare increase application which I received since I became Minister.  I oppose Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that we give Fifth Freedom rights to other carriers.  By &ldquo;other carriers&rdquo; I presume he means other than Aer Lingus.  So what?  It is in our interests to do this and it is regrettable that we give them to such a limited extent.  It is particularly regrettable that when we do give them, as was the case to Amsterdam and Prestwick, that they will have to stop exercising the Fifth Freedom right unless they <Col N="1873" /> increase their fares by 12 per cent.  This was stated in a letter from the Minister's Department, signed by a senior official, because the Minister did not approve of the company exercising those rights at the level which they were charging.  If they are not allowed to exercise these rights at the kind of fare level which they want but are forced to charge more, what use is that?  There is no big deal in giving Fifth Freedom rights out of Shannon.</P>

      <P>We should try to get more airlines to fly between Shannon and Amsterdam and let them charge as little as £100 if they like.  What loss is it to us? Why not let them do it?  A few years <Col N="1874" /> ago an airline was prepared to provide a service between Shannon and Amsterdam but they were told in a formal, official letter from the Minister, signed by a principal officer in charge of that area, that they would have to stop the service unless they increased charges by 12 per cent.  No matter what they were charging out of Shannon it was good to have that service and they should not have been stopped.  I have the letter here if the Minister would like to see it.  At present I understand that an airline is providing a service to Prestwick at a fairly competitive fare and I hope that we will not see the end of that as in the case of the service to Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister makes great play of the fact that Dan-Air have a licence to operate between Gatwick and Shannon.  They have but, as I pointed out here the last day, they do not now use it because they would have to go into the cartel.  They feel that there is not enough business to sustain cartel rates and that they will have to charge too much.  They said in their press statement of 3 May 1985 that, if a more liberal tariff regime existed, Dan-Air would welcome the opportunity of being able to introduce a more innovatory package of air fares for travel between the two countries.  They are more than anxious to get in here, but they are only prepared to do so at figures below those of the cartel and if they can compete.  They feel there would not be enough business if they had to charge the full cartel fare.</P>
      <P>How, therefore, does our national interest prescribe that we must retain the full cartel fare?  Our interest should be to get more people in here.  That is why Dan-Air are not using their rights into Shannon.  They would love to be able to do so, but they would have to charge too much.  If they could charge half the fare, there would be a daily Dan-Air service from Gatwick to Shannon which would be great for this country.  It is terrible that vested, local and institutional interests are strong enough to ensure that they come before the national interest.  It is a tragedy because the national interest loses out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;This Act applies to any rate or other charge, term or condition charged by an airline or other provider of ground services at any airport in the State in respect of passenger, baggage or cargo handling and the Minister is hereby empowered to fix maximum charges for such services and to disallow any conditions attached to the provision of such services as he considers not to be in the public interest.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I put down this amendment is to make it clear that any suitable body can provide these handling and ground services.  The Minister may say that at the moment, technically at least, anybody can; but there a monopoly of ground handling in this country.  The only people who act as ground handlers are Aer Lingus.  Some small airlines may do their own handling, but nobody does any handling for anybody else other than Aer Lingus.  This is not a very competitive situation.  It is well known that Aer Rianta, for example, are very keen to introduce either other ground handlers, in order to provide some competition, or to do the ground handling themselves.  It might be better in the circumstances if they did not become involved themselves, but, in practice there is a great deal to be said for other people being encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not hear very much about this subject here but it is of some importance in other countries.  The possibilities of abuse in an monopoly situation are widely recognised.  In the past there was a report in a European magazine, <i>The Kangaroo News</i> of May 1985, of a case <Col N="1876" /> between the European Commission and Olympic Airways which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The applicability of the Community Competition Rules to airlines could be tested if Olympic Airways, the state-owned Greek Airline, decides to appeal to the Court of Justice against a fine imposed on it by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission has demanded that Olympic provide it with details of its handling charges as part of a case that the airline has abused a dominant position in the market by raising its handling charges by 50 per cent.  Olympic has an monopoly of handling services at Greek Airports.</P>
    <P>But Olympic's defence is likely to be that there can be no infringement of competition rules if the relevant Treaty articles are not applicable to air transport.</P>
    <P>The Commission, whilst conceding that the rules have not been applied, believes them nevertheless to be applicable and would like a straightforward judgment from the court to this effect.</P>
    <P>That is a very interesting case.  If it is brought to the court and if the imposition by the Commission of a fine is disputed, the decision will be of great interest.  If it is not appealed, the decision will apply and this would presumably apply here also.</P>
    <P>Charges of this kind for ground handling account for 12.2 per cent of the cost of an airline ticket on average in Europe, according to EC Memorandum No. 2, page 25.  Therefore the amount of money at stake is not trivial.  It would comprise £25 on a Dublin-London ticket.  Probably as important is the fact that passenger or baggage handling monopolies are restrained from competition and provide incumbents with a lever.  We know this can be used to deter new entrants and to prevent the introduction of new services.  I referred to that instance the last day and since then, in addition to the Dan-Air case, another instance of this <i>vis-à-vis</i> an Irish company has come to my notice. Some very interesting documentation in relation to the matter has also come to <Col N="1877" /> my notice which I can go into if and when the occasion demands.  It is likely that the operation of these services at Irish airports does not meet the commercial criteria set by the Restrictive Practices Commission and often would not be tolerated in other lines of business.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Minister to show his interest in competition and in the interests of consumers generally by regulating these charges in the public interest and to ensure that there is competition between the suppliers of the services.  We know what happened in the recent Dan-Air case on the Dublin-London route.  We now hear from Dan-Air that they did not proceed with a formal filing of their fare after, as they put it, &ldquo;consultation with other carriers on the route&rdquo;.  We know exactly what that means and it has been confirmed to me from several sources since.</P>
    <P>The difficulty Dan-Air had in regard to the computer booking facilities if they were to take certain steps appears to be an echo of the difficulty that a small Irish airline had in relation to their computer facilities.  Because the computer facilities were held by Aer Lingus the small Irish airline had to go to the High Court to seek a declaration that they should be entitled to continue to avail of those services. Under the agreement the High Court referred it to an arbitrator who held that the service could not be withdrawn from them if they were already using it.</P>
    <P>That opens up a whole field in regard to computer booking facilities and ground handling service facilities which arise under this amendment.  This is very interesting and disturbing.  In getting confirmation on these matters the last day it was brought to my attention what had happened in the Irish case.  Since that had gone to court, it is a very much more public matter than the Dan-Air case which had not gone to any court.  For that reason it was surprising to see the vehemence of one of the denials particularly when, as it was put to me by people who knew the full facts, some of those who made the denials know that their <Col N="1878" /> denials are wrong.  I will not go into any of the documentation in that case unless I have to, and if I have to I will have great pleasure in revealing what goes on behind the scenes in Ireland in relation to these matters which are the subject of this amendment.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable if there was some form of competition.  That would not entail any unemployment because some of those working as existing handlers could be employed by different handlers. That would be in the public interest. That view is shared very strongly by organisations like Aer Rianta, Bord Fáilte and others.  The Minister may say Aer Rianta already have the power at the moment and that, technically at least, other people can act as handlers.  I agree that they can, but the fact is that none of them does.  It is not healthy, but we have a further instance of a monopolistic situation in regard to that aspect of our air services also.  Could I make reference in this context, because it is relevant to the statement made on 1 May last by Mr. Tony Ryan, founder of Guinness Peat Aviation, reported as follows:</P>
    <P>The aviation industry is showing steady growth and evolving from its traditional monopolistic and regulated nature into a commercial business.</P>
    <P>That sentence sums up the philosophy which should infuse Irish aviation policy generally.  Indeed, Mr. Ryan's own success and the success of his company in becoming in a short time the leading company in its field in the world demonstrates the sound economic basis for such an approach.  It is distressing therefore to find that our chief airline, Aer Lingus, and the Minister and his Department are so anxious to achieve the direct opposite of this approach by increasing rather than decreasing the traditional monopolistic protected and regulated nature of the aviation business in Ireland today.  It is time the Minister, and the Department and our State airline realised that they cannot continue in many of these areas to swim against the tide and that our national interest in the broadest sense requires the adoption of policies which <Col N="1879" /> will lead to a maximisation of access to Ireland rather than to further control and regulation which will inevitably prove damaging, both to the economy at large and the interest of the individual airline users.  It may be that the Minister will tell me that these powers exist already.  If it is the case that there could be other handlers, that Air Rianta could act as handlers if necessary, that is grand.  But could we have some active encouragement to people to act in that capacity so that we would not have a repetition of the situation which we had in at least one aspect of the recent Dan-Air problem and at least one aspect of the recent Avair difficulty?</P>

      <P>Here Deputy O'Malley is proposing, against the normal run of his argument, to give me extra powers and is asking for extra regulations.  I do not want that.  It is not necessary at all. Any airline coming into Ireland can do their own handling, for a start.  That is not so, for instance, in Italy or in Greece. It is also open to Aer Rianta to appoint other handlers than Aer Lingus.  I cannot see any merit whatever in the proposal being made by the Deputy.  It runs counter to the philosophy that he has been expressing on this Bill since last year. That philosophy I do not dispute, but the practical details I hotly dispute.  I am very much in favour of liberalisation in this area, but it has to be multilateral.</P>

      <P>I am giving him power to enable handlers to operate.  It may be that the power is there already.  I am not <Col N="1880" /> talking about people handling for themselves, but about those handling for outsiders. It is perfectly clear to anyone who reads this debate that I am endeavouring to generate competition in an area where there is not at the moment competition. I do not see anything inconsistent in that with what I have said already.  I have spent all this debate trying to encourage competition, deploring the lack and absence of it in many respects in our transport and re-echoing what Commissioner Sutherland has said.  I would like to see done here what he is trying to do in terms of competition.  I regret very much that the Irish Government are holding out against it.  I wish they would not continue with these provisions.  It is not just in terms of sales of airline seats alone that one can see a lack of competition. It is in these other areas which enable a particular airline to preserve a monopoly in a way that they would not have if they did not also have a monopoly, in practice, of things like ground handling, computer booking facilities and so on.</P>

      <P>I accept very much that Deputy O'Malley is in favour of more competition &mdash; so am I.  We just differ on the way that should be achieved. He has been extremely consistent in that. I have no doubt that the motivation behind this amendment is also to increase competition.  But I cannot see how, in practice, that would work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggests that I take extra regulatory powers.  I think he will agree that many of his earlier contributions have tended to suggest that where I am taking regulatory powers I am going to misuse them and have higher charges, tariffs and fares.  In this situation I do not need those extra powers.  First, all airlines are free to do their own handling. Secondly, Aer Rianta are empowered to select different handlers from their present ones.  There is plenty of competition. It should be said that a similar situation appertains in the United Kingdom. Aer Lingus are the major handlers for the British Airport Authority in Heathrow. They also have major handling contracts <Col N="1881" /> in New York against competition.  The fact that they have maintained the contracts in Ireland against competition does not mean that there is no competition, or cannot be.  There can.  The power suggested here is not necessary.</P>

      <P>As in other matters, I do not appear to have succeeded.  There is no encouragement for that.  In other major airports there are often six, eight, ten or 12 different handling firms.  There is plenty of competition.  If you are dissatisfied with one, you can go to another. That does not operate here.  There is only one firm handling for outsiders, leaving aside airlines handling for themselves. There is no competition.  I am also making the point that because that is the case it gives them an inordinate power in terms of access to this country.  It is clearly recognised by Aer Rianta that that is so.  They have made no secret of it.</P>
      <P>Everybody desires to have competition on the ground in this field of activity.  This is the field of activity, incidentally, in respect of which Aer Lingus made a denial of what I said the last day.  As I pointed out, they did not make any denial in respect of my reference to the computer situation.  I have rechecked these matters and have no reason whatever to doubt the accuracy of what I have said.</P>

Indeed, they could do the handling themselves. They could do that in Shannon, in Cork, in Dublin, or in all three airports.  I do not see the problem.  I do not see that this power is necessary and I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1) (a), line 5, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It seems that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; at the beginning of this section should be replaced by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  While &ldquo;may&rdquo; is there it is optional for the Minister for Communications to require an airline to give the notices that are referred to in this section in relation to their tarriffs.  I would dislike a situation in which one airline or more than one may be required to give these notices while another airline may not be so required.  It should be made clear that either all or none will be affected.  We have to keep reminding ourselves that this Bill was described here last June as an emergency Bill, one that had to be passed in a matter of days or enormous problems would arise and huge damage would be done.  Yet, here we are 11 months later and we find one of the main provisions is within the discretion of the Minister rather than obligatory.  It is very difficult to see how this could have been considered an emergency at any stage.</P>
      <P>Much depends on the fact that we have not an independent civil aviation authority. We have a form of conflict of interest which is very unsatisfactory and which is beginning to engage the minds of people to a fair extent.  When the regulatory authority is also the State commercial authority, it is very important that the exercise of powers of market regulation by a Minister and a Department who are also in charge of an airline in the last resort should be seen to be exercised in a way in which there could be no conflict of interest.  Therefore, perhaps the element of discretion should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in <Col N="1883" /> this section emphasises the discretionary nature of the powers I am proposing to take in the Bill.  As I indicated previously, it is not my intention, for example, to regulate charter fares.  Similarly, use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; will leave me or succeeding Ministers with the latitude necessary to accommodate such liberalisation measures as may come about in the context of the EC or otherwise.  Substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would introduce an element of compulsion that would be entirely inappropriate and in conflict with the thrust of Deputy O'Malley's arguments in relation to the Bill and would eliminate the flexibility which I am trying to provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately we have not got flexibility.  The Minister tells us he is trying to provide for it but I can reasonably ask where is this flexibility? We have a situation where you can operate in and out of this country provided you are in a cartel.  We do not have flexibility. The Minister read out something which I did not hear entirely but which seemed to me not to be relevant to the point I am trying to make.  If these powers are applied only to some airlines or air carriers, I ask why should that be?  Why not apply it to all of them?  The Minister read out something but it did not deal with the point as far as I could see.  In view of the fact that in a sense he is responsible for the commercial welfare of an airline and is also the regulatory authority for aviation, would he not agree that he should act the same way for all airlines rather than acting one way for one airline and another way for another airline?</P>

I think it would be a mistake to accept the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; because that would be an even tighter wording and would be giving tighter control than the Deputy wants.  If we qualify the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; by saying we cannot discriminate between carriers I think that would have the desired effect.  We will bring in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 21, to delete &ldquo;contained&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;contained: provided that the Minister shall not make a decision under this section in relation to the airline tariff before the day which is twenty-one days after the day on which particulars of the airline tariff are entered in the register pursuant to section 5 of this Act, or the day immediately following the expiration of the period specified in the relevant notification under subsection (4) of this section, whichever is the later&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment requires the Minister to refrain from taking a decision on any tariff proposal until a specific period not less than 21 days has elapsed since its inclusion in the register.  The purpose of this provision is to give the public and interested parties an opportunity to make representations to the Minister on aspects of particular airline tariff proposals submitted.  However, this provision does not impose any restrictions on airlines selling particular tariff proposals <Col N="1885" /> within this period.  Selling of tariffs subject to Government approval is not an offence under section 5 unless the Minister has specifically prohibited their sale by way of temporary direction under section 4.</P>
    <P>It should be clear the amendment does not preclude the Minister from reacting quickly in appropriate circumstances to disapprove or modify a particular airline tariff.  For instance, the Minister is permitted within the 21 day period to notify an airline of his intention to refuse or modify any airline tariff submitted so as to allow him to make his decision on the 21st day if he so wishes.  He may also have recourse to section 4 which allows him, by the issue of a temporary direction, to prohibit the sale of tariffs in order to prevent any abuse of the concession to airlines and intermediaries, allowing sale subject to Government approval.</P>

      <P>I should like more clarification from the Minister about what can happen within that 21 days.  This may be relevant to the amendment we have been dealing with a few moments ago.  Will it be the case that there will be a totality of information available for all airlines regarding proposals and fares during that interregnum so that judgment can be made as between how one company are proposing to charge and the others?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pro-consumer move in order to allow the public or interested parties to make submissions to the Minister within 21 days of a filing, to make points for or against that particular filing.  In normal circumstances, if the airline so wishes, it is envisaged that they will be able to go ahead with that fare pending ministerial approval.  That is common practice, that they can sell fares subject to Government approval.  It would not be our intention normally to intervene unless there was gross abuse, and if there was we could use the power in section 4.  I do not envisage us distinguishing between airlines in this respect; they would all be treated exactly the same.  I think that was the point Deputy Wilson made.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to follow the reasoning behind the Minister's amendment, purporting to put a straitjacket on himself in imposing this 21 day period.  One can visualise a situation in which a given tariff might be entirely excessive and require immediate action.  If that is so, why leave the thing running for 21 days?  Why impose that burden?  It could be that in the normal course the Minister might well wish to do that but his reasoning for straitjacketing himself rather escapes me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I have power under section 4 to make a temporary order if anybody is grossly abusing the 21 day period.  It is desirable that we have a period of time within which interested parties can make representations in relation to a particular filing.  I do have the power under section 4 to intervene immediately should there be any gross abuse of the 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should there be an obligation imposed by the Minister on himself to do that?  If a Minister feels that it is appropriate that a certain length of time should elapse there is nothing to stop him doing it; he does not have to take a decision within a particular time. Why is he saying that he must make it within a particular period?  It could be that seven days would be adequate, that 14 days would be adequate.  The Minister may well feel it is appropriate to leave it for a month, two months or whatever.  It does not require an amendment of the Bill to say that he may defer it, pending making soundings, inquiries or whatever. Here is a case where he provides that he must not within 21 days make a decision. He is not obligated to make it within 21 days anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, I am not, but during such longer time as I take, the airline can continue to operate the filing, whatever it is.  This is a desirable move. Deputy Taylor describes it as putting myself in a straitjacket.  It is true, it is a certain control on myself in response to <Col N="1887" /> some of the legitimate concerns expressed by people who have commented on the Bill.  It is intended to give the consumer a certain chance to make representations in relation to filings.  At the same time it is universal practice to allow airlines to file fares and to sell those fares there and then subject to Government approval.  Were we to say: no, there cannot be any change in filings until I approve them we would be in breach of international practice.  Here we are allowing a minimum 21 day period &mdash; it is not a maximum, it is a minimum period of 21 days to allow consumer and other interests, if they so wish, to make representations or comments on the filing and then we take a decision.  I think it constitutes a sensible and good move.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the point. I think Deputy Taylor was making the point that perhaps they should not make any alteration until a decision was taken by the Minister.  I am saying no, that they should be able to make the change subject to Government approval because that is universal practice.  Certainly it happens all over the world.  However, if it was a grossly outrageous proposal &mdash; suppose somebody pushed up their fares by 20 per cent at a time when inflation was running, as it is now, at approximately 5 per cent &mdash; I would have powers to intervene immediately to stop that if I so wished.  The normal position would be that a filing would be made; they could charge that fare immediately, subject to Government approval and without prejudice to whatever was the ultimate decision, having given the consumer at least 21 days to make representations.</P>

He is proposing a very much lower fare. I have the cutting here.  I think he is proposing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I second that proposal but I would say that Mr. Branson has as much chance of flying Dublin-London at £36 as I have of winning this year's Derby.  For that reason I want to ask the Minister, if Mr. Branson, or somebody like him, appears on the scene and files a fare which the Minister, Aer Lingus or some of his other advisers regard as too low, will he allow that fare the powers he says he has under section 4, or does this use of the temporary powers apply only to fares that he thinks are too high?</P>

      <P>No, it applies both ways, as do all the provisions of this Bill. It is in order to prevent the charging of fares that are too high or fares that are too low, where they would be disruptive. The intention would be to use the temporary powers under section 4 in the case of a very disruptive fare only.  I am sure this amendment is greatly welcomed by all consumer interests.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 21, <Col N="1889" /> after &ldquo;contained&rdquo;, to add &ldquo;, provided always that any airline tariff shall be regarded as complying with the Minister's approval if it is within a zone of reasonableness, that is, if it is within 25 per cent. above or below the figure approved by the Minister for a similar service on a particular route&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to add words to the end of subsection (2) to which the words have just now been added by the Minister's amendment, which in broad terms would allow what is called a zone of reasonableness in terms of charging fares above or below a particular fare that has already been approved for a similar service.  That would allow an element of price competition which one does not get now on the vast majority of routes in and out of Ireland to the detriment of Irish tourism and other economic interests.</P>
    <P>This concept is not one that I dreamed up myself.  I took it from the EC Commission's Memorandum II where it is advocated by the Commission, on page 31 of that document.  A zone of reasonableness is a pricing range within which airlines can establish their tariffs freely without seeking Government approval.</P>
    <P>Memorandum II goes on, in page 31, to state:</P>
    <P>It seems to the Commission that this concept has considerable merit in the Community context.</P>
    <P>The EC describe how their proposal would operate.  I quote from the memorandum, on page 32, which states:</P>
    <P>If the fare proposal was an individual fare and a dispute arose between governments, the governments would be expected to consult each other and seek agreement.  If this proved impossible, in the end the country of origin would be permitted to go ahead unless the country of destination accepted two zones of flexibility for the route in question.</P>
    <P>The drafting of my amendment may not be exactly perfect but I am trying to adapt EC concepts or law to the Irish context rather than using the Irish or English way <Col N="1890" /> of drafting these matters.  This concept of zones of reasonableness unfortunately has not appeared in Irish aviation regulations before.  It should.  As the Commission says, &ldquo;this concept has considerable merit in the Community context&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today he was all for Memorandum II but nobody else would support it.  The British and Dutch, for example, regard it as hopeless because it does not go nearly far enough and the Irish are identified as one of those who will not adopt it because it goes too far. The Minister would be a fair bit along the road if he accepted this amendment, not necessarily in the precise words in which I have it.  It may be possible to dress it up in slightly more formal, more European terms if necessary.  He would certainly be a fair bit along the road towards the current movements in Europe if he accepted the whole idea of zones of reasonableness.</P>
    <P>It happened in America a long time ago.  It was one of the steps towards deregulation. There is very strong feeling in Europe towards it.  Mr. Sorenson is very keen on it and, as far as I can see, it would be something which would accord pretty precisely with the thinking of Commissioner Sutherland on this matter.  He has said that if the Council of Ministers are not prepared to adopt this by the end of the year he will have to consider withdrawing the memorandum and implementing it directly by the Commission by its powers under Articles 169, 85 and 86.</P>
    <P>The way this would work in practice&mdash; this is why I consider it is very attractive for here &mdash; is that if a particular fare is set on a particular route at, for example, £200, somebody is entitled to come along and charge another fare on the same route which cannot be more than 25 per cent higher and cannot be more than 25 per cent lower.  Therefore you cannot get outrageously high figures and you cannot get outrageously low figures, but you can get a choice for the consumer.  If we assume the fare I am talking about is £100, the alternative fare could be somewhere between £75 and £125.  That could be done without having to go to the <Col N="1891" /> trouble of getting approval for it from the Department of Communications.  It would be done without consultation with anyone else on the route.  It would give a reasonable choice to the consumer and it would introduce a reasonable element of competition.  It would also get rid of this cartel situation in which everyone charges exactly the same for precisely the same service subject to the same terms and conditions.  This has resulted in one of our main routes out of the country being chosen by Mr. Branson because it was so high priced.  I have the newpaper cutting.  It is from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 May, which stated that Virgin Atlantic wanted to introduce a £36 one way Dublin-London shuttle.  It also stated:</P>
    <P>The chairman of Virgin Atlantic, Mr. Richard Branson said yesterday that the company had chosen the Dublin-London route because it was &ldquo;one of the most highly priced routes in the world&rdquo;.  He said that the company had already been in touch with Bord Fáilte and had received a &ldquo;very favourable response&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the old chesnut, but I am afraid it is not something that will stand up for the future because, if that is the case, there must be this enormous subsidisation; and any airline which has not an enormously profitable route like Dublin-London should logically close down, but that is not the case.  I <Col N="1892" /> would remind Deputy Taylor that there are other routes which are loss-making at the moment because they are not subject to competition and the cartels tie the fares.  If open competition was allowed on them they might not be loss-making at all.  For example, for years and years British Airways justified the very high fares they were charging on the London-Glasgow route by saying they had to fly to the Shetlands, Aberdeen and other places like that which are loss-making and they needed the very big profits they were making on London-Glasgow.  Finally, the British Government said to them &ldquo;We are throwing London-Glasgow open to competition.  You can stay on the route but you will have to compete&rdquo;.  They did and they also continued on many of the other routes which they suddenly found they could manage if they used different equipment and so on, and other people came in on some of the other routes.</P>
      <P>One of the features of air transport at the moment is that you will get a lot of new operators.  Some of those will go out of business.  There is no great tragedy in that.  At least competition will be afforded where there is not any at the moment.  The limits were much higher within the United States than those I am talking about.  I am only talking about 25 per cent above or below.  Much higher limits than that were introduced in the United States but this will give some reasonable element of competition.  It is precisely in accordance with what the EC Commission want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley, making a point about competition in the UK, said that some of those airlines would go out of business and it would be no great tragedy if they did.  That may be so in the UK where there is a market of 60 million people which can sustain, even temporarily, a number of airlines.  If one of them go there will still be a number left; but because of our size, we have only one national airline.  We could not sustain more than that.  That is a central point to the whole debate because transport economics, as Deputies will appreciate, are very much affected by volume and <Col N="1893" /> numbers.  What is good in a place like the United States with more than 200 million people might not be practical in a small place like Ireland, Finland or Belgium. What is good in the UK would not necessarily work here.  I understand that all the internal routes in the UK are now very seriously loss-making and that is as a result of the free competition.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment I should like to state that the concept of approved tariff zones is currently under consideration at EC Council and within the European Civil Aviation Conference.  Because of the complexity of the topic, discussions on the wisdom and practicability of introducing such a concept are ongoing. During the course of the Irish Presidency of the Community in the latter half of 1984, I am glad to say that, as a means of introducing greater flexibility &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will start again for the benefit of the Deputy.  The concept of approved tariff zones is currently under consideration at EC Council and within the European Civil Aviation Conference. Because of the complexity of the topic, discussions on the wisdom and practicability of introducing such a concept are ongoing.  During the course of the Irish Presidency of the Community in the latter half of 1984, I am glad to say that, as a means of introducing greater flexibility in this area, member states agreed that a fare zone system could in principle be contemplated, though the main parameters of any zone system remain to be described.  Work on this aspect is currently proceeding under the auspices of the Italian Presidency.  Having regard to these ongoing developments it would be rather premature for Ireland to implement a specific tariff zonal arrangement in the absence of wider international agreement on its terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, I would have reservations about inserting a specific percentage figure in legislation, even if there were <Col N="1894" /> currently agreement on a particular zonal concept.  Any such international agreement could be changed which would involve extensive time and effort in enacting new legislation.  As I am satisfied that the definition of &ldquo;airline tariff&rdquo; in the Bill is broad enough to accommodate any zonal arrangements to emerge from current international discussions, I believe that there is no need to incorporate a specific zonal concept in the present Bill.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear what the Minister had to say in relation to the amendment, but unfortunately it is not very reassuring for him simply to say that progress is being made in this direction but that he does not at the moment propose to implement it.  This is not some sort of unique thing that I just dreamed up out of the blue.  This is, as closely as one can do so, worded from <Col N="1895" /> Memorandum II.  Assuming that zones of reasonableness come in in Europe &mdash; that is not a very major assumption to make; it is very likely to happen, either because the Council will adopt it or, if they fail to adopt it by the end of the year, that the Commission will impose it &mdash; is it not likely that whatever does apply in Europe will be on the lines of what the Commission recommend?</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister is telling me that he has no objection to this except that it is always possible that the specific percentages might be changed or might be different at some time in the future, that we will have to have amending legislation and that anyway he thinks the definition of &ldquo;tariff&rdquo; is wide enough to cover it.  If it is, that is all right; but will he indicate his agreement in principle now to the introduction of zones of reasonableness of plus or minus 25 per cent out of Ireland and into this country?  If he accepts that in principle there will be plenty of airlines, including new entrants into the market, who would be prepared to operate on that basis.  They will operate on the basis that they can charge not more than 25 per cent less than the existing fares.  It would make quite a difference.  For example, it would reduce the ordinary basic London route fare from £204, which it is under the cartel arrangement, to £153.  That would be quite a boom to hard-pressed consumers in what Mr. Branson rightly describes as one of the highest priced routes in the world and which Bord Failte are very keen to see reduced.</P>
      <P>I am putting in figures the meaning of this idea of zones of reasonableness which the Minister, to his credit, seems to accept as a concept but which he does not seem to want to implement in the legislation.  Will the Minister, even if he does not want to write in 25 per cent as such in the legislation, give an indication that he will be prepared to allow airlines to operate within a zone of reasonableness of 25 per cent of the existing basic norm for certain routes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make <Col N="1896" /> arises from what we have been talking about in the context of the Commissioner's article.  I am not at all satisfied that the Commission are finding acceptance with the Council as of now.  The Commissioner's article is clear that he felt the Council were not going along with what the Commission want.  Until the political heads, Ministers in Council, accept it, then it has no chance of becoming effective.  From what Deputy O'Malley has said it seems to me that he is pinning all his hopes on what the Commission want done, but it is equally important that the House recognises that the political situation is dealt with by the Ministers and until they deal with it and accept it nothing can be done.</P>
      <P>In annex 2 (2) the zone of flexibility is mentioned.  It states that zone of flexibility means a pricing zone grouping together of air fares with similar characteristics within which double approval is not required.  It states that the range of the zone is calculated as a percentage of its upper limit.  Deputy O'Malley said that there was nothing sacrosanct about the 25 per cent figure.  From where did it come?  Was it just shoved in or was it debated in the context of the settling of air tariffs and fares?  If there is a question of 25 per cent below would the idea bear also the definition of 25 per cent above or what exactly is the significance of the 25 per cent?  As the Commission suggest, it should be defined.  On the right hand column of this we have the amended proposal for a Council directive for scheduled air transport between member states.  As such it is simply a suggestion. For that reason I would like a little more accuracy and definition as to where the flexibility applies.  Does it apply below or above, either of which is very important for competition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The zones of reasonableness concept would allow airlines to charge above or below a stated percentage. We pioneered this idea at a European Civil Aviation Conference in discussions between ECAC and the US and an agreement was reached with the <Col N="1897" /> US by the European Civil Aviation Conference allowing for zones of reasonableness which go from 125 per cent down to 55 per cent in certain circumstances. Deputy O'Malley asked me if, in principle, I agreed with the idea of zones of reasonableness.  I am in favour of it, but the details of these things have to be worked out at EC level and perhaps even at ECAC level.  Our existing legislation allows us to adopt, as part of airline tariffs, zones of reasonableness, as we have done in the case of the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy for the Minister to go on to the next logical step from what he has said in relation to these zones.  The Minister accepts the principle.  It may be necessary to change percentages from time to time, depending on developments in Europe or in other bodies.  The existing definition is wide enough to allow it and the only other thing that remains is for the Minister to agree to implement it.  I would withdraw my amendment like a shot if the Minister would agree, because it would not be necessary.  We would have this idea novel to Ireland introduced here, we would have competition and the cartel would be at least partially curbed. It is a very limited zone that I am proposing. On the basis of plus or minus 25 per cent the highest permitted fare would be only 1.7 times the lowest at a ratio of 125: 75, whereas the US zone, when they had it before they deregulated, from 30 per cent to 110 per cent of the reference rate, where the highest fare would therefore be 3.7 times the lowest.  The ratio here is quite small.  Would the Minister not indicate that he has no objection to this since he approves of it and agrees with the idea and that the existing legal definitions are wide enough to enable it to be implemented? It would be in our interest as a nation if it were done.  Would the Minister not say that we will have it beginning from 1 June on some routes at least to see what difference it makes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be thought that it would necessarily be in the best interests of Ireland if this was allowed.  A lot has been written about this subject and from what I have read &mdash; and I do not pretend to have read all the material that has been published on it &mdash; one has to look at the overall situation and not just look at one fare in isolation.  No doubt some zones of reasonableness will give a quick short sharp benefit on one route perhaps for one flight at peak times, but that might well not be repeated for flights that are required at less popular times.  Nor is there any guarantee that fares overall are going to be reduced or that the consumer will be any better off. The figures from the US on what happened there on deregulation seem to suggest the contrary.  The figures supplied to the Council of Europe, report document 5383, on the subject indicate that what happened in the five years following on deregulation was that the average fare increase was of the order of 46.4 per cent whereas in the five years preceding deregulation the average price increase was only 33.3 per cent.  That was at a time when the consumer price index in the five year period following on deregulation rose by 59.2 per cent, whereas in the five years preceding deregulation it rose by 44.9 per cent.  The indication there is that average fare increases operated to the detriment of the consumer following deregulation and not to his benefit.</P>

No country has done that, none of the great liberal aviation authorities which the Deputy so admires has done that.  I support the idea in principle.  We are working towards it at EC level and ECAC level and we will continue to do so.  I already have the power to make provision in airline tariffs for this, should agreement be reached, so the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Malley is superfluous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In considering an airline tariff submitted under this section, in addition to having regard to the interests of the air carrier by or on whose behalf the submission is made, the Minister shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the reasonable interests of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the other air carriers to which this Act applies, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the persons whom he considers will use the passenger service, or the mail or other cargo service, as may be appropriate, to which the proposed airline tariff will relate,</P>
      <P>(b)  the contribution capable of being made to the economy by the tourist industry by reason of the provision (subject to the need to maintain an air transport industry) of competitive airline tariffs,</P>
      <P>(c)  the necessity, having regard in particular to the public interest, of maintaining the continuity, range, frequency and standard of all or any of the following, namely, particular air services to, from or within the State, such air services generally or airport facilities associated with such air services,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  any representations or objections regarding the airline tariff which are made to him within the period mentioned in subsection (2) <Col N="1900" /> of this section (which representations and objections are hereby authorised to be made), and</P>
    <P>(e)  any air transport agreement for the time being in force, to which the State is a party and which the Minister considers relevant.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where under this section the Minister proposes either to approve of with modifications or to refuse to approve of an airline tariff, he shall notify in writing the air carrier or other person from whom the relevant submission was received under this section of his intention and of the reasons therefor and the notification shall state that within such period, beginning on the date of the notification as is specified in the notification (being a period of not less than seven days), representations and objections as regards the proposed refusal of modification may be made to the Minister by such air carrier (which representations and objections are hereby authorised to be made).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage various allegations were made that the Bill would restrict competition, lead to high air fares, damage tourism, endanger Shannon, be anti-consumer, etc.  The purpose of the new section 3 (3) is to require the Minister to have regard for certain specified criteria in assessing airline tariff proposals submitted to him for decision.  In practice the criteria specified have always been taken into account by the Minister in assessing fares, but it is considered useful to make explicit provision in law for these criteria in the interest of consumers, tourism, carriers, etc.</P>
    <P>The preamble and paragraph (a) of the new provision require the Minister to have regard to the reasonable interests of air transport users and of airlines.  It is reasonable for consumers to expect airline tariff structures to cater for all substantial categories of public demand for air services by providing a range of tariffs on terms which are clear, understandable and, above all, competitively <Col N="1901" /> priced.  In the case of airlines it is reasonable for them to expect approval of tariffs that will guarantee an economic return on their investment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) specifically provides that the Minister shall take account of the needs of the Irish tourism industry for competitive airline tariffs subject, of course, to the overall requirement of maintaining on an economic basis an Irish civil air transport industry.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) is intended to ensure that the broader public interest is not lost sight of in terms of the need for a broad range of air services to meet the needs of industry, economic development, exports, communications, etc., all of which are essential to a modern state. The reference to &ldquo;airport facilities&rdquo; is intended to provide a safeguard for airports like Shannon or Cork.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) requires the Minister to take account of any representations or objections which may be made to him by interested parties within the time period specified in the amendment to sub-section (2) arising out of the availability for public inspection of airline tariff proposals. Paragraph (e) makes clear that the actions of the Minister in determining tariffs must conform with the provisions of any relevant bilateral and multilateral air transport agreements to which the State is a party.  None of the provisions in the Bill conflicts with any of our existing international treaty obligations.</P>
    <P>The new sub-section (4) enshrines in the Bill explicit provisions requiring the Minister to notify his dissatisfaction to the relevant airline in circumstances where he intends either to modify or refuse to approve of an airline tariff.  The purpose of the provision is to give an opportunity, in accordance with the rules of natural justice, to airlines to make representations to the Minister in advance of his taking a decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the final arbiter.  However, the relevant international aviation agreements in most cases provide for inter-Governmental consultation where disapproval of fares results in dispute between two States, and, in the event of their failure to agree, the reference of the <Col N="1902" /> dispute to arbitration.  Of course, there is nothing to prevent an airline exploiting the common law by, for example, seeking to get an injunction or challenging the Minister's decision in a court on a specific point of law.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that there is a typographical error in the second last line.  The first word on that line is &ldquo;of&rdquo; and it should be &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In the sixth line, after &ldquo;carriers&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, operating on the same route or routes,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have three amendments down to the Minister's amendment.  The amendment in the Minister's name is of some significance. Last June we were told there was no need for any amendment of this kind, that this was an emergency measure and would have to go through the House in a matter of hours.  Now we have a whole rethink and suddenly the consumer matters as a result of this debate in this House on 27 June last.  Suddenly a whole lot of things about which I was derided last June matter and we are trying to appear-reasonable. The Minister's amendment goes part of the way to putting an appearance of reasonableness on the situation. It does not go very far, but in order to try to improve it, I tabled three additional amendments to it.  Deputy Wilson also <Col N="1903" /> has tabled an additional amendment and that is one I would agree with too.  The first two in my name would not be major amendments and what I have to say relates manily to the third one and to the amendment as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the first of these additional amendments I propose, in relation to taking into account the reasonable interest of other air carriers, to insert the words &ldquo;operating on the same route or routes&rdquo;.  This is because we have had instances of carriers who were not operating on the route concerned objecting violently to some noncartel airline coming in to operate on a different route.  In considering the reasonable interest of other carriers we should be referring only to other carriers operating on the route or routes concerned. A carrier not flying the route concerned should not be entitled to have his interests taken into account.  If the Minister would like details of instances of that kind I can quote some.  There was, for example, the Avair case before they were forced out of business.  If the changes I am proposing are made the general amendment of the Minister will be improved.  We would be thereby ensuring that some carrier is not given a kind of <i>carte blanche</i> right to have their interest taken into account irrespective of what route was involved and even if they were not operating on that route.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important amendment.  It arises as a result of the very strong consumer interest that was aroused at the time of the Bill's first appearance.  It is well to refer to the fact that a judge of the High Court stated clearly that an air company who were associated with a travel agency were in clear breach of what was intended in the Act and then the <Col N="1904" /> Supreme Court deemed that the company and the travel agency concerned had an arguable case.  That is what sparked off the legislation.  I said at the beginning of Committee Stage that if the due process of law had been followed, even allowing for delays in the law area being notorious, the whole matter would have been settled by now.  However, we must deal with what is here.  I said at the time also that this side of the House would be in support of the national airline.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to add my support to the motion tabled by my party concerning the state of the county roads.  First, I should like to quote from that infamous document, <i>Environment: Achievements Since December, 1982</i> which was published recently by the Minister.  This is a document which is long on statement and on intent rather than on achievement. The only achievement it seems to point to in relation to road development concerns the new plan put forward by the Government entitled, <i>Policy and Planning Framework for Roads</i>.  I quote from page 26 of the plan which outlines road development policy briefly as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the provision of an adequate inter-urban system for the major towns, ports and airports;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the elimination of traffic bottlenecks by the provision of by-passes for towns on national routes;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the reduction of urban congestion by providing new bridges, ring roads and relief roads;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the preservation, through proper maintenance, of existing and planned road investment; and</P>
      <P>&mdash; the improvement of road safety.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that there is no commitment there in relation to the vast majority of roads, which unfortunately are not regarded as national primary or national secondary roads.  In particular I would draw to the attention of the Minister of State who is present that this plan which is deemed to be such a major achievement for the Government has little or no significance for the area I represent.  I shall outline why it is irrelevant to my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Offaly the mileage of national roads is 11½.  In 1984 the allocation was £145,000 or approximately £13,500 per mile.  There are 77½ miles of national secondary roads in County Offaly and the allocation in 1984 was £1,280,000 or approximately £16,000 to £17,000 per mile.  On the other hand <Col N="1906" /> there are more than 1,150 miles of county and other main roads in the county which are not designated as national secondary routes.  The total allocation in that respect is a mere £563,417 or an investment of about £480 per mile.  That is in stark contrast to the allocation for the national primary and secondary routes.  Put simply, 84 per cent of the total road network in County Offaly attracts 34 per cent of the total funding for road development while only 16 per cent of the total road network attracts 66 per cent of the total funding from the State.</P>
    <P>It is my contention that the basic flaw in all this relates to the fact that there are no Stage grants being made available for county roads maintenance.  I ask the Government to support our motion on the basis that some of the most vociferous complainers in relation to the deterioration of our county roads are members of the Government parties at council level. As a result of the under-financing of the county roads system in Offaly, there is not even proper road maintenance.  Many of these roads have bog foundations and require the application of significant amounts in terms of maintenance.  The roads are surface dressed and figures I have obtained from Offaly County Council show that in 1982, 62½ miles of county roads, roads other than national primary or secondary roads, were surface dressed in the four engineering areas.  The corresponding figures were 62 miles in 1983 and a mere 28 miles in 1984.</P>
    <P>A member of Offaly County Council on the Fianna Fáil side and who is involved in employment with the county council informs us that the situation in the Birr engineering area for this year is that a mere three miles of the 150 miles of county roads will be surface dressed.  That means that there is a cycle of the county roads there being surface dressed once in 50 years and we all know that if a road is left without surface dressing for that length of time it is likely to have gone out of existence.  The under-financing by the Government of the county road network has brought about this catastrophic situation. There is no point in speaking here <Col N="1907" /> in broad terms about the major investment that is to be made in roads if the taxpayer is in the position where he has great difficulty in travelling to work because of the condition of the roads.  It is accepted by all the officials in Offaly County Council that the county roads in Offaly are in a dangerous state and will require a trebling of the present investment if they are to be maintained simply as county roads.  We are not talking about improving them but simply about maintaining them in their present state.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came to power the amount of money spent on county roads in Offaly in each of the four engineering areas has decreased in terms of the percentage of the total expenditure on all roads.  In the Birr engineering area in 1982, the expenditure was 7 per cent and this decreased in 1984 to 4.8 per cent.  In the Ferbane engineering area the expenditure was almost 6 per cent of the total expenditure and that figure decreased to 4.4 per cent in 1984.  The figure in respect of the Tullamore engineering area for 1982 was 6.85 per cent of the total expenditure on the roads in the county and in 1984 the figure was 4.4 per cent.  Likewise, in the Edenderry engineering area in 1982 the expenditure was 8.5 per cent approximately of the total and in 1984 that was reduced to 6.6 per cent.  Those statistics show clearly that the amounts of money being allocated to county roads is decreasing.  It is crazy that, while councillors in Offaly, have total discretion as to the expenditure of the total amount of money they are allocated, the only discretion they have in relation to how the money is spent, amounts to just 4 per cent of the total budget of Offaly County Council.  Grants are coming from central Government but we have sent requests to the Department asking that small amounts of that money that are going towards the maintenance of national primary and secondary roads be allocated for maintenance of county roads.  We, as councillors are not being given the power to decide where the money is to be spent.  It is farcical to talk about local authority reform if central <Col N="1908" /> Government are not prepared to give to councillors some say in how the money is to be spent, particularly in relation to the road network system.</P>
    <P>It seems that central Government lacks the confidence in local democracy to allow councils decide where the money is best spent.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil councillors in Offaly, I assure the Minister that the public money being spent on the road network system would be spent much better if we had discretion as to where it should be spent.  The vast majority of Fine Gael and Labour councillors would support this motion.  I am appealing to the Minister to be constructive in his approach to the motion and to give some assurance to the House that the people of Offaly and of the other areas represented here will be given the sort of funding they require.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear from the debate that has taken place on this motion last night and tonight that Fianna Fáil have no firm idea as to what their policy priorities for road development should be.  Some of the Opposition speakers were supportive of the major road improvement programme set out in our new road plan and wanted that fully implemented in addition to their so-called special programme for county roads.  Other Opposition speakers took a different view.  Deputy Byrne accused us, in our national road programme, of building speed tracks to impress officials from Brussels and suggested that we divert money away from the major road programme.  It is clear that Fianna Fáil, divided as they are, have not got their act together on this issue. At least this Government have a clear policy on road development and have had the honesty and integrity to spell it out in the new road plan published last January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, the Fianna Fáil contribution to the debate so far has been very poor and has generally been inadequately researched. Some of the contributions, notably those of Deputies Byrne and Calleary, have been more entertaining than illuminating.  However, I have managed <Col N="1909" /> to distil a few minor points from the mass of words spoken and I now propose to answer some of them.</P>

      <P>Various Opposition Deputies made the point that our road policy reflects a bias against rural Ireland. Deputy Byrne made the accusation that we were treating the people of rural Ireland as second class citizens.  I want to reject those suggestions with all the force at my command.  Our road policy is not anti-rural.  Our road policy is very carefully constructed to ensure the balanced economic and social development of all the country not for narrow sections of it. To suggest that a major road improvement programme which gives priority to the national routes is anti-rural is nothing short of rubbish and dishonesty.  If we are to promote industrial development outside the major centres of population, if we are to provide farmers with access to their most important markets or points of export, if we are to provide tourist access from our ports and airports to our main scenic attractions, we must have an adequate national network.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly Fianna Fáil have been deaf to the calls of bodies like the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Construction Industry Federation and the road haulier interests for an adequate national road system.  Neither can they be aware of the views of the CII on our new road plan.  Let me quote briefly from their newsletter of 19 March 1985, Volume 42, Number 20:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Confederation welcomes the Government policy decision stated in <Col N="1910" /> the new Road Plan &ldquo;Policy and Planning Framework for Roads&rdquo; to accord a higher national priority to the development of the road network, particularly the national routes, in recognition of their importance to the economic and social development of the country. The moneys being invested in these routes are of direct benefit to the entire national community, not just particular localities or regions.</P>
    <P>However, our policy is not only concentrated on national roads.  We are also providing funding for regional roads and for the improvement of county roads, including a special 75 per cent for county road bridges which we recognise as important to the preservation of the road network.  In 1985 the block grant, which includes provision for county road improvement at the discretion of the local authority, was increased by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>The impression has been created that virtually nothing is being spent on county roads.  The facts are that in 1983 the last year for which we have full returns £46 million was spent on county roads.  In that year, the first year in office of the present Government, we provided more money for county roads as a percentage of total funds than Fianna Fáil did while in office.  State grants accounted for 8.6 per cent of expenditure on county roads in 1983, while the average for the previous five years during most of which Fianna Fáil were in office was 6.5 per cent.  The facts speak for themselves and reveal this motion for what it is &mdash; a crude election time tactic and gimmick.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by Deputy Nolan that works on county roads could be regarded as productive investment to be financed by foreign borrowing, as recommended by the National Planning Board, is another example of the confused thinking of Fianna Fáil and I certainly hope it does not reflect their understanding of economic issues.  County road improvements would not qualify under the investment criteria set out in the planning board report.  Because of their low traffic volumes, expenditure on county roads would not be justified in cost benefit terms <Col N="1911" /> alone, Clearly, the planning board recommendation applied to national roads and to the type of major improvement projects listed in our plan which provide an economic return on investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not state that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  Last night, Fianna Fáil seemed to adopt a cavalier attitude to EC aid.  While the new road plan gives priority to national road investment in its own right, it is also the only road investment which can be used to absorb available EC aid.  To emphasise the importance of EC assistance let me quote a few figures.  In 1984, the Department spent £101.5 million on road improvement grants.  In that year, the EC gave a commitment of grant aid totalling £31.5 million, mainly from the Regional Fund.  In addition, the EIB gave commitments to loans totalling £37 million.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what was suggested by the Opposition, there is no realistic possibility of obtaining EC aid for county road improvements, with the exception of very limited FEOGA grants under the Western Package and a small amount of Regional Fund non quota aid for amenity roads as part of a wider, cross-Border package.  There is no possibility at all of obtaining EC aid for county road maintenance. If we are to continue to absorb our full quota of Regional Fund moneys and avail of the highest possible level of EIB loans we must rely on a substantial national road improvement programme as the basis for virtually all aid applications. One must ask the question: are Fianna Fáil proposing that we forego some of this EC aid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also talked about employment. The facts are that our accelerated road investment programme will generate substantial additional employment. State funded road employment in 1984 was estimated at 4,800.  This will, it is estimated, increase to 5,400 in 1985, to 5,700 in 1986 and to 5,900 in 1987 or in other words a 23 per cent increase <Col N="1912" /> between 1984 and 1987.  Spin off employment is expected to increase by 400 a year on average over the period.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke claimed yesterday that the Athlone bypass was developed by Fianna Fáil.  In fact, the application for the bridge order was made on 2 October 1981 but it was the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who on 15 March 1983 ordered the public inquiry and on 28 May 1984 the present Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, directed that the scheme should proceed. This Government and the previous Coalition of 1982 have provided £7.5 million to date for the scheme whereas Fianna Fáil provided less than £900,000 for preliminary expenses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hilliard mentioned a promise made by the Minister on his visit to County Meath on 11 March last but not yet delivered.  The Minister promised finance for an acceptable scheme at Slane Bridge and asked the council to prepare one as quickly as possible.  As soon as such a proposal is submitted to my Department the promise will be implemented.</P>
    <P>The clear implication of the Fianna Fáil arguments is that, without question and whether the taxpayer likes it or not, they will find more money to give to local authorities to finance county roads.  This is an ambitious boast for the party which, in 1978, forced through legislation against the vehement opposition of the present parties in Government, which placed greater limitations on local financial resources than any other measure in the history of Irish local government legislation.</P>
    <P>There have been amusing and cynical attempts from the other side of the House to suggest that the Local Government (Financial Provision) (No. 2) Act, 1983, promoted by this Government is at the root of local authorities' financial problems. The real culprit, as everybody knows, is the Fianna Fáil-sponsored Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978.  This purported to honour the commitment to remove domestic rates, but in reality it abandoned and disowned a parallel commitment by <Col N="1913" /> Fianna Fáil that local finances and services would not suffer as a result of domestic derating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was also promised by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1978 Act effectively removed all discretionary powers of local authorities to increase their own financial resources and substituted a straitjacket of central Government limitations. The effect of this straitjacket, in the years 1978 to 1982, was to depress the rate poundage levels of local authorities nearly 30 per cent below the growth in inflation.  As by far the largest programme relying on financing from local authorities' own resources, county road improvement and maintenance naturally bore the brunt of these Fianna Fáil inspired stringencies.</P>
      <P>When this Government came to power in December 1982, they found local authority finances in the crisis which I have described.  We immediately took three steps to improve local authority finances:</P>
      <P>&mdash;an additional £31½ million was made available to local authorities in rate support grant for 1983 compared with what Fianna Fáil had allocated them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 was enacted in July 1983 in order to widen local authority charging powers, thereby giving them access to additional revenue and improving local discretion and accountability;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Minister did not in 1983, or any subsequent year, use his power to limit rate increases.  Again, this has given local authorities much greater discretion over their own financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, the national plan announced the creation of a new farm tax, the revenues from which will accrue directly to local authorities.  This brief history of the respective records as regards local authority finances of Fianna Fáil and the present administration is a <Col N="1914" /> sobering but very necessary exercise. Fianna Fáil policies and actions in this area, while in Government, have been disastrous and have contributed more than any other single cause to the problems affecting county roads which they now deplore.</P>
    <P>We are now asked to believe that Fianna Fáil, naturally while in opposition, have found a solution which makes everything rosy once more in the local government garden.  The key to this solution, we are told, is a guaranteed statutory contribution which Fianna Fáil in government would make each year to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The cop-out perpetrated by Fianna Fáil in the 1978 Act should make us suspicious of any easy solutions offered by them now.  So to the Opposition spokesman on the environment, and indeed to his leader who also seems to be placing great weight on the Fianna Fáil statement of 22 February on local authority finances, let me put a few inconvenient points.</P>
    <P>The guaranteed Exchequer contribution to local authorities or the revenue sharing system which it seems to amount to, is a soft and doubtful option.  It suggests the availability of increased revenues to local authorities, but in reality it is not a new source of revenue at all; in so far as increased grants to local authorities are contemplated, every penny of these would have to be raised in increased central Government taxation or at the expense of other services.</P>
    <P>A guaranteed State contribution to local authorities is also a soft option, because it removes virtually all responsibility from local authority councillors and managers for raising their own revenues and all answerability in relation to spending them.  Fianna Fáil are implying by this proposal that local authorities want to abandon their financial responsibilities and throw all onus on to central Government, so jettisoning what is one of the cornerstones of local democracy.  If you talk to the general council of county councils, municipal authorities or to councillors from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, or Labour, it is clear that they are prepared to take on the responsibility of <Col N="1915" /> raising finance.</P>
    <P>A guaranteed State contribution to local authorities will not last for very long in the real world of government.  What Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, or indeed Cabinet, is going to assent for long that, uniquely among public service, local government receives or pre-empts a predetermined share of State revenues while health, social welfare, education and industrial promotion do not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am offending the Opposition, I will try to limit my criticism.  Finally, it is well known, and already noted in the ESRI Report on Local Finances of 1975, that revenue sharing systems like those proposed by Fianna Fáil can, because they are based on a general formula, give rise to a less economical allocation of resources to local authorities than would occur under a system of specific grants.  For this, and for the other reasons which I have cited, I urge Fianna Fáil to admit that the idea of a guaranteed contribution to local authorities is a non-runner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government can stand on their record in relation to road development. We are the first Government to provide a firm medium term commitment of road improvement finance which at the end of 1987 will be 52 per cent higher in money terms than the 1984 provision or about 31 per cent excluding inflation.  Not only did we promise the money but we are delivering on it.  We increased the block grant provision by 10 per cent in 1985, a substantial real increase.  We have published a new road plan which gives clear direction to road development and sets out a realistic and attainable programme of major improvement projects.  We have <Col N="1916" /> also set out a clear policy on private sector investment which we are actively encouraging.</P>
    <P>The new road plan gives potential investors a clear policy framework for assessing possible investments.  In the case of toll roads, the policy is as follows and I quote from paragraph 3.16 of the new plan:</P>
    <P>once constructed, the road will be a public road in the ownership of the local authority and subject to traffic management and other controls;</P>
    <P>the road will be designed, constructed and maintained to standards acceptable to the local authority and to the Department of the Environment; and</P>
    <P>the right of the private interest to collect tolls will be limited to an agreed period of years, with that right reverting to the public authorities at the end of the period.</P>
    <P>We have also made it clear that we will consider private sector loan financing proposals provided the terms are at least comparable with and preferably more favourable than those for Exchequer borrowing. In February we circulated financial and other interests with a document setting out our policy and identifying five potentially suitable toll roads.  The response to date has been most encouraging and I am hopeful that private funds will be available to supplement State investment.  As the House is aware, one toll proposal is already well advanced which involves over £20 million investment in a road and high level bridge linking the Navan Road and Lucan Road and forming part of the Dublin Ring Road.  These activities represent once again the Government's clear determination and purpose in relation to road development.</P>
    <P>This Government are being criticised for spelling out a policy in relation to State funding county road maintenance which has been followed by successive Governments, including Fianna Fáil administrations and Deputy Molloy, when he was Minister.  The policy was <Col N="1917" /> right then and it is right now.  The Minister in his contribution last night explained the reasons for the policy.  County roads though accounting for four-fifths of our roads carry only one-quarter of our traffic.  We have one of the highest percentages of dust free road surfaces in the world, better than many of our wealthier neighbours and than those with lesser mileages of road per head of population.</P>
    <P>Remember that our road mileage <i>per capita</i> is four times that of our nearest neighbour, Great Britain.  The House should also take into account that we spend four times as much on our county roads per thousand vehicle miles of travel as we spend on our national primaries &mdash; in other words, when compared on a basis of road usage, county roads do well. Fianna Fáil have also accused us of depriving local authorities of resources when it was they who introduced the legislation to remove the financial discretion of local authorities by abolishing domestic rates and limiting rate increases.  Once again their record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>In asking the House to reject the Fianna Fáil motion I want once again to call attention to their record while in office.  In the first year of their much heralded road development plan they provided 57 per cent of the level of State funding they promised.  In the first year of our new road plan we have provided every penny of the £152.5 million we promised.  I leave people to draw their own conclusions when they hear Fianna Fáil promising to provide increased money for county roads.</P>
    <P>This is a bit of a joke.  One has to look at the whole infrastructure of the country and take the economic and social responsibilities seriously.  Last year I was talking to a leading businessman in the United States who had been to Ireland.  He said that two of our problems were our telecommunications and our roads.  At that stage I was able to tell him we were doing something about our telecommunications and I would like to meet him now to tell him we are doing something about our roads.</P>

      <P>When people are interested in investing abroad, whether it be Ireland, Holland, Belgium or any other country, they vet the country.  One of the first things they look at is the lines of communications.  If communications are not good they walk away.  We are talking about the economic development of the whole country and our programme involves major road networks.  If we have good roads we will attract new businesses, because businessmen will know they can get their products from A to B. In this way we will be building a healthy and stable economy which can afford to develop the county roads.</P>
      <P>As I said before, and I will say it again because it is worth repeating, one would get the impression that county roads were the responsibility of central Government until the last few years.  As far back as 1971 Deputy Molloy said that the responsibility for county roads clearly lay with the local authorities and not with central government.  That has been the on-going policy.  The policy of central Government was always to look after national primary roads.  That is what we are doing, unlike the Fianna Fáil plan in <i>The Way Forward</i>.  They had great ideas, but no money.  We are developing a good solid road network so that if a person wants to set up a factory here or there, he can be assured that he will be able to move his products anywhere he wishes. In this way industrialists will be attracted to the west, the north-west or the south. When Fianna Fáil say our plan has an anti-rural bias, this shows their lack of knowledge in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policies have been set for the next three years and there will be a further programme into the nineties.  In ten years' time we will have a road network of which we can be truly proud because we will have the infrastructure necessary to attract businesses to the far flung corners of this country.  If we put all our money into county roads and ignored our national primary roads, who would thank <Col N="1919" /> us at the end of the day for empty roads, roads which were of little consequence?</P>
    <P>Let us be serious.  Stop playing petty politics coming up to the local elections. Let us look at this country in a broad way and work in the national interests, not in narrow parochial interests.  What we are doing is in the national interest but what Fianna Fáil seem to be advocating is in the local interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and express my disappointment at the Minister's speech.  He did not refer at all to the motion before the House.  This motion may not be of great interest or importance to Deputies living on the east coast, but it is before the House because of the frustration felt by Members on this and the other side of the House and every county councillor trying to operate on a local authority.  Listening to the Minister was like listening to an extract from <i>Building on Reality,</i> which is put before us in every debate.  The technical jargon resembled quotations from British Standards or Road Note 4, about which I happen to know a bit.  The Minister's speech also resembled a Fine Gael manifesto coming up to the local elections.  It had no relationship to the motion before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned his meetings with county councillors at the General Council of County Councils, but he must not have been talking to the Fine Gael councillors that I have been listening to. They are absolutely frustrated at this stage.  The Minister has expressed no practical knowledge of rural Ireland.  In that he could be accused of taking an anti-rural position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the county roads system has now reached a crisis, with many county roads practically impassible and in many cases impassible because of lack of maintenance and surface dressing. Although the Minister has ignored the appeals up to now I beg him, as a matter of urgency, to bring forward an emergency package to improve the county roads system.  Not alone would this relieve the problem which we have been discussing yesterday and this evening, but would also create very badly needed local employment.  Nobody could deny that local employment is badly needed.  If money were invested in our county roads system there would be a great opportunity for local employment.  In addition, native materials would be used for the strengthening and maintenance of those roads.  Quite a number of jobs could be created, instead of the temporary jobs of <Col N="1921" /> which we see so many at present and which serve no real purpose.</P>
    <P>In recent years, because of the increase in the carrying weight and capacity of trucks and of traffic generally, many of our roads are unable to take the heavy loads.  Following EC legislation, tonnage has been increased.  In the most remote parts of rural Ireland huge bulk tankers for collecting milk, delivering bulk feeding and supplies are normal, everyday events on roads which were designed for horses and carts, or very light traffic.</P>
    <P>Along with the breakdown of the county roads there is evidence of damage to the numerous small bridges on those roads, many of which are in a very dangerous condition.  The engineering staff in my own county were appalled at the results of a recent report on this matter. When there was greater need for more investment, the opposite happened.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies on this side of the House spoke of their own counties and I turn now to mine.  I have been a councillor for 11 years and remember as a councillor being able to go to my county engineer or local engineer to discuss a problem with him and finance would be made available and the works would be carried out immediately.  Since those times the situation has changed completely.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the block grants. In 1981 in my county this amounted to £226,000.  That rose to £260,000 in 1984 and in 1985 the figure was £367,000. While there was a considerable increase from 1984 to 1985, the increase from 1981 only barely kept pace with the fall in the purchasing power of the pound.  A sum of £100 in 1981 was worth £77 in 1983 and considerably less in 1985.  These figures are from the Central Bank and are not my figures.</P>
    <P>The block grant can be used only for improvements in county roads as distinct from their maintenance.  With regard to Kilkenny County Council the allocation in 1981 was £1,632,000, compared with £1,383,000 in 1985.  This represents an actual drop of 15 per cent in money terms and of 43 per cent in real terms.  No matter what the Minister says here, those <Col N="1922" /> facts speak for themselves.  With regard to our county roads allocation, in 1981 this was £1,240,000 and in 1985 it was £1,110,000.  Again this represents a drop of 10.5 per cent in money terms and in real terms 43 per cent.  So we have an overall drop of 43 per cent.  The Minister used quite a number of statistics, but I also remind him that there were very steep increased costs during that time.</P>
    <P>To put that in context, in Kilkenny there are 2,495 km of county roads, which is 82.6 per cent of the total mileage of the county.  The figures quoted are further proof that the whole system of county roads is not getting the finance necessary to keep it in a reasonable state of repair, not to mention the improvements so badly needed.  We must also remember the increasing costs which have had to be borne by the councils during the period 1981 to 1985.  For example, labour costs have increased, by wages per week, from £82.87 to £123.82 in 1985.  That is an increase of 49 per cent.  Plant costs have increased from £10.50 in 1981 to £14 per hour in 1985, an increase of 33 per cent. Even more important, the cost of stone per tonne and bitumen have increased. Stone cost, I believe, in the region of £6.50 in 1981, while it now costs in excess of £10.50&mdash;an increase of approximately 65 per cent.  Bitumen has increased per gallon from 82p to £1.47, an increase of 79 per cent.  Those statistics speak for themselves.  The Minister should include such figures and give a more reasonable balance.  Stone and bitumen are the main materials used in our surface dressing programme.  Surface dressing is the most important element of road maintenance. In my county in 1981 it comprised 29 per cent of our county road budget and in 1985 it comprised 46 per cent, although the actual mileage covered has been significantly reduced.</P>
    <P>Again, in 1981 the surface dressing cycle came around approximately every 13 years, against 15.5 years in 1985.  The desirable and recommended cycle, I understand, is ten years.  I know that in other counties surface dressing is not taking place at all.  The councils have not the money.  If roads are not surface <Col N="1923" /> dressed they will disintegrate rapidly, and that is happening throughout the country. It is a policy in our county to surface dress as much as possible, but the mileage which can be done because of lack of finance is being reduced considerably each year.  The consequences of this enforced inaction will be disastrous in the short term, leading to a complete breakdown in our county road system.  The major national improvements which are taking place are to be welcomed, but it is hard to explain this to an individual who has to make a detour to get to his home from his county road.  I hope the Minister will attend a council meeting to explain this position.</P>
    <P>I know deputations from various counties have met the Minister and have tried to impress upon him the importance of making money available for our county road system.  Unfortunately, they have been totally ignored.  The saying &ldquo;A stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; is one to which the Minister should pay attention tonight. Unless action is taken in the form of the motion put forward by us, I have no doubt that in a couple of years' time it will take major finance, because not alone will we need maintenance and surface dressing but the whole carriageway, the sub-base and foundation of every county road will have broken down and there will be nobody to blame except the Government because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to refer to a remark made by the Minister suggesting to this side of the House that own goals were being scored.  As this debate draws to a close it will be seen that it was a very obvious motion which <Col N="1924" /> was absolutely necessary in order to highlight to the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials in the Department the serious problem which we in the country are experiencing.  With due respect to the Ministers concerned and to the officials, they are obviously not aware of those problems if they are suggesting that own goals are being scored.  The main reason the roads are in such a bad state is that the Government are not making available the domestic rate relief grant which Fianna Fáil made available in 1971 and during the years before this Government took office.  Less money is being given to councils for the repair and maintenance of the county roads.</P>
      <P>I accept that the problem of county roads is a national one.  However, it cannot be denied that Donegal holds the record for the worst roads in the country. We have approximately 3,900 miles of road and of that figure there are 3,373 miles of county roads which are in a disgraceful condition.  They have deteriorated rapidly in the past few years because of lack of finance.  The Government did not make the money available.  They did not increase the domestic rate relief grant as Fianna Fáil did by 10, 11 or 12 per cent.  This year they have given a miserly 0.6 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>If the money had been given in the past few years the problem would not be as serious now.  We need now a major injection of money from the Exchequer to ensure that the roads do not continue to deteriorate.  The Government must fund the special programme as outlined in this motion.  In Donegal we have the worst roads in the country and we have the highest percentage of county roads.  The roads in the west of the county are used extensively by heavy vehicles taking fish from the ports to Dublin and to other centres for export.  All of this heavy traffic has contributed to the deterioration of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government seem to be proud of their road development policy.  It refers to the provision of an adequate roads <Col N="1925" /> system for major towns, ports and airports, to the elimination of bottle necks and the provision of by-passes.  This is poor comfort for the people of west Donegal and rural Ireland.  All of the matters mentioned by the Government must be attended to but not at the expense of the people whom I and other Deputies represent.  There is no reference in the Government's programme to county roads except to say that grants will not be available from the Exchequer, that expenditure under this heading will continue to be a matter for the local authorities even though less money is being made available to them.  This is poor comfort for people who have to travel on these roads and whose vehicles are being damaged.  The situation is fast approaching where people in my county and other counties will find it impossible to travel on the roads.  We have been inundated with complaints from drivers of all kinds of vehicles and soon school bus drivers will not drive on the roads because of the damage caused to the buses.  In that kind of situation the children's education will be affected.</P>
    <P>Because of the inadequate money to carry out a reasonable surface dressing programme the structure of the roads is being damaged seriously.  As was pointed out by another speaker, the cycle of surface dressings was once a ten-year cycle and was a 17-year cycle in Donegal but now it will be a 40-year cycle.  The finance which should be made available for surface dressing is being devoted to filling the craters on every county road.  It is accepted in Donegal that the condition of the county roads was more satisfactory 40 years ago.  It has been stated that the tracks in the Sahara are better than the county roads in Donegal.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is shortsighted from the point of view of business. It means that the heavy investment in county roads in the sixties and in the early seventies when Fianna Fáil were in power is being put in danger because of the deterioration of the roads in the past few years.  The public are waiting anxiously their opportunity on 20 June to give the Government an answer, to let <Col N="1926" /> them know they are sick and tired of the policies being pursued by the Department. Before I conclude I shall refer to the report of the Donegal County Manager regarding the 1985 Estimates when he said:</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, that the council is left with no option but to virtually abandon county roads unless a favourable response is given to the request to the Department for financial aid or unless moneys become available otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the local authorities have been downgraded since November 1983 by this Government due to the lack of sufficient funding to enable them to run the affairs of each authority in an efficient manner.  The people are calling for action and they are demanding central Government funding for local authorities, as they have had in the past. In this way confidence will be restored. The onus is on central Government to guarantee essential funding to local authorities.  This should be known in advance of the estimates meeting of each authority so that detailed and proper planning may be possible.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House calls on the Government to fund a special programme for the maintenance and improvement of county roads.  To date central Government have not made available such funding.  The serious condition of those roads is a cause of concern, especially in tourist counties such as County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county roadwork in Kerry consists of approximately 2,400 miles and of this figure approximately 95 per cent or 2,300 miles have been surface dressed.  The county road network in Kerry varies considerably in quality and carrying capacity. We have several hundred miles of such roads between ten and 12 feet wide which are not subject to very heavy traffic. Generally these roads are taken over by Kerry County Council after improvement works and surface dressing under the local improvements scheme.  In the county in excess of 75 per cent of the <Col N="1927" /> county roads are constructed on poor, boggy foundations.  This leads to a deterioration of road surfaces under heavy loads and in times of dry weather the peaty foundations tend to dry out and contract.  From an engineering point of view the best method of keeping our county road network in a well maintained state was to ensure that surfaces were adequately sealed.  This was done by means of an intensive surface dressing programme during the years.</P>
    <P>The servicing of the loans on capital investment and the operation of new schemes have resulted in reducing the finance available for county roads maintenance to a frightening degree.  I might give the House some example of the problem we are encountering with regard to the finances available to us for county roads.  In 1979 Kerry Councy Council had at their disposal £1.4 million for county roads maintenance and in 1984 £1.34 for the same purpose, which figure should by then have reached £3.4 million in order to keep pace with normal inflation.  In 1979 Kerry County Council had a surface dressing cycle of approximately 9.7 years on its county roads network.  No surface dressing has been carried out on those roads in Kerry in 1983 or 1984.  The surface of many of our county roads&mdash;now carrying heavier loads than ever before &mdash; is becoming dangerous and subject to water penetration.  If we are subjected to bad weather this winter and the following one a very large percentage of those county roads will deteriorate beyond measure.  It is now felt that approximately 50 per cent of our county roads network, or some 1,200 miles are at serious risk and it is estimated that the cost of repairing 1,200 miles is approximately £18 million, that is 1,200 by £15,000 per mile.  It is proposed that that amount of money should be made available over a six year period so that a programme of county roads restoration could be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in endeavouring to impress on the Minister and his Minister of State the really <Col N="1928" /> serious situation confronting local authorities.  It is not only a matter of the steady deterioration of our main roads and county roads structure but their speedy deterioration.  The Minister of State appears to come into this House to juggle figures.  He endeavours to give us figures for national primary and national secondary routes, an allocation heavily funded by the EC, in order to give the overall allocation a respectable look.  The most serious problem confronting any local authority or rural community at present is the very badly damaged road structure because of lack of funding.</P>
      <P>At our estimates meeting the county engineer put to us what he would require for main and county roads in order to maintain them at their 1976 level, that was prior to the abolition of rates on agricultural land and domestic dwellings. In subsequent years Fianna Fáil made good any shortfall, taking account of inflation.  We did not experience a problem until recent years.  The figures that the county engineer gave us demonstrated that he would require £3.3 million to maintain even the 1976 level, the minimum figure required to maintain the workforce at the previous year's level being £2.6 million.  But the maximum amount that could be provided at that estimate's meeting was £2.4 million, which represented £175,000 less than last year and £1 million less than what would have been required even based on 1976 levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem with which we are confronted.  We are faced with a £1.1 million shortfall grant in lieu of rates in County Monaghan this year in order to maintain our roads structure.  We have been endeavouring to maintain our roads in the best possible condition.  Over the last few years we discontinued the erection of any public lighting at churches, new housing areas and so on.  Additionally we have discontinued road widening, the removal of dangerous corners and verge trimming and have concentrated completely on surface dressing.  The advice we receive from our county engineer is that we would need to surfacedress our roads every ten years, but on <Col N="1929" /> the basis of the allocation we receive this year we shall be able to do so once in 25 years only.</P>
    <P>The Department do not appear to recognise an area where there has been major development, in poultry, pigs, mushroom and bulk milk collection, as was mentioned earlier.  For example, in recent years a broiler producer came to me wanting to erect a broilerhouse the materials for which could not be transported on an excessively narrow road. This meant we had to divert money from another source in our region so that we could widen a bridge across a small road enabling him to travel across it.  Last year an egg producer came to me with much the same story, telling me that food suppliers had told him they would not deliver any more ten ton loads unless there was a bridge provided to carry that capacity. We had to facilitate that man, again diverting money intended for roads maintenance and surface dressing.  These are the types of problems with which we are faced at present.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister coming into this House talking about national primary and secondary routes. Admittedly they carry the bulk of the traffic, but we cannot disregard county roads full of potholes and in many cases with the verges collapsing.  Last year again one man told me that there must have been many spare springs sold in a certain agricultural development where he made large deliveries.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to cut out this nonsensical talk about what they are doing and have done.  Fianna Fáil, when in power, provided funding in lieu of rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not got any money.  The total mileage of county roads in Sligo is 1,428, the allocation for the upkeep of which in 1981 was £615,000.  For 1985 the projected expenditure is put at £636,000, representing an increase of approximately 3 per cent which means a massive drop in real terms.  When one takes inflation into account it will be seen that this is nothing compared with previous allocations. When I was first elected to Sligo County Council in 1974 there were 200 men employed; today we have a mere 116, because if and when anybody retires they are not replaced, there not being the money to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy J. Leonard has said, there are many things also that we in Sligo cannot do.  We cannot afford to cut the hedges along half the main roads in County Sligo at the moment because the county council have no money to do it. The local community have to look after our burial grounds now.  This was formerly done by the county council.  I would like to say to the Minister, the House and <Col N="1931" /> the Press Gallery that they should go out to County Sligo and have a look at our county roads and those in other parts of the west and they will see the deplorable condition they are in.  I am very disappointed with the Minister's speech tonight.  I hope he will make some funds available to try to do something with the county roads.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this motion.  I support the Minister's amendment. I note that over the next three years the Government have given a commitment to spend in excess of £500 million on our road network.  This is a very welcome programme and one the Minister is to be complimented on, because it is vital that we bring our roads up to the standard of roads on the Continent and allow for easy transport from the west to our ports so that our goods can be exported easily.  If we have not a good main road network it will be impossible for people in remote areas to have their produce sold on the world market.</P>

      <P>I will deal with county roads in a minute.  I welcome the commitment by the Government and the Minister to open another bridge across the Shannon.  This allows for free transport from the west to the midlands and Dublin.  This is vital.  I welcome the turn-about by the Opposition, who are the cause of the problems with our county roads today because in 1977 they removed from local authorities the power to strike a rate, the power to raise money internally within the various counties. Many of the points raised by the people on the other side arose directly as a result of the Government who were in power <Col N="1932" /> between 1977 and 1981 preventing local authorities from raising finance locally.</P>
      <P>The amending legislation, which the Minister will be introducing, to return power to local authorities to raise funds locally will enable them to rebuild our county road structure.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the possibility of allowing flexibility for councillors to allocate more freely funds coming from central Government to enable block grants to be spent on our county roads.  It is a pity the Opposition seven years ago did not regard our county road structure with the same importance as they regard it now.  Is it because we have local elections in the near future that the Opposition are suddenly worrying about our county roads?  When they removed authority from local authorities to raise funds locally they imposed a 2 per cent tax on all farm produce.  That is their record in relation to our county road structure.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Labour to look at the social employment scheme to see how it could be utilised to improve our county road structure.  No maintenance has been carried out on many of our county roads since 1977.  The unions in my area are very reasonable people but I do not believe that any trade unionist could say that if work was carried out on many of our county roads under the social employment scheme it would prevent employment.  It will give vital employment in many of our rural areas.  It will also allow hedge trimming to be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accuse the Minister for the Environment of grave dereliction of duty in his neglect of the county road system which covers 80 per cent of our roads.  Deputies from every county are reporting on the rapid deterioration of county roads.  About 12 Fianna Fáil Deputies have spoken during this limited three hour debate and have given us a litany of the Minister's neglect.  The county road investment by generations of our people since the foundation of the State involving billions of pounds is now being washed away with every rainfall <Col N="1933" /> because proper maintenance on the surface of most of these roads has stopped. The small amount of money now available can only be use for limited emergency repairs in a few areas, with much of the county road repair work now being abandoned altogether by county council engineers.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for the implementation of a national policy for roads and he cannot exclude county roads from his overall responsibility.  They comprise 46,000 miles of our national road network, they represent 80 per cent of the total road mileage, they carry 40 per cent of the freight transport and in recent years over 50 per cent of the new private houses built adjoin county roads.  All of these important considerations seem to have escaped our Minister, whose pathetic performance last night in speaking to this Fianna Fáil motion on county roads leaves one to despair that the present neglect will continue.</P>
      <P>I accuse the Minister of being lazy, uninformed, disinterested and completely ineffective in fulfilling his duty.  In a 30 minute speech last night he made only the briefest of references to the terms of the motion before the House.  His comments were inaccurate, ill-founded and displayed a callous disregard for the plight of the tens of thousands of families whom he condemns to suffering on under deplorable local road conditions, with the huge cost in motor car repairs, delays and in many cases in inaccessability to their homes.</P>
      <P>One might well ask how this deplorable situation has come about.  What policy change has resulted in county councils not being able to maintain the surface condition of county roads?  In other words, who or what is responsible for the hardship which is now being inflicted on young and old throughout the country blocking future development and driving rural dwellers to despair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accuse the Government that their policy of neglect of the county roads is causing great anger, resentment and frustration among people living in rural Ireland.  In the local elections on 20 June the people will have the opportunity to <Col N="1934" /> express their anger by voting against Fine Gael and Labour Party candidates whose parties are solely responsible for the deplorable state of county roads today.</P>
    <P>Two decisions made by the Coalition Government are responsible for the now rapid deterioration of the condition of county roads.  The first was the decision in the Local Government Financial Provisions (No. 2) Act, 1983, to stop the funding of local authorities in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates.  Rate support grants have only increased by 3.5 per cent since 1982 and inflation in that period was 25 per cent.  The loss of over 20 per cent of its revenue has left local authorities with no money for county road maintenance. The second was the decision to concentrate available resources in development of national primary, secondary and regional roads to the exclusion of county roads maintenance.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these two decisions is the cause of the rapid deterioration in the condition of the surface of our county roads and the position has now become so bad that Fianna Fáil believe special action is required to cater for the crisis that exists and to restore the worst affected roads to satisfactory standards.</P>
    <P>Our motion calls for special action. Special funding is now needed from the Exchequer for maintenance and the rate support grants need to be restored to allow local authorities to maintain a satisfactory level of services.  The Government made a major blunder in thinking they could replace rate support grants by imposing water and other charges.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil published the road development plan for the eighties in May 1979.  That was the first major centrally co-ordinated programme for the development of the national road network. Expenditure on road improvement and maintenance under that plan increased by 63 per cent in real terms between 1979 and 1984.  Surely that is ample evidence of a Fianna Fáil Government's commitment to the development of our national road structure. All we had from Minister Kavanagh last night were promises which may never be implemented and which those in business are sceptical of because of the lack of evidence on the ground that any of these schemes will start as scheduled.</P>

      <P>Surface dressing, an intrinsic part of any maintenance policy to protect the fabric of the road from ingress of moisture and to provide skid resistant surfaces, is virtually being dropped from the maintenance programmes of many counties.  Local funds, from which surface dressing is mainly undertaken, constituted only 37 per cent of the total expenditure on roads in 1984 as opposed to 52 per cent in 1975.  The desirable objective of surface dressing county roads every ten years or thereabouts has now had to be dropped, we have been told by county engineers, to 100 years frequency, or, indeed, in some counties to a virtual cessation of surface dressing activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that the cost of bitumen, an essential component of surface dressing, has increased approximately 15 times from 1970 to date, whereas the corresponding increase in the consumer price index has been in the order of a factor of four only.  The regular appearance of the pothole is the most obvious manifestation of the deterioration of the quality of county roads; but much of the disimprovement is less obvious and will ultimately, and inevitably, culminate in major crazing and <Col N="1938" /> structural collapse of these roads.  The cost of remedial procedures at that time will be far grater than the cost of regular surface dressing at sensible intervals.</P>
      <P>The total number of recorded accidents on all roads has risen from 15,000 in 1975 to more than 20,000 in 1982. Apart from the major direct material and personal cost of these accidents, they have led to crushing increases on every motorist in the form of car insurance premiums.  Huge costs are incurred due to damage to cars arising out of the bad road conditions.</P>
      <P>In road improvement and road maintenance, therefore, it is abundantly clear that we must have a much higher level of service than we have experienced in latter years and that the consequence of continuing failure to respond to the need will have disastrous consequences in the long term.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt but that investment in road improvement in particular will yield a much greater return in real terms than would be the case in many other forms of local authority investment. Savings in travel time and in fuel consumption as well as the reductions in numbers of accidents and personal injuries are very significant.  The employment content of road investment is also greater than in many other areas of corresponding expenditure and this must be very significant in today's climate of unending job losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear, therefore, that a far greater input of central funding is required on both roads capital and maintenance works on an on-going basis since local authorities are unlikely to be able to finance such expenditures themselves from their limited resources.  It is improbable that funds available from the private sector will other than marginally alleviate this pressing need.  The return to the State on this financial outlay can be justified on convincing economic and material grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are calling on the Minister to <Col N="1939" /> change the policy.  We accept that county road maintenance has not been funded from central funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the crisis that has arisen in the financing of local authorities, who are unable to carry out a satisfactory road maintenance programme due to the changes in the 1983 Act introduced by the Government and due to the serious cutbacks in the funding of local authorities, Fianna Fáil are calling on the Government to invest in county road maintenance and establish a five year programme to bring these roads back up to a proper standard.  It is clear from what the Minister said last night, by continuing to refer to national primary, secondary and regional roads and to ignore the content of our motion, that he is not interested in rural dwellers and does not care. <Col N="1940" /> He has not briefed himself on the problems that affect the vast majority of the people who live outside Dublin.  Is this a Dublin Government only?  Are they not concerned about the problems of rural Ireland?  Do they know what it is like not to be able to travel down a road from one's own house to the main road?  The Minister must be ashamed of the ineptitude of his party and his refusal to do something about this matter.  We are calling on the Minister even at this late stage to change his policy and recognise the reality.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise this most serious matter.  I should like to refer briefly to the history of the Burtonport Harbour project.  Late in 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government, Taoiseach and Minister for the Gaeltacht gave a commitment that Burtonport Harbour would be developed at a cost of £1 million. Plans were set in train and prepared for the dredging of the harbour.  A Coalition Government then took office and Coalition Governments never have any interest in the west of Ireland.  Fianna Fáil returned to power and when the Estimates were being prepared by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, £1 million was included in the Estimates in November-December 1982 for this work. The present Government took office in November-December 1982.  They started to prune the Estimates and it became obvious that people in the west would suffer when £1 million was pruned from the Department of Fisheries and the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On numerous occasions we met the Minister for the Gaeltacht who is also the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  He gave us the distinct impression that we were high on the priority list and that we would get the 100 per cent State grant, 50 per cent from the Department of Fisheries and 50 per cent from the Department of the Gaeltacht.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy informed me that there would be a grant of 75 per cent from the Department of Fisheries and absolutely nothing from the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I wonder what co-ordination is there between the Department <Col N="1944" /> of the Gaeltacht in Dublin and the Gaeltacht in Donegal.</P>
    <P>On 28 March, Donegal County Council were told by an official of Roinn na Gaeltachta that they had plenty of money and would provide 50 per cent of the grant and that the hold-up was because there was no money coming from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. That was the complete opposite to what we were being told in Dublin.  Donegal County Council had never been informed that money would be required from them for the development of Burtonport Harbour. We got no opportunity in Donegal to consider this in the Estimates despite the fact that a decision was taken some 12 months ago.  Donegal County Council wrote to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Gaeltacht on 28 March.  It is sad to say that neither of those Departments have replied as yet to the queries raised.</P>
    <P>In the letter of 28 March to Roinn na Gaeltachta an official in Donegal County Council said that he sought clarification on the matter from Mr. X in Roinn na Gaeltachta who informed him that, as far as he was aware, the project had been delayed because the Department of Fisheries and Forestry were finding it difficult to make funds available for their percentage of the costs.  Donegal County Council were informed by myself and members of the Burtonport co-op that we had been informed that 25 per cent was required. That was the first time that became known to members of Donegal County Council and to the officials of the council. So much for the interest the Minister has in the people of the Gaeltacht.  Whoever was responsible for this acted in a most deceitful manner.  They told us they would increase the Department of Fisheries grant from 50 per cent to 75 per cent and reduce the Department of the Gaeltacht grant from 50 per cent to nil.</P>
    <P>Though Burtonport is in the heart of the Gaeltacht we must ask whether we are better in the Gaeltacht or out of it. Fianna Fáil were responsible for the extension of the harbour in 1972 when the late Deputy Noel Lemass was in charge of the Office of Public Works.  Following a <Col N="1945" /> period of Coalition Government, Fianna Fáil were returned to power and once again provided moneys for this development but the Coalition who were again returned to office pruned the Estimates and did not provide any money for Burtonport which had been a developing harbour when Fianna Fáil were in office. That development has been reversed by the Coalition with the consequent disastrous effect on the area in terms of unemployment and so on.  Boats as small as 40 feet are unable to enter Burtonport Harbour except at the risk of being damaged seriously and that would be one of the smallest boats using the harbour.  The bigger boats can use the harbour only at high tide.  Not only, then, have those boats to land at other ports in the county and in other counties in the west but in many cases they have to land in ports in Scotland.  This results in much job losses in the area, an area in which the rate of unemployment is twice as high as the rate for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry has a lot to answer for.  It is not often that he comes to Donegal and I suspect that is because he cannot answer in respect of what the Coalition are doing in this whole area of harbour development.  We are not talking about a small harbour.  Burtonport has a turnover of £7 million.  When we consider what has happened in Limerick in the constituency of the Minister for Justice, where 800 jobs are being lost for the sake of an extra £1 million, we must ask what chance we have in regard to what we are seeking and where many more jobs are involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to prevail on his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, to make the money available for Burtonport.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether in the event of Donegal County Council agreeing to make available 25 per cent of the necessary moneys, the Government are prepared to make the remaining 75 <Col N="1946" /> per cent available, or in some deceitful way are they merely trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the fishermen and their representatives in the area?</P>
      <P>We were deceived by the Minister, by the Minister of State and by officials of the Department.  Obviously, there is no liaison between Donegal and Dublin, I say to those officials in Dublin that, regardless of what attitude the Ministers may adopt, the interests of the west must be looked after.  Officials in Donegal say the money is available while officials in Dublin say it is not available.  The air must be cleared as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Gallagher in this matter.  All Donegal Deputies are very concerned about the serious problem in Burtonport. A large section of the community of The Rosses and Gweedore depend on that port and have been waiting for its development for a number of years but every promise made in that respect has been broken.</P>
      <P>Another factor that must be considered is the fact that off the coast there is a large island with a big population. There is a ferry for the island's people but the passage for that ferry is dangerous. As Deputy Gallagher mentioned, the size of boat that can use the harbour is very restricted.  In winter when the fishing season is at its peak, there would be a great saving to the big boats from Killybegs if they could call at Burtonport, discharge their catches, refuel and so on.  If we are concerned with our fisheries industry, a commitment must be given in this respect.  It is very unfair at this stage to renege on a promise made which was to the effect that 50 per cent of the necessary moneys would come from the Gaeltacht and 50 per cent from the Department of Fisheries, and instead to leave Donegal County Council who, like so many other local authorities, are very restricted financially, with a debt of £250,000.</P>

The time taken to deal with individual appeals varies, depending on a number of factors, many of which are outside the control of the board.  Of the appeals decided to date in 1985, 28 per cent were dealt with in less than six months and a further 41 per cent took from six to nine months to reach decision stage.  I am satisfied that the board are making every effort to reduce the time taken to deal with appeals and I understand that special attention is being given to those cases which have been on hands for long periods.

    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy a court order for the endorsement of the licence was made on 7 April 1976.  The person in question did not hold a licence at that time.  The first licence granted to him after the date of the court order was <Col N="1795" /> a provisional licence valid for the period 4 May 1982 to 3 May 1983 and this licence was duly endorsed.  He was subsequently granted provisional licences valid from 20 January 1984 to 19 January 1985 and from 10 May 1985 to 9 May 1986 and both these licences have been endorsed. The earliest date on which he will be entitled to a licence free from that endorsement will be 10 May, 1988.  This will be conditional on his ensuring that he holds a licence continuously during this period, i.e. that there is no break between the date of expiry of one licence and the commencement date of the next licence. Otherwise, he will have to hold a licence for two broken periods of 12 months each after 9 May 1986 in order to make up the aggregate period of five years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will agree that the bonding scheme applicable to the development of new housing estates is totally unsatisfactory, resulting in many residents having to live in appalling conditions for years; and if he will introduce the necessary amending legislation to the Planning Acts in order to correct this situation.</P>

      <P>The practice of requiring a bond for the satisfactory completion of housing estates is only one of a number of measures available to planning authorities to ensure that estates are completed to the required standard.  It is a matter for the planning authority to decide the amount of the bond required in any particular case and the conditions under which it should be used.  The conditions attached to planning permissions for housing estates and the enforcement of these conditions are of critical importance. My Department have issued a memorandum containing advice and guidelines on development control generally and dealing, in particular, with the type of conditions which should be attached by <Col N="1796" /> planning authorities to planning permissions for housing estates and the need for care and precision in drafting such conditions if effective enforcement action is to be taken at a later stage.  Many of the problems in regard to the completion of housing estates appear to stem not from defects in the Planning Acts but rather from the operation and implementation of the law.  However, when the relevant provisions of the Acts are being reviewed, I will consider whether any amendments could be made to improve the existing situation regarding the enforcement of planning control in the case of housing estates.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 623 and 624 together.  Women from the Dublin 12 postal district claiming unemployment benefit or assistance were transferred to the new exchange at Apollo House, Tara Street, because of severe overcrowding at the Victoria Street employment exchange.  It is accepted that moving any claimants to the new exchange causes a certain amount of inconvenience, at least in the initial stages.  However, the transfer of the approximately 1,850 women claimants in the Dublin 12 area in this way <Col N="1821" /> was the only viable solution to the problems of congestion at the Victoria Street exchange.  Unemployed men for the Dublin 12 area continue to sign on at Werburgh Street employment exchange.</P>
      <P>Parts of the Dublin 12 area are adjacent to Tallaght.  Because, however, of the limited size of the new temporary employment exchange in Tallaght, it would not be possible for unemployed people from Dublin 12 to be accommodated at that office.</P>
      <P>Plans for the provision of additional employment exchanges in outlying city areas where they are required are being pursued as a matter of priority.  In the meantime, however, it is necessary to take whatever measures are possible to relieve the pressure on claimants and staff alike because of the congestion at certain city exchanges.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 636, 637, and 638 together.  Application for new accommodation was first made in 1975 in the case of Tuam Vocational School and in 1979 in the case of Protumna and Ballinasloe Vocational Schools.  Because of the Department's overall building commitments at the time, it was not possible to commence architectural planning of any of the projects until 1982.  Planning has progressed to the stage where the developed sketch scheme has been approved for each project.</P>
      <P>In the case of Ballinasloe, documentation relating to the working drawings, has been requested from the County Galway Vocational Education Committee and is awaited in the Department.  This documentation has already been received in relation to Tuam and Portumna and is under examination.  When this examination has been completed and the documentation found to be satisfactory, the committee will be advised in relation to the next stage of planning, i.e. the bill of quantities.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of all the stages of planning, I am not in a position to say when tenders may be invited or when work on the projects may be commenced. The question of the allocation of money for any school building project does not arise until the project is nearing the stage where it is ready to go to tender.</P>

      <P>My Department on 16 December 1982 conveyed their agreement to the authorities of the national school referred to that the school building should be extended. It was subsequently necessary to seek an extension of the school site and when the site had been surveyed and acquired to have title thereto investigated and declared satisfactory.  These matters have now been attended to and the Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to prepare a sketch scheme.  When the scheme becomes available, my Department will <Col N="1828" /> communicate further with the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The position is that some years ago the County Meath Vocational Education Committee acquired a particular site for the school in question on the basis of a commitment given by Meath County Council to develop the access road, which is in public ownership.  Architectural planning of the project was initiated subsequently and reached the working drawing stage when costly planning conditions imposed by the council effectively placed the onus for developing the access road on the committee.  My Department were advised in March last that, following an appeal by the committee, An Bord Pleanála had upheld the council's conditions.</P>
      <P>Arising from a recent meeting held in my Department to discuss the situation the committee are to examine fully the possibility of building the new school on an alternative site offered by the council. When this examination has been completed, the committee are to submit their conclusions to my Department concerning the relative merits of building on the alternative, as against the original, site.</P>
