      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 18, 19 and 20.  By agreement, the proceedings on the remaining Stages of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1985 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 40.  Also by agreement, the proceedings on item 40 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 8.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if it would be possible for him, or the Minister for Justice, to make some statement or give us some information today about the position in regard to the tribunal which has been established to deal with compensation for the victims of the Stardust tragedy.  The Taoiseach will recall that I raised this matter on the Adjournment recently and the Minister for Defence, acting on behalf of the Minister for Justice, indicated that he was prepared to arrange a meeting between <Col N="1294" /> himself, or his officials, and the legal representatives of the Stardust victims.  I raise this matter because there is some confusion, in fact, a fair amount of confusion, existing.  We would all agree that it would be tragic if at this stage matters did not proceed satisfactorily.  There is certain doubt and confusion in the minds of the committee, and the victims, about some matters, particularly in relation to costs.  It would be very desirable if the Minister for Justice, or the Attorney General, could make a statement about the matter or arrange a meeting or take some initiative to clear up the doubts that exist because everybody is anxious to get on with the matter.  Most people are anxious to get before the tribunal and get this all settled but there are these doubts and questions.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern which I share.  In fact, the Attorney General, who is dealing with this matter, has been in continuous contact with the various parties with a view to resolving outstanding doubts or issues. I would be happy that he should brief the Leader of the Opposition on the present position and on his hopes of resolving anything that is outstanding in the immediate future.  Perhaps that might be done during the course of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation before the House is merely a constitutional requirement to enable Spain and Portugal to join the European Community. The main negotiations to enable these countries to join the enlarged Community have already taken place at a much higher level.  I congratulate our Government for the part which they have played in facilitating the entry of these countries into the Community.  There were very apparent and almost insurmountable difficulties, particularly during the year of Ireland's Presidency of the EC and great work was done.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="1298" /> Barry, should be congratulated and also the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, on the manner in which they committed themselves, on the one hand, to the interests of the Community and on the other hand to the protection of Irish interests. They are also to be commended on ensuring that the friendships which exist between ourselves and Spain are in no way damaged in this formal move.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Accession was signed on 12 June.  We are merely making it possible, by reforming our legislation, to facilitate what is taking place.  Since the original six member states formed the Community back in 1957, the EC have undergone two periods of enlargement and round three is now in train.  It is a natural, logical development of the Common Market area that such a large land mass as the Iberian peninsula consisting of Spain and Portugal should seek to join.  Geographically, one can find no objection to European growth in this way and I therefore welcome the participation of the free democratic countries of Spain and Portugal into the Community.  The historical links between the Iberian people and this country would serve to consolidate the friendships which already exist and will continue to grow in the years ahead.  Our Government at all stages of the negotiations have facilitated the entry of Spain and Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to Ireland's position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the entry of these countries into the Community and very briefly to the developments which have taken place in this country since we became part of the Common Market in 1972.  At the time there was a great conflict of interests between various political parties in this State whether Ireland should or should not become part of the Community.  We overcame that conflict by referendum and have concentrated as a full member over the last 13 years and have participated in many worthwhile developments during that period.  The main plank which influenced the majority of our people, particularly the urban and farming communities, were the structures in the Community, in particular the Common Agricultural Policy.  While our entry has <Col N="1299" /> brought a measure of prosperity to some of our inhabitants and has brought about improvement to certain sections, nevertheless when one examines our involvement we cannot be over-optimistic about what transpired during that period.</P>
    <P>In 1972 we had about 60,000 unemployed on the live register and in 1985 there are 230,000.  That fact demands very serious attention in the years ahead. If that trend were to continue the Community would fail this country very seriously. The advent of Spain and Portugal will add a further 30 million people, making the total population of the Community somewhere in the region of 300 million.  I cannot give the figure of the employable people in that number but there would be perhaps 12 million people unemployed in the Community.  The structures and the bureaucracy which have developed over the years have not assisted in the better development of social policy to cater for that situation.</P>
    <P>Unemployment here is rising faster than in any other country of the EC. Employment in the indigenous industries has almost collapsed since we joined. That is a mere fact of life.  How the employment situation will be affected by the addition of another great land mass and 30 million people is a matter for conjecture and something about which we should be very concerned over the years ahead.  There are advantages which would accrue, perhaps, in the agricultural sense from the participation of Spain and Portugal.  We do not have the same level of conflict between the agricultural products of Spain and Portugal and our own as would be the case with our closer northern European neighbours.</P>
    <P>The gap between the living standards of member states has widened considerable since 1972 and has widened further between regions in the one country and little effort or worthwhile achievement can be seen in that area.  Unless the original principles on which the Common Market was founded are to be adhered to and there is the political will and determination to ensure that they are properly implemented, the Common Market will <Col N="1300" /> have failed to bring about a diminution of the disparities that exist between the poorer sections of the Community.  I am not at all happy about that situation.</P>
    <P>Spain and Portugal indicated their intention to seek admission to the Community as far back as 1978-1979.  Obviously their reasons for seeking entry were economic.  The Common Market is a conglomeration of self interested nations, each protecting its own vital national interests.  In the super-levy conflict we were the country that would have been downtrodden were it not for the fight put up by our negotiators, our Ministers and our Government and the support of the Opposition.  We would not have achieved anything near what we achieved were it not for our defence of our position. Things will be even harder in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Community policy is of great concern. In an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on November 4 1985 relating to food mountains when thousands are starving, a speech made by Bob Geldof before 2,000 people in Canterbury Cathedral was referred to.  Mr. Bob Geldof had said that he did not want part of a country or world with a mentality that stored food while people are dying.  That is a sentiment with which we would all agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly related to the accession of Spain and Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related in the sense that we are preparing the way for the inclusion of another 30 million people who will continue to buttress the institutions and will further add to the food surplus for which the Community can no longer pay.  Because they are central to the Common Market, Germany, Great Britain and the Netherlands have a much greater advantage than the smaller peripheral countries.  The peripheral nations should band together so that we can influence the direction of the Common Market and eliminate some of the major problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition Party objected to the Government's handling of this issue.  The <Col N="1301" /> Government have done an excellent job. We are a very small part of the Community. We have a small say in terms of voting strength, but we have made our presence felt in a significant way.  One Fianna Fáil Deputy said that we had sold out the fishing industry.  It was grossly unfair of him to accuse our negotiators and the members of the Government of going into negotiations to sell out a vital national interest and I cannot accept a statement of that dimension of gravity. We all recognised that, once there was an application from Spain and Portugal for membership of the EC, it would pose a threat to our fishing industry and that Spain would automatically pose a greater threat to our fishing industry than any other country in the Common Market to date.  We would have had the same problem a number of years ago had the Scandinavian countries, particularly Norway, decided to join the EC but Norway decided by referendum not to participate in the Community some years ago.</P>
    <P>Having got the various concessions as outlined in the Minister's speech, which were as much as one could get, it is a matter now for the Community to honour these agreements and ensure that Spain does not fall in breach of these agreements, as fishing is a very important part of our resources.  Any attempt by the massive Spanish fleet to invade our waters would be detrimental to our industry.  The Government will have to seek special funding from the EC to protect our waters properly against infiltration by the Spaniards, up to 1996 at least.  At that stage we should be in a position to take on the Spaniards in relation to reaping the big rewards from fishing.</P>
    <P>I support the accession of Spain and Portugal.  Portugal, like Ireland, is a small country and their living standards are somewhat similar to ours.  Northern Portugal is like the west of Ireland, dependent on fishing and small farming units. They will depend on the regional policy and the Social Fund of the EC to improve their living standards.  We will be rowing in with them and hoping that they will support us in ensuring that a fair measure <Col N="1302" /> of the various funds will flow to our countries and that we will benefit to a much greater degree.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the social areas. Will there be a continuation of the growth in unemployment?  If there is, the Common Market will decline.  Some people say that in smaller countries there should be attempts to support native industries. Dumping has been taking place here from within and outside the EC.  Spain has outside interests and has long-established contacts with countries away beyond the European frontiers.  Therefore, Spain will influence marketing in a different way as participants in the EC.  I am pleased that Spain is taking its rightful place in the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the entry of Spain and Portugal into the European Community.  It is encouraging that successive Irish Governments since the seventies have supported the entry of the Iberian countries to the Community.  As Deputy Dowling pointed out, we have many historic links with the Iberian countries and this will help us to develop those links and to look after the interests of the poorer countries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entry of Spain and Portugal will <Col N="1303" /> provide opportunities for us, and challenges. This will open up a new market for our exports, particularly for agriculture, including dairy produce, beef and pigmeat, and with the removal of tariffs it will give us an opportunity to export industrial products to those two countries. I hope that every facility and encouragement will be given to Irish people who wish to export, particularly agricultural producers.  They should be given an early opportunity to export to those markets.</P>
    <P>The entry of those countries will create problems.  Spain has the largest number of sheep in the EC and this may provide a problem for our sheep producers.  We will not be affected to any large extent in respect of fresh fruit, vegetables and olive oil, any of the vegetables and produce that grow in the Mediterranean climate. Therefore, Spain and Portugal will not provide any great threat to us.  However, I was concerned at one part of the Minister's statement here on 24 October.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the case of the Regional Fund it will be necessary to revise the financial entitlements of members states to take account of the new members.  The provision of the shares for Spain and Portugal means that the shares of the present member states must be reduced in percentage terms.</P>
    <P>This should be a matter of concern for us.  The Regional Fund has not lived up to expectations.  One of the fundamental aims of the Community was to ensure that there would be no disparity between the various regions.  We would have expected that the standard of living would be uniform throughout the Community and that the Regional Fund would be used to bring about uniformity.  That has not happened.  Indeed, the gap between the richer and poorer regions has widened rather than narrowed since the formation of the EC.  Therefore, it is a matter of concern, as stated by the Minister, that the percentage of this fund will be reduced for the other countries in <Col N="1304" /> Europe with the entry of Spain and Portugal.</P>

      <P>No.  I am suggesting that it is a matter for the Government there to ensure that there would be no reduction, that the fund would be topped up so that there would be sufficient money to ensure a continuation of at least the present funding to Ireland &mdash; that more funds would be made available from the wealthier countries to ensure that Spain and Portugal will get their fair share as well.</P>

      <P>My concern is that the Minister did not refer to a larger fund. Our present funding should be maintained. The funding of the Community has been causing serious problems and it is a matter of concern that funds available to us have not been increased to take account of the disparity between the various regions.  This and previous Governments have been pressing for this because not alone is it in the interest of this country but of the Community as a whole. There has been a problem here because the funds have been distributed through the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the west and in Border regions we have not been receiving our fair share of the funds that came through the Regional Fund.  In other words, there have not been additions to those areas and the <Col N="1305" /> grants we normally got through the Government from EC funds as well as Government resources have been spread throughout the whole State and the disadvantaged areas did not benefit as they should have from the Regional Fund. Negotiations are taking place and it is important that they be brought to a successful conclusion.  The funds should be paid directly to local authorities.  They and other regional bodies like health boards should be allowed to make their cases to the European authorities so that the moneys would be paid direct to the local authorities.  This happens in other European countries, including the UK, and it is time we had that kind of operation here.  Local authorities are in a better position to know the exact needs of their areas.  This would get over the problem we have had.  Additional funding is not coming to the areas for which it was intended because the payment is made through the Government here.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund has served the country well and we have benefitted considerably.  With the entry of Spain and Portugal I hope there will be no diminution in the portion of this fund available to Ireland.  That is not to say that I do not support &mdash; because I do very strongly support &mdash; the provision of funds for Spain and Portugal from the Social Fund for their development, where necessary.  Indeed, the whole concept of the Community is to endeavour to abolish any disparity in the levels of wealth between the various regions in Europe. In this respect Spain and Portugal are entitled to exactly the same consideration as are the other countries within the Community.  The Social Fund has provided much necessary funding for various schemes here.  For example, between 1981 and 1984 over £230 million was directed specifically at young people under 25 years of age.  In 1981, over 30,000 people took part in schemes in respect of which £23 million was provided and the figure has been rising ever since. In 1984, over 150,000 persons took part in courses for which over £130 million was provided.</P>
    <P>Part of the European Social Fund has <Col N="1306" /> been directed toward the handicapped, their training for open employment and certain job creation schemes.  In the current year, before the entry of Spain and Portugal, I am concerned that the amount of the Social Fund available for the handicapped here is being reduced.  I note there has been a change in interpretation of the regulations whereby only those handicapped who are in training, and for a five year period only, can now benefit from that fund.  It is important that those who continuously attend, say, sheltered workshops, and those whose period of training over five years is complete, who are unable to obtain placement on the open job market, should continue to be supported.  It is important that the case be made to the European Commission to ensure that funds are provided continuously to meet the needs of these people.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by various health boards, particularly the North Western Health board who run quite a number of schemes for the handicapped themselves, that is, those not run by voluntary or other semi-State organisations, that the amount of money to be made available to them will be reduced, that they will be unable to fund many of their projects from the European Social Fund. While the overall allocation to this country for the handicapped has been increased over the years, the total amount paid to the health boards has been reduced by over £1 million between 1982 and 1985, from a figure of £6.3 million to £5.2 million.  This must be a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>In their negotiations and deliberations in Europe I hope the Government will ensure that there will be a return to the funding of these worthy projects for the handicapped in our community.  This is necessary particularly in recessionary times when the health boards will be unable to meet their commitments relating to handicapped persons off their own bat but it is of the utmost importance that the European Social Fund should continue to fund all of the projects in train for the handicapped which they <Col N="1307" /> have been funding in recent years.</P>
    <P>Of course the European Social Fund has created opportunities for work experience particularly for young people. It is a matter of concern within the EC that overall unemployment has risen so steeply from the 2.5 million when we joined to over 12 million at present. Indeed, when Spain and Portugal enter the Community, the total number of unemployed within the Community will be increased.  It is a matter for reflection that, since our entry into the EC, the total number of our unemployed rose from 65,000 to almost 250,000 at present. While a national Government must take responsibility for a large share of that, nevertheless the European Community have failed to come to grips with the problem.  It is something to which they need to devote their attention.</P>
    <P>Equality legislation has been introduced but has not been implemented, even though it should have been in December last, in order to give men and women equal rights out of the Social Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all relevant because, in the context of the entry of any new country to the EC, we must examine the whole question of funding. We must honour our obligations by way of giving good example to new members. This would be particularly appropriate in the case of Spain to whom we would need to give good example because they have been in breach of the fishing regulations even before their entry.  Last week when this debate was in progress here, two Spanish fishing vessels were found to be in breach of the regulations in relation to Irish waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling was critical of Members on this side of the House who accused the Government of having sold out on the fishing negotiations.  I believe <Col N="1308" /> that Deputy Daly and Deputy P. Gallagher spelled out very clearly the problems created for this country in relation to fishing.  It is also fair to say that the Government did not negotiate the best deal that could have been negotiated. There have been numerous breaches of the existing regulations by the Spanish fishing fleet.  After 1996 the Spaniards will have a very large entry into Irish waters which must have very serious consequences for our fishing industry. Perhaps we feel that 1996 is a long way off but, nevertheless, we are creating a very serious problem for those who will be involved in the fishing industry then when special rights will be given to the Spaniards, who have the largest fishing fleet in Europe, to come into Irish waters.</P>
    <P>While the Common Agricultural Policy served this country well in earlier years, more recently it seems to be under threat.  It is a matter for concern that restrictions imposed on the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; we accept that restrictions have to be applied especially in the case of milk &mdash; do not take account of the special position of Ireland in relation to agriculture.  The over-production of milk and the super levy are classic examples of this.  We are very largely dependent on milk production and, although we produce only 4 per cent of milk in Europe, nevertheless the same penalties in regard to over-production are imposed which can have a devastating effect on us compared to other European countries.</P>
    <P>In negotiations, special account should be taken of our situation and, if other countries are affected, their problems should also be taken into account.  The aid given to bring our land up to standard has not really been sufficient.  The western package and the western drainage scheme are examples which show that, although there is no lack of enthusiasm on the part of farmers in western counties in relation to these schemes, the amount of money available, particularly in regard to drainage, is insufficient.  This is unfortunate because, in the concept of the European Community, we would expect <Col N="1309" /> that sufficient funding would be made available to bring our land up to standard.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that people in western counties believe that we did not get the money which was allocated for certain schemes, and the local improvement scheme is a classic example.  In your constituency and mine, a Cheann Comhairle, the amount of money made available through that scheme has remained static in spite of the fact that extra funding was allocated from the EC through the western package.</P>
    <P>When new countries enter the EC they should look at their overall policy for development.  There is no comprehensive policy in regard to forestry and it is an area in which there should be a comprehensive policy which would benefit the whole European Community.  It is estimated that there will be an 8 per cent shortfall in the world supply of timber by the year 2000 and a 32 per cent shortfall by the year 2025.  The EC are only 50 per cent self-sufficient in regard to their timber needs and import approximately £10 billion worth of timber annually.  It is obvious that there is need for a comprehensive policy and we have an important role to play in the production of timber provided that we get support.</P>
    <P>The EC have a social policy programme which includes public and occupational health.  However, since the foundation of the Community, there has not been a co-ordinated health programme and this is something that the Community should look at because every western country, particularly those in Europe, has difficulty in funding health services and the demand for more and more health care.  A co-ordinated effort by the Governments and by Health Ministers in Europe would ensure that the health of people could be improved through the prevention of illness and through the promotion of good health. Governments must play an active role in this regard.  It is recognised that many diseases are caused by smoking, the abuse of drugs, including alcohol &mdash; and there are accidents, especially road accidents &mdash; and these are some of the areas where there should be a co-ordinated <Col N="1310" /> programme to prevent illness and accidents and to improve the health of communities generally.  The World Health Organisation have introduced a programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy O'Hanlon's interest in the area of health and his generous reference to it, but if we are to have a detailed discussion on all aspects of Common Market activities, it is not appropriate on the entry of two additional members to speak about health.  We should really be discussing whether Spain and Portugal should be admitted and how their admission will affect the Common Market. They are the relevant matters for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling and you will have noted that I have been very general in my comments so far.  I have glossed over areas into which I could have gone in great detail and I am just making a general reference to health because it should be a matter of concern that health has not been given a larger profile in the European Community.  With the entry of Spain and Portugal it is time to see if something can be done to ensure that it does assume a larger profile because the general health of the Community is inter-linked to the general development of the Community.  Naturally, the entry of Spain and Portugal is a major step in the development of the Community and I am merely making a general reference to these subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I enthusiastically welcome the entry of other European countries but, while we extend that welcome and realise that we must be good Europeans, it is important to protect our own vital national interests. I ask the Minister to use his influence in Europe to have another look at the special Border areas programme which has been responsible through the tourist orientated programmes in the past five years for a very welcome development and something that has been of benefit in improving the regions on both sides of the Border.  There will be new border regions when Spain and Portugal will <Col N="1311" /> enter the Community.  Border regions everywhere are recognised as being less well off.  I am disappointed that the tourist orientated programme which expires at the end of this year has not been funded again.  Questions arise with regard to industry in Border areas, of an industrial zone on each side of the Border and of support for small businesses.  It is disappointing that the North-South gas link was not proceeded with although I understand that there is a proposal before the Commission that £23 million should be spent on bringing gas to regions such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Cavan and Monaghan. I hope that programme will be expedited.</P>
    <P>I should like to see support from the EC, including the two new entrants, for the cross-Border economic development committees that are in existence.  They are properly constructed committees with representatives from the local authorities on both sides of the Border but they have not got the support to which they are entitled.  There is great opportunity for development in the Community and I should like to see them given the necessary support.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the European Community go back to the idealism of some of the founders of the Community, to the great visionaries of the time such as Monnet and Schuman, so that with Spain and Portugal all of us would be good Europeans while, at the same time, looking after our own national interest.  There is no conflict in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>As previous speakers have stated, negotiations have been successfully concluded to facilitate the entry of Spain and Portugal to the EC on 1 January 1986.  I should like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry as well as the officials who were in charge of the European Presidency during the latter stage of the negotiations in the second half of 1984.  It was very appropriate that the Presidency was in our hands at that time because this country has had <Col N="1312" /> long associations with Spain and Portugal.</P>
      <P>We have been told that probably some of the first settlers to this country along the western seaboard left the northern part of the Iberian peninsula.  Some of the structures they built here, such as the court cairns, gallery graves and passage graves are similar to those found in northern Spain.  The association was especially strong in the 16th century.  None of us has to be reminded of the Spanish Armada and the numbers of Spanish sailors who landed in various parts of the country from Dun an Óir in the south-west to Tory Island in the north-west. There was also the Kinsale campaign in 1601.  In Donegal we are very much aware that one of our most gallant warriors, Red Hugh, left this country for Spain and there is an Irish shrine in Valladolid where he rests.  We remember from our school days a very famous book, <i>Brian Óg</i> and the two Irish scholars who spent many years in an Irish college in Salamanca. The associations between our countries have been strong.  We have shared a common Christian heritage for thousands of years.</P>
      <P>Politically it is very important that Spain and Portugal should become members of the EC.  They are strategically placed in south-west Europe and their entry will increase the population of the Community by about 50 million.  For a moment or two we should consider the possibilities and the opportunities this will present to us.</P>
      <P>While Spain and Portugal are agricultural countries their produce will not be in direct competition with ours.  Their production will probably be mainly citrus fruits, wines and so on while ours will be dairy produce and beef.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, their entry to the Community will provide opportunities for our agricultural sector.  From the point of view of industry, there will be an additional 50 million people in the Community and this will give our industrialists many opportunities to extend their markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a coastal constituency where fishing plays an important role. <Col N="1313" /> It is also important for the economy of Donegal and for the country.  I must admit we are still afraid of the threat posed by the Spanish fishing fleet.  The fishing agreement negotiated and concluded by our Minister seems to safeguard our interests, at least on paper. One of the main conditions is that for the period 1985 to 1995 no Spanish vessel will be allowed inside the Irish box, a 50-mile zone around our coast.  However, as has been stated in this House, this regulation seems to be more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  Not a week passes that we do not read in the papers or see on the news bulletins reports of Spanish ships being escorted by our protection vessels into our ports.  Last year up to 100 such ships were apprehended in violation of the regulations and a similar number has been brought in this year.  I understand that in the fisheries regulations there is the condition that if a ship is caught on a third occasion having violated the rules such a vessel can be confiscated. When Spanish vessels are brought into our ports heavy fines are imposed but I do not think they have much effect.  My understanding is that there appears to be some understanding between the Spanish fishing fleet and the Spanish Government, whereby the latter pay most of the fines.  Thus, they are not much of a deterrent.  If we confiscated a ship that violated the regulations for a third time that would be a different matter.  In this country we have only a developing fishing fleet and we could make adequate use of any ship that might be confiscated.  One of the shortcomings of the Irish fishing fleet is a shortage of deep water or mid-water vessels.  I would advocate that this rule be looked at and if there are repeated violations it should be invoked.</P>
    <P>I believe there is another loophole.  A Bill was introduced here last year, and it is part of the common fisheries policy, which provided that Spanish ships could register with Irish companies.  I understand that at the moment a number of Spanish fishing vessels are registered in Ireland and are using Irish companies for flags of convenience.  I would not have very much against such an arrangement <Col N="1314" /> if their catches were landed in this country and the fish were processed here thus providing employment in the ports in the west.  Unfortunately, most of this fish is transported directly to the home country thus providing extra jobs there.  I ask the Minister and the Government to have a long hard look at this rule which enables Spanish ships to register here.  My understanding is that any fish they catch could be taken as part of the Irish quota.</P>
    <P>I was particularly glad to see the Minister in Brussels earlier this week defending our interests.  There is a rule in the fishery policy which allows a number of Spanish vessels into the 50 to 200 mile zone, but they have to be licensed on a monthly basis.  An attempt was made to interpret that regulation in a different way that these ships would be licensed daily.  It is difficult to monitor the present situation but if that interpretation were put on it, it would be almost impossible to do so when we are dealing with a huge fishing fleet of 16,000 vessels.  I compliment the Minister for the stand he took on this issue which I understand is on the point of being cleared up.</P>
    <P>We have had a long association with Spain and Portugal and it is to the advantage of the Community that they are becoming full members of the EC on 1 January next.  But coming from a coastal area I would want every guarantee possible that our interests, especially in the fishing industry, will be protected.  Our fishing industry is only in its infancy &mdash; 1,500 or 1,600 fishing vessels &mdash; compared with Spain who have 16,000 fishing vessels.  From discussions I had yesterday I learned that the Spanish fishing industry are busily engaged in building more ships. Perhaps they are preparing for the day when they have access to our zone.  The Spanish authorities are committed to negotiations to secure an orderly and phased access by their ships to the Irish box after 1995.  I believe the rules and regulations which have been negotiated will safeguard our fishing industry and give it time to develop if they are adhered to but the evidence at the moment is that they are not.  I hope help will be available <Col N="1315" /> from the EC to help us monitor the situation and to protect our interests.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the entry of Spain and Portugal but with that provision.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  San díospóireacht tá deis againn athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí ó chuamar isteach san EC tuairim agus leath scór bhliain ó shin agus a fheiceáil cé chaoi an bhfuil cúrsaí i láthair na huaire maidir lenár mballraíocht san EC agus cén tábhacht a bheidh ann san am atá le teacht.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss our position in the EC.  It gives us an opportunity of looking back over what has happened in the last decade since we gained entry, to look at the future and what we see in store for Ireland, our economy and the development of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>We have seen tremendous benefit for our farming community; new markets were made available and the standard of living in rural Ireland improved tremendously as a result of our entry to the EC. It appeared that a new dawn was breaking and great hope was generated as a result of our membership.  It is unfortunate that these bright lights have been dimmed. When one looks at the operation of the EC in relation to agriculture, the Regional Fund, FEOGA grants, and the Social Fund, there seems to be a considerable lack of planning or a sense of taking a forward position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take agriculture, for instance.  Our farmers, particularly our small farmers, were advised to go into milk and dairy farming.  This was taken to be the role that would help their economic position. We are told we have an over-production in milk.  There is now a question mark as to the amount of beef we should be producing because the markets do not seem to be stable or certain.  We have beef mountains, butter mountains and all kinds of mountains of agricultural products which are costing the Community around £5 million a day in storage alone. No matter how we look at it we have to <Col N="1316" /> admit that something is terribly wrong. If this trend continues, I cannot see that there will be any future for the farming community, and agriculture in particular. It is time that the whole question of the management of these matters was looked at in order to ensure that there is some hope for agriculture and the future of our small farmers.</P>
    <P>The regional policy would operate far more effectively if local authorities were given an opportunity of preparing plans and applying directly to the EC for funds rather than having the funds directed through central Government.  We see from time to time while driving through the country notices to the effect that certain road works are being funded by the European Community, but if one were to inquire from a local authority as to the extent to which they have benefited from the Regional Fund the figure would be very small indeed.  We have a great deal to do in the development of our infrastructure and much of the bureaucracy entailed in the preparation of schemes and applying for grants could be dealt with far more expeditiously if local authorities were in a position to deal directly with those responsible for the distribution of these funds.</P>

      <P>The Chair would not wish to interrupt the Deputy but, as the Chair sees it, this is not a review of events since 1972 or whenever we joined the Common Market.  If the Deputy, while making passing references to our experience in the Common Market, could relate his remarks to the enlargement of the Community, it would be more in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to quibble with the Chair but there are many references in the Minister's speech to what has happened since our entry.  The enlargement of the EC will not benefit us to any great extent because Spain and Portugal are countries whose economies are not too sound.  They would be regarded as being in a bracket more or less like our own and this means there will be a greater demand on some of the <Col N="1317" /> EC funds, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the FEOGA grants.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Social Fund, perhaps the Minister would let us know if it is the policy of the EC to continue funding as at present.  We are getting quite a lot of money from the Social Fund and it is providing help but in many areas the money is not used to provide stable employment.  Much is spent on various schemes of training courses for young people but these schemes do not seem to lead anywhere.  It is time for more positive thinking in relation to the spending of this money so that these training courses will lead to something worthwhile. In the regional colleges and universities we have a great number of students and while I welcome the opportunity these students are getting to have this type of education, I wonder if it will be possible for them to gain any great advantage at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>A great deal of concern is being expressed about our fisheries as a result of the entry of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  I would agree with much that has been said by other Deputies. Recognition is not being given to the fact that our fishing industry is just beginning to develop and expand.  One of our problems on gaining entry to the Community was to compete with the other member states to get the best advantage for our fishermen.  At a time when we have quotas for mackerel, herring and various other species it seems ludicrous that we are to have 150 Spanish vessels coming in right away to fish our waters.  We are not sure of our position in relation to the agreement on Spanish entry.  If licences are not properly controlled the situation will become worse.  It is not sufficient for ships of our Naval Service to arrest and take in fishermen caught fishing illegally. Far more stringent measures will have to be taken to ensure that fishermen from Spain and other member states keep the rules.</P>

      <P>The taking in of these people is very often a joke because some boats are used as a decoy so that when our Naval Service is engaged in taking them to port the other boats can get down to the business of fishing illegally.</P>
      <P>We must adopt a far tougher line in relation to all aspects of our membership. We have been good members of the European Community.  We play by the rules and we find that the French, the British and others blatantly break the rules as it suits them in looking after their national interests.  According to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 4 November the Germans say that we should have been far tougher in our dealings with the EC to ensure that we got better terms for our people on the entry of Spain and Portugal.  It is an indictment of our Government and our people working for us in Europe that any outside state or representative should make a statement of that kind.  It proves that we are too fond of playing the rules, of acting the good European, when we should be far more aggressive in trying to ensure that we get a better deal for our people here.</P>
      <P>Matters will be far tougher in the future for us in the EC with Portugal and Spain being members.  Our representatives in Europe will have to fight very strongly to ensure that our markets for lamb, beef and fish are guaranteed and that the benefits which we thought would be available to us on our entry to the EC will continue.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5 November tells us that farmers are facing five lean years and that their income in real terms may drop by 18 per cent over the next five years, so it behoves our people at EC level to try to protect all our interests in agriculture, fishing and other areas for which they have responsibility to gain the best advantage for us.</P>
      <P>The amount made available to us under the Regional Fund has been very disappointing. We have gained nothing like what we expected from that fund since joining.</P>

      <P>Enlargement of the EC is welcome to a certain extent, but we must treat the entry of the Iberian nations, Spain and Portugal, with a certain amount of caution especially from the fishing point of view.  Their entry will have very little impact on the future of our agricultural industry because we are blessed with a climate second to none as far as agriculture is concerned.  The barren, volcanic regions of Spain and Portugal will never lend themselves to agricultural production in the climate they have in that part of the world.  However, we cannot rest on our oars in this respect.  Their climate will not permit them to measure up to our agricultural production, but I must say that both the Spanish and Portuguese people are by nature very crafty.  We will be at a disavantage against them in fishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Their production of vines, olives and citrus fruits will pose no threat to our economy, but it will pose a threat to a great many other European nations, particularly Italy, Germany and France.  This in turn will lead to further confusion within the EC.  The greatest threat to us, naturally, will be the fishing industry.  Everybody knows that the greatest attraction for Spanish entry to the EC was access to our lucrative fishing grounds.  I admit that a very sound agreement has been made with Spain regarding <Col N="1320" /> fishing around this country and for the next ten years we will repel them with a certain degree of success from infiltrating into our fishing grounds.  However, their history during the past three decades regarding this country's fishing industry has been notorious, to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>In this respect I can say safely that we are fishing for trouble with the advent of Spanish and Portuguese entry to the EC. As a Member of this House who has the privilege of visual proof of the indiscriminate rape of our fishing grounds off our south west coast for the past two decades, I can say that the greatest offender of all the marauding foreign powers that have pilfered our fishing stocks was the Spanish fishing armada.  We have seen what happened with the German, Danish, French and Dutch trawlers when we joined the EC.  They played their part in creating havoc in our fishing stocks and breeding grounds.  I am very much afraid that, no matter how well we try to ensure the upholding of the agreement they have signed, it will be all we can do under present circumstances to get that agreement upheld.</P>
      <P>For that matter I am very much in favour of our Minister for Foreign Affairs and our MEPs advocating that special concessions be made for Ireland's case to preserve our fishing industry.  If we lose this valuable asset, our economy will be much the poorer.  Because of our climate, agricultural produce constitutes our main export, but we are very fortunate in that the North Atlantic Ocean surrounds our shores and we have one of the most prolific breeding grounds for fish on the whole globe off our south-west coast. Everybody is aware that the quality of fish in the North Atlantic is second to none.  The fish caught off the Canary Islands, Spain or Portugal cannot compare with the fish being pilfered from our valuable fish beds off the west and south west coasts.  That is the reason why the price of fish caught off Ireland and being sold in Spain has increased by leaps and bounds and is the major attraction for Spanish trawlers who take a chance and ravage our fishing grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most astounding revelations <Col N="1321" /> about the activities of the Spanish pirate fishing boats in our waters is that some of the boats have been caught twice and three times.  Any law which cannot be enforced is a bad one.  Some of the Spanish trawlers have made serious attempts to interfere with our fishery patrol vessels. Under international law, if our patrol vessels sank a Spanish trawler, there would be an uproar and many diplomatic protests to the Government.  I should like to know what would happen if Irish fishermen invaded Spanish fishing waters.  One can be certain that, instead of being arrested and accompanied into port, the Spanish would sink the boat.</P>
    <P>When there are serious incidents, as happened in recent years, between Spanish trawlers and our fishery patrol vessels, the Government should protest vehemently to the Spanish authorities. They should take up the hot line to Madrid immediately and insist on an apology and compensation for any damage caused.  Any Spanish or foreign trawler caught poaching in our fishing grounds on two occasions should be confiscated. Unless we take such serious measures, our lucrative fishing industry will vanish in the next decade.  Prevention is the cure.  The Government should take strong action against any intruders.  I am aware of what our fishing industry means to those living along the south and western seaboards.  I know what it means to the people who live between Malin Head and Mizen Head.  Were it not for that industry, those regions would be inhabited now by the badgers and foxes.</P>
    <P>We want to preserve our population along the western seaboard and to ensure that those involved in the fishing industry obtain a decent standard of living.  In the case of habitual offenders the normal practice is to increase the penalty but, in my view, in such cases not alone should the penalty be increased but the boat and gear should be confiscated.  A strong case can be made for such stern action in the case of second offenders.  Over and above the need to enforce the law to preserve our threatened fish stocks the Government should take stronger diplomatic action when the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> I have no doubt that the entry of Spain will pose big problems for us.  They will try to insist on having special rights as a member of the Community.  If the Spanish Government were prepared to honour the deal reached, they would be welcome in the EC.  In fact, the country's entry could prove beneficial to our fishing industry if they operated processing factories along our western seaboard.  We should be careful about giving any concession to the Spaniards to establish a landing centre and ensure that they get involved in processing.  There will not be much gain for our workers if we allow Spanish boats to land at Castletownbere, Killybegs, or Rossaveal for the purpose of preparing their catch for export to Europe.  That will not result in employment here.  We should insist that 75 per cent of all catches landed here by Spanish and foreign trawlers are processed here. That would create a lot of employment along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Spain and Portugal have a right to take their place in Europe and Europe is obliged to accept them, but those countries must be warned by member states that they should respect their obligations to other countries, especially Ireland where we depend to a great degree on agriculture and fishing.  We cannot compete with Spain and Portugal in regard to tourism because we are not blessed with the tropical climate they enjoy, but there should be special recognition for the fact that we depend on agriculture and fishing.  For too long our fishing industry was treated as a Cinderella concern and we did not take the proper steps to build it up.  We did not explore its prospects.  It is a pity that it has taken us so long to realise its potential.  Without conservation and preservation of our fish breeding grounds that industry will die a sudden death.  It is most important that we treat this subject with the respect it deserves.  On the threshold of European entry and after two years of austerity a case could be made for a degree of preparedness by Spain.</P>
    <P>With the entry of Spain and Portugal into the EC will come an enlargement of the already existing problems.  These nations have a right to become members <Col N="1323" /> but we will be faced with greater problems in the field of unemployment.  I believe that there is a total of 2.8 million people unemployed in Spain at present, an increase of nearly 500,000 since the end of 1983.  This will add to the growing ranks of the unemployed within all member states, with the serious problems which that can bring in its wake.</P>
    <P>In December 1984, I warned that the Spanish people and Government were preparing to milk the benefits of joining the EC.  At that stage their inflation rate stood at 9.5 per cent, being down from 12.2 per cent in the previous December and from 14.4 per cent in December 1982.  That will show the way Spain is preparing for entry into the Community. At the end of last year that country enjoyed a current account surplus of £2 billion.  This is in stark contrast to the £2.3 billion deficit at the end of 1983 &mdash; a £2 million surplus 12 months later.  This shows how they are girding themselves for entry into the Community.  Their improved external account, together with the £1.9 billion inflow of foreign investment and tourism income &mdash; the latter being their greatest earner, of course &mdash; left them £1 billion up on the previous year.</P>
    <P>Spanish Finance Ministry officials claim that the reserves at the end of last year represented 50 per cent of the total foreign debt and that this was the highest ration within the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. One can gauge from these figures how they are preparing to make an impact and to milk the benefits of EC membership. The most alarming feature of all is the 2.8 million extra unemployed who are now coming into the Community to swell the ranks already there.</P>
    <P>Portugal will not create so serious an impact on our economy on entry into the EC.  They are a very old, historic nation and Portuguese is still spoken by one million people in Brazil, a country which chose independence in 1823.  Their former colonies in Africa got independence between 1961 and 1974.  There and in parts of Asia the language of the people <Col N="1324" /> is still Portuguese.  There are almost five million immigrant Portuguese living in different Continents throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Lisbon, the capital, sits, like Rome, on seven hills.  That city was once the heart of an empire which stretched further around the globe than the outposts of Caesar.  They were a very strong force, as the House knows, in the early centuries and certainly made their impact at that time.  I have no doubt that they will again make their impact on the EC and on the reserves which are badly needed already by the present Ten that, with the advent of the two Iberian nations, will become a dozen member community.</P>
    <P>We must face facts.  Like any other nation, the Portuguese seek distraction from their worries.  Of their population, three-quarters watch two TV channels serving up a <i>pot pourri</i> of domestic and imported material.  The male population is often football minded.  You could describe them as happy go lucky people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>A minority of the population watch bullfights.  Those who can, flock to the beaches and to camp sites in good weather and young athletes dream of emulating Carlos Lopez's achievements in the 1984 Olympic games.  These people will have their hands out for any benefits they can get and will try to milk the golden cow of the EC as much as possible.  I can guarantee that they will certainly be apt pupils as far as getting their rightful share from the EC is concerned. We must prepare to make sure that the Common Market is not turned into a common warren, and that if there is to be a vibrant, truthful, strong, economic unit in the EC every country plays its part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure that every country that accepts the accession terms of Treaties with the Community will uphold those terms.  We are quickly told that if we produce too much we are subject to levies; that if we fish too many mackerel we are subject to levies; that if we exceed <Col N="1325" /> our production in any of the agreements outlined by the EC we must take steps to curb that.  I wonder what steps Spain and Portugal will take to curb that.  I wonder what steps Spain and Portugal will take to curb their activities when they become fully fledged members of the Community.</P>
    <P>We must be vigilant as far as those two nations are concerned that if there is an agreement imposing stern conditions for their accession, these two countries will honour those signed documents and will not ride roughshod over those agreements but will honour their obligations as members of the EC.  Until such time as that is ensured and until such time as our Government, Minister and MEPs ensure that Ireland gets preferential treatment regarding the preservation of our fishing industry &mdash; one of our oldest natual industries &mdash; until such time as Ireland gets that recognition in the Community I for one would be very doubtful that we could carry out adequate patrolling of our fishing grounds with our present fishery patrol vessels.</P>
    <P>While one Spanish trawler is brought into port and the fishermen kept there awaiting trial, up to a dozen other boats may be marauding in our fishing waters. The patrol vessel which comes in with the arrested Spanish trawler must be relieved of the responsibility of ensuring that the boat is kept there until dealt with by the courts.  The patrol vessel should be able to return immediately to our coastal waters because our fishermen need protection from foreign marauders.  They are not asking for too much.  Since the age of man began a time comes for people to protect their interests, in whatever walk of life.  The time has come for our fishermen to insist that their interests are preserved by the Government and that they are allowed to make a living where their forefathers did before them, allowed to ensure that our fishing stocks are preserved for the sons coming after them in the decades to come.  We do not want to see the fishing grounds off our western seaboard becoming a deserted ocean without fish life which is so necessary to <Col N="1326" /> continue the prosperous industry which can thrive on its rich harvest.</P>
    <P>The entry of Spain and Portugal is welcome, but with a caution.  I hope our Government will insist where possible that all the necessary legislation will be enacted and adhered to and that the provisions in the accession agreements will be honoured by those two Iberian countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheehan is perhaps understandably preoccupied with the impact of Spain and Portugal on the European Community and the craft they will demonstrate in milking the benefits from the Community.  The implication seems to be that because of their craft and guile we will be the losers.  I hope that Spain and Portugal make a major impact on the European Community whether because of their craft and guile, as Deputy Sheehan calls it, or because of their imperial past, which has given them a considerable experience in international negotiations, or the spirit of Real Madrid, Benfica or Carlos Lopez. They have demonstrated a great spirit of adventure.  I hope that all of this and more will be brought to bear on the European Community as a consequence of the accession of Spain and Portugal and that they will make a major impact.  The European Community needs a major impact from whatever source, for whatever reason, at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate offers us an opportunity to consider where the European Community now stands and how far it has progressed along the road to achieving the fundamental aims of the Community. We joined the Community on the basis of the Treaty of Rome and our Treaty of Accession.  Spain and Portugal are now to join on the same basis.  While we are understandably preoccupied with the impact on the Regional and Social Funds, the CAP and the fishing industry, I should like to dwell on the preoccupation all of us should have in trying to renew the whole spirit of Europe and make it much more meaningful for the citizens of Europe.  We would be deluding ourselves <Col N="1327" /> if we thought that the European Community is as relevant today as it was when the Treaties were launched 30 years ago. How relevant does it appear to be to the unemployed in Europe, whose numbers have increased more than two and a half times in the past ten years?</P>
    <P>It is time to recognise the reality that the non-EC countries in Europe, such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Austria, have come through the recent recession in a far healthier economic state than the countries in the European Community.  Allowing for different structures and growth patterns, it is quite extraordinary that the levels of growth in these countries over the past five years have far exceeded the levels of growth of member states of the EC and similarly the levels of unemployment in those other countries are very much lower than in even the most prosperous states of the Community.  Somehow that spirit of pride and enterprise is at least as evident in those countries as it is in the EC, which has turned in on itself and become preoccupied with such issues as &ldquo;How much will they take from us?&rdquo;  or &ldquo;How much will we have to give to them?&rdquo;&mdash; wrangles of the kind which have been associated particularly with the budget issue and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>We must consider where the Community is going and where its failures have been.  There is talk now about the need for a new Treaty, and I am glad to see Deputy Tom O'Donnell is here because this point has been mentioned in Parliament, one of the hopeful signs of the Community.  We have not even begun to implement the principles of the old Treaty.  The Treaty, which started with the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, was concerned with the common commitment to secure peace in Europe and it resolved as follows:</P>
    <P>to substitute for age-old rivalries the merging of their essential interests, to create by establishing an economic community, the basis for a broader and deeper community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts: and to lay <Col N="1328" /> the foundations for institutions which will give direction to a destiny henceforward shared.</P>
    <P>That was a Treaty between nations which were hitherto divided in war and the purpose was to secure the peace by a shared commitment to the economic well-being of the member states.  It was followed in 1957 by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community:</P>
    <P>...to lay the foundations for institutions which will give directions to a destiny henceforward shared among the people of Europe.</P>
    <P>This was on the basis of economic programmes, closer understanding and common commitments to basic principles.</P>
    <P>Where is that now?  How much are we seeing of the ever closer union between the peoples of Europe?  At European Council level what we are doing is engaging in constant wrangles between Heads of Government, some of whom are trying to demonstrate their muscle and their authority in an institution which was not part and should never have become part of the institutions of the original treaties. We often call down the god figures Schumann, de Gaspari, Spaak, as if we are somehow adhering to what they did in Rome.  They knew when they framed those Treaties that they had the overwhelming endorsement of all of their peoples.  The Treaties were framed to give expression to the will of the peoples all over Europe.  That was the feeling at the time.  The feeling then was called &ldquo;the high tide of democracy in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Thirty years on, it has to be acknowledged that the age old rivalries in war have been banished from the member states.  That is an achievement.  We were not involved in those age old rivalries: we had our own troubled history, with just one rivalry, which constantly dominated us here.  The EC has achieved an end to those rivalries and that is its greatest achievement in my view, but perhaps that is not always appreciated by those of us who were not caught up in those bloody conflicts throughout this century so far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> Our latest indications of the progress being made were given in the elections to the European Parliament.  Can anyone say that in these elections, in any of the member states, the issues before the people were European interests?  Those elections had very low turnouts throughout the Community states.  Did not that indicate to us that the peoples of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Britain and Ireland did not see the relevance of the EC to their problems?  It is time we recognised the realities and compared the employment levels now and the high hopes we had in Ireland in regard to the regional fund and agricultural policy for Europe when we joined the Community 13 or 14 years ago.  European issues were not relevant in the parliamentary elections because the prevailing attitude of the peoples was apathetic to the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The EC suffered as a consequence of the apathy of the peoples.  Our people here could not be expected to have read the Preamble to the Rome Treaty but, if they had, they could not readily accept that the member states or the institutions of the Community have been, and I quote from the preamble, &ldquo;affirming as the essential objective of their efforts the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of our peoples&rdquo;.  The Treaties and their promoters at the time could be said to be the high tide of democracy in Europe but it is fair enough to say that the European experience in recent times would indicate the ebb tide of democracy in Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament suffers from the failures of the other institutions to adhere to the stated aims and objectives of the Treaties.  We are now expected to talk about new Treaties.  In Europe we are faced with challenges which do not require a new treaty as has been suggested in bilaterial discussions between Heads of Governments.  What we really require is a renewal of a contract to build on the solid foundations of the original Treaty.  If the EC is to have any relevance or meaning that is what it must be about now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> There is no surge of feeling in Europe at the moment for a new treaty.  There is scepticism if not cynicism at our failure to make the EC responsive to the needs of today as the original Treaty was to the needs of yesterday.  The original Treaty laid the foundations for the institutions but, in my experience, the institutions have failed lamentably to give direction, to quote the Preamble, to a destiny which would henceforward be shared.  Were they meant to be mere words that we call down on occasions and then engage in our own constant battling with each other, when the big dominate the weak?</P>
    <P>We have had twice yearly meetings of Heads of Governments in the past decade.  Go for a day, home for a day, in the full glare of summit publicity.  The manner in which these meetings of Heads of Governments &mdash; they were not part of the original Treaty &mdash; have dominated the activities of the European Community. That is the single biggest problem of the EC in recent times.  The European Council were meant to promote and give authority and direction at the highest level of the EC institutions, namely, Commission, Parliament and Council, in the discharge of the proposals in the Treaty.  The meetings of heads of states are not in themselves an institution under the Treaty and as such are not subject to the conditions and disciplines of the Treaty.  Consequently, what have we seen happen?</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was predictable, but from time to time we have seen the British Government and the current Prime Minister &mdash; I have personally seen it &mdash; with little or no awareness, literally dominating discussions in the European Council which were meant to give direction to the future of Europe.  There was one preoccupation, the budget issue and the share that Britain would take.  Is it any wonder that we have turned in on ourselves in Europe?  Is it any wonder that nations outside the EC are making greater progress than those of us in the EC?  The whole wrangle has been about preoccupation with who pays which share and who gets what back, in this instance the British, in regard to a budget which <Col N="1331" /> is already clearly inadequate to meet the commitments of Europe as it is, much less Europe as it will be with the accession of Spain and Portugal.  I will give samples of some of the claims that have been made in relation to the budget and Britain's contribution to it.  Up to almost 50 per cent of what the British Prime Minister claims to be Britain's contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is clearly needed in terms of the management and direction of Europe are policies across the whole range of areas, industrial innovation, research and development, all of <Col N="1332" /> which raise the matter of vital technological development not being promoted in Europe at this time.  More money is being dissipated by individual efforts of member states, for instance on research and development, than the total amount being spent on research and development and technology in the United States or Japan.  Though we are spending more than they do, we are reacting to the technological advances they have made because we have failed to find a common cause.</P>
      <P>There is no common programme for research and development or for industrial innovation, although the policies have existed and have been contained in the mandate proposals from the Commission since the period during which I was involved.  They are all awaiting implementation.  The reality is that when they meet, the Heads of Government are more concerned with battling with each other, giving the impression, after one day's attendance three times a year, that they have somehow achieved something significant, dominating the news headlines in the full glare of summit publicity. It is time they learned a little about Europe and began to allow its institutions to operate.</P>
      <P>In this context I want to demonstrate the extent of the problem.  Almost 50 per cent of what the British Government claim to be their contribution to the EC comes from agricultural levies and common customs tariffs.</P>

      <P>The title reads:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Bill</P>
      <P Just="Center">entitled</P>
      <P>An Act to amend the European Communities Act, 1972, so as to provide that the treaty concerning the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community and the decision of the Council of the European Communities relating to the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Coal and Steel Community shall be part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
      <P>If you are going to tell me, A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that addressing the fundamental role of the European Coal and Steel Community, and where it is failing, is not relevant, then I do not know what is relevant.</P>

      <P>What is in order in this discussion is the matter of the accession of Spain and Portugal and the effect of such accession on the Community. That is the basis of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues we shall have to face in the context of the accession of Spain and Portugal &mdash; rather than wrangles about whether or not contributions that are, in reality to 50 per cent in Britain's case &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; of the EC &mdash; is the whole question of the increase of those &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;.  That is in order to ensure that, after the accession of Spain and Portugal &mdash; and hopefully in the future, because who is to draw a limit to the European Community simply in the interests of those of us who are within at present &mdash; we shall have adequate resources to fund the policies of the European Community as laid down in the Treaty, starting with the European Coal and Steel Community, quoted in the long title of this Bill.  That is where the failure exists at present.  No adequate <Col N="1335" /> resources are being provided.  The ceiling on VAT is still being adhered to as a consequence of decisions of the European Council, which is affecting the Council of Ministers and the Commission that has not had the courage and authority to face the European Council and the Council of Ministers though I would have to acknowledge that the new Commission is showing a fair bit more guts and authority than its predecessor.</P>
      <P>Our habit within the European Community in recent times has been to concentrate on what is called the cost of it. The Common Market is the term used even today in the debate.  We are not just dealing with a Common Market.  We are dealing with what is specifically said in the long title of this Bill to be the European Economic Community and I want to say a few words on that.  The Common Market will always give advantage to the strong trading nations to derive maximum opportunity and benefit from the accession of new members.  The Federal Republic of Germany, France and Britain &mdash; incidentally whose exports to the Community have increased considerably by almost £10 billion since they joined&mdash; are the first countries who can benefit from the accession of new member states because they are in an economic position to do so.  They have much greater capacity to exploit new markets.  To that extent the availability of these two new additional markets, plus the countries with which Spain and Portugal have had considerable trading associations over the years, will constitute a major boost to the trading pattern of the major economies of Europe.  If that is the case the resources of the European Community and the policies necessary to maintain a balanced economic development within the European Community must be fairly and properly provided by those same member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tired of hearing anyone referred to as the paymasters of Europe.  I do not intend to engage in any attack on Government &mdash; in this instance it is a bigger issue as far as I am concerned &mdash;<Col N="1336" /> but I hear the Germans say that we bungled EC aid.  They are described, in this article I have to hand, as the paymasters of Europe.  They are no such thing.  How can people claim to be paymasters when they derive more benefits than we do from the trade avenues open to them? If the rules of the Community say that contributions are made it is time we recognised that that is the basis of the Community.  We must get away from the notion that Germany, Britain or anybody else are the paymasters and that the rest of us are holding the begging bowl.  If the principles of the Treaty are implemented it is clear that the so-called paymasters gain much from free trade within the Community.  The reason the founding members introduced that balance was to ensure that the gains made would not be of such a nature as to create an imbalance between them and the other member states in the Community.  The reason for the policies was to ensure that the imbalance would not be of such a nature as to prevent the idea of anything like a balanced Community ever developing.</P>
    <P>With the accession of Spain and Portugal we should be talking about the role and obligation of the people of all member states to ensure that there are adequate resources to fund the policies for the necessary development of Europe.  Maybe the policies of the founding fathers are irrelevant, perhaps they were just flowing phrases which meant nothing.  Maybe we should tell the young people of the Community that the role of Europe is not to generate policies for employment or industrial innovation. However, we must be realistic and recognise that that is Europe's role, the role which was contemplated and presented in the Treaties and it is time that we all faced that reality.  I must tell the member states who are about to join the Community that it is not full of vigour, awareness of its history, confident of its future or concerned about the citizens of its member states.  I am afraid they are joining a Community composed of a bureaucracy which does not have much contact with the problems in unemployed centres <Col N="1337" /> throughout the Community.  I do not know whether the nature of the Commission and the level of salaries paid there are such as to isolate people from these problems but those who are charged with implementing the ideals of the Community should never allow themselves to get too far from realities and the crushing burden which they impose on so many people.  If they were in touch with reality, perhaps there would be a sense of urgency in implementing policies which have not been put into practice.  Tindemans was an excellent, committed European and his report still awaits implementation.  There are many other reports gathering dust on shelves; each new prime minister comes up with an idea but these reports are never acted on.  The Tindemans report is the most outstanding and it is time that we threw it in the dustbin or acted upon it.  Will we ensure that the Commission is independent or will we watch that independence being undermined as has been happening for a considerable time?  Will we ensure that the Council of Ministers will in fact be a council comprising as it does members from each Government who are not conscious of the Council of Ministers being from a big or a small country as they were at the European Council in the days of Helmut Schmidt, Giscard D'Estaing, Mitterand or Margaret Thatcher?  The Council of Ministers is an institution of the Community and it must be promoted as such.  The European Council should be in the background where it belongs because it has put the Community on a course far from that for which it was originally established.</P>
    <P>We can look on the accession of Spain and Portugal as a crushing problem which will cause all kinds of difficulties for us. I will not deal with fisheries or agriculture because there are others who are better equipped to deal with these subjects. Even allowing for the advantage that bigger powers have in exploiting the opportunities of trade in the European Community, we have failed to exploit opportunities in our own interest.  We must not always blame others because our market penetration in Europe is <Col N="1338" /> deplorably weak.  We have relied on FEOGA guarantees but we have done little or nothing to effectively exploit the opportunities in that huge market of 260 million people which will now be well in excess of that number.  The only way to exploit that market is by becoming familiar with it and until such time as the young people in whom we should invest, not for short term six month schemes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To use your own words, it is a passing reference.  We must educate our young people for the opportunities which exist in promoting market outlets and that means language familiarity which is part of the European experience where our young people will feel as much at home in the Netherlands as the Belgians do and <i>vice versa</i>.  Until we achieve that we will not be successful and it is time that we adopted a vigorous and aggressive approach.  I welcome the growing awareness of the need to promote a proper marketing strategy and it forms a central role in the policies of Fianna Fáil.  I hope that we can reallocate resources to education for permanent employment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that as a compliment from Deputy Kelly and we will have to develop that point at greater length some other time.  Leo Tindemans said that if we want to give the Europeans of tomorrow a personal and concrete impression of the European reality and a detailed knowledge of what it should be, then we must also teach them a deep appreciation of our languages, our cultures and everything that makes us different from each other but at the same time sharing a common European inheritance. It is time we recognised that our language is a special part of that culture, something that is respected by the Europeans even more than by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Europe of tomorrow will be much closer to the concept of Europe launched by the founding fathers 30 years ago than to the Europe we have witnessed in the past five or ten years.  I hope that in the Europe of tomorrow the cultural pluralism spoken of by people such as Leo Tindemans will be a major feature so that all of us will have something of which we can be proud.  Perhaps our contribution to that development will be even greater than what we claim it has been in the past.  Perhaps then we will not confine ourselves when talking about new member states merely to a reaction to the problems that may cause for us but <Col N="1340" /> rather that we will see the opportunities an expanded Europe will have for all of us in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá gur cúis áthais go bhfuil an deis seo agam labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo faoi leathnú an Chomhphobal.  Cúis áthais dúinn go léir go bhfuil an Spáin agus an Phortaingéil ag teacht isteach.</P>
      <P>As a Member of this House who also has the privilege of being a member of the European Parliament, I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution in this very important and historic debate.  The enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal is a logical, natural and desirable development.  It can truthfully be said that the extension of the Community to embrace Spain and Portugal &mdash; the Iberian peninsula &mdash; is a step that has received widespread support throughout the Community of Ten.  It is also true that the accession of Spain and Portugal is supported and endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>This morning Deputy McGinley referred to the historic and cultural links between the Iberian peninsula and this small island country on the northern periphery of the Community.  These links are very strong.  It is appropriate that the Deputy should have referred to them because when one travels throughout Spain, and in particular Madrid, one sees such Donegal names as O'Neill and O'Donnell quite frequently.  I was pleased on a recent visit to Madrid to the Congress of the European Christian Democrats to find that one of the main thoroughfares in that city is Calle O'Donnell. We have a common Celtic heritage and this has significant implications in the context of evolving European union.  The accession of Spain and Portugal will add to the diversity and richness of our European cultural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must remember that the negotiations for the accession of Spain and Portugal were difficult, complex and protracted.  That was understandable. We are talking about a peninsula on the south western periphery of the EC.  The <Col N="1341" /> accession of Spain and Portugal has major implications for the other Mediterranean countries of the Community and it has also implications for this small island country on the northern periphery of Europe <i>vis-à-vis</i> agriculture and also the regional policy.  The accession of those countries poses major problems in relation to the whole future of the Community's regional policy.  However, despite the accession problems, goodwill prevailed on all sides.  It is only right and proper that we should place on record the significant contribution made by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs during our Presidency.  In particular, the Dublin summit in December 1984 marked the final breakthrough towards the successful conclusion of what were detailed and complex negotiations.</P>
    <P>This morning other Members referred to various aspects of the enlargement of the Community.  I listened to Deputy Sheehan dealing at length with the implications of enlargement for our fishing industry and Deputy McGinley also spoke on that point but because those implications have been dealt with in detail I will not speak on that aspect.</P>
    <P>In his speech last week Deputy Collins on the other side of the House spoke about European regional policy.  To put the whole matter of enlargement in a proper context it may be well to give a few facts and figures, particularly in relation to regional disparities.  These disparities will be far greater in a Community of 12 than in a Community of Ten and certainly immensely greater than they were in the original Community of Six.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal will increase the total GDP by 8 per cent and the population by 18 per cent.  From our point of view it is significant that it will practically double the population of the weakest regions. The number of people employed in agriculture will increase by 37 per cent as against 14 per cent for those employed in industry.  Agricultural products will increase by 24 per cent compared with <Col N="1342" /> slightly more than 6 per cent in the case of industrial products.</P>
    <P>Highly significant from our point of view is the fact that in the enlarged Community of 12 regions with a <i>per capita</i> GDP below 60 per cent of the average of the Community of 12 will cover approximately 60 million inhabitants, nearly 20 per cent of the total population of the enlarged Community.  It will cover all of Portugal, Greece, Ireland, the Mezzogiorno region of southern Italy and more than half of Spain.  This means that the demands on the European Regional Development Fund will be immensely greater.  We have to realise that the implementation of a realistic and coherent regional policy now becomes a matter of the greatest urgency.  The Regional Policy Committee in the European Parliament last week completed a major study on the regional implications of the enlargement of the Community and a debate will take place in the European Parliament, Strasbourg, on this very important issue next week.</P>
    <P>If the Community is to progress, and if the objective of European Union is to become a reality, the major problem which has to be tackled, particularly in view of the enlargement, is the widening regional disparities within the Community. As far as I can remember, in the original Community the ratio between the richest and the poorest regions was one to four, then one to six, then one to eight and now it is one to 12.  These are frightening disparities but unfortunately they were widening all the time.  It has been an unfortunate characteristic of the Community that the rich regions tended to get richer while the poor regions tended to get poorer.  With the accession of Spain and Portugal we are bringing in a vast area with a <i>per capita</i> income lower than the poorest regions of the existing Community.  As far as I can recall, the inhabitants of 34 per cent of the geographic area of Spain and Portugal have a <i>per capita</i> income lower than the lowest region in the present Community.  We must have a realistic regional policy, otherwise this trend will be worsened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> There have been significant developments in the past year with the introduction of the integrated Mediterranean programmes.  One of the problems caused by the accession of Spain and Portugal was the economic and social implications for Italy, the south of France and the Mezzogiorno.  To overcome these difficulties a programme of regional development was formulated for the Mediterranean region, now known as the integrated Mediterranean programmes. This is an entirely new approach to regional policy.  It is a logical and practical approach and, in my view, it will have to be applied to other underdeveloped regions of the Community.  This raises the question of the undeveloped regions in the north-west of the Community.  On our accession the whole island of Ireland was regarded as one region.  There are parts of the United Kingdom which are underdeveloped and have major economic and social problems.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Dooge Report, the Minister for Labour put forward a theory that there was dire need for an integrated approach to the development of the poorer regions in the north-west of the Community.  I believe the integrated regional development programme which has been introduced for the Mediterranean regions could be applied to the north-west of the Community.  With the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community the whole question of a regional policy assumes a new dimension and there are implications in this for us as well.  Since our entry to the EC, successive Governments have been guilty in one area: our approach to collecting money from the European Regional Development Fund is that the Government submit a list of projects to Brussels and the grant aid in respect of these projects is paid retrospectively into the national Exchequer.  This Government, and previous Governments, have tended to regard the European Regional Development Fund as an additional source of revenue for the national Exchequer <Col N="1344" /> rather than being an instrument to promote proper regional development, particularly in the west, the type of region for which that fund was originally intended.</P>
    <P>In the context of the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community, I am concerned that the finances will not be adequate to make the massive transfer of resources to the poorer regions which are necessary if we are to attempt to iron out the major regional disparities in the Community.  The ERDF is grossly inadequate. It was inadequate in the Community of Ten and it will be grossly inadequate to the needs of the Community of Twelve.  Spain and Portugal have massive regional problems and I hope that as a result of their accession there will be a new approach to a regional policy because this will have very important implications for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many people have said they are worried that the ERDF grant aid to Spain and Portugal might only be possible by reducing the quotas available to Ireland and the other existing member countries. That will not happen.  During the discussions on the 1986 budget in the European Parliament, we were assured that there will be no reduction in the allocations from the ERDF to Ireland or to the other existing members as a result of the accession of Spain and Portugal. While acknowledging the long and historic cultural links between Ireland and the Iberian Peninsula, it must be acknowledged that as a result of the accession of Spain and Portugal, our Government and other national Governments will have to take a new look at the whole question of European development policy.  I have spoken at length about this on a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for <Col N="1345" /> Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if it is expected that a new multi-fibre arrangement will be negotiated; and, if not, whether he is aware of the extreme anxiety and concern expressed by the Apparel Industries Federation in relation to the clothing and textile industry in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) expires at the end of July 1986; discussions on whether it should be renewed opened on 23 July last under the aegis of the GATT Textile Committee and are continuing.  The EC Commission, on behalf of the Community, made a declaration at that meeting supporting the renewal of the MFA.  I am hopeful that, arising out of the GATT discussions, the MFA will be renewed.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I am fully aware of the anxiety of the Apparel Industries Federation about the renewal of the MFA.  In this regard, I would draw his attention to the reply which I gave to Dáil Questions on 13 June 1985 relating to its renewal and also to Report No. 17, dated 31 July 1985 of the Fourth Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which recently examined the MFA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at this stage.  The arrangement expires at the end of July 19863 and I hope that a new MFA agreement will be in place.  I was responsible for the negotiations of the present MFA. Negotiations were very complex and difficult and, apart from the GATT position, they involved quite a number of bilateral agreements between countries. Ireland has taken a position of strongly urging the renewal of the MFA taking into account the protection that we need of our industry.</P>

      <P>Realising that the market share of low cost developing countries <Col N="1346" /> and State trading countries is far greater in the clothing and textile sector than in any other trade sector, will the Minister assure the House that, in the negotiations at which we will be represented, the proposed liberalisation measures being propounded by Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands will be resisted in the interests of our textile industry in which we have lost something in the region of 10,000 jobs in recent years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Our textile and clothing industry employs about 25,000 people which is approximately one in seven jobs in the manufacturing sector.  In the course of the negotiations we will take every possible step to protect the Irish position. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the MFA arrangement is in fact a derogation from the normal GATT rules.  We are in favour of a new MFA and will continue to ensure that the necessary protection for the Irish industry will be forthcoming.</P>

This is a complex negotiation still at a very early stage.  Our position will be maintained throughout.</P>

I am aware that certain organisations in the retail food trade have continued to press for such a ban but I have indicated, in my meetings with them, that I accept the commission's findings in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that it is policy that below cost selling is not the right way to deal with the problems in this area, will the Minister accept that those who have advocated this view have probably been prompted by undertakings given by politicians on all sides of the House?  Secondly, what other system might be introduced to deal with the legitimate concern of smaller traders who feel that they may be overrun by the enormous purchasing power of conglomerates if below cost selling is deemed no longer to be useful in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In taking the present stance I am very much aware that if there was a ban on below cost selling they would substitute some other element such as non-price giveaways, or whatever, that would simply achieve the same objective.  I point out to the Deputy that a directive entitled Local Government Planning and Development General Policy Directive 1982 was introduced by the Minister for the Environment following continued representations from IADT and RGDATA which specified a wide range of criteria which must be used by all planning authorities in considering planning applications in this area.  I suggest that that mechanism would be of help in this regard.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the second report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses and their very strong recommendation after considering quite detailed evidence from all sectors of the industry, that there should be a ban on below cost selling?  Further, is he aware that since the RPC report in 1980-81 there have been substantial changes in the retail environment in Ireland?  Is he aware that it is quite common practice with Irish multinationals to de-list Irish <Col N="1349" /> manufactured goods because they cannot meet the credit terms and price demands of the purchasing power of these multiples and that these goods are being replaced by imported goods?</P>

In view of the report of the RPC, dated November 1980, there was a clear indication that, looking at the problem from the point of view of manufacturers, distributors and consumers, a prohibition such as suggested by the Deputy would not be to the advantage of any of these interests to such extent as would justify serious interference with freedom of trade.</P>

      <P>I take the point the Deputy is making.  I do not see any great advantage in price wars.  What I am addressing here is the question of below cost selling.  On the basis of the report made by the RPC, a legislative ban on below cost selling would not be in the best interests of the consumer for instance, nor perhaps of the distributor. I suggest also that if such a ban was introduced other mechanisms would be used by distributors which would achieve the same end but under a different guise, for instance in the selling of petrol at the moment when instead of reducing the price they give away bonanzas.  I do not know if that achieves what it should achieve.</P>

        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i> asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the very high premiums that are now being charged in cities and provincial towns for householders' insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the premium rates charged for household insurance which reflect the risks borne by insurers on this class of business.  Recent increases in these rates have arisen from <Col N="1354" /> the substantial losses on household insurance in recent years which must be provided for.  Because of my concern at the effect on the public, I have insisted that these increases be limited or moderated where it is open to me to so do and in a prudent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pose one or two questions on this important matter that affects every householder.  Is the Minister aware that in the past six months increases in this type of insurance have been between 50 per cent and 100 per cent, all granted by the NPC?  Is the Minister aware that this is having a detrimental effect on family budgets and that household insurance is now almost as dear as car insurance?  Has the Minister any hope to offer to the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy realises that my function is primarily as a supervisory authority.  I must ensure, as the Deputy will appreciate, that insurance companies remain viable.  I should like to point out that in recent years there has been a serious underwriting loss in this class of business under the heading of fire and other damage to property.  For instance, the underwriting losses deteriorated from £75 million in 1981 to £10.693 million in 1983 and £12.154 million in 1984.  Obviously, that represents a serious loss.  The main reason for those underwriting losses has been the significant increase in crime and the frequency of claims.  I suggest that the increase in the crime rate has been substantially responsible for those underwriting losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot pass this off by saying he does not have any responsibility except in so far as the supervision of companies is concerned.  Is the Minister aware that a burglary occurs every 20 minutes and that he cannot treat this matter in isolation by telling us it is the responsibility of another Minister?  If, as a result of a burglary occurring every 20 minutes, householders have to pay exorbitant insurance premiums, has he <Col N="1355" /> any suggestion to put forward to deal with the problem?</P>

I should like to inform Deputies that the average rate currently applying in the Dublin area is .7 per cent of a pound while in the rest of the country it ranges from .3 per cent to .45 per cent of a pound.  There is a clear reflection in the amount charged on the level of crime in Dublin and the rest of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that it is not my wish to prevent insurance companies from making a profit, but it is not my wish that they should make super profits.  It is in order to ensure in the public interest that does not occur that I have legal powers in regard to allowing price increases.  The Deputy can be assured that the criteria I adopt were established in the Department a number of years ago and allow a balance where possible for underwriting under the various headings of insurance cover.  This well established practice allows us to carry out a clear examination of the underwriting experience and gives an indication of how the trend is in the market place.</P>

      <P>Angling makes a major contribution to the tourism industry. It penetrates into areas that have little other economic development such as the lakelands area of Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim, the Shannon area and down to the Blackwater.  In 1984 Bord Fáilte expended £38,000 in promoting angling.  The net result is that of the total number of angling tourists coming to Ireland from Britain and the Continent 60 per cent are concerned with the coarse fishing sector in which the Deputy is interested.  In 1985, Bord Fáilte increased the expenditure on promotion in this field to £87 million &mdash; a 129 per cent increase.</P>

I cannot understand how the Chair can allow questions to be bulked together like this, following priority questions having been received and placed on the Order Paper. In effect, it means that the period between 3.30 p.m. and 3.45 p.m. will not be required.  It also will restrict me from <Col N="1361" /> following up the matter in the priority time.  If the Minister were prepared to give that 15 minutes to a discussion of this matter and have the questions all lumped together now I would not mind at all, but by adopting this tactic the Minister is, in effect, ruling out any possible supplementary questions and information which I might get by way of priority.</P>

      <P>The assessment by the administrator of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc of the company's position was set out in a press statement on 16 July 1985.  Briefly, the administrator estimated a net balance sheet deficiency in the accounts of the company as at 31 December 1984 which, taking account of the later sale of the Insurance Corporation life subsidiary, came to £164 million.</P>
      <P>The administrator's assessment was based on an extremely thorough examination of the books of the company and on professional advice from outside the company.  I understand from the administrator that the overall assessment announced in July has not altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financing arrangements for the administration were announced by the Central Bank on 4 October 1985.  These arrangements involve an advance of £100 million to the Insurance Compensation Fund for a period of 15 years.  The cost <Col N="1366" /> of the advance, amounting in aggregate to £9 million per annum, will be met in full by Allied Irish Banks, the other licensed banks and the administrator. These arrangements are in line with the Government's objective that none of the costs of the administration should be borne by the taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be asking the administrator for any further updating of the exposure of the taxpayer and the Central Bank on the liability since July last, having regard to the fact that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism stated in the Dáil on 27 March that the estimate of exposure was between £50 and £120 million and that there was no reason to believe it would be the higher figure?  In July the figure rose to £164 million.  Is it not time for a further reassessment?  Is the Minister aware of a report in the <i>Reinsurance Report</i> magazine indicating a likely exposure figure of £500 million and will he comment on it?  Have any of the reinsurers challenged liability on ICI business?  How many arbitrations are pending?  How many court cases are pending?  What is the likely outcome of these cases as far as the ultimate liability of the State is concerned?</P>

      <P>Deputies will understand that there was a certain amount of confusion in March when a very serious event was occurring which put in jeopardy the public interest and shook the foundations of the banking system in Ireland.  The Government, with the consent of this House and of the Seanad, took swift steps to ensure the security of the financial foundation of the State.  I am satisfied with the assessment the administrator has made.  This was the basis of the announcement in July and it <Col N="1367" /> is a prudent assessment based on his very thorough examination of the books and supported by outside legal and insurance advice.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this position is the correct one and has not altered since then.  There is no need for further assessment at this point.  It will fall to the administrator to carry out his legal functions under the court and to publish the accounts of the company when they become available.  They have not been published this year in respect of 1984 because of the difficult and complex nature of the accounts as the administrator found them.  Deputies will understand that.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of reinsurance and the report Deputy Taylor mentions in some publication, I am satisfied that the administrator's assessment on reinsurance is prudent and that the provisions are prudent.  The administrator will be taking all steps commercially and legally open to him to ensure that such policies as fall to be paid will be paid to the company.  I am informed that the administrator is supported by legal advice in his view on the recoverability of amounts due from reinsurers.</P>
      <P>It is not within my competence to deal with the question on arbitration and court cases.  That will fall to be determined by the administrator in the ordinary course of his administration.  The administrator is answerable to the court and I am satisfied that the action taken by the Government, which culminated in the Central Bank package recently announced, is the correct one.  Under the guidance of the administrator I am satisfied that the prudent and commercial viability of the company will be restored.</P>

      <P>A number of questions are being answered together. The duty of the Chair is to give every Deputy fair play.  I have allowed Deputy Taylor to ask three supplementaries in <Col N="1368" /> one and I am now calling on Deputy Connolly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has transpired from the Minister's replies that the overall liability of the ICI has gone up from £120 million to £164 million.  Can the Minister give the House a guarantee that that will be the total amount?  If not, who will be responsible for any overrun?  The amount estimated by outside commentators would be substantially greater than that given by the Minister.</P>

      <P>From his experience in Government, the Deputy will be aware that the insurance industry is very much open to rumour and rumour mongery, and not of a benign nature.  I am satisfied that the statement by the Minister on 16 July last and the package presented by the Central Bank on 4 October reflect the true position.  I am confident that the administrator, who is held in high esteem in his profession, will have sufficient funds to carry out his legal obligation to return the company to viability.  It will take some years for the administration to be resolved but I am confident that the company will be brought back to viability within the existing financial allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to withdraw that.  If I pose questions in simple language the Minister might be able to give me the answers I require, just a few.  I assume that the administrator is an appointee of the courts.  The Minister might indicate who are the five directors of the company. Have the ICI, since the administrator went in, experienced any difficulty in collecting from the reinsurers?  If so, how many of the reinsurers used by ICI have defaulted, and by how much?  If the ICI are still functioning in their London <Col N="1369" /> offices and continuing to pay on their liabilities under insurance treaties, that were badly negotiated in the first place, how much money have they paid on foot of these treaties?  Because I may not get a chance to come in again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the hope that I will get in for a few further supplementaries, will the Minister tell me if the ICI operation is profitable at present and is their trading position sound?  Would the Minister agree that the comments made in March last were misleading to this House?  At that time the Minister Deputy J. Bruton, stated that the losses incurred &ldquo;will fall inside the range of £50 million to £120 million&rdquo;.  He went on to say that he had to stress that £120 million would be the known upper limit and that there was no possible way it could go beyond that figure.  The Minister misled the House at that time when he said the taxpayer would have to pick up the liability only in the last resort.  Would the Minister now agree that, with the new package announced by the Central Bank in October, a lie has been made of the solemn commitment given to this House on 16 July by the Minister's statement and in March when the Bill was being introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the magazine <i>Irish Business</i> some weeks ago, and would he like to comment on the long list of allegations in that article? One of my questions is about the present status of the ICI.  Are they a semi-State company fully under the direction of the Minister?  If they are, what directives does the Minister propose to give to them?  Particularly, has his attention been drawn to the <i>Irish Business</i> article which had a whole range of allegations, from insuring bush fires to hotels which had burned down already, and so on?  Would he like to comment on that article, and what action does he propose to take to follow it up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the position in relation to AIB.  That is a matter for AIB.  I am aware of the articles Deputy Brennan referred to and I repeat that, above all industries, the insurance industry is open to malign rumour. Though I do not want to comment specifically on the articles referred to, I will approach the ICI case on the basis of the facts known to me.  I cannot stop rumours &mdash; I must treat them with the respect or disrespect they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming back to Deputy Flynn, at this point in time I am not quite sure whether he supports the continuation of the ICI administration or whether he would be happy to see the administration brought to an end.  Certainly he is giving vibes in that direction.  In relation to the myriad diverse comments the Deputy made on <Col N="1371" /> this issue &mdash; and one which is central as far as I am concerned &mdash; I should say that the Minister did not mislead this House on the ICI issue.  As Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism he indicated possible dimensions of the problem, as he had been advised by Allied Irish Banks.</P>
    <P>Again, at that point in time the seriousness of the problem was recognised and addressed by the Government, with the co-operation of the administration.  That position was subject to a full assessment by the administrator of ICI's affairs.  That became available and formed the basis of a press statement on 16 July last which formed the basis of a finance package announced by the Central Bank on 4 October.  I want to say quite clearly &mdash; in order to dispel notions that might be abroad, to dispel the rumour mongering machines, not only here but in England as well &mdash; that the assessment by the administrator is a prudent one and I have been so informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister of State know?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a statement that, as Minister with responsibility for the insurance industry, I am satisfied that the administrator's assessment of the ICI is a prudent one and will withstand examination.  I am also satisfied in relation to the question of the payment on reinsurance treaties that the normal commercial practice will be followed by the administrator in connection with the recovery of moneys due to the ICI.  As I said earlier in my reply, I am satisfied that the administrator will take every necessary step to ensure that he is paid moneys due properly to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have been happier had the Minister replied to Deputy S. Brennan's question.  Let me put the Minister at ease: certainly I wish to see an end to the administrator's activity in ICI. I take it that he expects and hopes that that would be the case too at the earliest possible date.  It is in an effort to get <Col N="1372" /> around this morass of so-called evidence that we are hoping to bring about that position.  Might I ask the simple question: is it envisaged having some new method of management of ICI in the immediate future other than the administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has clarified his position somewhat.  It would be up to the administrator himself to decide on the management structure he would wish to put in place.  I am sure he will address himself to that question.  The House will appreciate that the ICI London office accounts were in a mess. Let us be quite frank about it.  The position has been very complex and, in large measure, has been unravelled only in the not too distant past.  I am sure that, when the initial and serious questions which the administrator must address have been addressed, he will decide on his structure of management.  I should add &mdash; Deputy Flynn raised this in one of his earlier questions &mdash; that my understanding is that the ICI are and have been trading profitably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister the final report from the administrator at this time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a full assessment of the report from the administrator. Of course that formed the basis of the press release on 16 July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In that report does the administrator recommend the termination of his appointment in the foreseeable future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to address any aspect of the report which of course is confidential.  The question of the continuation or otherwise of the administration of the ICI is up to the administrator who, if he wishes to terminate the administration, would apply to the court.  Of course one would assume that, the Central Bank having made the funds available to him knowing that they are acceptable to the administrator, the <Col N="1373" /> exercise foreseen by the Deputy is somewhat frivolous, perhaps even slightly irresponsible, given the serious nature of the case we are at present discussing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the Minister's response that he does not have the quantification of the London mess. Consequently it draws a certain amount of scepticism in so far as the Minister's earlier reply is concerned, in that the final amount has now been satisfied in the sum of £164 million.  Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Finance, in a recent question, responded to the effect that he did not expect to be asking for any more, and was not prepared to give a guarantee that the taxpayer would not, somehow or at sometime, have to pick up the tab of these ICI losses?  Is the Minister of State aware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no foreseen need for any sum greater than £100 million that has been provided to the administrator.  I am confident that the £100 million is the maximum figure that will be required.  I am also confident that the administrator will be successful in his task of revitalising this company.  I fully accept that the mess in the London office falls at the door of Allied Irish Banks who bought and owned ICI.  What I am saying is that this Government took the necessary action, in the public interest, to secure the ICI in administration and also to secure the financial foundations of this State.  I do not make any apologies for their having done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not wish to get involved in the rumour mongering. It has been pointed out to the Minister by reputable sources that these costs could escalate.  The Minister has not relieved our anxiety in that regard.  Is the Minister aware that the Insurance Solvency International Report in 1981 indicated that ICI were a bad risk and that he indicated in his speech when the Bill was introduced here that he saw a certain lack in the supervisory authority machine? Could he indicate what improvement has taken place in the monitoring and supervision of insurance companies since March of this year?</P>

      <P>I will not comment on rumours in the press no matter from what source.  I take exception to the suggestion by Deputy Flynn that the supervisory functions in my Department are inadequate, especially in regard to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  This problem arose in the London office and the Deputy is well aware that there are existing international conventions which put that office under the aegis of the British Department of Trade and Industry. The insurance division of my Department have been extremely vigilant in relation to insurance company supervision in this country and I resent Deputy Flynn's remarks.</P>

Not a single movement forward has been taken by way of supervision improvement in the Department. <Col N="1376" /> As the Minister does not have the final figures in relation to the London mess &mdash;&mdash; as he rightly named it &mdash; will he now reaffirm that there is no possible way that the taxpayers will be asked &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity in replying to the debate to add my céad míle fáilte to the 50 million new citizens of the EC from Spain and Portugal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The support of the Opposition for the enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal is very welcome. It was important that we had the opportunity to analyse the full implications of enlargement but whether that opportunity was fully grasped in the course of the debate is a moot point. Many of the Opposition speeches, while <Col N="1433" /> dealing with general European issues, failed to focus on the central issue of the consequences of enlargement.  I say that as a statement of fact rather than a critical comment.  In replying to the debate I intend to concentrate on the points raised in relation to enlargement rather than on the broader European issues as there will be an opportunity to debate those issues when this House discusses the reports on developments in the EC.</P>
    <P>When the subject of enlargement was addressed, to a large degree critical comment on our negotiating strategy was uninformed and unsupported by the facts.  In effect, it was a load of &ldquo;old codswallop&rdquo;.  At times one had the impression that the Opposition wanted to have their cake and to eat it, or to be more apt, to have their fish.  Mention of fish brings me to the heart of the matter. If terms regarding enlargement were to be agreed, clearly a solution had to be found to this problem.  It goes without saying that fisheries was one of the most difficult areas of negotiation for the Community as a whole and was the most difficult area so far as Ireland was concerned. Despite these problems, or perhaps because of them, a major part of our negotiating strategy was devoted towards ensuring that our fishery interests would be protected in an enlarged Community and that there would be continued scope for further development.</P>
    <P>By a combination of patient negotiations and, to some extent, political brinkmanship, we pushed our concerns to the wire and the outcome was an agreement that represented the best possible solution that could have been obtained in our interests without going over the boundary and preventing enlargement.  I do not think anyone on the Opposition side has gone so far as to suggest we should have taken that course.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that we will face a Spanish fishing armada after enlargement is totally unfounded.  Such wild accusations are easily made and perhaps they make good copy but they bear no relationship to the facts.</P>

      <P>Spanish access to waters and fish stocks around Ireland will be absolutely and strictly limited.  There <Col N="1435" /> was much talk about the size of the Spanish fleet.  It is correct that that fleet numbers 17,500 vessels.  Obviously if the impression is created that a flotilla of 17,500 boats is ready to descend on our waters one could assume that a fishing armada is on the way.  However, that is not the case and any such impression is utterly ludicrous.  None of the 17,500 vessels of the Spanish fishing fleet will be permitted to fish in the Irish box, the 50-mile zone around our coast, for ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Even from 1996, at the most 93 vessels of standard 700 hp size &mdash; that is, approximately half of 1 per cent of the Spanish fleet &mdash; will be allowed to fish within the 50-mile zone. Furthermore, this overall number of 93 will not be concentrated in the waters adjacent to our shores but will be spread over the entire Community area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>How many equivalent Irish vessels have we got?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We were able to secure a commitment from Spain to negotiate an orderly and phased access to the Irish box after 1996.  These provisions regarding access to our waters will be reinforced by very tight controls, including quotas.  Mention has been made of illegal fishing by Spanish vessels.  On that point I share the concern expressed by speakers on both sides of this House. Certainly the figures are alarming.  At the moment arrests are running at the rate of about one per week and the total number of Spanish registered vessels arrested since 1980 is 233.  In the context of illegal fishing, it is important to note the situation that will apply after 1 January. After that date Spanish vessels will be subject to inspection in Spanish ports by Community inspectors and, in addition, Spanish vessels entering present Community waters will have to notify coastal member states on entry and exit and report their catches.  We have been able <Col N="1436" /> to secure a regime that will involve a much tighter control system after enlargement and this will put us in a much stronger position to deal with illegal fishing.</P>
      <P>An important aspect we were able to negotiate in the context of enlargement was the matter of adequate fishing surveillance capacity.  That question looms very large. We were able to secure an agreement that consideration would be given to the grant of financial aid for appropriate surveillance measures necessitated by enlargement.  I expect specific proposals in this regard from the Commission in the very near future.</P>
      <P>These facts, rather than the flights of fancy indulged in by the Opposition, reinforce the point that the development of the Irish fishing industry will not be impeded by enlargement.  There are, of course, other factors affecting fishing development, but if we fail to take advantage of present opportunities, we should not blame the Spaniards.  The agreement we negotiated in the context of enlargement gives every possible protection in the context that we could not veto the enlargement.  As I mentioned earlier, we pushed the situation to the wire to make sure that the best and most watertight arrangement would be put in place after enlargement.</P>
      <P>A further point was raised in the course of the debate in relation to the grant-aid to Spain to enable her to restructure her fleet.  What needs to be stressed in this regard is that when Spain takes advantage of this aid, Spanish vessels will be taken out of use and only half of them will be replaced.  People may well say that they could put a super trawler in place of a rusty hulk, but they will be restricted in that any such replacement has to be of a similar category and engine size.</P>
      <P>I expect that measures like this will go some way towards reducing the massive capacity of the Spanish fleet.  I say that in the context of the obvious over-capacity of the Spanish fleet while, at the same time, recalling my earlier remarks on the limited access after ten years by one half of 1 per cent of that fleet to Irish waters.</P>

Community finance from the guidance section of FEOGA is also available to both fishermen and fish processors.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Council of Fishery Ministers on Monday a point was raised in relation to the length of time for which each periodic list was to be established. At that meeting my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, stressed the importance of a regime which will provide for practical and effective control of the activities of the Spanish fishing vessels.  The Minister was strongly supported by the French and British Ministers at that meeting.  The House can be assured that we will continue to insist on an effective regime to ensure that access to Community waters by Spanish vessels included in the periodic lists can be effectively monitored.</P>

      <P>Some doubts have been expressed about the market possibilities open to us in Spain.  What are the facts?  Spain is one of the world's great fish markets and there is a constant demand for fish products.  I am aware of that from my own constituency because <Col N="1438" /> there is a Spanish concern operating in Castletownbere.  I believe this is a challenge facing our fishermen and fish processors and I want to see them taking up this challenge by supplying this market with the type and quality of products demanded.  We can create the right environment but Deputy Carey put his finger on it when he said it was up the fishing industry to take advantage of this market opportunity.</P>
      <P>The question of stock quotas was raised in the course of the debate.  The accession agreement ensures for Ireland larger quotas of species such as hake, megrim and monkfish.  These are species for which there is a very heavy demand on the Spanish market.  Deputy Daly asserted that our future possibilities for blue whiting and horse mackerel will be minimised due to Spain's accession, but I do not agree with that.  I accept that these two species have been little fished by our fishermen to date, but I believe our fishermen will respond to the opportunities that have presented themselves.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance towards conducting exploratory fishing to determine the extent of the possibilities that exist in relation to the species have already been made to the Commission.  If these exploratory efforts are successful, then a whole new ball game will come into play because we will be fishing a species for which there are no current quotas.  From that point of view I would see a further opportunity arising because of enlargement.  Those fishermen who have taken the initiative by making these applications should be encouraged because that is the kind of spirit we should be displaying in response to the challenge of enlargement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in putting on the poor mouth.  A number of Deputies mentioned unemployment, which affects every member state.  This Government are very concerned about our high level of unemployment, but <Col N="1439" /> what can be forgotten is the European context.  I want to remind the House that at the European Council the Taoiseach has continually stressed the need for concerted European action to bring about recovery that would significantly improve the employment situation.  Some of our colleagues in Europe assert the primacy of national effort in combating unemployment, yet we have consistently argued the need for a Community dimension. We continue to insist that only a coordinated and determined effort at Community level will assist in the resolution of this problem in all member states.</P>
      <P>There are some interesting developments in that area.  One of the conferences I attended recently was in relation to the Eureka proposal.  That is the kind of proposal of which we must see more in the Community.  In a rapidly changing world, with technological change all over the globe, and in particular with the advances made in the United States and Japan, it is essential that Europe combines and co-ordinates her efforts to compete effectively.  It is an outrageous situation to have a Europe where member states' combined total expenditure on research and development is twice as much as that spent in Japan and the United States and yet the results in Europe are pathetic when compared with the results in those two countries.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Regional and Social Funds our receipts from those Funds, inadequate though they are for the problems we face, are helping us to build an economic vocational and training infrastructure that can alleviate the problem in some ways.  Much valuable work has been done to combat youth unemployment through the Social Fund.  We are conscious of the enormous amount which remains to be done so we will continue to strongly support the creation of further Community instruments, programmes and measures designed to combat unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point raised by Deputy Daly was the need for financing for the Regional Fund to help with the development of harbours. At the moment the Regional Fund <Col N="1440" /> is helping to finance all kinds of important job creation infrastructure including the development of harbours.  Over the last couple of years harbours which received assistance included Rinroe harbour and Killala harbour in Mayo, Kilronan harbour in Galway, Port Devlin and Bunbeg in Donegal and Howth harbour.  We have had an allocation from the Regional Fund which has proved helpful in harbour development.  The House should be aware that because of how the Regional Fund works it will not be possible to make a specific provision for harbours.  Like the other member states we submit projects based on the quality of the project concerned and its place in the overall national regional development effort.  I accept that better harbours are one important aspect of our effort for job creation but in the context of the way the fund works they have to be seen and presented in the overall context.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins suggested that we might have used the occasion of enlargement to insist on some specific compensatory measures for Ireland.  This would not have been appropriate.  The Deputy referred to the integrated Mediterranean programmes as a precedent and an example.  The IMPS were designed to help those areas of the Community which are likely to suffer directly as a consequence of enlargement.  Some areas mentioned by my constituency colleague, Deputy Sheehan, which will be directly affected are, for instance, the farmers in the South of France, Italy and Greece. The IMPS were devised to assist these areas because the agricultural products they produce will go from short supply in the Community to over supply after enlargement, going into surplus.  They need to restructure their agriculture and create alternative employment opportunities outside of Mediterranean agricultural production.  We are not in that position.  If we had been we would obviously have been looking for similar type compensation.  An important aspect of the IMPS raised by Deputy MacSharry is their effect on the other structures in Government.  We were able to get an assurance from the European Council at <Col N="1441" /> their meeting in Brussels in March that the financing of the IMPS would not adversely affect transfer from the Structural Fund to the less prosperous areas of the Community.  This valuable safeguard was subsequently written into the Community legislation governing the IMPS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government missed the opportunity to get additional funds.  That is the point I am making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that any opportunity in the Community is fully availed of by the Government. I will not comment on the performance of the last Government and I will not deal with any analogous comments either.</P>
      <P>Referring to the Regional Fund Deputy Collins said that we need a more effective regional policy for the Community including higher levels of funding. I fully agree.  Consequently in any of the Councils in which I am involved in Brussels, whether General Affairs or the Budget Council, I constantly make that point.  I assure the House that my colleagues at the other Council meetings also make every effort to present this point of view in Brussels.</P>
      <P>Another point raised during the course of the debate related to the manner of the Minister's distribution of the funding. I appreciate that direct payment to local authorities could be beneficial in terms of an increased awareness of the great benefits derived from the Regional Fund. Receipts from the Regional Fund are used to increase the overall level of resources available to finance development projects under the public capital programme.  In practice the payment of Regional Fund money directly to local authorities would entail a corresponding reduction in the level of Exchequer expenditure on the public capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a view in response to this which suggests that direct payment to the local authorities would not bring a national financial gain.  Indeed, an argument suggests that it would lead to a fragmentation of the administrative <Col N="1442" /> arrangements for dealing with the Regional Fund which could result in reduced efficiency.  This could make it difficult for us to maintain our excellent record of drawing down promptly and in full the money available to us from the Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that there are substantial additional sums of money available from the fund which we are not taking up.  This is not the case.  In recent years, Ireland has been able to extract its optimum share of benefits from the fund. The most recently published reports from the European Commission for 1984 show that Ireland received more per head of population than any other member state of the Community from that fund.  The amount of the funding overall is insufficient, but we must bear in mind the fact that in 1984 we received that level of support from the Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned the 1980 Special Border Areas Programme due to expire at the end of this year.  It is proposed that the programme will be replaced by another Community programme for the Border areas.  This is the Commission's proposal to assist us in the extension of the gas pipeline to the Border areas.  This proposal which would involve increased Community aid over the 1980 level is at its final stage of discussion in Brussels.  The Government are confident that the measure will be adopted by the Council in the very near future, hopefully within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to the possibility of a programme similar to the IMPS which would be specifically designed for the north-western peripheral area of the Community.  We have not seen as yet how the IMPS will operate in practice, but we will be monitoring their implementation closely to see whether they provide any lessons in the field of regional development of the future.</P>
    <P>I am aware of and understand Deputy O'Donnell's strong interest in that aspect of Community policy.  No doubt, wearing his other hat in the European Parliament, he will also follow the developments <Col N="1443" /> there closely.  However, I make the point that in devising a programme of this kind the availability of additional financing is necessary if the operation of the programme is not simply to amount to a coordination of what is there already.  That point must be borne in mind.  Simple coordination of funding from existing structural funds would not really lead to any great additional advantage overall for the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy Durkan for his very useful contribution last week. I checked one point which he raised, that is, the availability of funding to assist with drainage projects.  I am glad to be able to confirm to him that assistance of this kind is available through the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House referred to the CAP.  Let me once more re-state the Government's commitment to ensuring that in any discussions on the future of the CAP in the context of both enlargement and the Commission's Green Paper on reform of the CAP, full account has been taken of our dependence on agriculture and the importance of its role in our economy.  In the preliminary discussions on the Commission's Green Paper, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, has already apprised his Community counterparts of our view that any revision of the CAP must recognise that that is a fundamental policy of the Community, one of whose objects is the maintenance of a viable rural community based on the family farm.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy raised the point about our take-up of grants under Regulation 35/77 for projects relating to processing and marketing.  Over the period 1978-84 grants amounting to £67.6 million have been awarded, £36 million of these have been claimed, claims for a further £7 million are with the IDA, and FEOGA aid grants amounting to £4 million have been renounced or under-claimed.  This leaves approximately £20 million or 30 per cent of total grants awarded to be claimed and most of this relates to grants awarded in 1983 and 1984.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the take-up of funds <Col N="1444" /> is not entirely satisfactory but it can also be said that it has improved significantly in recent years.  However, it should be appreciated that many of the projects aided involve significant investment and take several years to complete.  Work has commenced on most of the projects and it is expected that any outstanding grants will be claimed over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate a number of Deputies expressed disappointment at the lack of a comprehensive Community forestry policy.  There are a number of reasons why the Community has not been able to develop a common forestry policy, the primary one being that, unlike agriculture, forestry is not within the scope of the Treaty of Rome. The absence of a treaty base is compounded by the fact that a number of the larger member states are opposed to the creation of a common forestry policy.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the absence of a common forestry policy, there are many individual Community action programmes and measures affecting the forestry sector.  Various forestry measures have been initiated by the Commission on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, for example, the forestry element of the western package in Council Regulation 1820/80 aimed at encouraging afforestation by farmers in the west.  More recently discussions have taken place in the Community on proposed measures to provide forests in the Community with increased protection against fire and acid rain.</P>
    <P>Another example is the Commission's proposal currently being considered by Council for a Community action programme regarding forestry and forest based industry.  From these three examples Deputies will see that, while the Community has not yet developed a common forestry policy akin to the CAP or the Common Fisheries Policy, it is nontheless active in the forestry sector. The Government will for their part continue to encourage extension of Community activity in the area of forestry.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to remind the House that in the forestry area the present Community is less than 50 per cent <Col N="1445" /> self-sufficient in its forestry needs.  It seems to me in the context of restrictions in other areas from the point of view of land usage that there must be more usage in the forestry sector in the years to come. Certainly the grant aspects at this stage are very attractive indeed, running up to 85 per cent of the cost of developing plantations.  I add my voice to those who are advocating strongly that those with surplus or marginal land should consider actively the attractiveness of these grants and join in the development of private forestry.  It is sad to see us with forestry covering only about 5 per cent of our land area as opposed to over 22 per cent in Europe, and even that small proportion is made up almost totally of State forests; the figure is about 85 per cent.  I see a great opening here for developments in the private area and I encourage strongly the developments in that sector and the usage of Community and national support for the development of private forests.</P>
    <P>During his wideranging contribution Deputy McCartin took a very broad view, as one would expect from an MEP, and talked about the need for more effective decision making procedures in the enlarged Community.  It is necessary for us to stand back and realise that the present decision making process was designed for a Community of six whereas we will be talking shortly about a Community of 12.  The inter-governmental conference launched at the Milan Summit last June is at present considering some aspects of this complex issue.  These principally are the use of qualified majority voting where this could facilitate the achievement of a single internal market, the enhancing of the role of the European Parliament and increasing the executive and management powers of the Commission.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to go into the question in detail now.  This conference is going on and it will be resumed in Luxembourg on Monday next.  However, I can tell the House that the Government are taking a positive overall approach to the work of the conference while seeking, of course, to have <Col N="1446" /> account taken of our reservations in certain areas of particular sensitivity to us.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the need for an adequate level of own resources in the Community.  At the beginning of the debate my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, pointed to the fact that enlargement and the increase in the Community's own resources level from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent of the VAT base were matters that were inextricably linked.  He emphasised again the Government's commitment to secure a further increase in own resources at an early date on top of the 1.4 per cent in January next.  There can be no doubt about the Government's position on this. Indeed, last June, in the course of the debate on the Dooge Report, the Taoiseach clearly stated that an own resources level of 1.6 per cent of the VAT rate would itself be only a fraction of that needed to make European union a reality.  Increased own resources are the key to more effective Community action in those policy areas which Deputies have highlighted, regional development and the major area of unemployment.  It also applies to the development of new policies.</P>
    <P>From the beginning of the enlargement negotiations, various Irish Governments have shared a strong political commitment in favour of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in introducing the Bill said that the fundamental ideal of the Community was the enhancement of peace and liberty in Europe.  Consequently, the Community's charter affirms an openness towards other European countries who wish to join it in pursuit of its objectives.  The day to day economic activities of the Community with member states protecting their interests and advancing their own views often appear banal and at times, unappealing.  However, we must never forget the historical context in which the Community was established and the generous and conciliatory principle which inspired its birth.</P>
    <P>When we as a relatively underdeveloped country applied for membership of the Community, our present partners did <Col N="1447" /> not view this application in the narrow perspective of economic profit or loss. On the contrary, a generous response was determined by the ideals enshrined in the Treaty.  It is partly as a consequence of this generosity that we now in turn extend a welcome hand to Spain and Portugal. After an aberration in their history when they were somewhat isolated and inward looking, Spain and Portugal have now resumed their rightful place in Europe. The fact that these negotiations lasted more than six years is evidence of the complex and difficult problems which had to be overcome before the integration of the economies of the member and acceding states could begin.</P>
    <P>During this process each State negotiated in a hard-headed and determined manner for the protection of its legitimate national interests.  At times, it should be said, these issues seemed intractible.  However, the force of the Treaty ideal and the long term interests of the Community alway seems to be a guiding hand pointing towards a resolution. We can derive considerable satisfaction from the fact that, during these long and difficult negotiations, Irish interests were successfully protected.  We can derive even more satisfaction, however, from the knowledge that the end of the process brings Spain and Portugal within the European Community.</P>

    <Title>National Development Corporation Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress I was referring to the possibility of the NDC intervening in the small industries development programme.  There is enormous scope for the corporation in the development and promotion of small industries.  It is now recognised here and <Col N="1448" /> in the EC that small industries have a vital role to play in economic development and job creation.  In the mid-west region, because of the special attention given to small industries by SFADCo, there has been a remarkable growth in the number of such concerns.  Many facilities are available to small industries such as feasibility grants and grants for equipment, buildings and so on.  However, two major problems confront such industries, a cash or working capital problem and the problem of export marketing.</P>
      <P>I hope the NDC, which will be able to invest in large and small industries by way of joint venture or otherwise, will be in a position to contribute in a practical way to help to overcome the two major problems I referred to.  I regard the Bill as the most important piece of legislation introduced in the House for many years. The proposal to establish the NDC is a positive, realistic, practical and feasible response to the growing cancer of unemployment. The daunting challenge of tackling that problem, particularly in a recession, makes the introduction of new strategies and development agencies of vital importance.</P>
      <P>I should like to refute suggestions by Opposition speakers that the NDC will duplicate the functions of organisations like the IDA, SFADCo, CTT and, perhaps, Údarás na Gaeltachta.  I do not see how that argument can stand up to examination.  The IDA cannot provide working capital, participate or take equity in companies except in exceptional cases.  It has been difficult in recent years to attract foreign industries because of the world recession.  Countries are not investing abroad with the result that the job of the IDA has become very difficult. I see a possibility, under the terms of reference applying to the NDC, for an acceleration of foreign investment here. It will now be possible for a foreign investor to participate with the State in the organisation and promotion of industrial projects.  I am sure foreign investors will be pleased to know that, through the NDC, they will be able to invest in a project with the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the possibility of the NDC <Col N="1449" /> intervening in agriculture, food processing and the development of an Irish timber industry.  There is no doubt that agriculture is our greatest natural resource and there is immense scope for the development of a modern food processing industry.  One of the big problems in national development since the foundation of the State is that we have never succeeded in formulating and implementing realistic long term plans for the agricultural industry or established along side it a good food processing industry.  There is scope for intervention by the NDC in that regard.  The fact that we have not been able to develop the food processing industry to its full potential is an indication that State development agencies have been either unable or unwilling to get involved to the optimum degree.</P>
    <P>There is immense scope for vastly increased exports of high quality food products, particularly to the continent of Europe.  I have the greatest admiration for the IDA and SFADCo and recognise, as everybody must, the tremendous contribution these organisations have made to the development of industry, to job creation and to the attraction of foreign investment to this country.  That is recognised, understood and appreciated by all. However, in the present situation, with the difficulties of attracting foreign investment to the same degree as in the sixties and seventies, some new strategy is necessary, the release of a new dynamic.  The National Development Corporation have the possibility and potential to spark off a completely new approach to development and to job creation. In the establishment of this corporation everything will depend on the calibre, experience and capacity of the chairman, board members and chief executive.  This has been adverted to by other speakers.  I would appeal to the Government to ensure that the best possible people are recruited to those positions.</P>
    <P>Another area with enormous scope for intervention by the corporation is in the field of research and development.  It could give practical encouragement to a liaison between universities and research <Col N="1450" /> institutes in industrial development. There is a good example of this in the western region with the National Institute for Higher Education and the new technological park established in Plassey on the NIHE campus.  They have there an innovation centre and an enterprise centre and now this technological park. There is continuous interaction and interrelationship between the academic staff of the NIHE, SFADCo the IDA and industrial development and job creation agencies in the region.  It is clear that there is fantastic scope here.  We have very good research workers in all our universities and an outstanding internationally recognised agricultural research institute, but I have long been worried that these research services, which can be called pure research &mdash; perhaps in the field of chemistry, agriculture, engineering, electronics and so forth &mdash; are applied only in very small proportion in a practical way to the creation of industry and the making of jobs.  There is a need for some agency to act as a promoter or catalyst between the research institutes and universities and the commercial application of research.</P>
    <P>There are two areas in which the corporation could intervene in a very practical way to the benefit of the country.  The first is in the development of the fishing industry and the second in relation to afforestation and the establishment of a proper timber industry here.  I am delighted that this legislation has been brought before the Dáil.  I have great hopes that the establishment of this corporation will give new confidence to the over 200,000 unemployed people, particularly the young people leaving third level educational institutions and AnCO centres highly qualified and skilled and with enormous potential.  I hope the corporation will open up a new era of economic development and job promotion.  I congratulate the Minister very sincerely on introducing this Bill and trust that the hopes placed in it will be fulfilled and that it will be established very soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Development Corporation Bill is paraded before <Col N="1451" /> this House as legislation designed to deal with the economic problems of the country, particularly those of unemployment and lack of investment.  These are both interrelated.  It is essential to raise the level of private and public investment, thereby creating opportunities for employment which will remedy in some respect the basic unemployment problem affecting this country socially and economically at present.</P>
      <P>Viewed in that context, I question that this Bill is any answer to that basic and fundamental problem.  The creation of a bureaucratic corporation of this kind on top of the existing semi-State bodies and organisations is not a getting to grips with the unemployment problem.  It is merely creating yet another bureaucratic organisation on top of those already geared and mandated, under the legislation establishing them, to deal with the problems of investment, of joint venture participation, of co-operation with other State bodies or with the private sector in development and investment.  That is spelt out in the Bill itself because under the First and Second Schedules there is a list of all the State-sponsored bodies on whom the National Development Corporation will rely to carry out the investment about which I am talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the example of Aer Lingus. They are already engaged in areas of expansion and will have further areas for expansion in which they can participate without any National Development Corporation or administrative apparatus of this kind.  They have already diversified successfully into hotel development, aircraft leasing, training programmes, repair and maintenance operations. There is a whole range of aviation and hotel related activities in which Aer Lingus are already involved &mdash; substantially and successfully involved.  They do not require any administrative apparatus to supervise what they are doing or not doing.  They have the expertise, the financial, production and marketing experience to carry out that sort of work.  It is complete duplication to establish an <Col N="1452" /> elaborate structure such as the corporation proposed in this legislation while Aer Lingus are there.  If the State wants Aer Lingus to intensify existing activities or to go into the kind of developments I have mentioned, the State can make further equity capital available to Aer Lingus to carry out these operations. Alternatively, Aer Lingus can enter into any joint venture arrangement they may wish or participate with other airlines in areas of expansion which would give more employment.  All these possibilities already exist under the legislation establishing Aer Lingus.  All that is necessary is the political will on the part of the Government to give Aer Lingus financial and governmental backing to proceed in these directions.</P>
    <P>The same goes for every one of the organisations mentioned in the Schedule to this Bill.  Each of them could go ahead at the moment without the need of a further layer of bureaucracy on top of them, meddling in their affairs and causing a further impediment to development.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann are mentioned in the Schedule.  This organisation, given the proper mandate in terms of financial backing and political will, can develop further into Limerick, Galway and towards the north and north-west.  Progress in that area has been too slow.  It requires political direction and will not be improved in any way by putting a national development corporation between the Minister and BGE.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom are now moving into areas of expansion, and other possibilities will present themselves if political will is exercised by the Minister.  Sometimes that political will is exercised in a negative way and I would ask what the Government propose the NDC could do to improve the situation of the B &amp; I line. They require positive help and no amount of NDCs or bureaucracy will improve the performance of the B &amp; I and rationalise and expand their activities but rather will constrict their activities.</P>
    <P>Irish Life Assurance Company is one of the dynamic growth companies.  They have established a building society and <Col N="1453" /> are proceeding not only into insurance development but into the development of housing and property.  They do not require a development corporation to impede rather than facilitate progress.</P>
    <P>When one reads through this list one sees excellent semi-State bodies already in existence who have the legislative mandate to expand.  All they require is political will on the part of the Minister and the Government and the necessary financial backing to enable them to implement proposals envisaged by them to ensure further expansion, investment and consequent employment.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are also mentioned.  In what way will the National Development Corporation facilitate Bord na Móna, who have been doing an excellent job in regard to turf cutting and supplying turf burning power stations?  Their expansion into milled peat and the treatment of reclaimed bog are very advanced and a lesson to the world as a whole.  We would envisage further investment and expansion into the area of forestry development, the transfer of the activities of the forestry division of the Department to Bord na Móna, who would be given a fresh mandate to engage in the commercial development and exploitation of our forestry and timber resources as well as the development of our peat resources. The two go hand in hand and we would see further downstream ancillary activities taking place under the guidance of a single State-sponsored body.  What function would the NDC perform in that context? All that is required is a mandate from the Minister and a change in legislation to add forestry development to peat development as part of Bord na Móna's operation and, if necessary, the financial support to enable them to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>In all these State-sponsored bodies we have the structure, the expertise and the resources to allow for further expansion, provided there is political will and financial backing by the State.  It can all be done under the existing semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>The ESB have successfully diversified their activities.  In Africa and the Middle <Col N="1454" /> East they have undertaken consultancy contracts relating to the construction of transmission and power station facilities. They have done this from their own resources and much more could be done if the Government had the will to provide the ESB with the finance to expand in these directions.</P>
    <P>One can see the scope for expansion when reading through this list of State-sponsored bodies.  Bord Fáilte could expand in the tourism field; CTT could expand in the export area; Kilkenny Design Workshops could expand in the specialised area of design; the National Board for Science and Technology could expand advanced research into technology; SFADCo have great expertise in regard to industrial development on a regional basis.  There is enormous scope for expansion and development.  One is struck by the paradox of a Government who have the temerity to bring in this legislation, pretending to deal with development and expansion, while at the same time they are presiding over the liquidation of Irish Shipping and the quasiliquidation of B &amp; I.  In regard to both these companies the Government are taking an entirely negative, restrictive and reactionary approach.</P>
    <P>Coming back more directly to the mandate proposed in this legislation, is there anything in it that could not be done by the NEA, the IDA or the ICC, who are already engaged in this business?  They are all concerned precisely with investment on behalf of the State, joint venture investment or private investment.  I suggest that the proposal to establish this body is no more than an elaborate piece of window dressing because the State companies are already there, the apparatus is there, and all that is proposed here under the guise of further progress and development is another bureaucratic animal to supervise the State companies already there and to wind up one of them, the NEA.</P>
    <P>We do not want this new bureaucratic animal to graze on the State companies already there.  The existing State companies can do this work.  The British <Col N="1455" /> invented the term &ldquo;quango&rdquo; but the British have been dismantling them as have countries all over the world.  I am all for State enterprise provided it is channelled into productive areas, provided it is properly financed and given a mandate to do the work and to proceed under the overall political direction of the Minister and the Government.  Here, however, we have a Government running away from their responsibilities and establishing another bureaucratic monster to meddle and intervene between the Minister and the other semi-State bodies who are fully equipped to do the work.  This legislation is nothing more than window dressing to try to get the people to believe that something miraculous will happen.</P>
    <P>Nothing will happen without political will and finance.  The political will can be exercised and the financial resources made available through a whole range of State-sponsored bodies already in existence. Progress merely requires the Minister to sit down with the chairmen of these bodies and their boards, and ask them where we can go, where do we stand, what new ideas are emerging, what new activities do these State bodies require investment for.</P>
    <P>The IDA have been doing an excellent job attracting industry here, arranging that companies would come together. What kind of relations will be established between this new animal and the IDA? Why are the NEA being wound up and replaced?  Is it not quite clear that this is just political stunt making or window dressing, whichever you like to call it? A new bureaucratic structure is being established which will not contribute one whit towards development and expansion. It will just be a further layer of bureaucracy frustrating activity by the existing semi-State bodies.  This work could be done by more co-operation between the Minister and those bodies. If difficulties should arise, a special State body could be set up to deal with them. For instance, if there is a problem in relation to forestry development or downstream timber activities, Bord na Móna are ideally geared to take on that <Col N="1456" /> problem.  The law could be amended to give them an extra mandate and extra finance for that purpose.  Alternatively, a State body could be set up to deal precisely with forest development and the development of timber products.</P>
    <P>To set up this vague elaborate structure which, given time, will turn into a magnificent white elephant is an extraordinary action by any Government.  Of course it will not get time because before this legislation has been enacted there will be a change of Government and this legislation and any animal or quango that may incipiently emerge from it will be consigned promptly to the wastepaper basket by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government.  We will set about getting the existing State bodies to carry out enterprises more efficiently, or establish further State bodies if there is a vacuum and a need.</P>
    <P>That is the way to go about business, and I am sure that is the view of Deputies John Bruton and E. Collins, if they were to stand here and speak openly, if they did not have the albatross of the Labour Party around their necks.  Just because this quango was proposed in the Labour Party policy before the establishment of this Government, the Fine Gael Ministers are hung with it.  Those Ministers agree fully with what I am saying &mdash; one of them is sitting opposite me &mdash; but they are hung with this Labour albatross and have to go along with this parliamentary charade in order to keep the Labour Party boys quiet for another few months.</P>
    <P>Bringing everything down to bedrock, that is what this Bill is all about.  It is in aid of keeping the Labour boys happy for a few more months.  Deputies John Bruton and Dukes and Eddie Collins fought a fight for sanity, and for three years they frustrated and prevented the Labour Party from getting their way. They were right to do that, but they were wrong finally in succumbing, which they did because of political opportunism and expediency in satisfying the junior partner. That is why we are wasting time here talking about this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is my general approach.  There is not much need to go into detail on the <Col N="1457" /> weaknesses of the Bill.  The whole Bill has been wrongly conceived and will remain stillborn because we will be the next Government.  That is why the Bill or any fledgling administration brought into life during the brief period while it is law, before we are the Government, will be consigned to the wastepaper bin.</P>
    <P>As we are engaged in a parliamentary exercise, there are certain aspects of the Bill that show it for the complete nonsense it is even were it concerned with the sort of magnificent drive for expansion, development and investment in jobs that the Labour Party would like to trumpet about.  I might ask the Labour Party in particular, as the junior partner in Government, to look at section 15 (1) where there is contained a more restrictive clause than any obtaining in regard to any State body really doing their work. Here I am thinking in particular of the IDA.  Under that subsection no more than £1 million can be expended by this quango without seeking the approval of the Minister.  They are completely hamstrung from the beginning.  I will read the subsection to illustrate my point:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2) and subsection (3), the Corporation shall not, without the prior permission of the Minister, invest in an enterprise an amount or amounts exceeding in the aggregate £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the corporation <i>ab initio</i> is limited to not spending more than £1 million without approval of the Minister, who must then refer to the Minister for Finance, who will bring it before the Government, who will strangle any such project at birth.  That is not the way the IDA are run.  Rightly the IDA have always had an open mandate to carry out their developments.  Likewise, Aer Lingus have a similar open mandate, as have all of the major State companies, such as the ESB, over the years.  This corporation, which will supervise the whole lot of them, organise them all into joint ventures and new proposals, cannot make a move if any such major development exceeds £1 million.  Do the Government realise the age in which we live and <Col N="1458" /> the pretentiousness of this Bill?  If this Bill is what it pretends to be, it is a total contradiction in terms if the corporation is not allowed to spend or invest any more than £1 million without approval of the Minister and, in turn, the Minister for Finance and the Government.  We are right back into the maw of bureaucracy once more, the whole purpose of what is intended being frustrated.</P>
    <P>I am now making points that presume to some degree that this Bill is seriously intended, seriously meant to be what it states, when it is not.  Probably I am going through details here that will not matter a whit because the Bill will never be effective or achieve anything.  When the Government were pretending to throw a sop to the Labour Party, pretending to introduce a Bill that might be of some consequence, at least they might have continued the pretence and given an open financial mandate to such a body to get on with the job, implementing the whole range of tasks set out in section 10 which contain two pages of magnificent objectives of the corporation, all of which are already being achieved by existing State sponsored companies.</P>
    <P>Two-and-a-half pages of that section are devoted to reiterating those aims and objectives, giving this new corporation objectives and aims already written into the mandates of existing State bodies established by legislation in this House. There are two-and-a-half pages of glorious prose which, if read in isolation, might lead one to believe there was some serious intent behind the establishment of this corporation until one reaches section 15 (1), under whose provisions one sees they cannot make a move if any such project is in excess of £1 million, when they must seek Ministerial approval and so on &mdash; back to be buried by the Civil Service establishment.  That is that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is little else to be said about the Bill.  Indeed, both the Bill and its Explanatory Memorandum revolve around the two sections I have mentioned, one dealing with its objectives and the other with its financial limitations. Other than that it amounts to <Col N="1459" /> an administrative, bureaucratic exercise, purporting to establish a new bureaucratic body that will prove to be doubly frustrating.  It will prove frustrating to existing State-sponsored bodies who want to go ahead, get on with the job and who will discover this body meddling in their affairs.  It will be frustrating to the Minister concerned because this body will be sandwiched between himself and the State-sponsored bodies for which he is responsible.  Indeed, it will amount to a further frustration of the existing bureaucracy which will have yet another layer to deal with between the Minister and the existing State companies with whom they have to deal.</P>
    <P>What this Bill proposes is a bureaucratic mess for which there is no practical, financial or economic reason.  It is a bureaucratic mess designed purely to meet certain political imperatives caused by the desire of the senior party in the Coalition to keep the junior party in Coalition quiet.  That is just not good enough after three years in Government. We have a number of excellent State-sponsored bodies.  I might avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to them, many of whom engaged in forms of diversification and investment to date that have been highly successful.  These were State-sponsored bodies in the main established by Fianna Fáil Governments, that have worked excellently.  I was associated with one in particular, Aer Lingus, when as Minister for Transport they expanded into a whole range of areas related to aviation but not concerned with direct flying, all of which have been very successful &mdash; operations concerned with repair, maintenance of planes, the leasing of planes, hotel development, and so on.  That type of initiative has been shown by other State sponsored companies over the years.</P>
    <P>However, the Government have sought to diminish the role of State-sponsored companies.  Born na Móna have also done a magnificent job and there is scope for further development and activity on their part.  You can go right through the whole list and see that there <Col N="1460" /> is enormous scope for development, provided there is political will and finance is made available to do so.  The only response by the Government is to propose legislation to set up this body but &mdash; and I will be proved right in two years' time &mdash; it will never be a viable operation. It is stupid and futile in the extreme mainly because it is being set up for all the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>Existing machinery can carry out the job which is required and the Industrial Credit Company, the Industrial Development Authority and the National Enterprise Agency already do this job.  The facilities and agencies are there and, although this legislation may be passed, the National Development Corporation will never get off the ground.  If by any chance it did, we will ensure that it will go down when we are in Government again.  We will be a Government who place their confidence in the State-sponsored companies like the B &amp; I and others which have been established to do specific jobs.  We will ensure that these companies will be restored to health and properly managed and we will rid the economy of any bureaucratic excrescence which may develop as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this initiative and I see it as part of several which are needed.  We have never exploited our full resources although we hope that the potential is still there.  We never established the necessary industrial base and I see this initiative as encouragement and a generator of jobs which we all know is the greatest problem facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For too long people have been encouraged to think that jobs will be provided, but we did not give them the resources to allow them to create jobs.  The emphasis was always on the provision of jobs and a perception that the Government would, in some miraculous way, provide employment.  We did not give our young people training or encourage them to use their initiative and skills.  The whole emphasis in our education system should be to teach our young people self reliance.  We were led to believe that <Col N="1461" /> our young people should expect things to happen rather than to accomplish them. One of the problems facing us is the idea that all we had to do was to try to get a job and hold on to it for life.  We know that that passive or easy option is not available any more.</P>
    <P>I worry about the type of education provided and the way in which we judge success within the school system, particularly on gaining entry to third level education. Students are forced into working in a personal and competitive way, not for the good of a group.  They are not encouraged to work within a group which is essential from the point of view of sharing skills and talents, to work together to set up industries and job creating centres.  It is only by encouraging such type of sharing that we will create jobs which are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>Instead of working on the points system and judging people as being individually successful at 17 or 18 years of age where they are regarded as creators or water carriers, the success of students should be based on how much they contributed to a group, to the team work within the class.  If we are talking about initiatives and sharing of skills which are essential to job creation, that is where we must start.  I see nothing ideologically alien about the introduction of the NDC and I cannot understand why some Opposition Members are jumping up and down as if some type of strange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan made constant reference to the fact that much of the job creation has been as a result of setting up State agencies accountable to the Government which encouraged what private industry was not able or willing to do.  That is why I cannot understand why the National Development Corporation are seen as some strange animal which has not yet reached Ireland. A tremendous number of jobs &mdash; and this is the way it should be &mdash; are a mixture of private and public enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I listened to Deputy Lenihan and some other Members, I was reminded <Col N="1462" /> that exactly the same arguments were made with regard to other organisations which were set up 20 years ago.  They were described as white elephants, bureaucratic muddles and it was said that they were coming between private investors and individual rights.  Now that they are successful they are recorded as such. Deputy Lenihan hoped that he and his Government will be able to consign the NDC to the wastepaper basket but I think the Corporation will flourish in the future.  It is my opinion that in years to come they will be regarded as a success.</P>
    <P>However, I have certain reservations that the NDC may not be as flexible as we would wish.  I am glad that the corporation will be able to offer venture capital in certain areas where money will not be available from private sources.  If we could rely totally on private enterprise it would not be necessary to set up the National Development Corporation. However, private industry does not think it has any social obligation to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation will add to the excellent work already being done by the National Enterprise Agency.  I hope the corporation will not just concentrate on high-tech jobs which are essential if we are to keep abreast of what is happening throughout the world and if we are to remain competitive; I hope they will also deal with what might be called low-tech industries that are labour-intensive. Those of us who are constructive in our comments about the NDC welcome the fact that the corporation will concentrate on our natural resources.  They will be able to offer encouragement, investment and loans which are necessary to exploit fully those resources.  Other speakers spoke about tapping the potential in downstream agriculture and our forestry resources and I shall not deal with those matters.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) (f) states that the corporation shall:</P>
    <P>invest in any enterprise involved in the exploitation, development, production or marketing of natural resources...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> We cannot over-emphasise the importance of marketing.  There has been a tendency here to start production without carrying out the necessary research on marketing and on transportation problems. Marketing must be a first priority and I am glad that this matter has been dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) (i) states that the objective of the Corporation shall be:</P>
    <P>to establish, promote, assist (financially or otherwise) any enterprise engaged in the exploitation of research...</P>
    <P>Will the Minister state if it will be possible for research to be initiated by the NDC? Will they be able to set up their own research units?  We are in a time of rapidly changing technology and we will need to put tremendous emphasis on and investment into research.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision regarding accountability.  Deputy Lenihan said that we are merely adding another layer of bureaucracy.  All of us want the taxpayers' money and the European funding to be used as efficiently as possible. Therefore, it is important that legislators ensure there is due accountability.  It is our job as legislators to have the right conditions for investment and job creation. We have also to ensure that an account can be given of the money invested or loaned.  There is a perception among the public that often we have thrown good money after bad and many people believe that if there was more stringent accountability money could be channelled into more productive areas.  I reject Deputy Lenihan's suggestion that what we are proposing is just another layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the setting up of the board of directors, I am glad that the section in question refers to men and women with entrepreneurial skills.  I hope that when the board is appointed it will have people with the highest level of skills and expertise but I also want to have on the board women with those skills.  In the United States in the past few years many jobs, particularly those generated <Col N="1464" /> through small businesses, have been initiated by women.  They have achieved this against tremendous odds.  Inevitably women are not taken as seriously in business as are men.  In Ireland the trend has been the same in the past few years. Many women have started work in their own kitchen or in their backyard using their skills and services.  There have been large attendances by women at seminars dealing with small businesses and it is obvious that there is a great need for guidance and advice.  I ask that the NDC give every encouragement and support to women.  I hope they will set a record of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>Again and again Members of this House have spoken about forestry, and I am very pleased it has been mentioned in this debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, speaking on the last Bill pointed out that, while we do not have a common forestry policy in the EC, we have many opportunities to take advantage of the fact that less than 50 per cent of the Community are self-sufficient in forestry.  There is a lot of grant funding available from Europe for fast timber growing, for which the land of Ireland is particularly suitable.  We cannot over-emphasise the need to invest in this area. Unfortunately, we do not appear to have attracted private investment into afforestation, especially when the Minister tells us as little as 5 per cent of our land is under afforestation compared with 22 per cent in the rest of Europe.  This shows that there is great potential in this field.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the emphasis by the Minister on worker participation and worker shareholding.  I would like to think that the National Development corporation will provide initiatives and bonouses to encourage worker participation and worker shareholding.  Countries like Sweden who have similar corporations have been very successful because they have provided such incentives.  The Minister said, and rightly so, that he did not wish the National Development Corporation to function as a means of resolving the difficulties of ailing State or private sector industries.  The NDC should provide vibrant and creative opportunities <Col N="1465" /> and the bottom line should always be to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>In my view some of the sections in this Bill are too restrictive, for instance, the fact that long term investments should not exceed 30 per cent, or that not more than one loan may be granted to a company or firm.  Could the latter not be counterproductive where a company, which was set up to produce one product and was very successful, may wish to branch into another area for which they would need a certain amount of investment to get off the ground?  Does this section mean that because that firm got one loan they will not be given a second loan, even though they are offering a viable proposition?  It is important that this point be cleared up.  It is also mentioned that a lease on office premises should not exceed £250,000.  Does that refer to a long term lease?  For instance, if it was for a 35-year lease on office premises that would mean it would cost £7,500 per annum, which would be an extraordinarily low sum.  I may have misunderstood this so perhaps the Minister would like to clear up this point.</P>
    <P>There is a section dealing with disclosure of interest by directors.  Everybody sees the necessity for this section, particularly with regard to accountability.  Section 26 says that a person who contravenes subsection (1), who does not disclose an interest, particularly a vested interest, in any of the areas in which the NDC might be dealing, &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800&rdquo;. Because it would not be profitable to disclose one's interest in certain cases, does the Minister consider that the fine is high enough in today's terms?  That kind of advantage could mean a profit of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  We should consider whether it might not be worth the risk to be fined £800 in order to gain far greater advantage.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation should generate a feeling of confidence and encourage entrepreneurs. When a firm have a good idea and want to expand, they should be able to do so even though the banks may not be <Col N="1466" /> interested in providing venture capital because here we have a corporation set up primarily to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the discussion on another natural asset &mdash; tourism.  Changing circumstances are affecting Ireland even at European level.  Our farmers should be encouraged to diversify.  I have already mentioned forestry, but tourism should be recognised as one of our greatest revenue earners.  The time is coming when people will have longer holidays and more leisure hours.  This means tourism will become more and more important and the servicing of tourism will be more competitive.  This is an area where Ireland must not slip behind.</P>
    <P>People involved in tourism lay great emphasis on the fact that the National Development Corporation could help them to build a tourism infrastructure. They are talking not only about grants for expanding hotel and leisure facilities but about roads infrastructure to make travel easier and more attractive and about the provision of clean, hygienic, well serviced camping sites to cater for our young population and young tourists who visit here without much spending money.  We have done little or nothing in relation to providing such facilities although we have the greatest environmental assets for such a project.  The NDC could contribute in that area.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that camping sites and students travelling cheaply around Ireland or Europe do not contribute much to the economy.  That is so in the short term but, for the long term, we would establish standards and an image of this country that would attract those students back when they had more money to spend.  We could make this area a principal source of revenue.  I am glad this has been highlighted in the NDC Bill. I hope all the people in tourism, through investment, will be able to build on that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when people, recalling the setting up of the NDC, will remember the criticisms levelled at this Bill and the lack of confidence shown by the Opposition, and see that the criticisms have been totally refuted and that we have set up something that will <Col N="1467" /> accomplish what we all wish to accomplish, the generation of jobs and a climate that will encourage people with skills and initiatives to create jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Bill is no more than the Labour Party tail wagging the Fine Gael dog at the expense of the taxpayer and the economic future of the country.  This Bill has been introduced for blatant political purposes and account has not been taken of the important issues which the Government should be addressing.</P>
      <P>The money to be invested by the NDC, it appears, will be regarded as grant aid. Their function is a duplication of the function of existing State agencies.  Several of them have done similar work very successfully. A normal investment company would have share capital, bank borrowings and would have to attain profits.  On that basis it would have to make a profit, repay the bank and pay dividends.  None of these criteria will apply to the NDC when constituted, as they will be prohibited effectively from borrowing.  The Government will supply all the finance, run all the expenses, will fail to secure dividends and will end up making regular injections of capital into the corporation.</P>
      <P>It is not clear how much money will be put in by the NDC when constituted or how further funds will be obtained.  Will the directors have to make a presentation to the Minister each time they get an investment or will they have an annual investment fund?  These questions must be answered.  A director of the corporation will want to know what return the corporation will want.  Will they insist on appointing directors to companies in which the corporation invest?  What are the investment priorities of the corporation? There are no clear objectives in the Bill or criteria that could be complied with requiring a certain direction by the corporation when set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several State agencies will be in direct conflict with this corporation, the main ones being CTT and the IDA.  Private investment funds like the development capital corporation and new tax free <Col N="1468" /> funds can be invested in, up to £25,000 by individuals.  This corporation will only add further confusion to an already confused situation.  What we need to do is to generate confidence in investment, in productive industry either replacing imports or processing agricultural produce at home.  We need to support private enterprise as public efforts have failed during the period of this Government. I would prefer to see the Government support a public company with quoted shares and accountable to an investing public free of Government control, doing the same job more effectively.</P>
    <P>On section 7, what is meant by the target investing date?  What will the Minister invest if not £300 million initially? What is the long term investment plan for this corporation?  Will shares have a fixed cumulative dividend?  Will the corporation pay an amount similar to interest? Even if we were to lose money in the immediate years, it would be reasonable to expect that when the corporation make a profit they would make some return to the Government by way of a dividend which would be shown in the accounts of the corporation.  The principle objectives as set down in section 10 are ridiculous. Section 10(1)(a) says:</P>
    <P>to invest, in consultation, where appropriate, with State-sponsored bodies, in any enterprise (including any enterprise which is wholly or partly owned by a State-sponsored commercial enterprise) which, in the opinion of the Corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient...</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that this should be the situation because one could take from that that they would be required to invest in supermarkets, petrol filling stations and so on.  Why should they be excluded, although quite clearly they are from reading the section?  Priority has not been given to the two industries most central and important to the economic security of this country, the manufacturing and building and construction industries.  One must ask what resources will be made available under section 10 (1) (b) which <Col N="1469" /> states that the principal objects of the corporation shall be stated in its memorandum of association to be &ldquo;to manage, assist (financially or otherwise)...&rdquo;  One must ask what resources the NDC will have to manage the affairs of other companies. It is not stated in the Bill, neither was it stated in the Minister's speech. Section 10 (1) (c) is &ldquo;to establish, either alone or in co-operation with a State-sponsored commercial enterprise, any enterprise which has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment&rdquo;.  It appears to envisage that the NDC will set up new companies.  This is absolutely crazy.  They could end up with ten or more subsidiaries which they are not allowed to do in section 28.</P>
    <P>Why has tourism been singled out under section 10 (1) (d)?  A Deputy who spoke here said that tourism is a very important area of great opportunity for development, but saying that, as I do, on the one hand and recognising the shabby manner in which the tourist industry has been treated by this Government in recent years, it is nothing short of hypocrisy to imply in this Bill that tourism will get a special position, considering the fact that a White Paper produced recently ignored completely the fact that investment and taxation are essential to an improved environment for tourist industrial opportunity to obtain.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has attempted to dismantle the regional tourist organisations.  The responsibility for investment by Bord Fáilte in tourism has been removed and handed back to the Department who have not the experience, expertise or know-how to carry out the function of investment, and they are obliged to give consent or approval in some miniscule or irrelevant areas where Bord Fáilte would wish to carry out certain functions.  Their functions are now limited to consultations or consultancy on the one hand and sign-posting on the other, a really unimportant role for the body known as Bord Fáilte, the central tourist authority.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Taoiseach made <Col N="1470" /> reference in a speech to his intention to provide capital grants of up to £30,000 for hotels and guesthouses.  One must establish what exactly this Government propose to do about tourism.  There is no consistency in any of their plans; in fact there is no plan and to single tourism out here is nothing more than a Paul Daniels type of illusion that will trap us into believing that something serious or positive will be achieved.  It is most unfair to people in Bord Fáilte, the regional tourist organisations, the local authorities, county managers and genuinely concerned vested interests in the industry of tourism to suggest that there is any hope for them in this proposed legislation.  As I have said, it is proposed to make further grants to hotels and guesthouses.  The Taoiseach announced that very recently. For the life of me I cannot understand what he really is proposing or intends to get.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) (g) provides that the corporation are:</P>
    <P>to invest in any enterprise whose functions include developing or entering into long term supply contracts between producers and processors where such an enterprise, in the opinion of the Corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment.</P>
    <P>Again I am confused.  Agricultural long term contracts have been found to be notoriously bad in the past as farmers tend, rightly and understandably, to sell to the highest bidder.  In the present economic position in which the Government have left so many farmers I have no doubt that they would be very foolish to pass up the occasion to take the highest bidder at the first available oportunity.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that the corporation get a dividend.  I cannot understand why the Government would not be paid a dividend.  I see no reason why the NDC should not operate as a corporation in accordance with normal financial criteria, but of course it was never intended, as <Col N="1471" /> Deputy Lenihan said this afternoon, to be a serious attempt at pursuing a proper economic policy or to develop opportunity or to achieve results.  It is an attempt to accommodate a political relationship that is now under considerable stress and strain and will collapse within a matter of months, but the opportunity will have been taken once again to consume the time of this House and the public imagination with the expressed intention of diverting the attention of serious minded people away from the tragedy that has been brought about in almost every area by this Government conspiring and contriving on a daily basis to achieve the maximum political gain for the purpose of staying in office a little longer, knowing that their time there is short.  Their options are running out and the patience of the people has run out.</P>
    <P>The Government at this stage know the priority areas for investment and the priming that is needed for an economy in such difficulty as ours is at the moment. The State is involved in many areas of economic plight.  Our semi-State bodies over the years have done an exceptional job of work.  We can recall with pride the success of Bord na Móna and peat production, transport under certain difficulties and Aer Lingus.  We have many areas that need investment.  Lack of investment has brought about disastrous consequences for many semi-State bodies here in recent times.  There are enough agencies in existence who have a proven record of good performance on behalf of this nation.  They have been promoting, developing and investing and the Government have ignored totally the opportunities that private enterprise could provide if given the opportunity and the economic environment of confidence and trust.</P>
    <P>If to make a profit was not a crime under the present administration the profits of private enterprise would be going back into the various businesses and would ensure, alongside the expertise and good functioning of semi-State bodies, that unemployment would be tackled seriously and positively and <Col N="1472" /> would in a matter of a few years show a tremendous reduction.  However, the Government, for some reason I cannot understand, have failed to take on board uncomplicated solutions to our problems. There is no indication, contrary to what the Taoiseach and his Ministers have been saying, that the country is getting out of its economic difficulties.  Businesses are collapsing all around us.</P>

I should like to know why tourism has been singled out when there is no reference to other sectors of the economy.  It is only proper that I should refer to the serious problems that are afflicting our people.  Most small businessmen will say that, on a daily basis, they are being pursued up and down the highways and byways of the country by inspectors from various Departments.  Those inspectors are in hot pursuit of the last of a dying breed known as Irish business men and women.  It is time social and economic sanity was restored by the Government.

People no longer have trust in the Government or the institutions of State.  That is a frightening new development and the Bill advances it.  It is desirable that the Government are seen to be a partner by workers and business interests.  Otherwise more people will engage in the black economy which has flourished in recent years.  Unless serious amendments are made to Government policies anarchy is around the corner.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to describe the Bill as anything other than a political exercise.  Over a ten year period the £30 million invested on a yearly basis will mean £30 million in losses.  According to section 33 a maximum of £250,000 will be provided for the purpose of leasing offices and accommodation.  I doubt that the corporation will be allowed to survive in view of an imminent change of Government but, if it survives, I am satisfied it will contribute no more than its own bankruptcy and a total loss of the capital invested.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing to see speakers on the other side acting as begrudgers.  They acted in the same way when the IDA were established by the House.  They choose to ignore the poor performance we have had from the indigenous Irish section and seem to be content that 80 per cent of exports should come from foreign corporations.  The Opposition seem to be content to see Ireland become an outpost in the back woods for these foreign enterprises.  It is disappointing that that destructive attitude is being adopted by the Opposition. They are choosing to ignore the enormous success of agencies in the venture capital area doing the type of work that the NDC is designed to do.  For example, I should like to cite the US experience where they say that for a £200 million investment in venture capital they succeeded in producing £6,000 million in sales, growths per year of 33 per cent per annum and money from tax revenue of £100 million.  That is exactly half the money that went in every year from the corporations being set up.  This is the sort of success that we can achieve with the NDC properly designed and structured. It is disappointing to hear Opposition speakers harping about the way in which the legislation is being brought forward and complaining of duplication when it is quite evident from the Bill that there is no duplication whatsoever.  They seem content to see what we have seen here over the last 20 years &mdash; high rates of investment, yet a starvation of resources for the productive base of the economy and the main vehicles of investment going into property and Government gilts &mdash; the non-productive areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This move to establish the NDC represents a major point in that performance which we have experienced to date.  It is an entirely worthwhile initiative.  There is an enormous gap to be filled by the NDC, a huge gap in the financial structure for venture capital.  The bulk of the funds that have been spawned by our financial institutions are not by any means venture captial, although they might choose to call it that.  They are essentially the funds of people who are only willing <Col N="1476" /> to put their money into companies with a well defined market, with well defined products, that have a good foothold in those markets.  These are not venture capitalists.  They want very sound, bankable projects and the only reason that these financial institutions here call themselves venture capitalists when they are financing this type of operation is that of their dismal failure in the past to provide any money that could be available to people setting up in new industry other than on the old terms.  Those terms, as you well know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are five year loans and the like, repayable constantly.  No person setting up in the formative years of a company or enterprise can repay money on that basis.  These financial institutions are quite happy to give somebody, perhaps building a house or a property, 30 year funds with no such commitment.  Their only reason for doing that is that they have been too linked with the idea of wanting full security for their investment. That is something which does not exist in the financial structures of other countries. In countries like Japan, the United States and even the United Kingdom, the banking system is quite willing to put forward funds to new companies trying to set up on other than short term bases. We have been locked for too many years into a situation in which the productive base of the economy, the people willing to set up a viable employment creating activities, have not had access to money on reasonable terms.  We found that it has only been through the grace of the IDA that any such funds have become available and that has been on a narrow grant-giving basis.  That is not satisfactory, for the most obvious reason that, by and large, those grants coming from the IDA have gone to foreign corporations.</P>
    <P>The whole beauty of the NDC is that we keep the corporations Irish and if we are short of skills we bring in skills from abroad.  It would be very retrograde not to move with this opportunity offered by the NDC to shift from what we have known for so long &mdash; foreign based industries gaining the major benefits from their <Col N="1477" /> enterprises here.  This corporation offers the opportunity of a shift to Irish owned and Irish run businesses providing the jobs and the economic future for the country.  That, as we have learned to our cost in recent years, is the only way in which we can assure that companies will be well rooted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that under the business expansion scheme the needs of venture capital are slowly beginning to be met.  It is entirely beside the point for people to say that there are plenty of funds there and that the shortage is in projects needing to be financed.  The reality is that there is a gross mismatch between the sort of funds available generally in this economy and the sort of investment projects here.  It is only one or two funds that have been established under the business expansion scheme being brought in by this Government that are slowly beginning to fill some of that gap. There remains an enormous gap still to be filled and the NDC will be moving into that as one of its targets.</P>
    <P>It is quite right for people who have commented on this Bill to say that we must be very careful to avoid duplication with the IDA.  The Minister has stated that he will be insisting on an operational agreement between the two.  That will be very worthwhile.  There are very important things that need to be done that the IDA have not touched on at all.  One obvious one is to provide loan capital other than on a very short term basis which, as I have described, is all that is available from the normal financial institutions. There is a need for genuine venture capital to finance companies at the start up stage, not when they are well established.  There is a need for seed capital, by which is meant money available to finance companies in the pre-production phase.  Private venture capital funds are not willing to look at that phase.  Obviously, small individuals who have ideas and want to do some research and establish prototypes that might be launched on to a market find that all costs money and private funds are unwilling to go along with that here at present.  That is a huge gap that needs to be filled by the NDC <Col N="1478" /> and it will be very successful in doing that.</P>
    <P>Probably the most important job for the NDC which the IDA do not do is to set about nurturing corporate entities here that are capable of bringing opportunities to fruition.  While it is true to say that there are projects about, we cannot ignore that there is a great lack of an adequate number of projects which have a decent chance of success.  The problem has been predominantly the lack of management teams in Ireland capable of bringing forward a project to a phase where it can start up and get going.  The NDC would fail to fulfil their potential if they sit in their office waiting for people to come to them with ideas and if they acted as a passive venture capital financing agency.  The important gap that the corporation will move into is entirely distinct from any of the private funds in that they must set about nurturing ideas and the management teams that can bring those ideas to fulfilment.  The IDA's approach of enterprise development and of marketing aids, grants and so on, are all very well if we had good sound teams coming forward looking for those aids. The reality here is that we do not have such management teams.  The NDC should devote themselves to developing just such teams, developing the sort of structures in which they can work successfully. I do not believe that the corporation should be confined solely to companies in the traditional way that we have known them.</P>
    <P>It is very welcome that the terms of the corporation also provide the possibility for them to get involved with co-operatives. There has been an enormous success in the development of the co-operative idea in other countries.  In particular, the Spanish experience, where well structured co-operatives that guaranteed from the outset that they would have a sound financial structure and also had very tight control on the remuneration and takeout by those involved have been highly successful.  The structures which exist in Spain are ones from which we could well learn here.  I would see the NDC as being a very active agency to promote, not just <Col N="1479" /> the traditional corporation idea as a way of generating enterprise but the co-operative approach that has been so successful in other countries where they have been properly structured.  The failure of co-operatives in the past has been due to the fact that their structures have not been sufficiently soundly based to make sure that they would succeed in difficult times. We can learn from the Spanish experiment where they have had no redundancies in 30 years of experience with these co-operatives.  We will only learn from it if we have a State agent who will act as a gadfly to promote these groups.</P>
    <P>The NDC will have to be a very different sort of State agency from anything we have set up before.  We are demanding of them a uniquely difficult combination of things.  They have to be strictly commercial, highly inventive, with an eye for combinations that can prove successful over a long period of time, not necessarily in the first year or two of operation.  This is definitely new wine that we cannot pour into the old skins of semi-State bodies as we have known them.  We must break new ground in structuring the NDC if they are to fulfil their unique role.</P>
    <P>There are some absolute prerequisites if the NDC are to succeed.  There must be a very exceptional team of workers. The Minister has rightly drawn attention to that need.  However, I would question the terms of section 27 where it is specified that the rewards to be offered to members of the NDC are to be within DPS rulings.  The Department of the Public Service will be setting terms of remuneration and providing directives not only for the staff generally but also for the chief executive of the NDC.  That is not the correct way to proceed.</P>
    <P>Where venture capital has succeeded, where companies like the NDC have succeeded, is where they have had the very top people.  Many of these will perhaps have to be found overseas if they are not found in Ireland.  We would be hamstringing the NDC if we hammered them into the old mould of DPS restrictions on pay and terms of employment.  If we want individuals in the NDC who are capable <Col N="1480" /> of doing the highly difficult task of picking winners which can provide commercial return, we must be willing to pay them rewards commensurate with that extremely difficult task.  Section 27 must be seriously examined before it goes through.</P>
    <P>We must also break entirely new ground with regard to freedom from arbitrary political intervention.  I welcome the Minister's statement that, where ministerial directives are issued to the NDC, they will be of a general nature.  In other words, he does not intend to issue orders to the NDC which would deal with specific investments or day-to-day operations. However, I question whether he has gone far enough in this respect.  Very real concern has been expressed that the NDC could in time be subverted to supporting particular politically sensitive industries or industries in politically sensitive areas, that they could be subverted from their commercial brief towards a social or political brief.</P>
    <P>This is a threat which has been mentioned by outside commentators and it behoves us to draw special attention to it and structure the Bill so that it could not happen.  The reason it is more important in the case of the NDC than in the case of other semi-State bodies is that the latter have very clear commercial targets to be achieved.  A company running on normal commercial terms can see profits or losses on a year by year basis, but the NDC will have long gestation periods in their investments and the possibility of failure will be slow to come to the surface. We should build in more protection.</P>
    <P>Having set up the NDC with a clear commercial brief, I do not see why we should require them to go back to the Minister for sanction in cases of projects over a certain figure, or to go to the Government for sanction in cases of investment over another figure.  If we set up a company with clear-cut objectives, targets and performance measures, we should not ask them to come cap in hand to the Minister or the Government for approval to do what they have been set up to do.  I do not see the sense in having that control over the activity of the NDC. <Col N="1481" /> The argument in the White Paper is that the NDC might have too many eggs in one basket if this provision were not included.  If we set up a corporation with a decent board and decent employees they will not put all their eggs into a basket and threaten the viability of the corporation.  Certainly I do not think the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would have any more expertise to tell us there were too many eggs in a particular basket than would the NDC themselves.  There is no necessity for ministerial control over these matters. Ministerial control should be only in regard to setting objectives and clear performance tests for the corporation.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill states that only general directives will be given, some general directives could subvert the commercial thrust of the NDC.  For instance, if the Minister should insist on a quota of funds going to a particular type of industry or to a particular region, that would be pulling the NDC away from their initial criteria. It is the Minister's role to set targets if he believes they should be adhered to. However, if the Minister is going to tell the NDC that he wants a certain quota in a certain region, or for certain industries, or for certain types of people, he should be willing to pay an explicit subsidy by way of grant-in-aid to the NDC, a sum that would bridge the gap between the target rate of return they are expected to achieve and what they could achieve by adhering to his directives.  In other words, if the Minister is to tell them to support certain social causes or certain areas which are having difficulties, he should be willing to give extra money to finance them specifically.  He should not be able to do it under the counter, if you like, by just telling the NDC: &ldquo;I want so many of your enterprises to be located in County Donegal this year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have referred to remuneration for NDC employees.  Another matter on which we must be more careful in the framing of the corporation than in the case of other corporations is duplication <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other agencies.  The provisions in section 10 are not sufficiently clear-cut to clarify the borders between <Col N="1482" /> the different agencies.  We have several bodies operating in spheres similar to the NDC in some respects.  Most comments have been concentrated on the IDA who predominantly provide grant aid as well as assistance to enterprise development, marketing aids and many such developments. But there are other agencies which must have clear lines of communication with the NDC.  In particular I would refer to the NBST who are charged with the duty of bringing science and technology to economic fruition.  We have the ICC who are supposed to provide the financial base for industry.</P>
    <P>We must look radically at what the ICC are doing.  The private financial sector have failed to provide the proper venture capital, but that is equally true of the ICC.  They have failed to come forward with venture capital.  They have worked on very conservative banking criteria when financing enterprises.  They have failed to take equity participation of more than 20 per cent, and this has confined them to providing only a very narrow kind of financial package for potential investors.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must not only ensure that the NDC will not encroach on the IDA or the ICC, but we must look at the ICC again to make sure they are doing what they should be doing.  They should be taking up the financial funding of new enterprises, which they are not doing. That may have to be done by the NDC because the ICC are not doing it.  We should make the ICC into a more flexible financial institution than they are.  That would free the NDC to concentrate on an inventive approach to new enterprises. That would get the corporation out of a solely financial role and into the far more important role of discovering new enterprises, putting together good corporate teams, co-operative groups and so forth.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is time to question the entire concentration of the IDA on grant giving as against taking equity shareholding. The IDA have been forced by the poor packages offered by financial institutions to take up a sort of banking role, so that the IDA have become, in a way, venture capitalists without getting <Col N="1483" /> returns on their investments.  We now have an opportunity to look again and question whether they should be taking more equity participation in industry as opposed to merely grant giving.</P>
    <P>The reason I bring up the roles of these companies is to try to ensure that they are doing what they ought to be doing so that the NDC will be left free to do the formidable and very important tasks of developing true enterprises and opportunities and to fill in for deficiencies in the existing institutions.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this exciting Bill which offers great possibilities for new enterprise development.  The success of such agencies in the US has been enormous. We cannot wait for private imitations which have been so slow in coming.  This Bill is one of the most worthwhile initiatives we have seen in recent times and I look forward to the day when it will be looked back on as a milestone in the way the IDA were looked back on when they were established in 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that indigenous enterprises in Ireland need to be promoted, stimulated and encouraged if we are to strengthen and consolidate our economy.  I listened with great interest to what Deputy Richard Bruton has said.  I am afraid he does not echo his brother's views on the NDC.  What is in a name? The only conclusion I can come to is there may be many votes in it, and that seems to be what the Government think.  Why else would they waste so much time and effort and taxpayers' money to change the name of the National Enterprise Agency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to admire their advertising. They will take away your old fashioned brand X, the NEA, and they will replace it with a new improved miracle, the NDC from Labour Party Enterprises, with the added ingredient of £300 million of share capital, all guaranteed to wash away those nasty unemployment figures.  I would love to buy it, but so would the 250,000 people on the dole and on Government schemes for pretending that <Col N="1484" /> they are not unemployed.  So would the 20,000 people who are emigrating annually.</P>
    <P>We would love to believe that the £300 million is real money, but we cannot help but remember whom we are dealing with. This is the Government that raised more than £84 million on the youth employment levy and passed only £5 million on to the Youth Employment Agency.  This is the Government that slashed capital spending by 25 per cent and left 45,000 building workers without jobs.  This is the Government that have been content to watch living standards drop by 10 per cent.  Now they want to pose as the people who discovered the merits of Government spending.</P>
    <P>Perhaps they intend to raise this £300 million by borrowing.  After all, this Government of fiscal rectitude have us in debt to the tune of £22½ billion.  These gimmicks would be embarrassing during the run-up to an elaction but to see this administration after three years in office playing musical chairs with our semi-State bodies is nothing less than shameful.</P>
    <P>What purpose will this charade serve? What national developments can this corporation bring about that were beyond the powers of the NEA?  The answer is that the NDC are the development. Overnight they will create jobs for the unfortunate workers made redundant by the scrapping of the NEA; they will go to employ a board of directors and probably give work to the people supplying their office furniture, etc.  By then, of course, it will be time for another election and who cares what will happen after that? The Government obviously do not.  It is clear from this piece of non-legislation that they are as tired of governing as the people are of being governed by them. It would not be so bad if the Minister, Deputy John Bruton, would give up the pretence about this wretched thing.  Was there ever a less likely convert?  In the speech with which he introduced the Bill in the House he rephrased a crucial provision so as fundamentally to alter the whole character of the Bill.  I quote section (10) (1) (a) which says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> to invest, in consultation, where appropriate, with State-sponsored bodies, in any enterprise (including any enterprise which is wholly or partly owned by a State-sponsored commercial enterprise) which, in the opinion of the Corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment;</P>
    <P>Let us turn aside for the moment from contemplating the idea of State-sponsored bodies investing in enterprises owned by State-sponsored bodies in order to increase private sector activity. It is all too easy to imagine what horrors would emerge from such an incestuous relationship.  Instead I am asking the House to concentrate on the last few words on that subsection which read &ldquo;or providing viable employment;&rdquo;.  They recur throughout this section, in the same context, in reference to the National Development Corporation investing in, managing and establishing various enterprises. That fag end of the sentence enshrines the junior Coalition partners' hopes for the National Development Corporation.  It means that, if any given enterprise could convince them about providing viable employment, they could forget all about the more stringent requirements, about profitability and so on.  That is what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves what the Minister, Deputy J. Bruton &mdash; who will hold the whip hand over the NDC &mdash; sees as their objective.  On 23 October he said in this House, as quoted in the Official Report, Volume 361, column 308:</P>
    <P>Obviously, its remit will be to invest in enterprises which are, or are capable of becoming, profitable and efficient and offer reasonable prospects for development and the provision of viable employment.</P>
    <P>Somehow the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; has been replaced by the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  Suddenly provision for viable employment becomes, not a satisfactory alternative to <Col N="1486" /> efficiency and profitability, but the last and least of the Minister's requirements. The Minister can stand up in this House with his hand on his heart and contend that that was just a slip of the tongue but, of course, he will not expect us to believe him.  He has changed the whole concept of this Bill.  To contend that it is a slip of the tongue would be good news for the taxpayer worried about the establishment of yet another semi-State white elephant.  Instead what we have here is undoubtedly a white mouse, nothing more than a gesture of contempt on the part of the Government to all those seeking a real initiative on unemployment.</P>
    <P>What effect is this hollow, semi-State body supposed to have on the crucial issue of private investment in native industry?  Can the Minister point to a single line in the provisions of this Bill which will cause the private investor to switch from gilts or property to risk-taking investment?  No, he cannot. Instead we have a useless sham whose principal objectives the Minister is standing on their heads before it is even passed into law.  This Bill is being called a sop to the Labour Party.  It is not even that.  It is a dupe, a con trick done on them as well as the electorate.  We shall see if the ordinary voter is as easily fooled as are the Labour Ministers in this Cabinet.  I hope we have seen the last of these renaming Bills but I fear not.  When Aer Lingus get their new fleet, they will abolish that and call them some other name, because this represents the plan of action of the present Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that some rather more serious changes would be effected when he introduced this Bill.  He told us that directors would be appointed without any regard to political allegiance. Certainly I shall not smile at that claim by the Minister or his Party.  Political patronage is a very bad business and has done much harm to the reputation of this House.  Usually the only person who suffers is the taxpayer in terms of service given by political appointees.  Who cares? It is entirely for the Minister's conscience whether his appointees live up to this proud boast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The present Taoiseach, who is so self-righteous about the question of political patronage once vowed that he would not associate with the Fine Gael Party as long as his colleague, Deputy O.J. Flanagan, was in it, because he stated on television that he was all in favour of political patronage.  When he was just a member of the party the Taoiseach called for his expulsion from the party.  That same Taoiseach now, with the record behind him of political patronage, could be called king of the political patrons.  We shall see the very same happen now with their friends and friends of friends established on these State boards.</P>
    <P>Worker directors is an aspect over which the Minister has skimmed, and not looked at nearly closely enough.  He mentioned briefly workers' shareholding in industry.  I believe this to be a real area for development here.  What astonishes me is that the Minister has said on many occasions that private industry should have worker shareholders.  But never once has he talked about or initiated any plans for shareholders in State industry. There is a need for it.  It is the key to motivation of employees at all levels.  A worker with a share in the business has a completely different kind of morale and commitment from one confined to a sterile &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have seen An Bord Telecom offer their shares to the public, preference shares being offered at a very low price to the workers in proportion to their years of service.  This would have afforded them a real say in their operations.  It would have been of real advantage to the National Development Corporation or to the ventures in which they would participate.  I am disappointed not to find more explicit mention of it in the Bill itself inasmuch as it would contribute to the drive for profitability, development and growth of an enterprise. Why is it not one of the requirements on the Minister's list?  Enterprises in which the National Development Corporation invest must make some provision for offering shares to their employees on favourable terms.  Since <Col N="1488" /> the Minister obviously does not intend to spend his famous £300 million share capital, at least it would provide him with an original excuse for turning down applicants.</P>
    <P>While he is considering this let him consider also the £1 billion we are spending on unemployment, on the 250,000 people without a real job.  These people have a real share in our national corporation; they were granted it at birth under the terms of our Constitution.  What would the Minister, as an expert, advise these shareholders to do?  Should they cut their losses and get out, with the tens of thousands currently emigrating to get away from this Government's policies, or should they hang on until the value rises again?  When will that be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to the payment which would be made between now and the end of 1985 to farmers, especially those in disadvantaged areas.  Some 20,000 flockowners in the 1985 sheep headage scheme in the disadvantaged areas are now being paid £10 million at the rate of £9.50 per ewe.  They could get another £7 million if the EC fixes the amount of the 30 per cent advance of the 1985 ewe premium in time.  However, that is a matter for the EC to decide and we are pushing it for a decision.  Over 50,000 applicants in the cattle headage and beef cow schemes in the disadvantaged areas will be paid a total of about £21 million.  Forty one thousand applicants will be paid £7 million in premium grants under the 1985 suckler cow scheme and this payment is being made five months earlier than normal.  Thirty six thousand applicants will be paid some £5 million in 1985 calf premium grants.  A great deal of credit is due to the field staff of my Department who speeded up inspections of these animals and they have been working hard since August in this regard.  Last year, in the period between August and the end of the year, we paid a total of £33 million in headage grants and other support schemes; this year we will be paying out about £50 <Col N="1490" /> million to the same group of farmers. Priority will be given, where possible, to farmers in areas which were severely affected by the weather.</P>
      <P>Because of budgetary constraints I cannot raise the headage payments to the maximum level permitted by the EC of 101 ECUs, that is £75.75 on each livestock unit in the 1985 scheme, which would cost an extra £49 million before recoupment of 50 per cent from the EC. Even after recoupment a year later the extra cost would still be very substantial at £24,500,000.  The national plan provides for an increase in the rate of payment on beef cows in 1986 from £32 to £70.  This substantial increase will benefit some 45,000 beef cow farmers in the disadvantaged areas and put almost £11 million extra into those areas in a full year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to make grants available in the new and reclassified disadvantaged areas in respect of the 1985 headage schemes as it would cost £7 million in the current year and no provision was made for this in the Estimate. As to the proposal for reassessment of means under the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme, I wish to point out that in June the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare announced revised arrangements for dealing with claims for unemployment assistance for smallholders in western areas.  Under these arrangements a smallholder who wishes to have his means reviewed will, on application, have his means investigated by a social welfare officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the suggestion that loans should be provided through the European Investment Bank at low fixed interest rates, the position is that the European Investment Bank provide long term fixed interest loans for capital investment purposes.  In the past, such loans obtained from the EIB were lent to farmers by the ACC for periods of approximately ten years.  The interest applying to these loans was in the region of 14 per cent and any similar facility which might be arranged at present would probably be at a rate in the region of 12 <Col N="1491" /> per cent to 13 per cent.  The European Investment Bank are not in the market for supplying short term loans, that is loans of less then seven years, and therefore the suggestion put forward does not really relate to the problems confronting farmers at present.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Noonan's suggestion that the ACC and the banks should take full account of the hardship experienced by farmers following the bad weather and should help them to overcome their present difficulties.  Farmers who, as a result of these adverse weather conditions, find difficulty in meeting repayments on working capital loans should not feel that short term problems will lead to any punitive action by the lending institutions.  The Government have responded very generously to the difficult situation by agreeing to provide assistance for farmers in difficulty to purchase winter feed.  Government assistance will be in the form of a feed voucher scheme over the whole country which will enable farmers who have a serious shortage of winter feed to buy feeding stuffs.  This scheme will be based on £14 million from the Exchequer and 125,000 tonnes of intervention grain at 75 per cent of the intervention price from the EC.  The overall level of aid is substantial given the current difficult budgetary situation here and in the European Community.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the form of assistance to be made available, my main concern was to ensure that farmers were given the type of assistance they needed and that the assistance was directed at farmers in greatest need.  Since the main problem facing farmers is a shortage of winter feed for their livestock, it seems reasonable that the assistance should be in the form of feed vouchers to enable them to purchase winter feed.  These vouchers, which will be available all over the country, can be used by farmers against purchases of compound feeds.  The vouchers will consist of two parts, a cash element representing the Exchequer contribution and a credit conferring an entitlement to intervention grain at 75 per cent of the <Col N="1492" /> intervention price at the time the grain is removed from store.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise two points here.  First, about 75 per cent of the voucher will be in the form of cash which can be used against winter feed and I am satisfied that the full value of this part of the voucher will be passed on to the farmers.  The second point is that individual farmers will not be expected to present the grain element of the voucher to my Department in exchange for intervention grain.  The intention is that farmers will negotiate a value for this part of the voucher with their local grain merchant on the basis of the prevailing market and intervention prices.  The merchant will make feed available to the farmer to this value as well as to the value of the cash element.  The merchants will submit the vouchers to my Department in exchange for cash and cheap intervention grain.  Alternatively, merchants may pass on the vouchers to larger merchants or feed compounders.</P>
    <P>My guiding principle is to ensure that assistance is given to the farmers who need it most.  The scheme is confined to farmers who are mainly dependent on farming, whose off-farm income combined with that of their spouse does not exceed £6,400 per annum, those who do not have more than 60 livestock units and those who have less than 75 per cent of winter feed requirements for their livestock. I cannot tell exactly what the rate will be until the applications come in but we estimate that although over 70,000 farmers will submit applications between 50,000 and 70,000 farmers will be eligible.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the Government response to the fodder problem should be in the form of increased headage payments in the disadvantaged areas without any regard to the fodder situation of the recipients.  With the rather limited Exchequer resources available, it is necessary for us to adopt a selective scheme aimed at genuine hardship cases.  Giving increased headage payments in the disadvantage areas without regard to the actual fodder needs of the farmers concerned would mean aid <Col N="1493" /> for some farmers who may have no fodder problems at all.  Also the fodder problem is not confined to disadvantaged areas and a blanket scheme like that would result in a situation where farmers in other parts of the country could not be assisted.  Such farmers would be justifiably aggrieved that other farmers who did not have any problem got assistance from the Government and the inequity must be obvious to everybody.  Neither do I think it fair to ask taxpayers to fund such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said last night that I had refused to go along with a scheme put forward by one of the farming organisations in the past couple of weeks.  I did not refuse, I have the matter under review and we do not have any insuperable problems with the EC in this regard. There was a belief that we might be ruled out of order if we brought in the scheme for one year only.  We can overcome that problem and we are keeping the matter under review with regard to budgetary constraints and the Estimates which are at present being drawn up.  As I said, I will examine the matter.</P>

    <P>Overall the Government have responded generously to a very difficult situation.  We have provided a silage scheme that has been taken up by 24,000 farmers.  We are making available <Col N="1494" /> immediately £50 million by speeding up the headage payments system.  The Government are putting in a sum of £17,500,000, together with the £4,250,000 from the EC.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the motion in the name of our spokesman on Agriculture.  In the short time available to me I wish to focus on a matter connected with the flooding of the Shannon Valley. I realise it is not under the direct authority of the Minister for Agriculture but I ask him to make a case to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I wish to make the case for the setting up of a special Shannon authority.  The reason is obvious.  Farmers who live south of Athlone, on the east bank of the Shannon, have been subjected to flooding for many years.  I was born and grew up in Athlone and I remember the severe flooding in the winter of 1954.  Following that, an American civil engineer, Mr. Rydell, came to Ireland and he issued the famous Rydell report.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this report but if he is not I shall refresh his mind.  Having toured the Shannon Valley, Mr. Rydell made many suggestions.  One related to overall drainage which is not feasible.  No matter how often that dream was used as a siren call at numerous elections, full drainage of the Shannon is not on.  In his recommendations he called for something that has been re-echoed in every major seminar and conference on the Shannon.  These seminars have been called by the ESB, the Office of Public Works, local authorities, development associations and tourist authorities.  All of them have asked for an overall Shannon authority that would have within its control the regulating of all matters relating to the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers in my constituency are used to flooding on an annual basis from <Col N="1495" /> October to March.  Their land cannot be used during that time.  Last summer early in July their lands became flooded and by the middle of August they were totally unusable.  It has been said that farmers should have got into silage earlier in the year but that was not a feasible solution on the lands I am talking about because of the nature and terrain of the area.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have responsibility for navigation on the Shannon and the ESB have responsibility for maintaining water levels for power purposes. Both of them operate within their own regulations, many of which are outdated. However, they operate without any liaison with one another.</P>
    <P>In September I walked on Meelick weir.  I know the Minister visited many areas, as he pointed out in detail last night.  If he had visited Meelick weir he would have seen that half of the eyes are not working which means that water cannot flow through them.  Maintenance work is not being carried out on the side of the banks of the Shannon simply because it is not the responsibility of any one body.  The Office of Public Works, the ESB and the local authorities eschew this work.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his good offices with the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, in connection with this matter. He seems to think there is nothing wrong with the Shannon but that is not so.  What is needed is some simple maintenance work.  I am talking about dredging, about side line maintenance and keeping weirs and eyes of weirs open to ensure a proper water course and water flow.  This would help the farmers in my area, as would the setting up of a Shannon authority.  Other members of my party will deal with matters such as the shortfall in fodder and payments for disadvantaged areas.  I ask the Minister to consider what I have said and to convey my remarks to the relevant Minister.</P>

      <P>The past summer has imposed severe hardship on farmers in <Col N="1496" /> my constituency.  I know the Minister visited the west during August.  Last night he told us he visited the agricultural show at Ballina and also shows in other areas. We talk about damage in the Shannon valley but the Owenmore and the Arrow rivers in my constituency need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will mention also the Bonet river in north Leitrim which is being drained.  Farmers in the catchment areas of the rivers Arrow and Owenmore should get special treatment also because they suffer every year when we have freak floods.  This year they suffered most severely.  When Mr. Joe Rea visited a farmer in that area in August he found that the farmer had housed his dairy herd fulltime and he was then feeding them on silage that was intended for the winter.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not pay double headage payments in the disadvantaged areas as was done in 1981. The agricultural advisers are visiting farmers to see if they will qualify for grants for silage.  They will also assess them to see if they qualify for grain vouchers. What will all of this cost?  One way out of the difficulty was to pay double headage payments to those in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I come from the west and this summer we had the worst weather we ever experienced during summer months.  I remember being in Dáil Éireann in early July and the weather was nice but in the west it was raining every day.  The farmers in Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Cavan have been hit more severely than farmers in any part of Ireland, I work on a small farm and I know this is true.  The Minister even now should give double headage payments to farmers in those disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The Owenmore river should have been drained many years ago but consecutive Governments have not done so.  In my view it should have been done when the arterial drainage was included in the western drainage scheme.  That scheme has been discontinued and I hope the Government will do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments in support of the Fianna Fáil motion asking for additional aid for the farming community because of the damage done to their crops due to adverse weather earlier this year.  Thankfully the weather has improved.  Without apology I want to make a case for further aid.</P>
      <P>Many people think the farming community are privileged people, but the reality is that the majority of them, particularly those who lost most, have incomes considerably less than the average industrial wage.  These people live mainly in the west.  The amount being given to agriculture as a percentage of the overall Estimates is reducing all the time.  In 1985 the total contribution to agriculture was £252 million, less than 5 per cent of the national Estimates.  Agriculture is lauded day in and day out as the backbone of our economy, an area which employs up to 50 per cent of the work force, directly or indirectly, and is responsible for 50 per cent of our net exports, but it does not fare very well when it comes to sharing the national cake.</P>
      <P>I do not think the response to the difficulties experienced by the farming community this year has been adequate. Looking at the rag bag of measures provided this year, totalling £17.5 million, under any heading the maximum which any farmer will get is £500.  A person in the Shannon area will get a maximum of £20 per livestock unit.  Hay this year is costing £4 per bale.  Twenty pounds would only buy five bales.  How can an animal live for five months on five bales?  I do not know.  I do not believe this will make any contribution to solving these difficulties.  It is sad that the major contributor to the national economy is in dire trouble.  This fact has been recognised by the EC.  When he visited Ireland Mr. Legras said this was a national disaster and that a member state was entitled to support from Brussels, but it was regrettable that, nationally, we were not able to do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's script last night we <Col N="1498" /> came across references to budgetary constraints. I know the Minister wanted to help the farming community and it is regrettable that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance did not allow additional moneys to be made available, especially when Brussels were prepared to meet each £ contributed by the national Exchequer on a £ for £ basis.  I want to compliment the major farming organisations for announcing their contribution of £7 million, with an additional £7 million from the national Exchequer, making £14 million.  This means that £28 million would be made available to improve the cash flow in farming areas. It is a pity that was not availed of, nor was the increase in the headage payments availed of.</P>
    <P>Since the major problem was in the 12 western counties, the additional payments under the headage scheme would have helped the people in that area to increase the cash flow without a consequent increase in administrative costs.  It is a pity that the reclassified areas could not have been facilitated by payments during 1985.  This showed a lack of interest by the Department of Agriculture in the problems facing the west.  People were informed that they were in severely handicapped areas and were entitled to headage payments in March 1985, but when the inspections took place in August they were told the herds would not be read until 1985.  That was regrettable.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's script last night there was mention of a figure of £27 million as a costing for the extension, but in tonight's script that figure was changed to £7 million.  In my opinion that is an exaggeration. Three million pounds or £4 million would be nearer the mark.  We know that officials of the Department are liable to juggle with figures, and whether the figure is £27 million or £7 million may not be of significance to some of them, but to the farming community it would be of very great significance.</P>
    <P>I support this motion to help not just farmers but the entire agricultural industry. There is no point in just talking about agriculture and its contribution to the <Col N="1499" /> national economy if we are not prepared to fund it, if at the drop of a hat, to facilitate some of the left wingers in Government who want a National Development Corporation, we are prepared to expend up to £300 million on that corporation, but we cannot contribute an additional £7 million to agriculture which would mean a further £14 million from the EC.  This would ensure that for this year's winter and the spring of 1986 the farming community would be in a position to maintain their stock and their cow herds.</P>
    <P>We have the constraint of the super-levy and the self-imposed constraint in that there is no longer a farm modernisation scheme.  We have been promised a new farm improvement scheme, but we see no evidence of it.  I submit that the bulk of this £17 million which is being juggled around under different headings is a saving from different areas of agriculture. Because of the adverse weather conditions farmers were not able to avail of the grant aids which were available and they now find themselves without any farming schemes.</P>
    <P>The younger farmers, Macra na Feirme in particular, have made the point that their counterparts in the other member states have available to them establishment aid grants and in-station premia, but unfortunately the Department of Agriculture have not been able to implement that scheme here.  I suspect their colleagues in the Department of Finance will turn down any request for aid to agriculture.  How many more times&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will the Minister for Agriculture come to the Cabinet table looking for amounts due to them and be turned down and told that agriculture is not the priority and that they need the money for the National Development Corporation or anything other than agriculture? The Minister and his Ministers of State should tell the Department of Finance that they are sick and tired of <Col N="1500" /> being turned down when looking for finance to develop farming, agricultural processing, marketing of agricultural products and so on and that they need a fair share of the cake.  The Minister should tell the Department that he is getting only 5 per cent of the entire estimate for the running of this country, for agriculture, that he has to make do with the national agriculture export promotion boards having to try to do their business with less than £1 million whereas in the industrial area the amount of money provided is at least 30 times that, that he wants to see a greater relevance for agriculture at the Cabinet table and to see the Department of Finance giving greater priority to agriculture, and that he would have liked to see the crisis which has developed as a result of adverse weather conditions given a sense of reality to the people responsible for the provision of finance in this area.</P>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion before this House for increased aid to the farming community, not so much for the farmers but for the entire agricultural industry as a base for our national economy. We cannot allow farmers in need of cash flow to face this winter without additional aid.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's amendment.  The aid provided by the Government and the EC is welcomed by a large majority of farmers in difficulty. Neither the farming organisations nor farmers expected the Government to compensate everybody with fodder problems or with tillage problems on a £ for £ basis.  What was asked for was compensation for farmers who lost the majority of their winter fodder and the Minister reacted to this in the package he has announced.  During this debate it was said that none of the fodder provided in the scheme had been made available.  This is winter fodder and it is not supposed to be made available until required during the winter months from mid-November to March or April next year.  The Minister reacted positively.</P>

      <P>I do not understand the calls from the Opposition to the Minister for a full amount of compensation to be paid across the board in the disadvantaged areas whether or not people require it.  The Opposition called for money for farmers to buy fodder, which is not available at this time of year.  If we provided cash, all we would do would be to put up the cost of the fodder available and only farmers with extra cash would be able to buy it.  This would lead to the poorer person being left with a smaller chance of receiving aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument made by the Opposition that the Government have done nothing positive is wrong.  The last speaker talked about money being made available, with no money at the Cabinet table.  When Deputies look back over the last three years, on every occasion when there was a crisis or a problem in agriculture, the Minister delivered on the problem and on the realities faced not alone in Ireland but in Europe.  The Opposition are continually knocking any good done in the <Col N="1502" /> present circumstances.  The economy is short of cash but I will not go into the reasons why.  The people on the Opposition benches were four years spending money we had not got.</P>

      <P>It is my pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here tonight.  It is important that we recognise the tremendous effort that the Government have made to make finance available to the farmers in this year which has been very difficult from many points of <Col N="1504" /> view but particularly because of the downpours we had all summer.  Obviously, the Opposition have not listened to the Minister, or they are not aware of what he has done for the farming community. Listening last night to some of the Opposition speakers one was horrified to discover that they did not even realise the implications or the details of the schemes being introduced by the Minister. I want to put on record the assistance that the Minister and the Government have made available to farmers in this difficult year.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the nitrogen, the fertiliser scheme which got much criticism from Deputies over there.  Nevertheless, 24,000 applications for the scheme have been made already; 24,000 farmers have availed of this facility.  Let us examine the question of the silage subsidy which again got much criticism.  The number of applications for that scheme highlights how important it was.  In my area many farmers who had not made silage previously and were using hay as the basic feed have now become involved in silage making and many of them will qualify for £4 per tonne for the first 50 tonnes of silage.  Again up to 24,000 farmers have applied for this scheme.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister who said last night that one thing we all have a duty to do is to encourage a changeover from dependence on hay to silage.  This year too many farmers left themselves vulnerable because they were dependent on hay as a basic feed.  I welcome the scheme for the Shannon valley and Suck valley aid.</P>

      <P>Do not be jealous.  I want to compliment the Minister on the efforts he has made to make finance available to farmers who faced devastation in that region.  Many of them found their incomes totally whittled away as a result of the floods over which they had no control.  I feel very strongly about the question of the control of the River Shannon. This is an issue to which at some later stage this House must address itself. I have no doubt that the £20 per livestock <Col N="1505" /> unit which that scheme provides will help many of those farmers to retain and feed their stock over the winter.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of having the Shannon-Suck valley aid extended northwards along the Suck to include areas like Athleague, Fuerty and Ballymoe which have suffered particularly from the flooding.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government and the Minister to bring forward the payment of headage grants because this will make finance available to many hard-pressed farmers to buy winter feed for their stocks.  The amount of money channelled by the Government into this scheme and the fact that payments are to be made early will be a decisive advantage. The Minister will be paying 20,000 flock owners some £10 million in ewe subsidies.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion proposed by our spokesman on Agriculture and to condemn this Government and the Minister for Agriculture for the feeble, fragmented efforts they made over the past summer to try to alleviate the misery suffered by the farmers as a result of the inclement weather.  We must all accept that farming is a risky business and that 1985 was the worst year, weather-wise, for 50 years.  One would think when the Taoiseach announced the plethora of schemes with trumpet blasts in Taughmaconnell and other places that he was about to write a cheque for £100 million for the farmers of the west. Instead we now learn that the application forms were only made available for some of those schemes today.  The schemes were a response to the calls by the Opposition for help for farmers.  We have highlighted the problems being experienced by farmers and farming organisations have brought to the attention of the Government the difficulties being encountered by those involved in agriculture.</P>

      <P>I was the first public representative to visit the Shannon Valley in 1985.  On that occasion I saw tractors, machinery and bales of hay covered with water.  Not alone was meadow and winter feed lost but the grazing that is important to carry farmers into the winter was also covered with water. The Government's response to that was to give a maximum grant of £500 to farmers in the Shannon Valley.  We were <Col N="1508" /> delighted to have the Minister for Agriculture visit us in Ballinasloe, although he was late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Paul Connaughton, the Minister of State, Deputy Deasy put a hurried statement together to the effect that they were extending the Shannon Valley scheme to cover the northern end of the Suck Valley at the back door of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot understand how that Minister of State who represents the constituency of Galway East did not make positive representations to the Government to ensure that the entire Shannon Valley from the Suck bridge at Ballinasloe to Shannon bridge at Portumna and across to Looscaun near Woodford was included in that scheme.  We have areas like Tiernascragh, Boula, Portumna, Ballycrissane, Clonmoylan, Rossmore, Looscaun on the west bank of the Shannon Valley left out.  That represents discrimination by the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Naughten and Deputy O'Rourke, in their call for immediate action in that area.  I hope the Minister will put immediate pressure on the Office of Public Works and the ESB to reduce the water levels and ensure that farmers get a reasonable opportunity of recovering from this disaster.  I call upon the Minister to double the headage payments immediately.  He has said that he will be giving £17.5 million in fragmented schemes but if he doubled the headage payments he would be ensuring that the Government get value for money because the EC would back that scheme with a further £17 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few weeks ago I went to Brussels to seek aid for western farmers and I was told that the money was available but an application had not been made for it.  Not alone that but the Minister for Agriculture brought a scheme from Europe to save the EC money.  The feed voucher scheme will save the Government and the EC a lot of money but denies agriculture, our biggest industry, of vital money that <Col N="1509" /> would be available if a proper plan was put to the agricultural Commissioner.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the £100 million negotiated by Deputy Lenihan when Minister for Agriculture in October 1982 from the European Investment Bank is made available immediately to farmers.  If that occurs it will take the pressure off the ACC.  That money should be made available at a low interest rate of 5 per cent immediately. The money is available and I appeal to the Minister to apply for it.  I appeal to the Minister, in the interests of farmers in the west, to make representations to get a decision from the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Donnellan, to ensure that small farmers who lost unemployment assistance have it restored immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's priority should have been to introduce adequate measures to ensure the retention of our breeding stock, be it milk or beef.  What has been done to date is inadequate.  At the minimum, help should have been given for feed and credit.  The way the Government face up to the problems arising out of the wet summer will dictate the trend of agricultural development in the years ahead. The Minister must now regret the withdrawal of farm modernisation grants because had that decision not been made there would have been much more silage conserved.  Those grants were withdrawn at a time when there was a lot of silage development taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cavan-Monaghan, a milk producing area, agriculture is facing a crisis in regard to grain, feed, milk production and so on.  Measures are not being taken to rectify the problems.  In my constituency farmers experienced a huge loss in income.  Producers with heavy outlay on additional feed in the summer months will not go within shouts of reaching their milk quotas while in the south there have been reports that a £20 million payment will have to be made to the EC for exceeding the quota.  That supports what Deputy Brennan said in regard to his constituency.  The Minister must have <Col N="1510" /> completely disregarded the submissions made by ACOT officials in our counties or otherwise he would have given farmers the same attention that he gave those whose land was under 18 inches of water. What is the difference between land that is under three inches of water and land that is under 18 inches of water?</P>
    <P>In our area there was great co-operation between ACOT, the IFA and the banks.  At the end of September the view of ACOT officials was that we would only have 50 per cent of the winter feed and at the end of October, that although we had good weather and a lot of silage was made by way of open pit or bag, it was estimated that we would have only 60 per cent.  Milk producers in that area who took a severe hammering this year have discovered that under the 1936 Act they cannot distribute milk in or near Dublin city.  However, the Dublin dairies when they have a surplus can flood markets elsewhere in the country.  The Minister should examine that.  We have made a request to the EC to rectify this but I urge the Minister to take action before he is compelled to do so by the EC.  The measures introduced were inadequate and the Minister will have to assess every area as he finds it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate and highlight the serious difficulties that confront those involved in the country's biggest industry.  This year will be remembered as one of the most disastrous years ever for agriculture.  Bales of hay were seen floating around in different parts of the country.  The television pictures clearly illustrated the problems farmers face.  The small farmers who depend solely on hay as winter fodder suffered most.  A larger percentage of smallholders do not have silage making facilities mainly because of the economics involved in purchasing the necessary machinery.  Certainly in 1985 their whole base of production will have been devastated. The seriousness of the impact of the weather in 1985 on those smallholders will not be known fully until January or February and right into 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> The possibility of those smallholders being able to stay in agriculture is very doubtful.  Later in the winter, when one has an opportunity of examining the quality of hay and straw saved the bales brought out to feed stock will be found useless.  We could well have another flood of cattle coming on to the market, with a consequent effect on the prices available to stock owners on the marts.  The short term measures being introduced will be seen to be inadequate and the Minister for Agriculture and the officials in his Department will have to look at this problem in the long term. The facilities and machinery available to many smallholders are inadequate.  I am not suggesting that there is any ready-made solution to ensure that these farmers can provide those facilities for themselves.  However, there must be a justifiable case to be made for giving assistance by way of a special scheme to enable them to buy the more modern equipment available today but, unfortunately, beyond the purchasing capacity of many of these holders.  A number of farmers, perhaps three or four should be allowed jointly to purchase such machinery. With the more modern equipment which came on the market during the last two years, particularly for hay making, if grant aid were made available it would help considerably in the future.  This would have a beneficial effect, particularly in the western counties.  Many holdings do not lend themselves to the making of silage and will have to continue with hay as fodder for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The problematic smallholders are not confined to those 12 western counties.  In my own county, on the Cooley peninsula, the mountainous holdings on the north side of the peninsula tend to be overlooked compared with the midlands and south Louth.  The mountainside holdings are in a very serious situation indeed as far as the availability of fodder is concerned. I foresee a very depressing picture for many of them after Christmas, particularly if we have a severe winter.</P>
    <P>I move on to the problems experienced <Col N="1512" /> by the potato growers and the vegetable producers.  Because of the type of weather this year, blight has been a particular problem.  That in turn will have its effect on the yield and quality of potato available.  Potatoes are a very high cost product and the extent of borrowings entered into by many growers leave them in serious financial difficulties.  Many will go to the wall this year because of accumulated problems over the last couple of years.  The potato growers will be out of business, their suppliers will suffer and there could be many millions of pounds worth of potatoes imported into the country at a time when we are actively working towards import substitution. Unless we are prepared to come to terms with the cost of potato production our ability to stem the tide of imports will be considerably diminished.</P>
    <P>The vegetable growers also have been hit badly by the weather and their position is not a very healthy one.  Unfortunately, the Minister has not seen his way to taking the type of measures needed to assist many of these who are in a serious position.  The level of borrowings for the potato and vegetable growers and farmers in general is unacceptable and the repayment capacity of many of the holdings does not, on examination, make economic sense.  That will be a major inhibiting factor as far as agricultural development is concerned.  We are now in the era of the super-levy, talk about cereal quotas and of restrictions on the various lines of agricultural production. A small isolated country off the coast of the mainland of Europe cannot survive without a vibrant, strong and productive agricultural base.  Economists have identified the food industry as an area with considerable potential for development, but if restrictions are placed on the primary production areas the possibilities of of development and expansion will not be realised even though in many areas we have climatic advantages over many countries.  This will affect the economy and the employment creation potential.</P>
    <P>With the type of farm structure that we have, with an abundance of small farms, there must be a case to be made for <Col N="1513" /> uninhibited expansion of our agricultural base for the development of our food industry.  I urge the Minister to take a long, hard and serious look at the possibilities put forward to present our case to Europe and convince the people out there that we will be in a state of stagnation for many years unless the different lines in agriculture are given their heads. It is with great regret that many in agriculture and outside it have read of the refusal of the Department of Finance to allow the establishment aid for young farmers to be included in the revamped farm modernisation scheme.</P>

      <P>It has always been recognised that the level of education and know-how in agriculture was an inhibitant in many respects to the development of the industry.  The establishment aid package could have worked wonders for many of the young farmers who want to become established in agriculture at a time when the possibilities and outlets for employment are non-existent in other areas of the economy.  This may be a result of one of the ideological problems that arise from time to time with a Coalition Government when it comes to making decisions on these matters.  That we are not going to have the package is very serious indeed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> The numbers among the EC member states involved in agriculture have decreased over the years.  That is a sad trend which has been ongoing here for a long time.  I have always held the view that there is a real possibility of employing more people in agriculture.  However, unless we have policies which will encourage young people to become involved, we will have a continuous flight from the land.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to what has been said and, as a farmer, I would be the last person to deny that this has been a bad year.  I would point out that it has been a bad year not only in the west but also the south and east of Ireland.  Some of the rainfall figures for my own constituency were as high as in any other part of the country.  Every farmer suffered as a result of the bad weather.  People who did reasonably well were those involved in dairying, beef and sheep and those who made silage.  It is frustrating to hear people still advocating the making of hay 30 years after ACOT said we should be concentrating on silage making.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the possibility of giving aid in the form of interest to people who are hard hit.  That is the sort of aid which the IFA asked for.  It is well to remember that point.  It will be a very big problem.  This also goes for the protein peas which were probably <Col N="1515" /> a write off this year.  Rye grass was also a write off.  These were problems all over the country and no Government could fully compensate for the losses incurred.</P>
      <P>I would not accept that the position with regard to potato seed is as bad as was indicated here tonight.  Most people seemed to manage to have their crops properly sprayed and are getting very good tonnages, as high as 15 and 16 tonnes of Pentlands.  The Potato Co-operative has been launched and Deputies on all sides should encourage people to join the co-operative.  It was set up with the co-operation of both sides of the House.  People are coming to us now who tell us they are not involved in the co-operative, yet they are worried about imports.</P>
      <P>Strength is in co-operation and that was the whole idea behind the spending of State funds to encourage people to cooperate and take on these imports.  We must remember that we are in a Community and must obey the rules.  Dumping from Holland to here is just like dumping from Cork into Kerry.  It is the same thing.  Very shortly we will be launching a horticultural-vegetable co-operative on a national scale, beginning in the south east where the concentration of vegetables is heaviest.</P>
      <P>There is only so much anybody can do in this House.  We can help with limited finance and through ACOT and the other State agencies, including An Foras Talúntais, but if people do not see the wisdom of what is being offered, there is very little we can do.  You can bring a horse to water but you cannot make him drink.</P>

      <P>I fully support the motion moved by our party spokesman on Agriculture, Deputy Michael Noonan, who is a successful farmer and has served at the highest levels of farming organisation.  He is therefore very capable of dealing with any situation in relation to agriculture.  The motion states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the <Col N="1516" /> magnitude of the crisis faced by many Irish farmers as a result of the poor summer weather, calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>(1)  make available, as a matter of urgency, financial aid to those most seriously affected as identified by ACOT and those crop farmers who need to buy seed for next year;</P>
    <P>(2)  immediately re-assess means under the Smallholders Unemployment Assistance Scheme in the light of the effects of the disaster;</P>
    <P>(3)  increase headage payments to the maximum allowed;</P>
    <P>(4)  speed up the payment of headage grants;</P>
    <P>(5)  extend headage grants to newly designated areas this year, not next;</P>
    <P>(6)  provide low fixed-interest loans through the European Investment Bank; and</P>
    <P>(7)  encourage the banks and the ACC to help farmers bridge their present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I wish to let those opposite know what we are about.  Our motion is very reasonable and its proposals should be put into effect immediately.  It brought a very negative response from a Government who are totally anti-farmer, as has been evident over the past three years.  My colleague, Deputy Noonan, claimed yesterday that £200 million had been withdrawn from the industry which employs directly and indirectly in excess of 500,000 people and whose export content is valued at over 50 per cent of total exports.</P>

      <P>Considering that only 10 per cent of Irish farmers are under 35 years of age, it was a scandalous decision not to avail of such assistance.  There are many other instances of this Government's complete lack of interest or belief in agriculture.  Their answers to date have been an absolute farce.  The bad weather of the summer and early autumn this year has had disastrous affects on every farmer, not just some, as indicated yesterday by the Minister.  I am delighted that his junior Minister recognises that. It is there in black and white but perhaps the Minister did not understand what he was reading.  To indicate that £500, £400, £300 or even less than £100 would be satisfactory is a clear indication of the Government's ignorance, or callousness, or both.  I can give an instance of a farmer in Offaly today.  He is married with four children.  He was told he would possibly succeed in his claim for a grant and that he would get £300.  His fodder shortage this year will cost him £2,500, and he can <Col N="1518" /> be certain that the fodder he buys will not be of good quality.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment is a laugh.  No matter where one comes from, the farmers there have suffered severe losses.  I am glad Deputy Hegarty agrees with me.  The effects of those losses will be felt for years.  The Government's reaction was one of ignorance and drama. The Taoiseach flew over certain areas in his helicopter to see for himself, at first hand, he said, how bad the position was. That gimmick misled people into believing that he was concerned about the plight of farmers.  He confined his flight to a certain area to give the impression that the damage was confined to a small part of the country.</P>
      <P>That trip, of course, was a con job and we have all seen through it.  All it did was to widen the gap between town and country because of its innuendo that farmers were looking for handouts again. We in Fianna Fáil condemn this divide and conquer policy, a tactic constantly employed by our first cousins across the water.  Agriculture needs urgent support if we are to stabilise on and off-farm jobs and hold on to and increase our level of exports.  If the measures we have proposed are not acted on we will see many more young farmers emigrating or joining the dole queue.  The Minister last night and today made it quite clear that he is not aware of the problem countrywide. He proceeded last night to make a joke out of a very serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  He indicated that farmers in the dairying industry saw more grass on their farms this year than in previous years.  That part of it may be true but is he aware that that land, with lush grass, could not take the weight of heavy machinery?  The land was so wet that enormous damage was done to it by cattle and cows.  It was a common sight during summer to see tractors and other machinery bogged down for weeks.  Of course that would not be noticed from a helicopter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" /> The suggestion that there have been only tremors in the beef market could only have come from one who does not attend cattle marts.  The Mickey Mouse scheme of August was a total failure and all the speeches in the world will not change it.  Any silage made in September and last month, though welcome, will be of very poor quality.  The main winter fodders used in Ireland are hay, silage and, to a lesser degree, straw and compounded grain meal.  If farmers are to retain healthy herds they must provide them with good quality feeds.  The summer weather prevented farmers from getting good results.  In the interests of the country, the farmers, and particularly the taxpayers, that must be redressed and this can only be done by acting on our motion immediately.  The nation will thank the Minister for it.</P>
    <P>On this motion, the Minister departed from his script to say that farmers had learned little from similar experiences in other years.  He said they had not provided silage slabs, and so on.  That came from a Minister who scrapped the farm modernisation scheme and effectively finished off any farm building work.  It shows how hypocritical this administration is.  The hail storm that devastated a five kilometre corridor from south Kilkenny to Ardee in Louth cut the leaves off sugar beet, destroyed fruit crops, reduced barley and wheat yields by at least 50 per cent, and we are offered, as the Minister said, token support.  Such a defeatist attitude by the Minister is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I represent many tillage farmers and they have told me of their substantial losses.  Spring wheat was a disaster. Barley yields are back, the quality is very poor and the financial yields are rock bottom.  The junior Minister told us many of them received only £75 per tonne.  We all know it costs £95 to produce a tonne of barley.  As a result, the co-ops, the banks and the ACC cannot be repaid. That means there will be no credit for farmers next year or possibly for years to come.  The investment in an acre of barley is about £300.  How, in such circumstances, can a tuppence-halfpenny <Col N="1520" /> scheme help?  Pictures of hay in flooded fields which we saw on television may have been dramatic but they gave a clear illustration of the position.  Eighty per cent of the country's hay is of poor quality. Much of it has been thrown into ditches.  Today in County Offaly farmers are cutting with scythes to try to get something out of it.  Therefore, I resent any suggestion that farmers are taking advantage of the fodder shortage to feather their own nests.  It has been said they have been selling vast quantities of straw across the Border.  Those who made that suggestion are grossly irresponsible mischief makers.  Co-operatives and others bought straw which normally would have been burned.  It has been said that farmers bought that straw and sold it.  I wish to point out categorically that there has been no bonanza for farmers in that type of transaction.</P>
    <P>We urge the Minister to exhort the banks, the ACC and the co-operatives to take account of the plight of farmers this year.  We do not want fancy statements in the newspapers from anybody.  The slogan &ldquo;pay up or sell out&rdquo; is blackmail at its lowest form.  I call on the Minister to assess immediately farmers' means under the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme.  It is sad to say that people regarded as sound farmers are now approaching the South-Eastern Health Board for assistance.</P>
    <P>The Ministers has said that because of budgetary constraints he cannot do any more.  That is a clear vote of no confidence in agriculture.  The Minister was implying that investment in agriculture is not worth while.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, told us that investment in agriculture yields 14 per cent.  We are calling for such investment. Surely it makes sense to look after the biggest employers, the biggest contributors to the economy.  Excuses by the Minister for his own inadequacy or the lack of commitment by the Government are not adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy P.J. Morley has sought and been granted permission to raise on the Adjournment the threatened imminent closure of Claremorris bacon factory with the loss of 120 jobs in the town.  He has ten minutes and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for having been given this opportunity to raise this very important matter.  With your permission, I should like to give half of my time to my colleague, Deputy Flynn.</P>
      <P>In raising this matter, I am merely reflecting the anxiety felt in my local community because of the impasse which industrial relations have reached in this factory and the widespread concern that everything possible should be done by all who have responsibility in this field to bring the parties together and to avert the possibility of the factory closing.  This is not the usual run of the mill closure where a company gets into financial difficulty, is no longer viable and must put up the shutters.  On the contrary, this is a potentially viable plant and the company have plans to make it so.</P>
      <P>These plans do not involve compulsory redundancies among the 120 people at present employed there.  They do, however, involve slight redeployment of staff and rearrangement of work procedures. A first stage development was carried out some time ago and a second stage awaits implementation.  For almost a year now, this company have had close on £1 million worth of new machinery under wraps which they are waiting to put into operation following the satisfactory resolution of the present difficulties.  There is no economic reason for the factory to close now and both sides agree that it should remain open, but management and union leadership at local level have become entrenched in their respective attitudes towards each other and positions have hardened to the point of stalemate with the result that jobs are in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management say that they will close the plant by the end of the month unless the union nominates somebody other than the present local leadership to negotiate with them.  Already 35 people have been let go since last Friday evening.  The local chamber of commerce have tried to mediate but appear to have reached the end of their tether.  It is here that the Minister could use the prestige of his office to get talks going.  Because of the <Col N="1525" /> sensitivity and delicacy of the situation, fraught with so many far reaching consequences, he should not hesitate to do so. As well as the prestige of his office, he has other machinery available to him which I am sure he could usefully employ to break the logjam.</P>
    <P>I hope he will be able to give a positive indication of his intention in this regard. Until now, this company have had a very happy history in Claremorris.  They were founded in 1930 and have operated continuously and successfully since, giving employment to a large number of people over the years.  The present workforce is in the region of 120, mostly male.  The closure of this factory will not just mean the loss of those jobs and the £25,000 approximately in the weekly pay packets to the local community, but will have adverse repercussions leading to the loss of other jobs in the service side of industry and the greater impoverishment of the community as a whole.  Who can say that if this factory closes the company's two other plants in Letterkenny and Limerick will not also be in danger?</P>
    <P>For all those reasons, I hope the Minister will outline the interest he has taken in this dispute so far, the steps, if any, he has taken to have the crisis resolved and the action he proposes to take now to ensure that my county does not lose one of its traditional and valuable industries because of this unfortunate dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Morley in asking the Minister to come to the aid of this industry which is about to close.  In this connection I think I am speaking on behalf of Deputies from all sides of the political divide in County Mayo.  The reason I speak is that a considerable percentage of the workforce comes from west Mayo despite the fact that the industry is located in east Mayo. The bacon industry has had a difficult time in the recent past but it is an indigenous industry.  Every effort should be made to ensure that industries based on the raw materials of our own country are protected and preserved.  We want the Minister to use his good offices to do this for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> The Bacon Company of Ireland is a good company.  It is not a loss maker.  It has made money consistently during the years.  It made a profit of £750,000 in 1981 and it only slipped into the red in 1984. However, the management decided to do something about it and they have a reorganisation programme they want to implement.  The plant is on site and they want the workforce to be employed there.  They do not want the factory to close.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morley was quite right in what he said.  Let me put the matter beyond doubt.  The whole group will close and die if the flag leader in Claremorris is allowed to close.  We believe the company wants to get involved in the expenditure of more money to revitalise the business.  It has a very good record in industrial relations.  It was founded in 1930 and only once, in 1948, was there a closure of two months when unions were introduced.  The factory has an admirable record in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that a personality clash of some kind between management and unions has crept in.  That is unfortunate. Management and unions have a responsibility in the matter.  Neither side is entitled to do anything that will put in jeopardy the livelihood of so many breadwinners.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to take an exceptional step here.  We are asking him to use his good offices and the agencies available to him to avert this closure.  It is difficult to attract foreign investment to County Mayo because we are inaccessible in many ways.  We have suffered through the closure of Travenol and many other industries in the past few years.  There are 8,000 people unemployed in the county.  An indigenous industry based on raw materials available in the locality is vital to the local economy. Both sides have a heavy responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>A solution can be found but it is necessary for some person to step into the middle and bring the two sides together in an effort to work out a satisfactory solution.  The Minister, representing the <Col N="1527" /> people of Ireland in his office as Minister for Labour, is the person to do this job initially.  We are satisfied that if he takes this step there will be a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for raising this matter in such a constructive way. Their concern is shared by all the Deputies from Mayo, some of whom are present in this House.  The company concerned is producing added value to natural product and, thus, this dispute is all the more unwelcome because clearly it is damaging not just the workers and management but those who produce the raw material for the factory.</P>
      <P>Given the time available to me I will not go into the background to this dispute other than to say that the company has displayed in recent times with the union involved considerable skill in negotiating agreements relating to a package of redundancies that were agreed.  They were implemented in the three plants concerned, namely, at Claremorris, Letterkenny and Limerick.  For example, there have been 35 redundancies in Letterkenny, 22 in Limerick and 12 in Claremorris. I give those figures to show that the company and the union involved possess negotiating skills in that they have arrived at a settlement that was not the subject of a major dispute.</P>
      <P>The request of the Deputies in this debate that the Department of Labour should intervene is one I can respond to in the following way.  I and previous office holders have made this point before.  It is our responsibility to ensure that the machinery of industrial relations negotiation should operate to maximum efficiency. In this instance the major machinery is the Labour Court.  I say to the House that the Labour Court have become involved already in this dispute in a very responsible way, an indication of the active way the court operate.  The chief conciliation officer, Mr. Paddy Lynch, has had extensive discussions with both sides in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> Deputy Flynn spoke about some personality clash.  The future of this industry and the jobs of the 35 people who have been laid off temporarily as well as the remaining jobs are too important to allow any personality dispute on either side. There are Members in this House who would find it totally unacceptable that workers should be able to nominate which person in management should negotiate with them.  Equally, in a free and open democratic society workers have the right to decide whom they wish to negotiate on their behalf.  I presume that in selecting that person they do so on the basis that he or she is the best person capable of advancing and improving their interests.  Clearly all the Members who represent the area have a concern in the matter.  With Mr. Jerry Flynn of the Chamber of Commerce, they consider that it is in the best interests of all the workers in Mayo that the factory should not only survive but that it should thrive and develop.  I do not think that the best interests of all concerned should be at the mercy of a personality clash between any parties.</P>
    <P>While I understand the points made here and elsewhere, I am not prepared to dictate who should negotiate on behalf of any group of workers.  That will always be their free and democratic choice.  They must exercise that choice with full responsibility, having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morley asked what action I propose to take.  I give this undertaking to the House.  I will formally contact the Labour Court to ensure that all the machinery of that court is made fully available to help to settle the dispute.  I will bring to the attention of the Labour Court that this matter was raised on the Adjournment, that the elected Members for Mayo expressed considerable concern and asked me to convey that concern to the court with a view to finding a satisfactory solution as soon as possible.</P>

It provides access to European facilities and expertise and allows Irish scientists to participate in major experiments and programmes which it would not be possible otherwise to organise or fund.  It also allows Ireland the opportunity to influence the direction of EC policy towards marine science and ensure that EC initiatives are of benefit in an Irish context.</P>
      <P>Ireland has, for a number of years, urged the Commission to bring forward proposals for a full-scale comprehensive research action programme in the marine area.  This is listed for inclusion in the new Community framework programme for research covering the years 1987 to 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to our involvement in Community programmes we are developing bilateral co-operation wherever possible. We have an exchange scheme with France which provides our scientists with <Col N="1382" /> access to facilities and expertise in France which are not currently available in Ireland.  A co-operative programme in marine science and technology with the Federal Republic of Germany has been initiated and is in course of further elaboration.</P>
    <P>My Department support marine research through the National Board for Science and Technology which partially fund the Shellfish Research Laboratory in Carna, County Galway, and support R &amp; D in the higher education sector through their various grants schemes. The NBST, on my behalf, manage the State-owned research vessel the <i>Lough Beltra.</i></P>
    <P>Over the years a range of State bodies has become involved in various aspects of marine research.  In order to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these programmes a working group is being set up under my Department to make recommendations as to the most appropriate structures for the future development of marine science and technology in this country.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that in accordance with the White Paper published in July 1984, the IDA have now regionalised its small industries programme devolving responsibility for grant approvals to <Col N="1383" /> regional boards with local representation. The Midlands Board were established in June of this year.  The availability of the four small industry cluster units of 3,000 square feet each and the 23 acres of land in Edenderry should provide an attractive infrastructure to facilitate the establishment of small industries in the town.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 34 together.  I understand that the more recent increases in the price of bread were due in the main to increased costs which would have been allowable if price control criteria applied.  In August 1984 the National Prices Commission, at my request, examined the price increases implemented at that time and found that price increases since decontrol in August 1982 had been less than those justified by increased costs.  A major factor in this was the increased competition evident at all levels of the trade with low priced bread being widely available at retail level.  This level of competition is still evident and a survey by the Commission, undertaken since the latest increase, shows that in most major supermarkets and multiples own brand bread is available at between 39p and 47p per standard <Col N="1384" /> loaf while branded bread is being retailed between 55p and 63p.  In these circumstances and as the price increases in question seem to be justified on the basis of cost increases I do not propose to reintroduce price control at this stage. However bread prices at retail level will continue to be monitored by my Department.</P>

My primary (and statutory) concern in supervising insurance, however, relates to the solvency of insurers. I cannot compel an insurer to underwrite a particular risk or to underwrite it on particular terms.  This must be left to the insurers commercial judgment.  Nonetheless, within these limits, my Department will examine cases referred to them of difficulty in getting cover, to see what can be done.  In the final analysis, if a risk is uninsurable it is not within my powers to alter that fact.</P>

      <P>My Department have no statistics <Col N="1393" /> on the number of Irish citizens refused entry to the United States.  United States statistics on this are global, not broken down by nationality.  My Department would become aware only of a small proportion of cases, for example where the person asked for the Embassy or a consulate general to be notified, or where the person reported the event afterwards to us.</P>
      <P>In the last year 18 Irish citizens sought help from our Embassy or consulates general in the US to return home to Ireland. The normal procedure in such cases is to help the citizen to get funds from relatives or friends in Ireland.  Money would not normally be advanced to the citizen until an equivalent amount had been obtained by my Department from relatives or friends. In one of the cases that arose during the last year, which involved very serious illness, an advance of part of the cost of repatriation was, as an exception, made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ratification of the Council of Europe Agreement on <i>Au Pair</i> Placement would have to be preceded by signature. It should be realised that Ireland's signature of the agreement would not increase the protection of Irish <i>au pairs</i> abroad.  At the same time, the agreement is not based on reciprocity and therefore those states which are parties to it are bound to extend its protection to foreigners regardless of their nationality.  The Department concerned with the welfare of foreign <i>au pairs</i> in Ireland are satisfied that adequate control is exercised over the welfare of the foreign <i>au pair</i> in present circumstances and do not favour the further legislative and administrative machinery that would be necessary if the agreement were signed.  For these <Col N="1394" /> reasons it is not proposed to sign the agreement.</P>
      <P>Irish girls going abroad for <i>au pair</i> placement who consult my Department are advised to insist on a written agreement with their host families before they leave this country.  While they are abroad they have of course available to them the protection and care of the local Irish diplomatic mission.  Similarly foreign <i>au pair</i> girls coming to this country have the protection of their own diplomatic missions resident here should the occasion arise.</P>

      <P>The measures announced by the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann on 23 October 1985 which are likely to generate employment and for which I have responsibility relate to the Custom House docks site, certain other inner city areas, housing grants and community and leisure facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Custom House docks site will be <Col N="1398" /> acquired for a major redevelopment programme and a special development authority will be established to direct and control the development of the site. Leglislative proposals to provide for the establishment of the authority and the acquisition of the site are being prepared as a matter of urgency.  A wide range of incentives to stimulate construction activity and to promote the development of the site will be made available.  These will include: 100 per cent capital allowances on non-industrial buildings; section 23 type relief on new dwellings; double rent allowance offset against tax for traders; full rates relief for ten years.</P>
    <P>Additional programmes of inner city reconstruction and development are being instituted in designated areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The precise areas for designation will be announced following the completion of consultations which are already taking place with the local authorities involved.  A range of incentives will be made available in respect of designated areas including: capital allowances for commercial development; a new 5 per cent tax allowance on the purchase price of private dwellings which will apply annually for ten years; double rent allowance offset against tax; full rates relief for ten years.</P>
    <P>A new scheme of house improvement grants is being introduced to provide substantial grants to enable householders to carry out improvements to their homes. The new scheme provides for a special grant of up to £5,000 for the repair and reconstruction of older houses and in relation to dwellings generally, provides for a range of generous grants for various categories of repair and extension etc. works.  These grants will be available for construction work involving the employment of legitimate building contractors. Full details of the scheme are set out in Memorandum H.A.2 and the addendum thereto issued by my Department.  A copy of the memorandum and addendum has been sent to all Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>In addition a substantial programme for the provision of improved community and leisure facilities and other general <Col N="1399" /> amenities is being introduced to assist areas of greatest social need.  A sum of £5 million is being allocated for this purpose. It is proposed that the scheme will operate to support the carrying out of environmental and other improvements in local authority housing areas, as envisaged in paragraph 5.92 of the national plan, as well as to provide community and leisure facilities in these and other areas.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the carrying out of the various measures that I have outlined will have substantial effects on employment and output in the building sector and in other sectors of activity associated with the industry.</P>

      <P>A scheme for the provision of suitable landing and ancillary facilities at Keave was discussed by officials of my Department with the local fishermen at a meeting earlier this year. An engineering report and cost estimate in respect of the scheme has now been received from the Office of Public Works and at present my Department are carrying out a feasibility and economic appraisal of it.  Pending the completion of that appraisal I cannot say what work will be justified or when such work is likely to commence.</P>

The amount of PAYE included in the figure for income tax above is provisionally estimated at £1,530 million.  The PAYE receipts figure covers more than income tax on wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to increase the turnover threshold for VAT registration in respect of taxable services to the same level as that which pertains to the supply of taxable goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Registration limits are set so as to remove small businesses from the scope of VAT while having regard to the need to secure VAT revenue and minimise competitive distortions between registered and unregistered traders.  A lower threshold for taxable services as opposed to taxable goods generally is justified on <Col N="1411" /> the grounds that greater scope for tax-based distortions of competition between registered and unregistered traders arises at a lower level of turnover in the case of services.  I am satisfied that the respective turnover thresholds of £12,000 per annum for taxable services and £25,000 per annum for taxable goods generally, strike a fair balance having regard to all of these considerations.  I would also point out that it was in response to complaints from traders in the services sector that, <i>inter alia,</i> they were being placed at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their unregistered counterparts, that the previous annual turnover threshold for VAT registration for services of £15,000 was reduced to the present level of £12,000, by virtue of the Finance Act, 1983.</P>

    <P>These figures are not necessarily comparable since the basis of compiling waiting lists may vary between health boards.</P>
    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(a)  In Dublin and Kildare no waiting lists are kept for children.  All children are given appointments but they may have to wait between two and nine months for treatment depending on which health board clinic they attend.</P>
    <P>(b)  In the Midland Health Board children's dental services are organised on a rotational basis between the schools and no waiting lists of individuals awaiting treatment are maintained.</P>
    <P>(c)  No accurate figures are available at present for children awaiting dental treatment in the South-Eastern Health Board due to variations in practice in the compilation of waiting lists between the different community care areas.</P>
    <P>(d)  The figure relates to adults awaiting treatment through the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme only.</P>
    <P>(e)  The North-Eastern Health Board has recently changed its system of waiting lists in some of its community care areas and hence comparison with previous figures is not valid.</P>

      <P>A person who has exhausted entitlement to unemployment benefit cannot requalify for benefit until he has a further 13 weeks of employment which is insurable at a contribution class which provides cover against unemployment. Any weeks of insurable employment after 156 days of benefit have been drawn are counted for this purpose.  The person concerned exhausted his entitlement to 390 days unemployment benefit on 10 December 1984.  He produced a form P45 which showed that he had been employed on a part time basis after the exhaustion of 156 days of unemployment.  Extensive inquiries had to be made to establish that the employment was insurable at the appropriate contribution rate for the purpose of requalifying for unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person who is a landholder but does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 contributions paid in a three year period is not entitled to unemployment benefit if the income from the holding exceeds £2 daily.  In the course of inquiries it emerged that the person concerned is a beneficial occupier of land and as he did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 contributions paid in a three year period, the income from his holding was investigated and it <Col N="1415" /> exceeded £2 daily.  Accordingly, his claim to unemployment benefit was disallowed and he has been notified of the decision. He was advised of his right to apply for a qualification certificate but has not done so.</P>

      <P>Following a review of the old age pension entitlements of the person concerned it was discovered that she had means from capital which had not been previously disclosed.  She was overpaid £2,875 in the period from 30 September 1978 to 2 May 1985.  The latest assessment of her means, consisting of the weekly value of capital and a one-third intestacy share in a holding entitles her to pension at the weekly rate of £28.  The amount overpaid is being recovered by withholding arrears of £755 for the period 3 May 1985 to 7 November 1985 and by withholding £6 from her current pension entitlement, and a pension of £22 is accordingly being paid to her.  The appropriate pension book payable from 8 November 1985 issued on 5 November 1985.  The delay in finalising her current entitlement was due, mainly, to difficulty in establishing her means since 1978.</P>

When these inquiries are completed his case will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination of his means.  It is a matter for the appeals officer whether he grants an oral hearing or not as regulations provide that, if he is of the opinion that the case is of such a nature that it can be determined without a hearing, he may determine it summarily.

      <P>The person concerned claimed a retirement pension on 1 April 1985. One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance under the Acts, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The person concerned does not satisfy this condition as he has no record of insurable employment in Ireland since the beginning of the 1953 contribution year.  Neither did he qualify for old age contributory pension on reaching age 66 on 21 June 1985.  A yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person has been employed in another EC country his insurance in that country may be combined with his Irish record to enable him to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension calculated on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in <Col N="1423" /> proportion to the combined total in the relevant period.  Since the person concerned has no record of Irish insurance in the relevant period he is not entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> pension from the Department. He is in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>
    <P>There is no record of receipt of a claim for a non-contributory old age pension from him.  If he wishes to claim such a pension he should submit a completed claim form as soon as possible.  A claim form can be obtained at any post office.</P>

Inquiries have not yet been completed and when they are his case will be referred to a deciding officer for assessment of his means and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed accordingly.  In the meantime, as it has now come to light that the person concerned is the holder of a qualification certificate issued last year, arrangements have been made to put his claim into payment this week on the basis of the existing qualification certificate.</P>
      <P>He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £9.85, being the appropriate rate in his case of £79.50 less means of £69.65.  A voucher for the arrears due from 27 August will be posted to him this week and weekly payments will continue as they become due.</P>

Sessional supervisors, therefore, are required only for a maximum of about 16 hours any week.  Some projects are only active on Saturdays and supervisors on such projects might be required only for about eight hours per week.
