    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been promised by the Government on a number of occasions. The most recent occasion was by the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, in Sligo two weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear about this.  Is the Deputy referring to the Bill dealing with housing for the homeless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the commitment made by the Government on a number of occasions to take power from elected county councillors and to transfer it to non-elected county managers.  The power I am referring to is in regard to the provision of facilities for the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  Certainly the possibility of doing that has been raised if county councillors did not do their duties.  There is not promised legislation on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I wish to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the incursion of the British Army at Courtbane last Friday, where the British Army polluted the water supply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been promised by the Tánaiste.  When a statement is made by a person who is second in charge of the Government, surely I am entitled to ask a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Perhaps the Deputy will cast his memory back to shortly after the first assembly of this Dáil.  At that time the Chair made clear what was in order on the Order of Business and what was not in order.  If the Deputy has forgotten that, I would refer him to the Official Report at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the matter I am speaking about requires legislation? If the Tánaiste speaks to the Press and makes a commitment about issuing a statement today or this week, surely I am entitled to ask a question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  In my opinion that is an improper decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of good order, will the Taoiseach indicate to the House a full, complete and properly costed list of Government and/or Fine Gael or Labour Party commitments in regard to the local elections, whether it is a tunnel in Cork, gas in Limerick or jobs elsewhere.  This House and the public are entitled to have a comprehensive statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish taxpayer is at least entitled to that, a comprehensive, properly costed list of commitments from <Col N="289" /> a Government that purports to be responsible and is entirely irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ruling the Deputy out of order.  I am asking Deputy Lenihan to resume his seat.  Deputy Lenihan must resume his seat.  I am calling item No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, the Government's policy on local government was published last week and is available to all Members of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in order for the Taoiseach to make a statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that the Chair is not getting the co-operation from the House that he should get.  When Deputy Lenihan gets up and raises a matter which I have told him on several occasions is not in order &mdash; a matter of a highly controversial nature &mdash; and shouts his way through the Chair it is difficult to stop somebody else from getting up to deny that.  Of course.  Deputy Haughey then is asking me to enforce unfair play&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is not reasonable.  I am asking Deputy Haughey to take a different view on it. When the Chair rules something out of order the Chair should be obeyed.  It is manifestly unjust if I am to allow somebody to make a fairly long controversial case and then not allow that to be answered.  On the other hand, if I do allow an answer I am inviting chaos.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you have brought me into this matter, if I may say, in a very partial way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="290" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>You came into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I want to reject most of what you said.  I want also to point out to you that for many a day, as Taoiseach, I sat over there where Deputy FitzGerald is sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I must point out to you that I consistently obeyed order and did not answer or intervene on questions and matters raised on the Order of Business which you had ruled out of order.  That has been a well established precedent by previous Taoisigh and Ministers in this House and I suggest to you, Sir, that it should be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The only change is that Deputy Haughey invited me, the Chair, to put an end to wrangling with the Chair.  I am doing my best to put an end to wrangling with the Chair and I am not getting the co-operation that I should be getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair can only rule with the co-operation of the House.  The Chair must listen for some time until he knows what is being raised. But when Deputy Lenihan got up I tried my best to get him to sit down but he decided he would not sit down&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, I submit that it is necessary to reconsider this matter.  If the Chair is unable, despite all his efforts, to prevent a Deputy continuing to make allegations that are irrelevant and that <Col N="291" /> are ruled out of order then some consideration has to be given to giving a right of reply.  I have submitted this before.  I would like you to give further consideration to that.  Alternatively, if any Deputy continues to speak after the Chair has asked him to cease he would have to leave the House automatically, one or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the extension of voting rights at Dáil elections to persons other than Irish citizens, who are normally resident here.  Under existing law, the right to vote at Dáil elections is confined to Irish citizens resident in this country.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which was passed by both Houses, proposed to extend voting rights at Dáil and presidential elections and at referenda to British citizens resident here.  That Bill, which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution, was ruled to be repugnant to the Constitution.  Following that ruling, the Government decided to bring forward a Bill to amend the Constitution to enable the right to vote to be determined by legislation.</P>
      <P>The Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1984, which was passed by both Houses in April last year, was referred to the people for decision by way of referendum in June 1984.  That Bill, which was approved at the referendum, had the effect of allowing the Oireachtas to extend to non-citizens resident in the State, the right to vote at Dáil elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the Bill now before the House will be to provide for the extension of voting rights at Dáil elections, on a reciprocal basis, to citizens of EC member states resident here.  The United Kingdom already allows Irish citizens <Col N="294" /> resident there to vote in parliamentary elections and, in recognition of this, the Bill confers directly on British citizens resident here the right to vote at Dáil elections.  At present, no other member state gives voting rights at parliamentary elections to Irish citizens.  But the Bill makes provision for reciprocating the granting of such a right, should it occur, by ministerial order, subject of course to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The requirements as regards entitlement to the Dáil vote for Irish citizens will of course apply in relation to non-citizens. A minimum age of 18 years will apply; there can be no discrimination on the grounds of sex; the person concerned must be free from legal disqualifications in relation to voting and he must be ordinarily resident in the State.  The Bill also makes provision for specifying criteria to determine whether persons resident here are nationals of other member states for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from section 2, which is the section providing for the extension of the franchise, the rest of the Bill is taken up with consequential technical changes. These arise mainly from the fact that the extension of voting rights relates only to Dáil elections, and voting rights at presidential elections and referenda will still be confined to Irish citizens.  This means that a new category of elector must be defined.  The Bill proposes a category of &ldquo;presidential elector&rdquo; which will be confined to Irish citizens; only persons in this category will be allowed to vote at presidential elections and referenda.</P>
    <P>During the debates on the 1983 Bill and on the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1984, many Deputies expressed the view that any extension of voting rights should not be confined to nationals of one particular country and that there should be provision for the granting of voting rights to nationals of other member states of the EC resident here.  I am sure those Deputies will now welcome the wider provisions of this Bill enabling this to be done on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>This country is unique in that we are <Col N="295" /> the only member state of the EC which allows nationals from all other member states the right to vote at both European and local elections without reciprocation. The provisions of this Bill can be seen as a further development of this country's open approach to the granting of the franchise to a wide category of foreigners living here.  I hope it will also be seen as an important first step towards mutual extension of voting rights at parliamentary elections among EC member states.</P>
    <P>The extension of voting rights at Dáil elections to British citizens is a reflection of the special relationship which exists between the two countries, as well as redressing an imbalance which has existed for many years with so many Irish citizens voting at parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom.  I hope the Bill will contribute to the relationship and to understanding between both countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party welcome this Bill.  The gesture of extending voting rights in general elections to British citizens was first proposed by the Fianna Fáil Party who when in office initiated a review of existing legislation and constitutional provisions to determine how this might be done.  At the summit meeting with the British Prime Minister in 1980 the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party proposed to reciprocate the voting rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in British parliamentary elections by the extension of the same rights to British citizens living here.  When this Government brought forward legislation to give effect to that promise we expressed serious and substantial doubts as to the validity of the Bill which the Government brought before the House &mdash; the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983 &mdash; and recommended that the President might exercise his powers under Article 26 to have the Bill referred to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality. The courts ruled against that Bill and we subsequently had a Referendum Bill brought forward.  That referendum was held and an overwhelming majority of <Col N="296" /> the people in the 26 counties voted to give the vote in Irish general elections to British citizens living here.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, several points were raised by me and other Fianna Fáil speakers.  I am pleased that nearly all of the arguments we brought forward have been adopted by the Government in this Bill and in the actions which they have taken since.  We were concerned at the proposal to extend the voting rights not just to general elections but to presidential elections and for referenda being held here.  Now the right to vote in a presidential election or in a referendum is being confined to Irish citizens.  The right to vote in general elections is what Fianna Fáil promised and wanted to see implemented.  I gave the reasons why it would not be appropriate to extend the voting to those other areas when the 1983 Bill was being discussed. This is the third occasion since then that we have had an opportunity to discuss the extension of voting rights in general elections to British citizens living here so it is not necessary to delay the House very long.  Most of our thoughts on the matter are in the Official Report.  We are pleased with the contents of the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point which the Government do not seem to be able to determine accurately, that is the number of British citizens living here who will benefit from this new power which this Parliament is unanimously agreeing to give them. During the course of the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, the Minister said that there was an estimated 10,000 such voters.  On this occasion in the explanatory memorandum the Government have estimated that there are 12,000 such voters.  In reply to a parliamentary question, which I put down on 21 May this year, I was told that there were 56,800 UK nationals usually resident in the State.  That figure is a global figure including persons under 18 who would not have a vote.  One is not sure how many British citizens will qualify and there is not a reliable source for the statistics given by the Government <Col N="297" /> other than a guess that it is in the region of 12,000 to 20,000 voters.  We hope that when these new voters exercise their franchise here they will recognise that the party who first proposed extending that vote to them will appreciate their electoral support.</P>
    <P>In relation to this whole question of voting rights between Irish and English citizens a unique situation exists in that in Northern Ireland Stormont Parliament or Assembly elections Irish citizens living in the Six Counties do not have the right to vote.  In view of the generous measure this House is proposing this morning will the Minister say if any approach has been made to the British authorities requesting an extension of voting rights to Irish citizens living in the Six Counties in Assembly elections or Stormont elections. That seems to be the only outstanding sore point in electoral relations between both countries.  It would have been appropriate to raise this with the British authorities in the course of the various discussions which we are assured are taking place in seeking to find ground for better relations and progress in our long standing dispute over the occupation and division of part of our island.  Surely the British could reciprocate to that extent in removing that anomaly and extending the vote to our citizens in the Six Counties in their Assembly elections. One must recall without rancour or bitterness that the extension of the voting rights to Irish citizens living in Britain was not a deliberate decision by the British people.  A referendum was not held to extend that right nor was any special legislation passed in the Houses of Parliament. The right was there for historical reasons, because of a reluctance on the part of the British to introduce a Bill after the 1949 Act here setting up the Irish Republic, declaring all Irish people in England to be aliens.  It would have been impractical for them to do so and would have had serious political repercussions for Britain had they sought to deprive all Irish citizens there of the vote which they had for other historical reasons.  This is a very magnanimous gesture on the part of this Parliament.  I hope the British <Col N="298" /> authorities will recognise it as such and that they too will make a move to extend voting rights to our citizens in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill. As Deputy Molloy has said, this matter has been debated here on several occasions already and it is on record.  It is pleasant to come into the House and welcome this Bill that we have all anticipated in a referendum.  For Irish people who for some part of their working lives have lived in Britain and have had the advantage and privilege &mdash; the vote there was a privilege for them in the absence of a reciprocal arrangement here &mdash; I can say as one of those people who was integrated into the political system in Britain and worked and had a vote within it when I lived there, that it is all the more welcome that we are now reciprocating. My constituency of Dún Laoghaire has a large number of residents from Britain particularly but also from other EC countries, who have lived there for 20 or 25 years, have paid their taxes and taken a keen interest in the politics of this country.  They believe that their vote is precious &mdash; as it is &mdash; and their future depends upon the politics and policies of this country and not of Britain. They have had a sense of grievance that Irish people living in Britain had this right to vote which was almost automatic while they have been denied it here for so long.  They are not guilty of chauvinism. Their concern and their interests arise from their feeling of belonging in this country, of having set down their roots here and regarding Ireland as the country where they want to live.  It is embarrassing for us when we canvass at elections that again and again we have had to tell them that the vote has been promised to them, we had a referendum and we hope that the vote will be extended to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are showing openness and a sense of European community here when we use this Bill to extend the right to vote here to nationals from other member states of the EC when those member <Col N="299" /> states reciprocate by allowing Irish citizens living in their countries to vote there. We have anticipated the extension of voting rights to citizens of member states living here.  When we consider the ideals &mdash; which unfortunately are not always attained &mdash; and objectives of the Treaty of Rome we should see Europe as a family with European Community meaning community in the sense of a people joined together across barriers and borders. This measure is a real move towards crossing those barriers and borders and making all of us who work and live in other member states feel that we are of the same European family.  It is appropriate that we in Ireland are doing this because from the time we voted to enter the EC we have shown a sense of unity with Europe and a sense of community sometimes ahead of other members states.  I hope that in the not too distant future other member states will look at this area and extend voting rights.</P>
    <P>This measure is apposite particularly when we consider the kind of movement that can be anticipated particularly by our young voters in the years ahead.  We have a highly educated electorate and our students have been introduced, not before time, to foreign languages and are learning to overcome psychological and language barriers and to operate freely in the EC.  I foresee the day when our young people will move easily in the EC and perhaps spend part of their lives in other member states gaining experience and making the contribution there and to the Commission.  It will be of importance to those people to have a vote in the areas in which they will be living and where they will be at the receiving end of the policies and politics of those countries.</P>
    <P>The local elections to be held on 20 June remind us again of our right to have the vote and the responsibility attached to it.  I would like women particularly to be aware of how precious that vote is and how long and hard women had to fight to get that basic right.  It is a matter of sadness to all of us in this House when we canvass and find that people through lack of interest or of education in politics <Col N="300" /> in their school years feel that a way to mark their displeasure is not to bother to come out to vote.  Probably even more depressing in a democracy is that some people do not really care, they feel that it is no business of theirs to come out and vote.  I think that politicians on all sides of the House would recommend that, regardless of whom people are voting for, they should see their vote as one of the most powerful, democratic and desirable rights that they have.  Sometimes when I canvass on the doorsteps I am tempted to say to people who tell me that they will not bother to come out to vote that if tomorrow this House decided to legislate to take the vote away from either the whole populace or part of it, for any reason, there would be an uprising, a revolution of people demanding that their most basic right to vote would not be taken from them, yet, unfortunately, that realisation, enthusiasm, sense of interest is not evident among some of the electorate. I hope that the short debate we are having this morning will raise an awareness once again of the importance of people coming out to vote in the local elections on 20 June next as that election will affect them at local level and within their communities.</P>
    <P>Let me mention finally two groups of our Irish citizenry to whom I would like to think voting rights will be extended in the future.  For instance, some citizens of our country for whatever reason work abroad on occasions.  They would like to be able to vote, but for business reasons or work reasons they cannot do so.  That section of the electorate very much resent the fact that they cannot vote because they are not in the country.  When it can be shown that these people will be physically absent, they should be able to register their vote within a certain period before they go away, or by post.</P>
    <P>There is another group of people with a huge sense of commitment to Ireland, the families of the diplomatic corps.  They represent us at all levels in other countries and they do so with a tremendous sense of pride.  Literally they are our ambassadors abroad.  They have a tremendous interest in what is happening in Ireland.  They <Col N="301" /> would like to be able to vote in elections here.  Nothing is impossible.  We should be able to allow them to register their votes and have them brought back here under proper supervision.</P>
    <P>We want the vote to be used by as many people as possible.  In this Bill we are extending voting rights to British citizens living in Ireland and citizens of EC member states when they reciprocate. The openness shown in this Bill is an indication of the importance we place on the right to vote.  I ask the Minister to consider the two categories I mentioned and see whether the same openness shown in this Bill could give them the right to vote in the near future.  When we are talking about people coming out to vote we are talking about people feeling a sense of identity and an interest in the country and its politicians.  There is also a sense of family within the nation and within the greater European nation.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will be extended further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is important in symbolic terms and also in reality.  It calls for very short contributions because it is not controversial.  It is not divisive.  It will be greatly appreciated by those upon whom it will confer one of the great privileges of a parliamentary democracy, that is, the right to vote fearlessly and freely and exercise the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why this Bill is being welcomed on all sides of the House.  The first is that it fulfils a promise.  It may have taken five years to fulfil that promise but, when the Bill goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, it will become a reality.  This Bill is part of what might have been a major breakthrough in Anglo-Irish relations at the Dublin Summit in 1980.  For a variety of reasons the expectation which was inherent in that summit was not realised. That should not deter us or make us see the promise made about votes for British nationals living in Ireland in an unfavourable light.  The proposal has great merit and it would be churlish in the extreme for us to reject what was promised then because parts of the package have not <Col N="302" /> worked out.  Nobody in the House would want that to be the case.  This all-party agreement is welcome.</P>
    <P>The second reason why this Bill is welcome is that it contains a measure of reciprocity.  Irish people living in Britain have long had the right to vote in Great Britain.  I exercised that right in local elections in Britain on a number of occasions. Had there been a general election while I was living there I would have used my vote to have my say in who would represent the constituency in which I lived.</P>
    <P>Having the right to vote means that Irish people who have made Britain their home permanently or on a long term basis can become fully involved in the political life of their adopted country, whether it be in local politics or in national politics.  We have tended to underestimate the extent to which the use of the vote has helped to create a strong and increasingly powerful Irish lobby in British politics.  This is particularly evident in the Labour Party.  People who came over here on deputations tried fairly consistently to understand the nature of the Northern Ireland problem.  They have also tried to understand the problems which affect the two Governments whether they be in terms of the welfare of emigrants or in terms of trade.  The presence of a strong, sympathetic Irish lobby in British politics is beneficial to us.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be more frustrating for a person than to become involved in politics and not have the right to vote.  The right to vote has had an integrating effect on the Irish community in Britain while, at the same time, allowing them to maintain their sense of being Irish and their links with their home country.  The right to vote for those who made Britain their home gave them an opportunity to belong and to be part of their new country.  That opportunity has not been available to British citizens living in this country.  British people living here are for the most part model citizens.  They have a very high civic sense.  They pay their taxes. They follow Irish politics with great interest and in a very constructive way.  They <Col N="303" /> want to see good relations between our two countries and they want to see progress made towards a resolution of the outstanding problems between our two countries.  Up to now they have felt excluded.</P>
    <P>At the last count 575 British people living permanently in my constituency were excluded from voting.  From talking to these people, meeting them on the doorsteps and at social functions I know they feel excluded.  They cannot participate fully in a country which they want to serve.  They feel a great sense of gratitude because of the fact that this Bill is now a reality.  We all take for granted the right to vote.  Perhaps in the coming local elections many people may feel the right to vote which was fought for for so long and which is one of the hallmarks of a free people is not worth exercising.  Like everybody else I hope that in the local elections people will come out, no matter whom they will vote for, to ensure that this right does not go by default.</P>
    <P>I should like this Bill to go a little bit further.  The constitutional change last year makes it possible for the Bill to be extended.  At a time when we should be discussing European union and our own future in Europe, this Bill is particularly appropriate.  I would like to see voting in national elections extended to nationals of European Community countries living here.  Obviously that can only happen if those countries are prepared to grant the same right to Irish people living in their countries.  The figures revealed in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach of EC nationals living in Ireland are not very great and are not concentrated in any one area where they could distort the election results.  I am glad to see the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in the House.  He had a great deal of work to do during our presidency and he can take up the point I am making.  I hope in the discussions with our European neighbours that the question of extension of voting rights on a reciprocal basis can be looked at in a serious way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> I can see one problem straightaway. France extends voting rights to its nationals living in Ireland.  There is a fairly complicated system in relation to the French national elections whereby French nationals can vote by post or at their embassy.  The question of whether people will have the right to vote in the elections of two countries will arise.  This matter will have to be sorted out between the two Governments.  I am sure we all agree it would not be proper that a person should have the right to vote in two national elections.  People in that situation could opt for one or the other.  I urge the Minister to look at this particular aspect.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of EC nationals living in Ireland do so from choice.  They have come here to work, they bring their own skills with them to contribute to the development of this country or they have chosen our way of life.  The Minister's own constituency is an example of this. They perhaps feel in these areas that there is a saner, more civilised, calmer way of life.  They find there something which they believe the rest of Europe has lost and they have come here to make this country their home.  I believe they will greatly appreciate the privilege of voting in our elections.  If the problem could be ironed out there would be a great welcome for the extension of this right.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going through the Dáil with all-party agreement at a very crucial stage of Anglo-Irish relations.  The discussions are at a very delicate and difficult stage and it appears that agreement has been reached on many issues but there are still some outstanding issues.  It is no harm that this measure goes through here today and through the Seanad later this week or next week with the full backing of all the parties in the House as an earnest of our goodwill, a desire of all parties in the House to live in terms of friendship and equality with our British neighbours and also to highlight one of the element of the Forum report, that is the ability of two seperate identities to coexist side by side, fully expressed and in full harmony. This Bill conferring the right to vote in <Col N="305" /> our elections will be greatly appreciated by the many British people who live here and who have contributed so much to our development over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On 19 October 1983, when we were discussing the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, I stated:</P>
      <P>I am delighted to extend the franchise to British residents, but I appeal to the Minister to go further.  Let us lead the way in Europe by extending the franchise to all our European colleagues resident in Ireland.  There is little we can lead in when it comes to European matters.  We always appear to have the hand out.  The reasons for that are obvious.  I do not need to document them.  If we give our jealously guarded franchise to anyone let us give it to all our European brothers and sisters who are residents in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I made the point about how much they were contributing to our economy, that they were, as Deputy Manning has just said, in Ireland by choice, that many of them were married to Irish men and women and were rearing Irish children. I felt they were entitled to a say in our affairs provided they were well and truly rooted here and making Ireland their home for the foreseeable future.  When I made that plea, along with many other Deputies from both sides of the House, it was pointed out that doing it on such a wide base would not have the same political advantage as just extending it on a reciprocal basis to British people living in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that we are here this morning doing what many of us asked to have done in October 1983 but I am rather saddened that we had to have our hands forced to do what most of us would like to have done at that time.  However, having said that by way of an I told you so, I welcome the Bill before us this morning. My only reservation is that we are insisting on reciprocity in relation to our other European partners in extending our franchise to them.  I feel very strongly that we could lead the way in Europe in this regard.  I also feel very strongly that our <Col N="306" /> example, even as we have it in the Bill this morning, will lead to Irish people resident abroad being extended the franchise in the various countries they are living in by choice.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to feel magnanimous about a Bill on which many of us felt let down a couple of years ago when we were discussing the previous Bill.  There is a missed opportunity here to which I have just referred.  I know there will be great delight among non-nationals resident in Ireland in what we are doing here this morning.  I will make a final appeal on Committee Stage that we consider extending the vote to those who do not give it to us in other European countries. It is a little dog in the manger of us as a nation to insist that reciprocity must be the order of the day in relation to the question before us.  I urge the Minister to have a final look at the matter, to make the decision and not have his hand forced by any constitutional issue, by the Supreme Court or otherwise.  I urge him to listen to what back benchers on all sides of the House had a strong gut feeling for nearly two years ago.  Perhaps we could reconsider our demand that what we are granting this morning can only be on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this issue in October 1983 I, like many others in the House, including Deputy Molloy, voiced our concern about the constitutional aspect of what we were then discussing.  We were subsequently proved right on that issue also.  I hope that those of us who have not too bad a track record on this particular issue will be listened to again. I hope that Committee Stage will allow the final step to be taken on what I consider would be a superb contribution to those concerned in this country.  We sometimes forget how much we own to non-nationals who have come here by choice.  These are people who have chosen Ireland to live in, who were not born and reared in the country and who have to accept a <i>de facto</i> situation.  Those people can look at our good points and our bad points and make a conscious decision to come to Ireland, live here, pay taxes and be part of our community.  I consider they are <Col N="307" /> entitled to vote in our elections.  It is back to the old basic premise of no taxation without representation.  We had something to say about that 18 months ago when we were discussing the Bill before us.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputy Manning in appealing to everyone to exercise their franchise once that franchise has been gained.  History has documented very carefully the difficulty experienced by various groups in various communities who were denied the franchise. These included women, coloured people and other groups.  When one has regard to the record and realises how different people had to fight for the franchise, including people in our own country, it seems a certain tragedy that perhaps up to 50 per cent of the electorate do not bother to exercise their franchise. I appeal for a big turnout for the local elections.  We are spending time here today debating the gift of franchise to various sections in the community but there will be thousands who will not bother to exercise their vote on June 20 though they may have had the vote for many years and merely take it for granted.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with the country's open approach now to the granting of franchise to wider categories.  It is important for British people living here that the franchise is being extended to them.  Irish citizens in Britain have always been allowed vote at elections.  This is a reflection of the special relationship between ourselves and Britain, a relationship that has been difficult at times but which has always been special.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a final appeal to the Minister <Col N="308" /> to consider going all the way and extending the franchise in respect of Dáil elections to all European citizens resident here without demanding reciprocity.  Perhaps we should have a definition of residency, too.  We are assuming that residency means that a person has been in the country long enough to be placed on the register of electors.  Can we make that assumption?  Perhaps the Minister would let us know.  I am very pleased that we have arrived at the stage where we can discuss such an important Bill as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  With my colleagues, I welcome the legislation and particularly I welcome the changes in this Bill compared with the previous one.  As Deputy Doyle pointed out, a perusal of the record of the House in respect of the previous Bill will show that myself and many other backbench Fine Gael Deputies made the point specifically that the 1983 Bill should not have proposed simply to provide extending the franchise to British citizens but as a minimum should have proposed extending the franchise to other European nationals particularly in the context of the EC.  I welcome the fact that that has been done here and I shall not be ungenerous by criticising the Minister.  It is an indication of the willingness of the Government to take into account the views being expressed by Government backbenchers and, in fairness, by Members of the Opposition also that we now have a different type of Bill before the House.  The Supreme Court decision which found the original Bill to be unconstitutional did not require the Government to extend the franchise to other EC nationals.  The constitutional amendment that had to be made was specifically to empower the State to extend the franchise to persons other than citizens of this State.  It is within the power of the State to extend the franchise purely to British or French nationals, for example.  I welcome the principle behind the Bill which provides for a general European dimension, a dimension that was not included in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in dealing with that dimension it is worth pointing to one or two <Col N="309" /> anomalies that arise.  I agree initially with the views expressed by Deputy Doyle but I do not have the theological belief that we should endear ourselves to the concept of reciprocity.  If we take the very basic principle that other Deputies have referred to &mdash; no taxation without representation &mdash; the position is that to be taxed under our taxation code, one must establish residence in Ireland.  I am not suggesting that someone who has resided here for one or two years should have the franchise extended to him but whereas the principle of reciprocity has merit in the context of trying to encourage other European countries to provide rights to Irish nationals residing in those countries, it does not have any great relevance to the position of foreign nationals living in Ireland.  As other Deputies have suggested, the Bill could be improved by providing also that in the context of any other country, and not just a European country, where there are reciprocal arrangements for Irish nationals we would extend the franchise to people from those other countries who are resident here.</P>
    <P>We could provide that the national of any country European or otherwise, who has resided here for a continous period of 10 years would automatically be extended the franchise.  Because of the tax position it would be simple to establish the genuineness or otherwise of a claim to residency qualification.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider this point between now and Committee Stage.  If French or Italian nationals have lived and worked here and have paid their taxes for 15 or 20 years, they should qualify on that basis alone for the franchise. They are working within the country. They are bound by the constraints of our legislation and they are contributing to our economy.  Such people should not be deprived of the franchise solely because the Governments of their own countries are not prepared to extend the franchise to Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>Regarding the electoral qualification there are anomalies in the legislation. The Bill refers to extending the vote to nationals of other EC countries but there are countries which would be regarded <Col N="310" /> as European but which are not formally members of the EC.  One thinks of Sweden, for example.  One must ask whether we should exclude nationals of other European countries from voting here simply on the basis that their country is not a member of the European Community. Even if Swedish law extended the franchise to Irish nationals living in Sweden, this legislation would not entitle us to provide for reciprocal arrangements in respect of Swedish nationals resident here.  Therefore, while I very much welcome the European dimension, the legislation would seem to be unnecessarily confined to the EC.  If we are to provide for a principle of reciprocation in terms of the franchise, should we not apply that principle to any State?  There is no reason why the rule should apply solely to member states of the Community.  There is the point also that those member states can change, that the Community can either expand or reduce.  Recently, for example, Greece acceded to the Community and Spain and Portugal are about to become members but not so long ago Greenland left the Community.  In theory then, we could have a situation where if Greenland had extended the franchise two or three years ago to Irish nationals living there we would have extended reciprocal rights to persons of Greenland origin residing here but under this legislation we would have to deprive any such person of the vote.  That may sound extreme but it is an example of what could happen.  Likewise, if we extended the vote to the Dutch or Greek nationals and then if at some future date Holland or Greece decide to leave the EC, we would be depriving someone of the franchise as a result of the actions of a foreign, country of which they were a national but over which they had no control.  A number of anomalies could arise under this legislation.  If we are adopting the principle of reciprocity we should do so on a worldwide basis and not confine it to member states of the EC.</P>
    <P>There are many people of foreign nationality living in Ireland who have made the same contribution in this country but who under this legislation will be <Col N="311" /> treated differently.  For example it seems anomalous that we can extend the vote under this legislation to Italian or German nationals but not to American nationals who are permanently residing here.  An American national working and paying taxes here for 15 years will not have the facility of a vote extended to him even though under American electoral law Irish nationals would have a vote.</P>
    <P>This legislation could be improved.  We should have a general principle of extending the franchise on the basis of reciprocity which would not be confined to member states of the EC.  We should extend the vote to those who, be they nationals of the EC or another state, have worked and lived here for ten years or more and who paid taxes here.  It would be a fundamental democratic right for them to have the franchise extended to them and would comply with the principle of no taxation without representation. I urge that we do that.  It would not undermine our democratic institutions but would rather enhance them and our reputation as being a country totally committed to parliamentary representation and election and as a country committed to extending to all those who live here on a permanent basis the right to vote in general elections.</P>
    <P>The legislation in 1983 was welcome in that it was intended to extend the franchise to British nationals living in Ireland particularly in the light of the fact that, albeit for historical reasons, Irish nationals residing in Britain have always had the right to vote in British general elections. We are now changing our law in this area and extending the vote to British nationals.  By so doing we are extending it to the largest number of foreign nationals who are permanently resident here and who have contributed by way of taxation and job creation.  It should be recognised that we are not doing it simply on the basis of reciprocity but should be seen as being symbolic of the unique relationship which exists between the two islands.  We do not always agree with British Governments.  There are matters of tension and disagreement between us but <Col N="312" /> there is a closeness between us and the British.  It is only right that this legislation be seen to be a unique example of the recognition of the relationship that exists between us.  To that extent I welcome the Bill and the fact that its passage through the House is not being opposed.  I hope we can improve the legislation to some extent along the lines I suggested when we come to deal with it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I have always felt it was outrageously unfair not to extend the franchise in general elections to UK citizens who are resident here.  During my eight years in the Dáil I have campaigned for this legislation and I am delighted that we are now at the stage of having it enacted in the House. There is a unique relationship between our two countries.  For historical reasons, Irish citizens in the UK have always had a vote in their parliamentary elections. Thirty five years ago when we left the Commonwealth this right was continued for Irish citizens resident in the UK by a special Act of Parliament.  It was rather a dog in the manger attitude on our part not to reciprocate that.  Over the years, UK citizens here have made a contribution from the point of view of the establishment of industry and so on.  At this late stage we are in many ways remedying an injustice by extending the franchise to them.</P>
      <P>From the European point of view this legislation creates a new opening.  In the European elections we, uniquely within the EC, provided for all EC residents to vote.  There is considerable debate in Europe as regards the possibility of having a uniform system for the next European elections.  There are two points of view.  One is that the vote should be based on nationality and the other is that it should be based on residence.  In European terms, my view is that the system we have should, if possible, be accepted and adopted by all other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the national elections we have also created an opening.  In many ways I would wish to see all nationals <Col N="313" /> having entitlement to vote here in general elections but we must take into account that there are different systems in different countries.  In the recent elections in Greece there were many buses, ferries and planeloads of electors travelling to Greece because that is where they had an entitlement to vote.  What we have done is create an opening so that we can discuss with our colleagues in the EC a system which will bring our citizens closer together from the point of view of parliamentary elections.  Under the legislation, we have the right to discuss procedures for the future on the basis of reciprocity which will enable progress to be made in European terms in the future.  We are doing a good day's work in extending the vote to UK citizens and in giving a lead from the European point of view.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State for introducing it after many years of possibly unnecessary delay.  The Supreme Court found the previous Bill repugnant to the Constitution but, following voting last June, the way is now open to extend the franchise in relation to general elections to British citizens resident here and to other designated residents of member states.  The situation as it was was ridiculous having regard to the reciprocal rights which Irish citizens enjoy in England. Up to now, British citizens residing here could only vote in local and European elections.  People from the UK who work here and contribute to society should have a say in general elections.</P>

      <P>As I indicated, I welcome these proposals which are long overdue.  I note that about 12,000 British residents will be entitled to participate in future general elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point has been made in regard to the register at the time of presidential elections and perhaps the Minister of State will indicate the position in this area.  I look forward to British residents <Col N="314" /> and those from member states having full voting rights and I hope that they, in turn, will ensure that people from this country will have similar rights abroad.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Members of the House for the way they received the Bill.  There is general agreement in this area and we had lengthy debates on this matter some time ago.  We are now giving votes to UK residents here and we have talked about this for years on the basis that Irish people living in England have a vote and, in natural justice, the same situation should prevail here.</P>
      <P>It is also important that we are now giving EC partners the opportunity of coming in on the whole question of reciprocity between various member states and this country in relation to voting in parliamentary elections.  This is important and I hope that member states will look at this as a gesture from a small national committed to the principles of European unity and economic development. It is surely a way of forging closer links between member states and, if we talk about a European concept, nationals of such states should have the right to vote in elections.  We have now set up the machinery to allow this to happen and one could say that the ball is now in the court of other member states to reciprocate and I hope that they do.  Indeed, I have no doubt that they will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised the problem with regard to Northern Ireland in relation to the Assembly elections. This Bill is basically about parliamentary elections and in that regard people living in Northern Ireland have the right to vote in Westminster elections.  We are aware of the restricted franchise in the case of local and Assembly elections but they are not at issue here.  I have no doubt that the British authorities will take into consideration the views expressed in the House on this and will respond.  We have now made the running and we hope that will be taken up.  I do not have any doubt that in the on-going discussions on <Col N="315" /> various issues in regard to Northern Ireland that issue could be taken on board. We have given a lead by giving votes to citizens of the UK.  We have shown the way.</P>

      <P>Deputy Doyle mentioned the question of reciprocity and suggested that this requirement be dropped.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that our laws in relation to the franchise for local and European elections are the most liberal of any European state.  We are giving a lead in the legislation before the House. We have gone as far as we should go and we await a response from other member states.  I have no doubt they will respond. Deputies Doyle and Shatter raised the questions of residency.  The intention is that no length of residence will be specified. The requirements will be the same as those that apply in regard to the registration of Irish citizens at Dáil elections. Deputy Shatter said he would like to see the vote extended to any person who resides here for an extended period especially those who stay between five and ten years.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that a person can take out Irish citizenship after five years of residence without being required by our law to renounce his existing nationality or citizenship.  If people living in the State want to avail of a vote they can do so without renouncing their citizenship. That is a reasonable approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Barnes and Manning, and others, said that in view of this legislation it was hoped that such people will take a keen interest in the forthcoming local elections and exercise their right to vote. We all share that sentiment.  It is our hope that people will take an interest in all elections.  Our proposal is to allow UK citizens who have worked on the economic, social and cultural side of our life to vote.  I am happy about the proposal. The referendum last year indicated that the majority of Irish people in a generous and open way wanted to extend that right.  I hope other member states will follow our example.  Such a provision will not tip the balance in the electoral field in any country but it represents a gesture of solidarity and a coming together of the <Col N="317" /> citizens of member states.  The provisions have been debated fully today.  It is a short though important piece of legislation which many Members recognise is long overdue.  I should like to thank both sides of the House for the warm way they received it.  The approach of Members is indicative of the way the people felt when asked to decide on the issue in the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that native Irish industry relies excessively on State aid and debt finance.  This unhealthy trend was identified in the White Paper on industrial policy as one of the major obstacles to the growth and development of indigenous enterprise.  The under-capitalisation of industry makes it ill-equipped to finance the development of new products and markets and thus ensure a strong self sustaining base for growth.</P>
      <P>The extent of the problem is clearly demonstrated by the recent NESC report on financing the traded sectors.  This report shows that from 1972 to 1982 bank borrowing by manufacturing industry increased in real terms by 6 per cent per annum while production volumes increased by only 3.5 per cent, just half as much.  The report also showed that equity capital relative to total assets is much lower in Ireland than in, for example, the UK, Japan or the USA.  Small industries are particularly vulnerable to over-reliance on borrowings.  They are less capable of weathering the storm than larger well established enterprises, and in times of low profitability, reduced cash flow and high levels of real bank interest rates they are quite simply forced over the precipice.  This is not to suggest that the larger industries are immune from the disease, as has been all too clearly demonstrated in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality and extent of the problem has also been recognised and acknowledged by Members of this House.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses stated in their first report on manufacturing industry that &ldquo;finance is without doubt one of the major problem <Col N="319" /> areas for small companies&rdquo;.  In regard to equity finance in particular, the same report concluded that many small firms are under-capitalised when setting up and that because of low profitability and lack of any further equity investment this situation continues throughout the life of the company.  Among the committee's recommendations it was stated that the encouragement of additional venture capital through the banks, other financial institutions and through private investors is required.  My own views on this topic clearly parallel those of the Oireachtas Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>If further evidence is required of the increasing imbalance of the debt equity ratio of Irish industry, I would suggest to Deputies that the problem is no more starkly evident than in the performance of the Irish Stock Exchange in recent years.  The number of companies quoted on the exchange has been steadily declining over the past decade.  Its activities in recent times have concentrated on trading in a small number of &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; equities and oil share speculation.  The Stock Exchange has become irrelevant to the financing needs of Irish industry generally.  The market capitalisation of shares quoted on the exchange is under 10 per cent of the country's national output as compared with about 50 per cent in the UK and the US.  The most recent statistics available to me show that only 21 of the 77 companies listed on the Stock Exchange are engaged in manufacturing. The unlisted securities market was launched in 1980 to encourage the entry of smaller high-growth companies to the Exchange.  Its performance according to any criteria, and particularly when compared to its UK counterpart, has been most disappointing, to put it mildly. The failure of industry and, in particular, manufacturing industry, to utilise the facility of the USM is further testimony to the dearth of equity type capital in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of this Government's progressive policy for industrial development, as outlined in the <Col N="320" /> White Paper on this topic, is our commitment to encouraging a greater level of private sector investment in the productive sectors of the economy.  Given the stark reality of the problems of financing Irish industry, our endeavours in this direction must take on an increasing and continuing importance and urgency.</P>
    <P>The first step towards providing a cure however must focus on an analysis of the causes and symptoms of the disease.  It would be very wrong to assume that the lack of equity capital in industry is due only to the failure on the part of the investment community to provide the finance.  If the dramatic gearing &mdash; in other words, excess borrowing &mdash; problems of industry are to be rectified, entrepreneurs must become more receptive to the idea of outside investment and overcome their traditional reluctance to dilute their ownership and control in the firm regardless of consequences.  Native small industry to a very large extent has been based on the model of the family business.  It has usually been the case in such instances that family ownership is considered to be sacrosanct and investment by third parties regarded as an undesirable intrusion in the family's private affairs.  Many small businessmen are quite happy to sacrifice the benefits both to themselves and the community, of expansion in favour of a quiet life with an acceptable level of income.  This has often been motivated by a reluctance to accept the increased workload &mdash; and there is no doubt there is an increased workload &mdash; and responsibility to shareholders associated with third party investment.</P>
    <P>These are all factors which affect the level of suitable opportunities for investors but which are not within the direct control of the Government.  We can merely urge a change in attitude.  However, I feel that the harsh realities of economic recession, and the fact that it is far better to own 50 per cent or 60 per cent of a successful business than 100 per cent of one which has failed, will ultimately bring about a reversal of these trends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> Certainly, the Government are committed to encouraging a greater acceptance of the need for equity financing.  The emergence of a demand for equity among entrepreneurs is evolving, but it must be matched by a supply of finance from private and institutional investors.  There has been a marked reluctance on the part of investors to put money into industry and this trend has been particularly noticeable in the last decade.  Reasons for this reluctance are easily identified.  It is certainly true that there has been a significant disincentive to productive investment by virtue of the more favourable tax treatment of other less risky forms of investment, such as investment in property and Government gilts.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the White Paper, committed themselves to an examination of the tax code to see how the elimination of this bias in favour of riskless investments as against risky investments, might be achieved.  The Finance Act of 1984 introduced a number of relevant measures such as the elimination of bond washing and the restriction of tax based financing, which encouraged borrowing by businesses.  However, by far the most important and far reaching initiative introduced in the 1984 Finance Act was the incentive given to invest in industry by virtue of the business expansion scheme. The scheme provides that individuals who purchase new ordinary shares in unquoted manufacturing companies, namely, those eligible for the 10 per cent corporation tax scheme, or in companies providing internationally traded services should be able to write-off up to £25,000 per annum against their personal taxable income.  I should say that the provision of income tax relief is subject to a number of qualifying criteria, but an illustration of the potential benefit is that an individual paying 60 per cent tax and who makes a qualifying investment of £25,000 will find that the net cost of that investment is only £10,000.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss this scheme in more detail and to outline why it gives rise to the need for the Bill currently before the House, I should like to dwell a little longer on some further aspects of <Col N="322" /> the equity financing problems of Irish industry.  I would beg the House's indulgence in this regard but the issues involved are of sufficient importance and have significant relevance to this legislation as to merit a comprehensive and open debate in this forum.</P>
    <P>Many economists, investment managers and other interested commentators have argued that tax incentives such as those provided by the business expansion scheme will not remove one of the principal obstacles to productive investment, which is the lack of suitable, well planned and profitable project ideas in which to invest.  This is a criticism one hears frequently when talking to those in the broadly defined banking community.  In other words, there is, some say, too much money chasing too few projects.  I do not accept this argument which hinges entirely on one's definition of a suitable project.  The major difficulty facing most of the enterprises emerging under the IDA's Enterprise Development Programme is that of raising equity finance.  The National Enterprise Agency have attracted significant numbers of projects, some of which have already been rejected by the private sector finance houses.  My Department are approached almost daily by budding entrepreneurs inquiring about the availability of capital to finance new projects.  There is no shortage of projects.  Apart entirely from all of these are a large number of established businesses for whom refinancing would be a significant step towards both viability and profitability.  What I am attempting to demonstrate is that there is a significant pool of new and established businesses offering opportunities for investment.  The problem is that they are not deemed to have sufficient potential to justify the risk.  I am informed that at least one private venture capital agency requires applicant companies to have a minimum of at least three years' profitable trading before investment is even contemplated.  That criterion would not quality as venture capital in the United States of America.  Indeed, one US businessman, who set up a business here with the aid of the business expansion scheme <Col N="323" /> in a place which I visited recently, told me that the venture capital community here could be described as good merchant bankers rather than venture capitalists in the American sense of the term.</P>
    <P>The application of this type of criterion narrows the field down quite considerably and leads to claims of &ldquo;too few project ideas in which to invest&rdquo;.  What is required in fact is change of attitude in regard to risk-taking and a lowering of the risk thresholds demanded by the institutional investors.  The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses concurred with this viewpoint and concluded decisively that &ldquo;there is an urgent national need which the market has failed to deliver on&rdquo;.  I do not comment on the English used there.</P>
    <P>I would like to state categorically however that my remarks are not intended as a criticism of the venture capital industry, which is still in an embryonic stage of its development in this country compared for instance, with the US model to which I was referring.  It would serve no purpose, I suppose, if the industry were to fall flat on its face by virtue of a rash of ill-advised high risk investments.  I am confident that risk thresholds will be lowered and high risk investment will be more readily accepted as the industry evolves and establishes a track record for itself.  The Government can clearly contribute to this evolution process by the creation of an environment which is more conducive towards investment generally and through an integrated industrial development policy which will enhance the future profitability of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>An essential prerequisite for the development of a healthy equity base in industry is the provision of the appropriate infrastructure through which the stocks and shares of industry can be traded.  I commented earlier on the performance of the Stock Exchange and do not therefore propose to dwell on that subject.  However the fact remains that the exchange is perceived by the young entrepreneur and the private investor as a rather formidable institution.  Its failure <Col N="324" /> to attract any significant new business from either quarter in the past decade is ample testimony to its stagnation.  This is particularly damaging given that it is the only official market place for trading industrial shares.  If we are serious about encouraging a greater level of private sector investment in industry, we must be prepared to provide the necessary mechanisms through which to channel the investment.  In particular, mechanisms with which the private individual can more easily identify are essential.</P>
    <P>My Department have only recently completed an important study in regard to the development of a more active market in the stocks and shares of small and medium sized industry.  This study has concentrated on three main areas:</P>
    <P> (i) the performance of the Stock Exchange in recent years;</P>
    <P>(ii) the potential benefits of a properly regulated over-the-counter market such as exists in the UK; and</P>
    <P>(iii) the desirability of amending company law to allow companies to buy back their own shares. </P>
    <P>I referred to this report in my recent address to the annual general meeting of the Confederation of Irish Industry and in doing so provoked a considerable response.  My Department were subsequently inundated with requests for copies of the report.  I would like to say for the record, however, that this report was never intended for publication, but rather as a document for internal use within my Department.  My reference to it was merely to indicate the seriousness with which my Department were taking this issue.  Much of the detailed information contained in the report was provided by third parties on the basis that it would remain confidential.  It would be dishonourable therefore not to respect the wishes of those whose co-operation was so vital in the preparation of the report.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this constraint on publicity, the report is a valuable document and will greatly assist in the development of Government policy for the promotion of an active market in stocks <Col N="325" /> and shares and the promotion of industrial investment generally.  It provides important statistical analysis of the over-the-counter markets at present operating in the United Kingdom and the United States.  I would like to see a similar market developing here as a means to tackling the poor capital structure of Irish industry.  Indeed, I am heartened by some responses made to my Department in this area, even since the speech to the Confederation of Irish Industry.</P>
    <P>It would be important however that such a market should develop in a properly regulated manner.  This would be essential if investor confidence in the market is to be guaranteed.  I would also stress that I would not view such a market as being in any way in competition with, or a substitute for, a thriving Stock Exchange.  Indeed, I think a properly structured over-the-counter market could lead ultimately to a rejuvenation of the exchange by providing an interim market for the shares of small and medium sized industries and facilitating their development to a point where they might contemplate a full listing.  Essentially, an over-the-counter market is an informal arrangement by which people can buy and sell shares that are not quoted or listed on the exchange.  In a way, it is a private market in shares, as distinct from the public market, as is the exchange.  There is a tendency to use jargon in this area on the assumption, which is often not correct, that people understand what you are talking about. They are afraid, for fear of showing their ignorance, to ask you what you mean. It is important to explain the difference therefore between the over-the-counter market, the unlisted securities market and the full exchange listed market. These are three separate types of institution, with a rising degree of disclosure requirements and a rising degree of complexities, but also a rising degree of access to funds &mdash; lesser funds being available the less onerous the requirements, and the more onerous the requirements the more funds being available.</P>
    <P>In considering the report I will also be <Col N="326" /> paying particular attention to the comments by the consultants in regard to allowing redemption of capital.  I can assure the House that I will be considering the report as a whole as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>This whole area is of considerable importance to both the institutional investor as well as the private individual. This is particularly so in the context of the business expansion scheme.  In order to qualify under the scheme, companies must not be quoted on a Stock Exchange. Stock exchange companies are excluded.</P>
    <P>This is not a particularly restrictive provision as the vast bulk of industry, as I have already indicated, falls into this category of unquoted companies in any case.  After a period of three years has elapsed, however, the companies may, if they so choose, seek a listing on the Stock Exchange.  Given the performance to date of the Stock Exchange one could not predict with any confidence that the BES will lead to a significant increase in the level of activity on the exchange, but it may and I hope it does.  In the absence of any alternative exit mechanism, people who have bought shares will want to get out; and, since they are not on the Stock Exchange where they can sell them, investors would be faced with the prospect of being locked into the shares and unable to realise their investment.  I do not wish to give rise to false hopes of an overnight solution to this difficulty but I do wish to assure prospective investors that will exists to tackle the problem and tackle it effectively.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we realise that the success of the business expansion scheme to some degree hinges on finding not only a means by which people can buy shares on a favourable basis but also, in due course, sell them on a favourable basis also.</P>
    <P>I would not wish that the business expansion scheme be viewed as a panacea for all the ills I have outlined.  The long term solution lies in the creation of an environment which is conducive to investment.  This will involve tackling the various aspects of the problem on a systematic basis.  I am confident however, that the scheme will have an important <Col N="327" /> catalytic effect in terms of generating a significant flow of capital to the productive sectors of the economy and focusing attention on the benefits of equity investment.  It is a significant incentive to the private individual to invest in industry.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the scheme which should not be overlooked is that the tax relief applies to qualifying investments by employees in their employer companies.  I have for some time now been advocating the concept of employee shareholding.  As Minister for Finance, I was instrumental in introducing tax concessions in the 1982 Finance Act to promote the concept in Irish industry.  These tax concessions were made more attractive in the 1984 Finance Act and, I am glad to say, have resulted in increased interest in introducing approved profit sharing and employee shareholding scheme.  The additional benefits resulting from the business expansion scheme increase the potential attractiveness of such schemes, but the employees will find this scheme of interest also.</P>
    <P>I believe that the adoption of employee shareholding on a wide scale in Ireland would represent a radical change from our traditional thinking in the area of industrial relations &mdash; a change which would, in my opinion, greatly enhance our prospects for a profitable industrial base capable of competing successfully in world markets.  As a small open-trading economy our competitive edge will be a key factor in ensuring the future employment prospects of our young population.  If we are to ensure our industrial prosperity we must guard against becoming complacent or insular and the value of employee shareholding as a means to that end should not be underestimated. By having a stake in the business in which they work employees will have a greater commitment and incentive to ensure that their employer is efficient and profitable.  They become more appreciative of the difficulties with which business must cope and develop a greater <Col N="328" /> insight into the factors affecting the prospects for industry.</P>
    <P>The framing of the business expansion scheme to extend eligibility to employees is therefore a critically important factor which improves the potential of the scheme to contribute to the equity base of Irish industry and broadens its effectiveness through the promotion of employee shareholding.</P>
    <P>Thus far, I have concentrated on outlining the Government's perception of some of the important difficulties facing Irish industry.  I have described key initiatives for tackling these problems.  I have also attempted to underline the significance and potential of the business expansion scheme.  Clearly, if the scheme is to achieve this potential it must be seen to be effective and workable.</P>
    <P>Since it was first introduced in 1984 the scheme has faced much criticism from various interested parties who viewed it as much too complex and restrictive.  One of the key difficulties relates to the establishment of investment funds.  Under the scheme, an individual may make an investment directly in the company of his choice or, alternatively, he may invest in a fund which has been designated for the purpose of the scheme by the Revenue Commissioners.  The legislation now before the House is designed to facilitate the establishment of these designated funds and at, the same time, complement the provision of the 1984 Finance Act in that regard.</P>
    <P>The designated investment funds have a crucial role in determining the success or otherwise of the business expansion scheme.  The experience of the UK scheme has shown that up to 90 per cent of total qualifying investments are made through such funds and we might expect a similar profile of BES investment in this country.  Designated investment funds are a particularly attractive proposition to investors for two reasons.  First, each participant has an interest in all of the investments made by the fund and so is able to obtain a fair spread of the risk associated with his investment.  Secondly, by investing through a fund, the individual has access to the investment expertise <Col N="329" /> of fund managers who identify and actively monitor the companies in which they invest.</P>
    <P>Two such funds have been established to date.  However, expectations of a greater level of activity in regard to this aspect of the BES have not been realised. The problem lies in the fact that designated investment funds as outlined in the terms of the Finance Act, 1984, come within the scope of existing unit trust legislation and, as a result, have certain constraints imposed on them.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to remove these designated investment funds from the scope of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, and thus avoid a serious legislative anomaly.</P>
    <P>Some understandable confusion may arise as to the precise differences between an investment fund and a normal unit trust.  There are, in fact, fundamental differences between the two.  In an investment fund each participant will own a particular share in a particular company. In a normal unit trust each participant owns a proportion of the total holding rather than owning a particular asset. Also, in an investment fund all subscriptions must be paid up by a specific date nominated by the manager, after which no further participants may join the fund. A unit trust scheme on the other hand is open-ended and a participant may join or leave at any time by buying or selling units of the scheme.  Indeed, the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, requires the manager of a unit trust to buy units of the scheme from a participant on demand.  This latter provision would be particularly inappropriate in respect of investment funds and indeed would place an intolerable burden on the fund manager.</P>
    <P>The Unit Trusts Act, 1972, provides that unit trust schemes may register under the Act.  The Act specifically provides, however, that unregistered unit trust schemes are prohibited from advertising. Therefore investment funds would be required to register under an Act, the provisions of which are wholly inappropriate for their purposes, in order to be able to advertise and invite subscriptions from the public.  Essentially that is the <Col N="330" /> nub of the problem this Bill is designed to solve.  The two existing funds, to which I referred earlier under existing legislation are considered to be unregistered unit trusts which have chosen not to advertise and so remain within the law.  It would, of course, be unreasonable to expect all prospective fund managers to operate within this constraint.  If we do not have adequate participation it probably will be because of lack of advertising, leading to lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>In order to provide further clarification let me outline briefly how these funds will operate.  Following designation by the Revenue Commissioners, each fund will advertise its existence and invite subscriptions directly from members of the public.  It may specify a minimum or maximum subscription to be made by each individual as well as a total target size for the fund.  The fund will also specify a closing date by which such subscriptions must be received.  No investments may be made by the fund itself prior to the closing date, that is, until all subscriptions have been received.  After the closing date the fund manager may make suitable investments in targeted companies on behalf of the participants in the fund.  I feel it is important to note that the fund managers will be acting as a nominee of the participant who at all times will retain beneficial ownership of the shares purchased on his behalf.  The subscription of each participant will be spread <i>pro rata</i> over all investments by the fund.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is achieved by section 2 which removes the designated investment funds from the scope of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972.  The remaining sections of the Bill are designed to impose certain requirements on designated funds in the best interests of the investors.</P>
    <P>The main aim has been to ensure that funds will provide the maximum possible information to prospective investors. Access to information such as that specified in section 5 of the Bill is essential if investors are to make an objective decision as to whether or not investment in a particular fund constitutes a good risk.  It is worth noting that the prospectus must <Col N="331" /> highlight the risk involved in investment in industry and advise all prospective investors to consult their accountant, stockbroker, bank manager or other professional adviser before proceeding.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to attempt to provide in this instance for more comprehensive investor safeguards.  Ultimately, responsibility for assessing the bona fides of a particular fund will rest with the investor himself. Given the likely profile of these investors, that is those on a high income, and the range of information with which they will be provided, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the provisions of this Bill are more than adequate to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>I consider it important that I draw the attention of the House to the provisions of section 6 which imposes certain obligations on fund managers in regard to investments in private companies.  This section provides important safeguards from the point of view of the investor.</P>
    <P>Of course, an investment under the business expansion scheme does not have to be channelled through a fund.  In the past 12 months a number of direct investments in qualifying companies have taken place.  I recognise, however, as I stated just a moment ago, that there has been considerable criticism of the scheme, much of which I regret to say has been ill-informed.  However, I have at all times indicated my willingness to listen to constructive criticism and to consider suitable amendments to make the scheme more effective.  I am pleased to say that the Government have accepted my recommendations for some key changes to the Finance Act which will provide a major impetus to the scheme.</P>
    <P>First, close relatives who have up to now been excluded will in future be eligible for relief from income tax. Secondly, the statutory ceiling on fees which may be charged by investment fund managers will be removed, providing further incentive for the establishment of such funds.  The time limit within which companies engaged in research and development must start trading is being <Col N="332" /> extended in order to encourage investment in this type of activity.  Finally, companies with less than wholly owned subsidiaries and those with certain foreign subsidiaries will in future qualify under the scheme.</P>
    <P>These changes have been proposed on the basis of discussions which I and my Department have had with a wide range of interested parties in the investment community over the past 12 months. They will, I am certain, result in a much increased level of activity under the BES. Coupled with the measures proposed in the Bill now before the House, I am confident that we have the right recipe for a successful business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the need for which was expressed in the lack of support forthcoming for the proposal first initiated in the Finance Act of 1984 and in subsequent debates in 1984 and to date.  It was clearly indicated to the Government that the need for this Bill was urgent and absolute if we were to get money invested in industry starved of equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise that Fianna Fáil contend that the scheme, to be successful, requires imaginative legislation and a healthy business environment on both of which counts the Government and the Minister for Finance, in particular, have failed dismally.  The Bill has been introduced in a very restrictive manner.  The amendments put forward prove their point, points made when Finance Bills were being discussed.  The Bill falls short of the necessary ingredients to make the incentive a success.  Encouraging capital for investment, an appropriate economic climate and business confidence in the Government's running of the country are absolute prerequisites.  Constant erosion of consumer spending leads to protraction in business life which, in turn, leads to lack of investment.  Furthermore, Government policy in terms of company and capital taxation is not conducive to the stimulation of investment vital for our <Col N="333" /> economy under this scheme now proposed.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest drawbacks of the scheme has been the restrictive nature of the trades that qualify.  Had Fianna Fáil's advice to the Minister been taken when he was introducing this legislation it would have been realised that being restrictive in the types of trades that would qualify would impede the success of the scheme.  For instance, Fianna Fáil strongly recommended that companies in the building industry should qualify. Given the heavy capital requirement of agricultural enterprises that industry could have been incorporated to raise capital, and relief under the scheme would be of tremendous benefit to investors.</P>
    <P>The fact that two funds only have been established in the last year is a measure of the Government's failure in this regard, with very few individual companies qualifying under the provisions of the scheme. Whatever the Minister may have said today, or the Government for that matter, that cannot be said to be a successful scheme.  It is suggested that the application of the scheme be extended at least to the categories I have mentioned, other types of industry, and that there be a wider definition of service industries to be considered.  Despite the encouragement from this side of the House in the matter of investment in industry, creating a climate in which people would have confidence to invest the provisions of the scheme remain too restrictive.  I contend that the scheme requires investment in share capital to be kept for a minimum of five years.  It is accepted that enterprises require long term capital.  It must be borne in mind also that investors have an option of partial reimbursement of capital over a shorter period.  Therefore, why has not this aspect of the scheme been considered and implemented? Where enterprises are successful most business people and professional advisers would recommend that those enterprises should be in a position to raise further finance from the public.  Normally that is done through the unsecured listed market, private placing or going public. <Col N="334" /> In the interest of investors I would recommend that a time limit of three years would be more appropriate.  The scheme is inherently good for investors and investment in business.  However, the continued narrow approach to it militates against its success.  I have already said that its limited success to date is hardly worthy of note.</P>
    <P>The amendments introduced are welcome in that their implementation will further develop investment funds that can be set up.  However, I could content that the Minister for Finance is too restrictive in the terms applicable to the scheme.  I would urge him through his colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, to broaden his horizons in order to speed up the use and development of the investment scheme.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the Bill before the House does little to dismantle the intimidating barbed wire fence which surrounds the business development scheme encompassed in the 1984 Finance Act. Despite the fact that the Minister made considerable mention of that scheme it remains restrictive in its provisions.  The provisions of this Bill remove designated funds from the scope of the provisions of the 1972 Unit Trust Act, imposing instead certain unacceptable controls.</P>
    <P>The Minister has power to prescribe what a designated fund prospectus should contain.  For example, it must say that an investor should consult an accountant, stockbroker, branch manager or a solicitor before investing in the fund.  That is equivalent to the statutory health warning which must be printed on a packet of cigarettes.  The Minister is merely introducing further constraints to a scheme which was already largely inoperable. The recent NESC report on the financing of the trade sector highlighted the high level of borrowings in industry which results in many firms operating at considerable risk.  This is also reflected in the very high level of bad and doubtful debts being sustained by the banking industry. The primary requirement is to attract more equity funds into the manufacturing and business sector to fund future growth <Col N="335" /> and output and increase employment.  I have reservations that this Bill will achieve what we seek to achieve.  The aim should be to encourage the greatest number of individuals possible to invest in industry through venture capital as designated by the Finance Bill, 1984 and by this Designated Investment Funds Bill. More risk investment of this nature will reduce the need for borrowing and increase the capacity of firms to support higher borrowing only if it is attractive to people with funds to invest.</P>
    <P>The Minister should simplify the income tax procedure as this is most important for individual investors in designated funds.  At present the PAYE taxpayer does not get relief until money he has paid into a designated fund is actually invested by the fund in a qualifying company. The Minister should pay some attention to that aspect.  There is not a reason why an individual investor should not be given an amended certificate of tax free allowance as soon as possible after providing evidence of his investment to a designated fund.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the needs of industry starved of equity have been finally recognised by the Government and that an effort is being made to correct a major deficiency in the original proposals.  I am glad that in this Bill the Government accepted the promptings of this side of the House during the budget debates of 1984 and 1985.  I would welcome this Bill more if it removed some of the continuing restrictive elements so that we could give the fullest possible support for investment funds for industry.  I hope this Bill will change the attitude of this Government who, by their policies, stifled investment in industry and undermined confidence.  It is high time that an environment more conducive to investment and expansion in industry was created by the Government to establish sustainable employment.  I hope that this Bill will receive the fullest support from the financial institutions and people with money to invest.  That support will come only when an environment is created by the Government to encourage people to <Col N="336" /> invest.  We can no longer accept a situation where jobs are continually being lost in manufacturing industry.  Over a four year period 28,000 jobs were lost. In relation to the support industries some progress was made in high technology and chemical plants but it has not been sufficient to take up the vast labour pool available.  Perhaps at a later stage the Minister will address some of the continuing restrictions to investment under the designated trust funds.  This Bill opens the door to investment and I welcome it. I can only wish that the door had been opened a little more because we need more investment capital to provide employment and to boost an economy that has been allowed to decline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I largely welcome this Bill.  There is no doubt that the Designated Investment Funds Bill is essential for the success of the business expansion scheme as outlined in the budget of 1984. The development by Government of the venture capital market is one of the planks of industrial strategy for the next decade set out in the Government's new White Paper on industrial policy.  There is a vital need in Ireland for seed and venture capital and new internal initiatives generally.  The Minister referred extensively to that aspect in his address. It appears that in the initial drafting of the business expansion scheme the draftsmen were perhaps a bit over zealous in ensuring that the scheme was not abused.  A number of minor amendments to it as proposed here this morning will make an enormous difference and will make a good idea a very successful one.  Despite the initial attractiveness it was quite clear that individuals would be very reluctant to take the risks associated with such investment of their own volition.  It is essential therefore that legislation makes it attractive for fund managers to act as intermediaries so that the huge resources available can be channelled into the right kinds of investments.  The first requirement, therefore, is to make it clear that the general unit trust legislation does not apply to the funds set up under this scheme.  The controls of the unit trust <Col N="337" /> legislation are so restrictive as to make it highly unlikely that anybody would take the risk of setting up a venture capital fund and subsequently finding it subject to unit trust legislation.  That aspect has been very adequately dealt with today in section 2 of the Bill and I welcome it heartily.</P>
      <P>Another criticism that was quite prevalent after the Minister's announcement of a business expansion scheme was that the 5 per cent limit on fees was too restrictive, especially compared to the 3.5 per cent which they generally could earn for, say, life assurance companies by simply introducing potential investment through a European policy.  The 1.5 per cent extra allowed on the venture capital scheme could not possibly cover the vastly different expenses involved in such a scheme.  It would require special advisers to assess projects in general and monitoring progress thereof.  I am delighted that in the Finance Act, 1985, the limits for exercising this restriction were removed and there is now no limit at all, which is what many thought should have been the case all along.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to my budget speech of 6 February 1985 when I made reference to my concern about these aspects of the business expansion scheme that were preventing it from being extremely successful.  I quote from the Official Report, column 1877, Volume 355:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many companies have been under-capitalised since their establishment and because of low profitability and lack of further equity investment this state continues during the lifetime of the company.  The venture capital Scheme announced in last year's budget has not perhaps been as successful as it should be, even though it is early days yet.  The basic approach was correct but I ask the Minister to turn his attention to minor amendments that could turn a good idea into a very successful one.  For instance, it is essential that it be made clear that the terms of the general unit trust legislation do not <Col N="338" /> apply to funds set up under this scheme as they are so restrictive few people would take the risk.  Also, the 5 per cent commission or limit on fees is too restrictive in view of the expenses involved in setting up, advising and monitoring progress of such schemes. I favour no limit being set and let the market forces dictate the appropriate level.</P>
    <P>That aspect has been taken care of in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>There was a feeling that the legislation precluded fund promoters from taking shares in the companies into which they were channelling profits generally.  This is not precluded under current legislation despite wide misconception in relation to this point.  Under the Finance Act, 1984, section 27 (8) apparently fund managers will be allowed to take up to 30 per cent. Clarification of this would be in order because there is much criticism of this aspect which I understand is wrongly based.</P>
    <P>There were problems also in relation to the fact that investors through no fault of their own found that after two or three years a company no longer qualified for relief and they could find themselves with the tax benefit clawed back and funds being locked into the company.  There have been many requests for safeguards from this, and that should be taken care of.  While it is quite understandable that there should be some restriction on disposal, the terms of the original Act were far too restrictive.  When a company is doing well and needs to raise large amounts of capital, it is effectively precluded from doing so in order to protect the tax status of the original investment. A mechanism is required whereby companies should be allowed to go on the unlisted securities market if the need arises.  This would also provide a very welcome market for the original investments and would add significantly to their attractiveness.</P>
    <P>A further option which I would like to be considered has been referred to by the Minister and I think at the CII AGM this year, to allow companies to buy their own <Col N="339" /> shares as in the US.  This would also make investments more marketable.  I am thinking of the model of the SBIC &mdash; small business investments corporations &mdash; which have been extremely successful in the US and of similar type schemes in Europe.  Belgium particularly has a successful scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a passing reference at this point to the fact that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses considered the whole aspect of venture and risk capital.  In their first report on the manufacturing industries generally, the committee made the point that many small firms are under-capitalised when setting up, and because of general low profitability and lack of any further equity investment that situation continues for the life of a company. The necessity of making relatively large repayments is a considerable strain on the resources of any company, particularly when profitability is low, as is the case when companies are setting up or where trading difficulties arise or exist.  The Stock Exchange has tried to develop a market in unlisted stocks in recent years with little success and has concentrated on devising sophisticated schemes for its existing usually large companies rather than trying to make the exchange attractive for new small companies.  A measure of its failure is that the Finance Act, 1984, proposed a scheme for relief for the investment and corporate trade.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the business expansion scheme has been welcomed generally. The amendments being made here today in relation to the unit trust legislation and the amendments already in the Finance Bill of this year should make this scheme extremely successful.  The availability of additional venture capital through the banks or other financial institutions and through private investors generally must be encouraged and is required urgently for small manufacturing companies in particular such as we are concerned with today.</P>
    <P>A point which has been made many times and to which the Minister referred <Col N="340" /> is that there is a general climate in Ireland, a belief that Irish company owners generally would rather be 100 per cent owners of unsuccessful companies than 40 per cent owners of successful companies. There is a difficulty here in changing people's attitudes in relation to ownership, particularly in the business world.  It behoves us all, particularly the Minister and the Cabinet generally, to ensure that people appreciate the benefit of having a properly structured financial base in their company.  Traditionally the debt equity ratio in Irish companies has been very bad and their base has been very unsound financially.  The moment they hit a bad period or meet big repayments or have trading difficulties of any kind they topple.  Historically they have done little about it.  Perhaps a company or business has been handed down from father to son or, more rarely, from father to daughter or through the family throughout the years without any consideration of the financial structure of the company.</P>
    <P>The last few years have taken their toll of such companies.  The recession has meant that any company that had not a sound financial structure, a sound footing on a financial base, went to the wall with tragic consequences not only for the family concerned, the owners of the company, but for employment generally. Encouragement of young people into business, ensuring that our education system is not biased against the entrepreneur as it is at the moment and has been to date, ensuring that career guidance generally is not directed just at the safe pensionable job but rather more into the business arena and towards entrepreneurship, encouragement of properly calculated risks for our young people are what we should be about.  It is not just the Minister, Deputy Bruton's Department who will have responsibility in this area, but a far broader ambit in the Cabinet. Education has a major role to play and in certain aspects we have very good examples of how we are broadening our views in relation to the business arena, particularly in relation to risk taking, at <Col N="341" /> which traditionally as a nation we have not been very good.</P>
    <P>While we are discussing this topic, I appeal that the Stock Exchange should assess its criteria for allowing small business stocks in the case of companies seeking to raise funds at a lower level than now prevails.  We as a country and our financial institutions have failed to date to help small companies and to allow investment in small companies to be attracted to encourage this risk type investment.  The Minister said that generally the tax system and schemes here have been biased against risk capital and risk taking.  The scheme before us this morning and the original business expansion scheme as announced in the budget of 1984 are the Government's contribution to redressing the balance in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill could also be regarded as investor protection legislation which it provides very adequately.  One aspect concerns me slightly.  The Minister referred to the highly attractive situation in allowing employee investment through the business expansion scheme or designated investment funds into the companies in which they are working. Reference was made to the fact that the investment protection aspect of this legislation was sufficient because, generally speaking, we were talking about people on high incomes, the assumption being that unless they were on high incomes they would have nothing left to invest when they had paid their way.  I am not sure this will always hold, particularly in relation to attracting employees to invest in their own companies through these schemes.  I should like some reassurance on that.  I know many employees could be considered to be on high incomes but, without defining what we call high income in 1985&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that assurance.  I did not interpret it as clearly as that.  I accept what the Minister says.  They are not precluded from going <Col N="342" /> through a fund particularly in a big company. There is a slightly grey area there. I believe in the encouragement of employee shareholding and profit sharing generally in companies.  This is the path for the future, particularly in smaller companies.  The more financial interest employees have in their own companies, the keener they are to see that the company is profitable and to understand the difficulties.  Generally management and employee co-operation will be greater and the company will be the winner in the context of the appalling unemployment statistics at the moment.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the Bill.  I endorse what the Minister said in commending the Bill to the House.  There is an overall problem in relation to our attitudes.  That goes back to what I said a few moments ago.  We will have to ensure that people do not try to continue to be 100 per cent owners of unsuccessful companies rather than 40 per cent owners of thriving, successful companies. That is the nub of the problem.  A change in that attitude will make this Bill successful and the business expansion scheme generally successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  During the debate on the Finance Bill there was much criticism from the Opposition benches about the lack of equity in Irish business.  They criticised the Government for being too restrictive in the 1984 and 1985 Finance Bills.  This Bill goes a long way towards solving many of the problems which arose subsequent to the introduction of venture capital tax relief.  This Bill is introduced at an opportune time. Conditions for investment could not be better.  The progress made in reducing inflation since this Government took officer has been fantastic compared with the galloping rates which existed under previous Governments.  With regard to venture capital and equity we have fallen behind our neighbours in Britain and on a world wide basis.  The Minister outlined some of the problems.  He was concerned about the Stock Exchange and that many <Col N="343" /> people do not make full use of the Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Too many agencies come into play where investment in industry is concerned. Many restrictions are placed on individuals investing due to the fact that we have a proliferation of agencies such as the IDA.  It is time that voluntary bodies such as Chambers of Commerce came onto the scene again.  Recently they were swamped by the activities of these agencies.  This Bill will give scope to people on committees to take a more active part and perhaps become full managers and see that industries are established in their towns.</P>
      <P>The main complaint launched by the Opposition is that the qualifying criteria which the Revenue Commissioners will examine are too restrictive.  I do not see anything restrictive in the Cork Chamber of Commerce or the Ennis Chamber of Commerce having something more useful to do than signing certificates of origin for exported or imported goods. These committees are essential to Irish life.  They brought in manufacturing industry from all over the world.  In this Bill the Minister is giving them scope to take part again.  I hope they will play an active role.  In my constituency we have seen various examples of the better use of venture capital.  We have seen major companies investing in small companies and taking a share in small companies who are supplying different products to the base in the major company.  As a result the small companies have had a latitude which otherwise they would not have had.  That has been seen in the industrial estate in Shannon.  It will be further encouraged under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Profit sharing and employee shareholding will provide greater confidence in the work place.  If companies encourage proper employee shareholding especially in small companies the doubts which exist and the anxiety to maximise the take from companies will be reduced.  Many employees believe that a manufacturing industry will last for a short period only and, as a consequence, they have not got the confidence to contribute to it.  I <Col N="344" /> commend the Minister on the way he has handled some of the problems which arise in Irish industry, and on bringing in this Bill.  He has shown that he is aware of the current problems.  Since he took office he has made a major contribution to progress in industry.  This business expansion scheme is one of the means by which he has made a major contribution.  I commend him on his work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate for the welcome they have given to this Bill, and to thank Deputy Carey for the very kind remarks he made about me personally.  I will go through the points made in a rather random way.  Deputy Avril Doyle referred to the need to provide a means whereby companies could buy back their own shares which I referred to obliquely in my opening remarks.  That is recommended in the consultancy unit report. In Britain they have provided legislation to do this.  I understand it ran to 22 sections. It is fairly complicated piece of work.  We are engaged in a fairly major overhaul of company law at the moment. I have already received Government approval for two substantial Bills, one of which is published, in respect of company accounts.  I hope it will be possible to deal with this matter by a separate Bill or to incorporate it in one of those other Bills. While it is not essential for the initiation of this scheme it is useful for its continued successful operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle is also correct in saying that section 27 (8) of the Finance Act, 1984, allows fund managers effectively to take options of up to 30 per cent in the fund they establish.  Any misconceptions which there are in that regard, which are discouraging fund managers from setting up funds, can, I hope, by this publicity, be removed.  I would also refer to what Deputy Carey said.  I agree with him that this scheme gives bodies like the Chambers of Commerce an opportunity to do something positive about establishing or supporting the development of industry <Col N="345" /> in their localities on a basis that is profitable to the individuals involved.  Constructive conjunction of private gain and local patriotism can be achieved through this scheme.  I hope to have a meeting in the near future with the Association of Chambers of Commerce in Ireland.  I will urge them, in view of what Deputy Carey has said, to promote actively the use of this scheme in their own towns.  I am aware of a very good example of this in the principal town of my constituency, Navan.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy Lyons for the co-operative approach he adopted towards the Bill before us.  He made a few criticisms of the business expansion scheme, many of which relate to the Finance Bill aspects of it.  It is a fair to say that the vast majority of the criticisms that carry serious weight have already been met in the existing amendments to this year's Finance Act.  There is always the danger &mdash; I am sure Deputy Lyons will agree with me on reflection &mdash; that if you go on looking for improvements and refinements in the scheme without actually making use of what is there it can readily become an excuse for inaction. With this Bill and with the amendments to the Finance Bill this year I believe we have made many improvements to the Bill and I do not believe Deputies in this House should encourage investors to hang back waiting for more improvements. Let us get on with it and get the scheme underway.  I believe we have refined the scheme as is reasonable at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons made another point which deserves some discussion.  He suggested that the scheme should be extended to areas outside manufacturing and the internationally-traded services. He mentioned business and agriculture. I do not agree with the Deputy on this. We have to recognise that there is only a limited amount of money available for investment.  It is not unlimited and you have to target it to some degree to the areas where you expect to get the most return.  If you were to allow it to be used for investment in agriculture you could end up with the situation which happened <Col N="346" /> in Britain that the business expansion scheme there was simply being used to finance land speculation, driving up the price of land.  I do not believe that Deputy Lyons, no more than I, would want that to happen.  That is the sort of danger you can have if you are too liberal with the scheme.  Likewise, if you allow it to invest in the service industries all you might do is simply allow one publican to expand his pub using the business expansion scheme to take trade away from another publican.  The total sum of business activity would not be increased.  It would simply be used to divert trade from one part of the service sector in the economy to another.  That is not something we would wish to finance through a tax relief. The reason we have chosen to confine it to manufacture and internationally-traded services is that both of them are internationally traded.  If there is expansion it will be expansion into export markets potentially rather than at the expense of some existing alternative operation.  That is a reasonable targeting and a reasonable use of the incentive.  I believe it is generally recognised that the motor of economic growth in the country is still manufacturing and the internationally-traded services.  The employment may not all come in manufacturing and internationally-traded services but the wealth to create the employment will be earned to a great degree by manufacturing and internationally-traded services. It is how we use the wealth, once we get it into the country through that means, that is the crucial determinant of our success in combating the employment problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons was also concerned about the fact that the scheme did not allow people to get the tax relief until not only had the money been paid into the fund but that the fund had actually made an investment.  This criticism has been expressed by others who have also said that the anxiety to get the tax relief might encourage people to make unduly speedy investments when they might be better off waiting.  On the other hand, there is the danger that if your allow people to get the tax relief the money could sit <Col N="347" /> there in the fund for quite a while and not be invested.  There would not be a great urgency to get on with it, which is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be the individual's fault.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it could be the fund manager's fault.  The individual would not be putting the fund manager under any pressure because he would have already got his tax relief.  Admittedly he would not get any return on his investment until it was invested.  While there could be some justification in what Deputy Lyons has said it is not a major problem with the scheme.  However, I will take note of what the Deputy said and I will discuss it again with the Minister for Finance in due course.  I believe that, generally speaking, with this Bill and the amendments to the Finance Bill we have put the business expansion scheme on a basis that should deserve the wholehearted support of the entire community in making this effort to extend the productive, as distinct from the unproductive, activity of our economy very largely.  I thank the Deputies concerned for their co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Since Question Nos. 5, 6 and 7 relate to <Col N="357" /> aspects of the same problem, I propose to take them together.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputies that Garda statistics for 1984 show that there was a decrease of 2.6 per cent in the number of indictable offences recorded for the whole country over 1983 and that there was a reduction in the recorded crime in the Dublin Metropolitan area of some 4.8 per cent.  In drawing attention to these figures, however, I am not to be taken as implying that the problem is not still a serious one, nor would I wish to minimise the concern which I know exists throughout the community about it; but I think it is important to point out that the assumption underlying Question No. 5 is not correct.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is reasonable that I should be expected to make policy statements &mdash; which would necessarily have to be comprehensive in relation to what is essentially a complex matter &mdash; in response to parliamentary questions, all the more so since I dealt very fully with the measures I am taking to deal with crime in replying to a motion on the matter in this House on 20 March 1985. However, I cannot accept the implication contained in Question Nos. 5 and 7 that the Garda Síochána are not reasonably supplied with modern equipments or that there is any inadequacy in the technological capability of the force that is not currently being dealt with.  I dealt with this matter specifically and also with the question of manpower in the context of the motion I have already referred to and I would invite the Deputies' attention to what I said then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to attacks on the elderly, I dealt in some detail with the measures being taken by the Garda Síochána to deal with this problem so far as it relates to attacks on the homes of elderly people living in rural areas in the written reply which I gave on 12 March last to a Private Notice Question.  That reply is in column 1995 of the Official Report for 12 March 1985.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been a considerable decrease in the incidence of attacks on elderly persons in recent months.  A number of persons have been changed in <Col N="358" /> relation to these attacks and the Garda are still pursuing a number of inquiries which it is hoped will lead to further charges and bring more of the persons concerned to Justice.</P>
    <P>With regard to crimes such as household burglaries and vandalism, the Government have, as I recently announced, allocated funds for the promotion of the neighbourhood watch scheme which is a scheme principally aimed at the prevention of these types of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accepting that the Minister has taken some steps in this regard I should like to ask him if he accepts that the moves to date have not been very successful and that a new approach is needed.  In one area in my constituency there were 50 break-ins in a housing estate of 100 houses and in view of that I should like to ask the Minister if he will accept that the steps taken to date have not worked?  Will he accept that the difficulty persists on our streets and that he, as Minister for Justice, will have to try harder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I believe that the measures being taken are working. We have a lower amount of serious crime here than in any other country in western Europe.  In Dublin we have a lower incidence of serious crime than in any comparable city in western Europe or North America.  There are two areas of particular concern, the unauthorised taking of vehicles, car stealing, and burglary and larceny.  Those areas are of great concern.  The measures taken on car stealing have been working very effectively.  In the first four months of this year, despite the public attention and the amount of publicity about the matter, the incidence of car stealing in the country as a whole was down by 20 per cent and in Dublin it was down by about 30 per cent. In the last three or four weeks there has not been any incident brought to my notice of the ramming of Garda cars. That, for the moment, is under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as the Deputy pointed out, there is one area of concern, the area of <Col N="359" /> larceny, the breaking into houses.  Certain houses are more vulnerable than others, houses where one might be likely to find consumer goods, where both spouses are working and the houses is empty during the day, or houses left unoccupied while people are on holidays for a number of weeks.  The new scheme of neighbourhood watch will be very effective in that regard.  We can do more to deal with larceny and burglary by concentrating on crime prevention rather than exclusively concentrating on crime detection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In my question I did not query the Minister on the efficacy of the equipment, technology or manpower but asked for extra equipment, technology and manpower, Can the Minister help in that regard?  Garda associations have been calling for extra equipment, technology and manpower and in view of that I should like to know if it is the Minister's intention to put more gardaí on the streets of Dublin city and county, give the Garda extra equipment and make more technology available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Government have decided that the strength of the force will be maintained at 11,400.  In the national plan the Government are committed to maintaining that number to 1987.  It is also the policy of the commissioner, with which I am fully in agreement, to deploy more gardaí in uniform on the streets.  He has been doing that.  The increase in the force from 1980-81 was about 700 and about 650 of that number were put on the beat in Dublin.  On the question of equipment, I believe that the type of equipment the Deputy has in mind is of a technological nature and, therefore, I do not think it is a separate question to ask about the technology.  A new national communications network is being provided for the Garda Síochána.  It has been installed in the Garda divisions outside Dublin.  It will be switched on nationally as soon as the appropriate checking out has taken place to ensure that the equipment is fully <Col N="360" /> satisfactory and that we are not accepting liability for something that is not fully satisfactory.  That is in hand.  It will be dealt with in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the DMA Garda divisions is that I have signed, on behalf of the Government, a contract for £2 million to put a very modern radio equipment facility into the DMA.  There are also major improvements in computerisation in the Garda Síochána taking place.  In the last six months visual display units were installed in 18 divisional headquarters and some other major stations outside the DMA as well as in nine of the busiest stations in the DMA so as to provide direct links to the Garda Computer at headquarters in the depot.  Computerised Garda systems, for example, for criminal records, stolen vehicles and firearms records, are continuously under review and being improved so as to better serve the needs of the force.  Hand in hand with the development of major technological systems the force are being equipped with a wide range of miscellaneous equipment including specialised police equipment, office and training equipment.  Every effort is being made to provide new equipment where necessary to meet changing needs in crime prevention and detection techniques.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a new indoor firing range is now ready at the depot and will be in use within a week or two.  A site for a new outdoor firing range has been acquired and work is progressing. It should be in use at the end of the year. Quite an amount is happening and a lot of new equipment has been provided or is in the process of being provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the unprecendented high level of attacks on elderly people who live in isolated rural areas.  Is he aware of the anxiety in rural communities due to an apparent breakdown in law and order?  Is the Minister aware that some very violent attacks have been made on old people, in some cases resulting in death, and that in those attacks axes, iron bars and other items were used to gain access to premises? Is the Minister aware that the <Col N="361" /> Garda appear to be inadequately equipped to deal with the problem, particularly in rural areas?  It is alleged that they have faulty and antiquated radio equipment, that there is a shortage of squad cars in rural areas and that the closure of rural stations is a major factor in the increase in rural crime?  Will the Minister give an indication to the House of the extent of crime in rural areas?  Will he confirm that in the first three months of 1985, of the 65 or more serious crimes against elderly people less than five have been resolved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Obviously, the Deputy's question was tabled at a time when a big number of attacks on elderly people took place, particularly in the west.  Specific measures taken by the Garda Síochána to combat such attacks have been reasonably successful. There has been a major decrease in the incidence of attacks in recent months.  As the Deputy is aware, special Garda centres were set up in Roscommon and Sligo in December where staff from the technical bureau were co-ordinating investigations.  At that time there was a spate of attacks in the north-west.  Those centres proved successful and the level of attacks dropped significantly.  Arrangements were made with community groups such as Muintir na Tíre, the IFA and so on for special supervision of the homes of elderly people living alone.  Advice on precautionary measures is given on &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo;, in the local press and on community radio programmes.  When there was another spate of attacks in the spring time, similar units were put into other counties in the west and they proved successful.  The Garda say that the incidence of attacks has decreased very much in recent months.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that a number of arrests have been made and some people are due to appear before the courts.  I do not wish to say much more about that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have already dealt with the provision of radio equipment.  The new equipment will be switched on within a matter of days.  With regard to the Deputy's statement that rural Garda stations have been closed I should like to point out that no Garda station was closed since I became Minister. Indeed, no Garda station in rural Ireland was closed during the term of office of my three predecessors.  I understand that it is about 14 years since a Garda station was closed in rural Ireland. I ask the Deputy not to continue with suggestions that stations in rural Ireland are being closed.</P>
      <P>The provision of an adequate number of cars is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. There is a transport vote in the Garda Vote, which is a block vote.  He approves the purchase of whatever cars he thinks appropriate.  My information is that a lack of equipment is not a factor inhibiting the Garda in any way in dealing with attacks on the elderly.</P>

      <P>While, as the Minister said, it may be correct statistically that Garda stations in rural areas have not been closed, the manning levels have been drastically reduced and this has the <Col N="363" /> same effect as closing the stations.  I ask the Minister to comment on the infamous green box which has replaced the garda in the stations.  This equipment is no substitute for a member of the Garda Síochána. Has the Minister any plans to reestablish the traditional neighbourhood Garda patrols particularly in our towns? A contributory factor to the present deteriorating situation in urban areas is the fact that the Garda and the community no longer identify with each other.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is true that in our larger urban areas there has been a breakdown in the cohesiveness which existed traditionally in communities. Obviously if the cohesiveness of a community is looser than it was then the relationship between the community and the local gardaí will be looser as well.  I do The policy of the commissioner is to put the same gardaí on the same beat as weeks go by, so that they will build up a relationship with the local people.  Also, a number of community gardaí have been appointed in particular housing estates. That has proved very successful and a close relationship is being re-established between the Garda and the community. As well as having a good relationship between the individual citizen and the individual number of the force, it is important that there be a formalised relationship between communities and the Garda Síochána.  I hope the extension of the neighbourhood watch scheme, which formalises that relationship to prevent crime, will be very helpful and will restore the traditional relationship between the Garda and the communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No rural stations have been closed.  The transfer of gardaí and the development of the gardaí is a matter for the commissioner. I do not have figures available now for individual Garda stations, but I recently looked at figures for the divisions in the west where there was a problem, because attacks on the elderly.  There was no decrease in the number of gardaí in <Col N="364" /> any of the divisions along the west coast &mdash; as a matter of fact there was a marginal increase, less than ten.  The number of gardaí in Mayo, Sligo or Donegal was at least as high as it was in 1980.  It is not true to say that a large number of gardaí have been taken out of rural Ireland, because they have not.</P>

In 1983 substantially less than that was spent on overtime but in 1984 more than that was spent because we had two events &mdash; the European elections and the visit of President Reagan.  General elections and local elections account for a great deal of Garda overtime because the Garda have to man the polling booths until 10 p.m.  President Reagan's visit was a special event which will not be repeated this year.  We have tried to keep expenditure at approximately the same level for the past three or four years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9, together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the latest years for which statistics relating to accidents involving articulated lorries are available are 1982 and 1983.  The statistics published by An Foras Forbartha in <i>Road Accident Facts,</i> based on information obtained from the Garda, show that in 1982 there were 89 accidents involving injuries, 28 of which were fatal; and in 1983 the figure was 100, 16 of which were fatal.</P>
      <P>Statistics relating to prosecutions of drivers of such vehicles &mdash; whether in relation to failure to comply with safety or other road traffic requirements &mdash; are not recorded seperately and could only be compiled at the expense of diverting Garda manpower from other duties.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of whether articulated lorries are complying with safety, environmental and other statutory requirements, there are, as the Deputy may be aware, two main features to this matter.  There is a scheme under which annual tests are carried out on vehicles which are more than one year old.  This scheme was established pursuant to statutory regulations made by the Minister for the Environment and is administered by the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the local authorities.  Vehicles which pass the test are issued with a certificate of roadworthiness. As regards the role of the Garda Síochána, the Garda have the general duty of enforcing compliance with road traffic legislation and, in this context, have the power to demand production of roadworthiness certificates from vehicle users.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that enforcement work in this area receives as much attention as possible having regard to the many other demands made on Garda manpower and resources.</P>

In general, would the Minister accept my assertion that this problem, particularly in the new estates throughout the city, creates increasing difficulties?  When the Garda catch up with these people they find that they are dealing with people who cannot be called other than cowboys because they are not complying with the legislation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, in their Fourth General Report in 1981, the Law Reform Commission indicates that a draft working paper prepared by them on the subject of child abduction deals with legislation necessary for Ireland to become a party to The Hague Convention. In their Fifth Report of 1982 the commission stated that this draft working paper was before them.  The Sixth Report in 1983 did not refer to the matter, but I understand that it is being dealt with by the commission, that work on the draft report is being expedited and that we should have a report fairly shortly.</P>
      <P>The problem to which the Deputy has drawn the attention of the House is very real.  Children can be taken by one parent from one country to another, usually in defiance of a court order in the first country which has awarded custody of the child or children to the other parent.  It is a kind of legal kidnapping, child abduction. The problem arises from the fact that the court in this country assesses the case in the best interests of the child.  The return of the child, in accordance with the foreign order which was made, might not necessarily be, in the court's opinion, the best course for the child and the court will not then order the child's return.  We need to bring that into line.</P>

Do we have to await the commission's report in this area?  I do not see the necessity for this.  However, if this is necessary, it is desirable that the report be produced urgently.  There is a danger that this country might become a haven for people who wrongfully remove children either from care or from parents in other countries after lawful court orders have been made in relation to the custody of those children.  There is an absence of publicity, because all these cases are heard in private, creating the belief that an urgent problem does not exist.  The Law Reform Commission have been dealing with the matter since 1981 and could the Minister, through the <Col N="370" /> Attorney General's office, make urgent representations to them to complete their deliberations on this issue?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that Questions Nos. 12 to 17 are intended to include all cars taken without the owners' consent, even though in most cases this is not stealing in the legal sense.</P>
      <P>The total number of larcenies of cars in the whole country in 1980 was 515 of which 433 occured in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and 13 in Cork city.  The corresponding figures for 1983 were 1,094, 1,002 and five respectively.  Statistics for 1984 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The total number of unauthorised takings of mechanically propelled vehicles &mdash; a breakdown of the number of cars included in the figures for unauthorised takings of motor vehicles is not available &mdash; in the whole country in 1980 was 21,005, of which 16,172 occured in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and 1,428 in Cork city.  The corresponding figures for 1983 were 19,484, 15,071 and 863 respectively. In all cases classified as &ldquo;unauthorised takings&rdquo; the vehicles involved were recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already given details in a number of public statements of the measures being taken to curb this problem.  I will outline them briefly again.  A special Garda unit has been operating in the Dublin Metropolitan Area since 15 January last, with the sole objective of apprehending and deterring so-called joyriders.  This unit has been very successful in that some 700 persons have been <Col N="372" /> arrested and charged with the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles or similar offences.  Some 322 persons are actually in prison serving sentences for such offences.  Additional custodial accommodation has been provided at Spike Island and at Arbour Hill and Cork prison to ensure that car thieves and other criminals will serve the full sentences imposed on them by the courts.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of persons who have committed further offences when on bail, the position is that precise figures for the full period since 1 January 1985 are not available but of the 642 persons who were arrested for the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles and related offences between 15 January 1985 and 18 April 1985 &mdash; a period of some 13 weeks &mdash; about 20 per cent committed similar offences while on bail.  In this regard I have had discussions with the President of the District Court about the possibility of earlier hearings for persons involved in these offences, so that they will spend a shorter time on bail.  There is also provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, for the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>The number of &ldquo;unauthorised takings&rdquo; both in Dublin and in the country as a whole has now been significantly reduced due to the measures that have been taken and I expect a continuing improvement in this matter.  I think that there is now widespread and increasing recognition that the measures taken by the Garda have brought the problem under control and, accordingly, I do not think that the circumstances envisaged by Deputy Briscoe are likely to arise.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply which is extremely helpful.

In view of that level of car theft, by no stretch of the imagination can one claim that the matter is under control or even that substantial progress is being made.  I assert that the matter is not under <Col N="373" /> control when that number of cars is stolen every year.</P>

Have his Department had negotiations with car manufacturers regarding the installation of more sophisticated anti-theft devices that could be linked to the ignition?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have not got any more statistical information than I have already given about the situation in Cork.  The Garda state there has been a considerable decrease in the unauthorised taking of vehicles in Cork city in recent years.  With regard to the responsibility of motor manufacturers, what the Deputy has said is true.  I should like to see more sophisticated anti-theft devices installed in cars.  When we are in an age where cash dispensing machines outside banks can be activated by a plastic card, it cannot be beyond the expertise of car manufacturers to provide a simple but sophisticated anti-theft device.</P>

However, will the Minister not agree that we must have a system of imprisonment whereby joyriders and car thieves will serve their full <Col N="374" /> prison sentences? Can he assure the House that it is his intention to make sure that those convicted in our courts on these very serious charges will have to serve their sentences and that accommodation will be provided to ensure that they do so?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have dealt with the question of accommodation on previous occasions.  Up to last Friday and the three weeks prior to that we were accommodating 123 more people than we were in the previous weeks.  I have already given assurances that people who steal cars will serve their full sentences.  The Deputy probably has in mind publicity over the weekend which suggested that somebody who was serving a sentence for car stealing had been released prematurely.  That is so.  The case as presented to me was that the man was serving a sentence for the larceny of £14 worth of goods.  The fact that he had also been convicted for car stealing was not presented to me.  He was let out on a weekly release that was renewable but his release is not being renewed for the coming week.  He will be back in prison tonight.</P>

      <P>I did not have that particular incident in mind but now that the Minister has mentioned it, I wish to ask a question.  All I know about the case is what I read in the newspapers at the weekend.  It was implied in the newspaper reports that the case was misrepresented to the Minister by the Garda Síochána and the Minister in his statement now has confirmed this.  However, there is other information that this is not so and that the Garda Síochána were opposed to the release of this prisoner.  I do not have the background information and I had not intended to raise the matter but now that the Minister has brought the matter up it is important for the public that we clarify it.  I want the Minister to confirm that no request came from his Department for the release of this prisoner.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is correct.  No request came from my <Col N="375" /> Department.  The request came from a member of the Garda Síochána who deals with these matters.  It was presented as the case of a person who was in jail serving a sentence for the larceny of £14 worth of goods.  No personal approach was made to me whatever.  I dealt with it in a routine way.  I inquired if there was any question of cars being involved and I was told there was not.  That was the information presented to me.  As I have said, the man in question is going back into prison because the decision was made on the basis of incorrect information. I am not implying anything.  I think the Garda acted absolutely bonafide and that a genuine mistake was made.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The circumstances of the case came to my notice as Minister for Justice in the normal way. A file was presented to me by officials of my Department with a recommendation to release what appeared to be a petty offender for two reasons.  First, there was <Col N="376" /> a likelihood of the man being rehabilitated because if he got out of prison quickly he could return to his former employment &mdash; his employers had suggested this.  Secondly, it was on the basis that we still have overcrowded prisons. We let out petty offenders if they are outside the categories I indicated.  As the Deputy knows, car stealing is one of the restricted categories.  Subsequently the fact that a mistake was made came to my attention when a press query came to my Department on Thursday or Friday last.

      <P>When I spoke on this Bill last week I initially made the point that the Bill was welcome in that it contained a number of important positive aspects to bring about a change in both the law and social work or health board structures dealing with children at risk and in need of care.  In those welcome aspects of the Bill I would include the emphasis on providing family care for children who cannot be cared for in their own families to the extent that emphasis is placed on fosterage and the importance of fosterage as opposed to simply residential care. The onus is placed by the provisions of the Bill on health boards to cater for the welfare of all children in their area not only children at risk, which is welcome, as is the strengthening of the provisions for the making of place of safety orders and improved provisions for the making of care orders.  Again, in the context of fosterage, the specific recognition within the Bill of the role played by foster parents, of their need for greater legal protection, and the need for legal protection of the fosterage arrangement is welcome, as are the proposals for the regulation of day care services and residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had begun to say last week that there are many aspects of the Bill that I felt could be improved and that there are some anomalies created by its provisions. I shall also explain why I believe certain aspects of this legislation will not withstand a constitutional examination.  If we are truly committed to protecting the rights of all children, ensuring that their welfare is fully and properly protected, in the light of recent court decisions, in particular a recent decision of the Supreme Court, it now appears to me to <Col N="472" /> be urgent that we provide for a constitutional referendum to clearly set out the rights of children so as to ensure that where there is a conflict between the right of the child to have its welfare protected and the right of parents to have custody of their child, the right of the child to welfare and full development during childhood will take precedence over any parental right vested in parents under our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I had begun to make the point on Thursday last that there are difficulties with the Bill, some of which are no fault of the Minister as such, but derive from the fact that this Bill precedes the introduction in this House of any legislation on the status of children, on the whole anomalous area of illegitimacy and the legal discriminations that currently exist in respect of children who are labelled by our law as illegitimate.  I made the point that I believed it was unfortunate that we currently have merely a booklet for public discussion dealing with the whole problem of illegitimacy as opposed to a formal Bill which has received a First Reading in this House containing specific and detailed legislative proposals that we could debate on Second Stage here to place all children in a position of legal equality.  The booklet we have contains a draft Bill within it.  Nevertheless it is not a Bill yet that has come before this House.  I indicated that it creates an initial difficulty for the Minister in this Bill and will create a continuing difficulty that I shall trace in the course of the passage of this Bill in the context of whom this Bill defines as being a parent for the purpose of the legislation and who is not regarded as a parent.</P>
    <P>Because of the law still obtaining whereby children are regarded as illegitimate this Bill effectively, within its definitions section, excludes from the definition of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; the natural father of any illegitimate child.  That has important consequences later on in the general care provisions of the legislation.  In the context of the child who is currently labelled by our law as illegitimate one presumes the parental situation to be such that there is an unmarried mother living <Col N="473" /> alone, with a father somewhere, often having disappeared over distant horizons, or certainly not a father who participates in the regular, day-to-day, care of the child or who has taken part in any parental duty.</P>
    <P>I was making the point that there are a number of anomalies currently which will continue to be with us for some time and which this Bill has not yet taken into account.  We have many examples of couples whose marriages have broken down, having obtained either a foreign decree of divorce that we do not recognise, or Church decrees of annulment that we do not recognise, and then one or other spouse goes through a second ceremony of marriage which we equally do not recognise.  There are a number of such second households established between people who, to all outward appearances, are a married couple but because of the legally anomalous situation in which they find themselves, are regarded as two people residing together who are not married to each other.  In consequence any children born to them are regarded as illegitimate.  As a consequence also the father of those children is regarded as not being a parent having any relationship to them.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Bill excludes the natural father from the definition of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; has important consequences for the care provisions provided under the Bill.  If the view is taken by a health board that a child may be in need of care and may require either a care order, that could result in the child being placed with foster parents or would result in the child being placed in an institution.  Or if the view is simply taken that some form of supervision order should be made it would appear to me that the father, who would be a real parent, in any ordinary meaning of the term, to these children, would have no specific role to play in any court proceedings brought to have the children taken into care.  He would not need to be notified that such court proceedings had been brought; he would not be a party to the court proceedings, and he would not have any specific right, for example, to appear separately, legally <Col N="474" /> represented in such court proceedings if the situation had arisen whereby the relationship between himself and the mother of the child had collapsed.  Even though he may have lived with and loved his children for many years he could find himself effectively excluded from playing a role in a fundamental court hearing on the basis of which the child or children could be taken out of their home and placed in care.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that because we are still stuck in the anomalous situation in which we have the law relating to illegitimacy unchanged there is a need to provide amendments to the Bill to deal with the position of the person <i>in loco parentis,</i> the person who is effectively playing the role of a parent, who is not legally speaking a guardian and not legally speaking a parent, as defined in this Bill, but who is in real terms a parent of the child, so as to ensure that when a child is in the care of such parent that parent does have a role to play in ensuring the child's future welfare is properly protected and that that parent is not bypassed in any care proceedings or in any other interventions that may take place on the part of a health board.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have legislation dealing with the issue of illegitimate children before this House very early in the next Dáil session.  I also hope that there will be a considerable change in the legislation brought before this House from the approach evident in the document which has been circulated for public discussion. That document continues to preserve an anomaly whereby children are labelled as a result of their birth.  Children who in the nineteenth century were called bastards and this century were called illegitimate will have the new trendy title of nonmarital children in the year 2000.  They will still be labelled as different which is legally unnecessary.  It is unfortunate that the hoped for Bill could not precede this measure or run in tandem with it.  I hope we will produce legislation in that area in which the parental relationship will be based on the biological link between parent and child and not on whether the parents have or have not been through <Col N="475" /> ceremonies of marriage, a matter over which no child has any say at the time of conception or at the time of birth.  The provisions that are currently being circulated for discussion relating to illegitimate children or the absolute abolition of the concept of illegitimacy which I favour, will both run into a constitutional difficulty arising from a decision in a law case determined by the Supreme Court a year ago, which is reported in Volume 5 of the 1985 <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i> at page 86.  The case is entitled &ldquo;In the Goods of William Walker, Deceased&rdquo;. The constitutional issue arose for consideration as to whether it was unconstitutional to deprive an illegitimate child of the same succession rights as are given to a legitimate child.  The courts held that it was constitutionally permissible to deny an illegitimate child rights that we extend to the legitimate child because of the constitutional provisions relating to the family.  The argument was accepted in that case that such discriminations against illegitimate children were designed:</P>
    <P>To strengthen the protection of the family as required by the Constitution and for that purpose to place members of the family based upon marriage in a more favourable position than other persons in relation to succession to property....</P>
    <P>On page 98 of the same report the Supreme Court stated that:</P>
    <P>The provisions of Article 41 of the Constitution of Ireland create not merely a State interest but a State obligation to safeguard the family.</P>
    <P>The family in this case being the family based on marriage.  There is a judicial hint in that decision, despite a contrary view earlier being expressed by the Law Reform Commission, that legislation to equalise the rights of children could find itself, on current judicial interpretations, in conflict with the constitutional protection afforded to the family under Article 41.  That issue is a problem regardless of whether we deal with this area in the <Col N="476" /> manner suggested in the discussion document circulated by the Department of Justice in May or whether we deal with it in the manner in which I suggest, by abolishing all distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate children.</P>
    <P>I will be making the case in greater detail on this Bill that this Bill will require a constitutional amendment to ensure that it is constitutionally sound.  In making that case &mdash; and briefly adverting to the issue of illegitimate children and the departmental discussion document on the status of children &mdash; if we are to deal with the constitutional issue of children's rights we should deal with it in a comprehensive way and face up to the constitutional anomaly whereby it seems to be not merely sanctioned but possibly obligatory on current judicial interpretation to discriminate against children born outside of the conventional, legally recognised martial relationships and we should provide for a comprehensive constitutional amendment to protect the rights of all children.</P>
    <P>In pointing out the anomalies that arise under the definition of parent in this legislation I recognise that it is through no fault of the Minister.  The anomaly exists and it will continue to be with us; but in the context of this legislation, even on an interim basis, we will have to make some provision for a person <i>in loco parentis</i> being a party to care proceedings involving children.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly that arises from the definition of parent is that in some instances this Bill does include the natural father and relations as being a parent.  In one section the natural father is a parent and in another he is not.  In the context of the provisions relating to the regulation of day care services the natural father's position as a parent is recognised. In some parts of the Bill we acknowledge natural fathers and in other parts of the Bill we pretend they do not exist.  This arises from the anachronistic legislation which we currently have in relation to illegitimacy.  In the context of infant maintenance and the provision for a contribution to be made towards the support of children who, for example, are taken <Col N="477" /> into care, this Bill says that the father is not a parent.  Where a mother will have an entitlement to bring affiliation proceedings against a father, the health board will have no entitlement, where a child is taken into care, to seek a financial contribution from the father towards the expense involved in the care of that child. This is an anomaly created by the current anachronistic law in this area.  We should deal with this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in this Bill a positive duty is imposed on the health boards to promote the welfare of children. In Part III of the Bill, in section 23, it is referred to in detail to some extent. I would ask the Minister to have another look at the operation of this provision in the Bill.  The Minister's intent is welcome but the phraseology in which that section is couched is unnecessarily qualified and does not impose a sufficient obligation on health boards.  It does not impose an obligation that can be properly monitored. It does not ensure a uniformity of approach by all health boards in dealing with children.  The section states that:</P>
    <P>A health board shall, so far as practicable and subject to the provisions of this Act, promote the welfare of children in its area</P>
    <P>I am not sure why the words &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo; have to be included in the section.  It is an unnecessary qualification which means that, if a health board derogates from its duty to provide proper system of care or if it fails to take action promptly in a situation where a child may need care and protection, if it does not have sufficient procedures and properly trained and qualified social workers and if it does not properly monitor the families of children who are at risk, the health board, if the matter is investigated, can simply say that it was not practicable for them to look after the matter or deal with it promptly.  There is no necessity for not imposing on health boards a more positive and definitive obligation to promote and protect the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>In the context of the powers of the health board in relation to the provision of day care services, the Bill provides <Col N="478" /> that the health board may make available services for the care of children on a daily basis.  It is recognised by child care workers that day care facilities are an absolute necessity.  I do not see a reason that the position should be that one health board might provide such facilities and another might not do so.</P>
    <P>One problem in the context of child care in recent years has been the lack of a uniform duty imposed on our health boards to provide comprehensive and equal services within the health board areas for the protection of children.  We are all aware that the services provided by the Western Health Board differ substantially from those provided by the Southern Health Board which again differ from those provided by the Eastern Health Board.  There is an absolute need for uniformity of approach and provision for minimum standards ensuring that, operating as a child care authority, each health board continues properly to perform its function.  Whilst there is a need for some autonomy in what they are doing, nevertheless, there is a need to ensure that minimum standards are observed.  The difficulty seems to be that up to now the Department of Health have no statutory ability to lay down uniform and minimum standards; and if something goes wrong, as the law stands at the moment, no health board can be held necessarily directly responsible.  Whereas the Minister's intentions in this Bill are desirable, the phraseology of the provisions relating to children in this context are woolly and need to be set down in a far more definite way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in relation to place of safety orders.  Place of safety orders are not new.  Under the 1908 legislation, which we are changing, there was provision in relation to place or safety orders for the protection of children in need of protection.  This legislation before us is seeking to up-date that provision in a way to ensure that children can be taken to a place of safety when that is necessary.  A number of things concern me in a general way about the provision relating to place of safety orders.  Firstly, it appears that the gardaí <Col N="479" /> primarily are now to take children to a place of safety.  It will not normally be a garda who will be directly involved in monitoring families where children are at risk.  More often it will be social workers attached to a health board or a community care team and occasionally social workers attached to a voluntary agency.  As the current law stands, there is a facility for a third party to seek orders for the protection of children; and in the context of social workers attached formally to health boards obliged to provide for the care of children, the facility for taking a child to a place of safety and the power to do so should be formally extended to social workers attached to health boards acting as a child care authority.</P>
    <P>The social worker should not have to go looking for a garda to take a child to a place of safety.  Social workers cannot be guaranteed that if they do they will necessarily have a member of the Garda available to them in time or that they will always necessarily receive from the Garda the co-operation they require, through no fault of the Garda but simply because the Garda are not trained to deal with this area and would regard it as outside their expertise and competence. In a very extreme situation, where a child is in danger of being murdered by a parent, a garda observing a child being physically assaulted would intervene and do something &mdash; and, of course, a garda can do that anyway &mdash; but in the context of a social worker's judgment that a child needs to be taken immediately to a place of safety, the social worker should have the power to do that.  That power should, as are the powers extended to the Garda under this legislation, be hedged in in a way that ensures that they cannot be abused and that any action taken is truly in the interest of the child's welfare so as to ensure that children are not wrongly removed from parental care.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's aim is, as I know it is, to protect the welfare of children, then the general phraseology of section 27 of this Bill, which deals with the circumstances in which a member of the Garda may without warrant take a child to a <Col N="480" /> place of safety, is not sufficiently spelled out.  Not only should a garda or, as I suggest, a social worker, have the power to take a child to a place of safety if it is required for the child's immediate safety, but also if the child's immediate welfare requires that it be taken to a place of safety.  The problem of talking simply about immediate safety is that it envisages a situation where a child is being physically assaulted.  The immediate welfare of a child may require that child also to be taken to a place of safety in circumstances where parental abuse falls far short of parental assault.  For example, a child is being taken care of by a parent who is continually drunk.  The parent is not assaulting the child, but the child's immediate welfare may require that that child be taken out of that environment.  I ask the Minister to look at that section again in a general way with a view to amending it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the general provisions for making place of safety orders, section 28 of the Bill provides that any child who is taken to a place of safety by a member of the Garda or any child who takes refuge in a place of safety may be detained there pending the making of an application to the courts for a place of safety order.  That should read &ldquo;shall be detained&rdquo;.  If the child is not detained in a place of safety where is the child to go? If an initial judgment is correct that a child needs to go to a place of safety, surely that child must be detained there until matters are investigated.  If it is merely that the child may or may not be kept in the place of safety, what is to happen?  Can the parents simply remove the child?  The legislation is designed to prevent that from happening, but that provision should be rephrased in a more definite way than at present.</P>
    <P>We must maintain a balance in all of this.  One of the problems in a neighbouring jurisdiction is that they have gone from one extreme to another.  Certainly England has gone in practice from an extreme whereby ten or 15 years ago social workers were most reluctant to take children into care.  After the tragedy of the Maria Cauldwell case in <Col N="481" /> England children were being taken into care in many situations when they should not have been taken into care.  It is necessary to find a balance and in finding that balance I take grave exception to the provision in section 28 (2) that, once a child is taken to a place of safety, a court application in relation to the future care of that child must be made not later than 72 hours after the child has been taken to a place of safety.  In that sort of timescale, three days, you simply cannot take a child out of a family's home and keep that child for three days before making some form of court application in which the parents can be involved.  Why if a child is taken to a place of safety cannot any application that may be necessary to establish the need to maintain that child in care, even for an interim period while assessments are carried out, be done within 24 hours or, at the very latest, within 48 hours? Where a child is removed from a family &mdash; and at some stage somebody may make a wrong judgment and remove children wrongfully &mdash; that would be not merely distressing to the parents, but it can be devastating for the child.  Technically if a wrong decision is made, it would seem to me that it should require access to the courts within 24 hours to obtain some initial court order to retain custody of the child.  The three day provision in this Bill, effectively on the judgment of a garda or a social worker without any judicial intervention, could be unconstitutional and in breach of parental rights. Indeed, it could be in breach of the child's rights where the power was exercised unnecessarily and there was no facility to apply to the courts.</P>
    <P>A problem could arise where a child was removed in that way without a legal requirement that there should be a court application within 24 hours.  Immediately upon the child's removal, if they sought legal advice the parents could head into the High Court on <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings and require that the child be returned to them.  I know this provision is well intended.  I am worried that the length of time provided for is too long.  I am concerned that it may not be <Col N="482" /> effective as an emergency protection in some instances and that, in other instances, it could actually do damage to the child as well as causing considerable distress to parents.</P>
    <P>In the context of place of safety orders, without going into it in detail because we will do that on Committee Stage, section 29 (2) (a) authorises a member of the Garda or an authorised officer of the health board, who presumably and in most instances would be a social worker, to search for a child who has been or is being assaulted or ill-treated.  That provision should be amended to provide for a search for a child who requires immediate care and protection.  As phrased, the section does not achieve what is required in sufficient detail.  I know what it is intended to achieve.  Under the same section it would seem to me that a person who knowingly conceals a child who has been made the subject of a place of safety order should be guilty of an offence.  I am not satisfied that as drafted the section deals fully with that.</P>
    <P>I want to deal at some length with the part of the Bill under the general heading of &ldquo;Care Proceedings&rdquo;.  The provisions relating to care proceedings seek to update the 1908 Act by extending in some instances the grounds on which a child can be taken into care and, at the same time, removing some grounds which have long since ceased to be relevant and bear no relationship to modern problems.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the constitutional issue I want to welcome the Minister's intent as displayed in the Bill to provide comprehensive and extensive provisions to enable care orders to be made in respect of children.  I welcome the fact that there is an emphasis on trying to provide as far as possible for a child to be kept within a family environment and, where it is believed that the child's welfare can be protected to provide for supervision of the child within a family by the making of supervision orders as opposed to the current position which is that the court either takes a child into care or it does not.  For many years social workers and lawyers working in the area of children's <Col N="483" /> law and child care legislation have pressed for legislation to provide a facility for the courts to make supervision orders so that children can be supervised within the home without the necessity to taking them formally into care by being placed in institutional care or placed with foster parents.  As a general principle, I welcome the powers granted to the courts to make supervision orders.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret &mdash; and at a later stage I will deal with this in more detail &mdash; the fact that supervision orders appear to be confined to the bringing of care proceedings as envisaged under the Bill. Whilst they provide an alternative mechanism whereby the courts can make a supervision order instead of taking a child into care, the legislation does not extend the application of supervision orders to other areas involving children where the courts need the power to make such orders and where they lack it at present. I am referring in particular to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Under the terms of that legislation, if there are disputes relating to the custody of children between parents whose marriage has broken down, the courts have one of two choices.  They can simply grant custody to the father or to the mother.  That is the extent of their choice.</P>
    <P>Many custody cases &mdash; I will not say they are the norm but they are not infrequent &mdash; have gone through our courts over the years in which I have little doubt the Judiciary have taken the view that neither parent was sufficiently adequate to be given sole custody of the child or children.  They have taken the view that the child might be better off with the mother than with the father, or with the father than with the mother.  There have been grave doubts as to the capacity of the parent awarded custody to care for the child unsupervised living alone with the child or a number of young children. Over the years there has been no interaction between legislation relating to child care and legislation dealing with custody disputes over children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> I ask the Minister to look at the power to make supervision orders with a view to extending to the courts who are determining proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, and specifically courts dealing with proceedings instituted under the Guardianship of Infants Act and making custody orders where it is deemed necessary in the interest of a child's welfare, the power to make a supervision order authorising a social worker in the child care area of the work of the health board to supervise the care of that child in the home.</P>
    <P>Obviously in the majority of custody disputes which come before our courts that sort of power will not have to be used and will be unnecessary.  I have very little doubt that many of the Judiciary would welcome that power being made available to them.  Due to the inadequacies of the current law, over the years some members of the Judiciary have on occasion cajoled and urged health boards when making custody orders &mdash; where social workers have been giving evidence in court proceedings, or where there have been reports from child psychiatrists attached to health boards &mdash; to have the child's care monitored by the health board, or that a child psychologist should continue to have an involvement with a particular family.  They have had no power to make court orders requiring any parent to co-operate in that, or to require the health board to co-operate in that.</P>
    <P>The powers in relation to the making of supervision orders should extend to all proceedings determined by the courts pursuant to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  Whereas in the vast majority of instances custody disputes relating to children under that legislation are concerned with married parents, in all instances they are not.  One of the fallacies in our existing law is the belief that natural fathers cannot currently apply to the courts for custody of their children.  Of course, they can, and they can get access to them under the 1964 Act.  Occasionally under that Act, courts disputes as to custody arise between a parent and third parties such as grandparents, or aunts and uncles, and previously foster parents. <Col N="485" /> Generally speaking, no matter in whose favour the courts make a custody order there should be a power under the 1964 Act, which could be extended to proceedings brought under that Act by this Bill, to make court supervision orders.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the general provisions for the making of supervision orders there are a number of points I have to make in relation to them.  My view is that the specific substantive provisions relating to supervision orders need to be clarified and to some extent, amended. The empowering provision effectively under the Bill dealing with supervision orders is section 35.  It provides for the making of supervision orders but it does it in a rather odd way.  It does not lay down exactly what a social worker or a health board are to do in the context of a child who is the subject matter of a supervision order.  If a supervision order is made does it mean that a social worker must pay a visit once a week, once a month or how frequently must a social worker pay a visit to the home in which the child is residing with its family?  It seems to me that there is a need for a specific uniform provision to be laid down as to how frequently, as a minimum, a health board or a social worker attached to a health board must visit a child who is subject to a supervision order.</P>
    <P>The second problem which arises is that when a supervision order is made it can apparently remain in force for a maximum period of 12 months only.  The Bill goes on to say that you can apply for a further supervision order.  If you get your initial supervision order you will require it because a child is in need of care and attention.  The child might be neglected, ill treated, assaulted or sexually abused. There could be a whole series of difficulties and problems placing a child at risk. Obviously, in the more extreme situations, in particular sexual abuse, one would anticipate that the child would be taken into care rather than a supervision order made.  If a supervision order is made I certainly suggest that an initial period of 12 months for the supervision order to operate is too short.  I would also make the point that if there is to be a <Col N="486" /> power to make further supervision orders it is essential that this Bill lay down the criteria upon which the courts will determine whether a further supervision order should be made.</P>
    <P>One can look at a parallel area which has created a problem where there is a similar time limit.  Currently, the District Court can grant a barring order excluding a husband who is battering his wife from the family home for a period of 12 months.  There is a facility for a wife, when the time limit is almost up, to apply to the courts to get a new barring order. If a wife makes that application at the moment the courts differ, district justices, individually and subjectively, differ, as to whether they will grant a new barring order.  If the husband has been barred for 12 months and during the period in which he was barred he has not again beaten his wife he will be automatically allowed go back into the family home by some district justices, even if the wife stands up in court and says &ldquo;I am terrified, I do not want him readmitted&rdquo;. If he comes back home and beats her up a few weeks later she can then reapply and get another barring order. Other district justices take the view that where an initial barring order was granted for a period of 12 months and the husband's behaviour was sufficiently serious to give rise to a genuine and grave fear for the future safety of wife or children, the wife who is still genuinely in fear at the end of the 12 month period should have her barring order renewed even if the husband has behaved himself during the 12 month period.</P>
    <P>We have a problem in the context of supervision orders in the sense that if a parent is inadequate and if a child or children are at risk and an initial supervision order is made a social worker might take the view that the supervision order is working to the extent of monitoring the position of the child or children in the family.  But the social worker may be of the view that at the end of the 12 month period she still wants to monitor what is happening, she still feels and believes the children in that family may be at risk.  If that social worker goes to court in what <Col N="487" /> circumstances will the court renew the supervision order?  If she says to the court &ldquo;Everything has gone well for 12 months, these children have not been battered&rdquo;, does that automatically mean the supervision order cannot be renewed?  If she says she believes the children may still be at risk but nothing has happened in the last 12 months, what credence will be given to that belief?  Will it be necessary in order to renew the supervision order to prove that six months after the first one was made one or other child of the family was again abused?</P>
    <P>There will be many instances where, for the protection of the child, a supervision order is made and where in the interests of that child's welfare the supervision order should be continued in force after 12 months.  The problem is that this Bill lays down no criteria on which any court is to determine the basis upon which a supervision order is to continue in existence. We must spell that out in greater detail in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another problem which arises in the context of supervision orders is in the provisions relating to an appeal.  If a child is genuinely at risk, it is felt that a supervision order should be made to protect that child and the supervision order will presumably involve social worker visits to the family, it is then open to a parent or parents of that child to appeal against the making of a supervision order.  It is correct that they should have that facility.  Section 35 (7) states:</P>
    <P>An appeal from a supervision order shall not stay the operation of the order, unless the court otherwise directs.</P>
    <P>To use non-legal language that means if the District Court makes a supervision order the lodging of an appeal should not postpone the coming into operation of the supervision order pending the hearing of the appeal unless the court decides it should postpone it.  The problem is that there is nothing laid down in the Bill indicating the basis upon which any district justice should make that decision. Presumably, a supervision order will not <Col N="488" /> be made unless it is believed a child is at risk.  It will not be made unless it is believed that it is in the interest of a child's welfare that there be regular visits to the family home to ensure that the child is not being abused, ill-treated or neglected.  It then goes on to say that even if one thinks a child is being abused, ill-treated or neglected and even if a supervision order is made, if the parents lodge an appeal, the coming into operation of the order can be postponed.  I do not want to be overdramatic but in 1981 two children in the Eastern Health Board area died as a result of parental battering in circumstances in which the health board should have taken them into care.  There was no excuse for either of them not being taken into care.  If power is conferred on district justices to stay the operation of an order this legislation should lay down the basis on which they exercise such judicial discretion.  If a supervision order is made and the parents appeal against it, in my view neither the District Court nor the Circuit Court should have power to stay the coming into effect of the District Court order pending the hearing of the appeal in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>If a child is in need of care or supervision a supervision order will be made. That need will subsist from the time of the hearing of the District Court case until the hearing of the appeal.  There is no rational basis for providing a power postponing the coming into effect of the supervision order.  Its operation for some weeks before the hearing of the Circuit Court appeal cannot unduly prejudice either the parents or the child because a supervision order does not involve the child being removed from the family home or the parents being deprived of the care, custody or guardianship of the child.  It requires them to submit to social worker visits organised through the health boards to ensure that a child believed to be at risk is being taken care of properly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at that section. I appreciate he has problems about this in the context of appeals.  However this aspect should be tightened up.  In relation to the power to make supervision <Col N="489" /> orders I do not understand portion of this legislation.  I do not understand the rationale behind it or what it can accomplish or how it can be enforced.  Section 35 (4) states:</P>
    <P>In addition to or instead of making a supervision order the court may &mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) order a parent or guardian of the child to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper care and guardianship over the child or</P>
    <P>(b) order any person convicted of an offence under the Second Schedule in respect of a child to be of good behaviour towards the child. </P>
    <P>It is the &ldquo;instead of&rdquo; portion of this section that concerns me.  Entering into a recognisance in legal parlance only means that somebody has to go under a bond to the court to pay out a sum of money or lodge money in court so that in the event of their not doing what they say they will do &mdash; in this case not exercising proper care or protection &mdash; they will suffer some financial penalty.  If a parent is abusing his or her child and there is belief that there is a need for a supervision order how requiring that parent to lodge a recognisance of, say, £100 can provide any guarantee that the child will not remain at risk and not be abused is something I do not understand.  There is no way of monitoring if the parent is complying with his promise.  The only way of knowing if the parent is not complying with his promise is if he or she seriously damages their child.  There would be no right of access to the family on the part of health boards because no supervision order would be made.  The recognisance would be lodged instead of making a supervision order.</P>
    <P>If someone commits one of the offences listed in the Second Schedule in respect of a child I do not understand the point of ordering a parent to be of good behaviour instead of making a supervision order when no one can supervise whether the parent was being of good behaviour or whether the child was being abused.  There is no guidance provided for the Judiciary as to the circumstances in which they should make a supervision <Col N="490" /> order as opposed to the circumstances in which they should give the parent a lecture and say they should behave themselves, or order a recognisance.</P>
    <P>Section 35 (4) should be deleted.  It does not add anything to the Bill.  It will leave social workers in a position where although they may believe that a child is in need of a supervision order they may not succeed in getting one.  There will be a lack of uniform application of child care legislation by the courts because each district justice will interpret that power in a different way.  We do not monitor the way these things are dealt with in the courts and as a result there will be no feedback to the Department, let alone the health boards as to the way in which that aspect of the legislation is applied. It could result in supervision orders not being made in cases where the professional judgment of the child psychiatrist or social worker would be that such an order should be made.  The reason it could result in varied judicial application is that different justices have different ideas about the sanctity of the home.  One justice might think a man's home was his castle and would only make a supervision order in extreme cases, whereas another justice might take a more flexible view.  I urge the Minister to remove the subsection. It adds uncertainty to the legislation and waters it down.  It provides an inbuilt mechanism that could result in children not being provided with the type of protection they need.</P>
    <P>In this legislation a child is defined as someone under the age of 15 years.  At age 14 years and 11½ months one is a child but when one is 15 years and one day old one becomes a young person.  This legislation prevents the courts from making a care order if such is necessary in respect of 15 or 16-year-old children. For example, there could be a family of three or four children the eldest of whom was 16 years old.  The health boards might be of the view that all four children should be taken into care but as a result of the way the legislation is framed a care order can only be made in respect of children under 15 years.  The 15 or 16-year-old child is left to his or her own devices to <Col N="491" /> protect himself or herself from parental abuse.  The task force on child care recommended that the age should be 17 years.  I ask the Minister to look at this and amend the legislation to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extended grounds provided in the legislation for the bringing of court proceedings.  I refer to section 33 (2) (b).  The Bill refers to care proceedings as meaning proceedings for the making, variation or discharge of a care order, a supervision order or an interim care order, and states in subsection (2):</P>
    <P>A child may be the subject of care proceedings if any of the following conditions is satisfied with respect to him, namely that...</P>
    <P> (b) he is or has been under the care of a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship or has otherwise received or is receiving inadequate care such as to cause or to be likely to cause him physical or mental suffering or injury to his health or to impair substantially his proper development, or</P>
    <P>(c) his parent or guardian is not capable of exercising proper guardianship, or </P>
    <P>When dealing with the issue of children being taken into care, the Minister in his speech dealt specifically with his intentions and aspirations in relation to this area and what he saw as being the basic approach.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with what he sees as the basic approach but I see it as a major problem.  As they stand, subsections (2) (b) and (c) of section 33 will be open to serious constitutional challenge and will not stand up.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>That the child himself has rights is something that has received little emphasis in the past.  The third principle upon which the Bill is drafted is that children have natural rights and that these rights may, in certain cases, differ from and conflict with the rights <Col N="492" /> of their parents.  These rights arise from the democratic nature of the State and include the right to life itself, the right to preserve and defend (and to have preserved and defended) that life, the right to live at a proper human standard and the right to be reared and educated.  In cases of conflict between the rights of a child and those of his parents, the Bill seeks to ensure that the interests of the child will be treated as paramount.</P>
    <P>Subsections (b) and (c) to which I referred clearly illustrate the Minister's desire and intention &mdash; and what should be the intention on all sides of the House &mdash; to ensure that where there are cases of conflict between the rights of the child and those of his parents, the interests of the child will be paramount.</P>
    <P>The difficulty appears to be that, under the Constitution as currently judicially interpreted, the interests of the child cannot be paramount in those circumstances. The Minister is, to some extent, relying on paraphrasing of judicial statements made in various court proceedings relating to the care of children and those statements were made in proceedings brought under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  The first problem, which is not of a constitutional nature, is that while laying down the various criteria under which a child can be taken into care, there is not the necessary interaction between this legislation and the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  In particular, it does not indicate how the courts will cope with the provision in the 1964 Act which will clearly apply in unison with any provisions contained in this legislation.  Section 3 of the 1964 Act states:</P>
    <P>Where in any proceedings before any court the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant, or the administration of any property belonging to or held on trust for an infant, or the application of the income thereof, is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> Effectively, that legislation seeks to provide where there is a dispute regarding the custody or care of children, that the welfare of the child is to be regarded as the first and paramount consideration. In the light of a recent decision by the Supreme Court, the argument is no longer tenable, despite the Minister's optimistic statement that, where there is a conflict between the rights of parents and those of children, the child's rights will always prevail in the interests of the child's welfare.</P>
    <P>There has been much judicial debate in this regard over the years and in some of the court cases it has been said that the children have the right to have their welfare fully respected and that that right should have priority over parental rights. In other court cases, it has been suggested that section 3 of the 1964 Act is in itself unconstitutional in so far as it could require that the child's welfare be given precedence over the constitutional rights of parents as articulated in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution which talk about the family having inalienable and imprescriptible rights and about parents having inalienable and imprescriptible rights in regard to the education of their children.</P>
    <P>Children, curiously, in Article 42 are referred to as having imprescriptible and natural rights and, as the courts appear to be interpreting the Constitution on this issue at present, they seem to regard the inalienable and imprescriptible rights as vesting in parents and the rights of children as something less important and less qualified for constitutional protection than the rights of parents in the context of a married couple.  Because of that, section 33 (2) (b) and (c) of the Bill is likely to be held to be unconstitutional on the basis of the most recent judicial constitutional pronouncements.  If we are serious about wanting to protect the rights of children, there is a necessity to bring before this House, as a matter of great urgency, because of recent judicial pronouncements, legislation to provide for the constitutional referendum to ensure the attainment of the aspirations expressed by the Minister, that where <Col N="494" /> there is a conflict between the rights of children and the rights of parents, the children's rights will prevail.  If we are to achieve that aspiration there is a need, as a matter of urgency, to bring legislation before this House for a constitutional referendum to clearly incorporate the Constitution and to amend Articles 41 and 42 to expressly provide that not only do parents have inalienable and imprescriptible rights but that children have similar rights and that where there is a conflict, the welfare of the child should prevail.  There should be no conflict of a political nature in that regard.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that because so many family law and custody cases relating to children take place behind closed doors and judgments receive no publicity, the general public and politicians are unaware of the difficulties in this area. We tend to presume that if there is a custody contest over children between parents and other relations or new relations such as foster parents or between parents and a health board, the courts will always make decisions on the basis of the child's welfare being paramount. It can now be categorically stated that that is not the case.  A recent decision of the Supreme Court clearly indicates the road our courts will travel in the foreseeable future in this area and it poses a serious threat to the welfare of children. In the absence of constitutional amendments, it is impossible for the Minister to achieve the aspiration laid down in his speech.  It also renders a portion of the subsection of section 33 liable to serious constitutional attack.  If we do not have the capacity to provide for a constitutional referendum to protect children in this area, it will be necessary for this legislation to be referred to the Supreme Court by the President, under Article 26 of the Constitution, for a pronouncement as to whether it accords with the Constitution before it is signed by him.</P>
    <P>My remarks in this area are specifically directed to section 33.  I want to illustrate in graphic terms what I am talking about and why this is a problem which legislators must face up to.  I do not want to open old sores but we had an unnecessary <Col N="495" /> constitutional referendum on the position of the unborn child.  We must now have a necessary constitutional referendum to protect the rights and welfare of children who are born and live in this State.  I want to be specific on this issue because all too often in this House we talk about our aspirations and what we want to achieve without being specific in what we are talking about.  What I am talking about in the context of the Supreme Court judgment is a case entitled MC and MC and KC and AC <i>v</i> An Bord Uchtála.  In the written judgments delivered by using the first letter of each person's name anonymity is preserved.  The case involved prospective adopters, natural parents, and An Bord Uchtála, the Adoption Board.  The decision by the Supreme Court was delivered in March 1985.  There was very little public comment about it as I do not believe the implications and importance of it are clearly understood.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is appropriate for me to make any comment as to whether the decision in the case was proper or not. That is not the point I am making.  Our courts are there to interpret law.  We all recognise in the area of constitutional law that there is a degree of subjectivity of approach in the way in which some aspects of our Constitution are interpreted. Our courts are independent of this House and that is correct.  When our Supreme Court makes a pronouncement on an area such as this it must be taken seriously and we must look at the effects of that pronouncement.  We must look at its effects in the overall context of the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>The judgment was a unanimous one delivered by a five man Supreme Court, with no dissenting judgment, on the issue of the rights of children and the rights of parents in a situation of conflict between a married couple seeking custody of their child against prospective adopters who had had custody for a lengthy period of time.  There were other complicated issues involved in the case which I will not comment on because I do not believe <Col N="496" /> it is necessary for us to involve ourselves in them.  However, I am specifically concerned about the manner in which the Supreme Court interpreted Articles 41 and 42 and the role the Supreme Court envisaged in the context of the protection of the rights of children.</P>
    <P>The court was dealing with section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, and talked about constitutional rights.  In dealing with those rights of children it laid down a number of principles.  It referred to the child who at the time the court decision was delivered was living with the couple with whom it had originally been placed for adoption but whom the courts had held, for legal reasons that are not of direct relevance, could not obtain an adoption order.  The court was dealing with the legal principles to be applied in determining the issue as to whether the child should remain in the care of the married couple with whom it was originally placed for adoption some two and a half years earlier or whether it should be returned to its natural parents. The judgment stated:</P>
    <P>1.  The infant being the child of married parents... has in addition to the rights of every child, which are provided for in the Constitution... rights under the Constitution...</P>
    <P> (a) to belong to a unit group possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent and superior to all positive law;</P>
    <P>(b) to protection by the State of the family to which it belongs;</P>
    <P>(c) to be educated by the family and to be provided by its parents with religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social education. </P>
    <P>The judgment went on to state:</P>
    <P>2.  The State can not supplant the role of the parents in providing for the infant the rights to be educated conferred on it by Article 42.1 except &ldquo;in exceptional cases&rdquo; arising from a failure for moral or physical reasons on the part of the parents to provide that education. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> In dealing with the 1964 Act the judgment stated:</P>
    <P>The Act of 1964 must, if possible, be given an interpretation consistent with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the nub of the judgment, because the rights of the children in this judgment are being interpreted not from the perspective of the child but on the basis of a presumption that the rights of children can only be constitutionally exercised if living with the family, meaning the married parents as opposed to any other third party.  The judgment went on to state:</P>
    <P>In the case, therefore, as this case is, of a contest between the parents of a legitimate child, who with the child constitute a family, within the meaning of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, and persons other than the parents as to the custody of the child, it does not seem to me that section 3 of the Act of 1964 can be construed as meaning simply that the balance of welfare as defined in section 2 of the Act of 1964 must be the sole criterion for the determination by the Court of the issue as to the custody of the child or, to put the matter in another way, that it is a case as would be the situation in a contest between the parents of a legitimate child as to which of them should have general custody where the Court could or should determine the matter upon the basis of the preferred custody, having regard to the welfare of the child as defined in section 2 of the Act.</P>
    <P>That sounds complicated but, in essence, it boils down to the court holding that if there is a custody contest between parents and third parties with whom a child had been living for a number of years, or, to apply it to this legislation, if there is a custody contest between the parents and the health board who believe that a child's welfare requires that the child be taken into care, the court, in deciding whether the child should remain with the parents or should be placed in the care of a health board or should <Col N="498" /> remain with the people with whom it has been residing for two or three years, cannot constitutionally decide that issue solely on the basis of what course of action is in the interests of the child's welfare.  If the courts were to do that, the view of the Supreme Court is that it would be unconstitutional.  In effect the child's welfare is placed in a constitutionally inferior position to the right of parents to have custody of their children and to the right of parents to educate their children.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice, in delivering judgment in this case, went on very categorically to confirm that that is the legal position.  Section 3 of the 1964 Act states that in any issue relating to the custody, guardianship or upbringing of children the court shall regard the welfare of the children as the first and paramount consideration. The Chief Justice went on to say that he would accept the contention that section 3 of the 1964 Act must be construed as...</P>
    <P>involving a constitutional presumption that the welfare of the child... is to be found within the family unless the Court is satisfied on the evidence that there are compelling reasons why this can not be achieved or unless the Court is satisfied that the evidence establishes an exceptional case where the parents have failed to provide education for the child and to continue to fail to provide education for the child for moral or physical reasons.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the criteria of education can be applied in the context of a two year old child that a health board believes is at risk.  I do not know constitutionally what would be regarded as &ldquo;compelling reasons&rdquo; to require that a child be taken into care.  It is quite clear that this pronouncement of the Supreme Court states absolutely and conclusively that in interpreting the Constitution and applying it to existing children's legislation, that in determining issues of custody between parents and health boards, third parties or anybody else, it is not constitutionally permissible in the context of <Col N="499" /> legitimate children to regard the legitimate child's welfare as of paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice went on to deal specifically with this issue.  For some years there has been a debate going on between lawyers as to whether the courts would regard the welfare of a child as of paramount consideration in the context of such a conflict.  Following the decision of the Supreme Court in 1977 it appeared that the problem had been resolved and that the child's welfare could be regarded as paramount.  However, the Chief Justice went on to say:</P>
    <P>In <i>J. v. D. and Ors.,</i> unreported, Supreme Court 22 June 1977, the judgment of O'Higgins C.J. clearly indicates that he laid it down that a consideration of the welfare of the child, as defined in section 3 of the Act of 1964, was a sufficient reason to refuse custody to the father who was the sole surviving parent of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>That was a Supreme Court case in which the court appeared to lay down absolutely that the welfare principle is paramount. He goes on to say on page 15:</P>
    <P>In so far, however, as that judgment may be construed as clearly indicating that in the case of legitimate children, paramount consideration of their welfare as defined in the Act of 1964 can be applied as the sole test without regard to the provisions of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, I must, respectfully, refuse to follow it.</P>
    <P>This case did not involve a direct constitutional challenge to section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  The courts, however, interpreted section 3 of the 1964 Act in a way that would, I believe, diminish the concept of welfare of the child as the paramount consideration. What the court has done in that case is to make it quite clear that, unless there are compelling reasons for removing a child from parents, or unless the parents have failed for physical or moral reasons to properly educate their child, no legislation can constitutionally deprive <Col N="500" /> parents of legitimate children.  This creates an even greater constitutional anomaly because, as Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution do not apply to children born outside marriage and do not apply to parents of such children, it seems that within our legislation we afford greater protection to illegitimate than to legitimate children.</P>
    <P>There is a belief that if an illegitimate child is in need of care or protection, or if there is a contest about the care or custody of such child between a parent and third parties, be they foster parents or a health board, it seems there is no difficulty in the court making a decision on the basis of what is in the best interest of the child; but, if a legitimate child is the subject of such a conflict, the courts cannot apply a principle that the person with whom the child will be allowed reside should be determined on the basis of the tests relating to the welfare or the best interests of the child.  It seems the child's rights are subservient to the inalienable, inprescriptable and paramount rights of the parents.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the case in which this emerged.  I am not going to comment on what happened ultimately, but there were three different High Court judgments in addition to the Supreme Court judgment.  In the context of the High Court judgment relating to the custody issue the judge was dealing with the issue as to whether this child should remain with the prospective adopters or the natural parents after the child had been with the adopters for two and a half years, the child never having lived with his father or mother.  Dealing with that issue initially the High Court made an order allowing the &ldquo;adopters&rdquo; to retain the custody of the child and in doing so referred to the medical evidence given to the court.  In the High Court decision last autumn reference was made to the fact that evidence had been given by child psychiatrists.  On page 6 of the court judgment Mr. Justice Lynch, dealing with the issue as to whether the child should be transferred to its natural parents, said:</P>
    <P>&mdash;On that evidence which I accept I <Col N="501" /> am satisfied that there is an appreciable risk of long-term psychological harm to the child by such a transfer.  The evidence did not however indicate whether it is more or less probable that such long-term harm may occur but it did establish to my satisfaction that the risk of such harm is sufficiently approximate that considerable weight must be given to that risk in deciding these claims and counter-claims for custody of the child.  There would of course be an immediate upset for the child from which she would probably recover within a relatively short time but while not ignoring such short-term distress it is the risk of long-term detrimental effects that is more important to be taken into account in deciding the question of custody....</P>
    <P>The child is clearly bonded to the adopting parents and the boy&mdash;a son the adopting parents had&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;as though they were its own parents and brother respectively.  Any sundering of these relationships would cause considerable immediate suffering to the child and a real possibility, if not a probability, which it is impossible to say one way or the other, of long-term serious harm.</P>
    <P>The High Court was of the belief that the child would be caused long term serious harm.  The Supreme Court decided that the issue as to custody could not be decided on the basis of the child's welfare but that the parental rights under the Constitution had to be looked at and then remitted the case back to the High Court. The case was determined in the High Court on 25 May 1985, two weeks ago. The same judge was put in the position of applying the new judicial test laid down by the Supreme Court in March 1985.  In dealing with the issue this time the judge said:</P>
    <P>The evidence on the previous occasions and even more strongly on this occasion is that there will be a very considerable short term upset for the child and I accept that evidence.  The evidence of medium and longer term <Col N="502" /> psychological consequences is also even stronger on this occasion than on the previous occasions, although it remains subject to the reservation that it is predictive evidence and not certain evidence, and to some extent at least it depends on the quality of the parenting which the parents will be able to provide for the child.</P>
    <P>In other words, the judge was still of the view that the child could suffer considerable immediate distress and long term harm if custody of the child was transferred from the &ldquo;adopters&rdquo; to its natural parents at this stage, never having lived with its natural father or mother but having lived with the &ldquo;adopters&rdquo; for almost three years.  The same judge, applying the test articulated by the Supreme Court, transferred the custody of that child from the &ldquo;adopters&rdquo; to the natural parents whom the child did not know and with whom he had no relationship.</P>
    <P>I cannot comment on whether that was a correct decision.  I do not know if there will be an appeal and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it. That decision, however, clearly illustrates that we have moved out of the realm of academic arguments between family lawyers as to whether in determining issues relating to the care and custody of children it is constitutionally permissible to protect the child's right by regarding the welfare of the child as a paramount consideration.  The Supreme Court has clearly articulated that in a contest between the parents of a legitimate child and others <i>in loco parentis,</i> such as, foster parents, the welfare of the child, under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, cannot be the principal criterion on which the courts make the decision as to who should bring up the child.</P>
    <P>If section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, does not stand the constitutional test, I have no doubt that section 33 (2) (b) of this Bill will not withstand the constitutional challenge either.  If there is a belief that if a child remains with its parents it will substantially impair his proper development, <Col N="503" /> would that be regarded by the courts as a compelling reason to remove the child from its parents?  If the view was taken that the parents were not providing proper guardianship, would that withstand this constitutional test?  I do not believe it would.  Indeed, the Minister may have got an inkling that it would not. The concept of proper guardianship and the right to take a child into care when a parent is not providing the proper guardianship is still contained in the Children Act, 1908.  This is the concept upon which the health boards mainly rely at present in bringing care proceedings on behalf of children.</P>
    <P>I am aware of at least two cases in which that concept was relied on by a health board, which resulted in constitutional proceedings being issued to challenge the constitutionality of that provision under the Children Act of 1908. Neither of those cases ended up heard in the courts because there was a fear on the part of the lawyers acting for the health board that if the courts determined that issue, the 1908 Act would be found to be constitutionally infirm.  This would have resulted in the major substantive legislation contained in that Act, which allowed health boards to take children into care, being effectively removed. Both those cases were settled by agreement between parents and the health board through their lawyers, resulting in the children concerned taken into care being returned to the parents on the basis of the parents agreeing voluntarily to some sort of social worker supervision. There would thus be some guarantee of the two children involved in those proceedings of which I am aware being afforded some degree of protection.  The constitutional challenge was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I absolutely accept the commitment of this Government and of the Minister, their desire and aspiration to ensure that in cases of conflict between the rights of a child and those of the parents the interests of the child would be paramount. In the light of the recent decision in the Supreme Court, constitutionally <Col N="504" /> that is no longer possible.  Constitutionally, we in this House must face up to this issue.  Members of this House some years ago, without contention, on all sides of the House provided legislation to enable a constitutional referendum to be held to copperfasten the constitutional position of the Adoption Board in 1979.  The aspiration to protect the welfare of children is one which we all share.  If we do so, the Minister's Department should produce the necessary legislation for a constitutional referendum and I would be anxious that we do not bring about the situation that arose in regard to the rent restriction legislation and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill of 1983 which, again, we are debating today as the 1985 Bill.  We waited on the Supreme Court, by virtue of a presidential reference under Article 26, to pronounce something as unconstitutional. In one instance we then had the constitutional referendum and in the other we amended the legislation to fit ourselves into the constitutional framework.</P>
    <P>If we want to protect the welfare of children, we cannot fit the legislation within the constitutional restraints.  I have no doubt that the Minister has had advice from the Attorney General's office, but regardless of that advice, in the light of that recent judgment we cannot say that this aspect of the legislation is constitutionally sound.  There is now an urgent need to provide for full constitutional protection of children's rights because we can no longer rely on section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as a provision protecting, in all instances, the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>It is worth making the comment that the possibility of this problem arising is not unheralded.  There have been references to it in recent reports produced by various groups and voluntary organisations over the years.  Back in 1977, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in their second report dealing with the issue of children's rights under the Constitution set out the need to provide a constitutional amendment in this area.  At the time that report was produced the judgment in the Supreme Court in the case <i>J.</i><Col N="505" /><i>versus D.</i> to which I referred was delivered and it seemed that the problem was resolved.  It seems however that that is no longer the case.  I did not mean to labour the issue, but it is an important issue that we can no longer gloss over.</P>
    <P>If we are going to have a constitutional referendum to deal with the protection of children's rights&mdash;the protection of the welfare of all children &mdash; let us do it in the context of also placing all children in a position of legal equality.  Let us ensure that we deal with any possible constitutional infirmity in any legislation which may seek to place both legitimate and illegitimate children in a position of equality.  Let us provide a constitutional amendment which expressly states that all children have equal rights under the Constitution and that in the context of the rights of children, where conflict arises with parental rights, the paramount, first and most important interest and right is the welfare of the child.  If we can finally acknowledge that this is something which must be tackled as a result of the debates taking place on this Bill, we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>In relation to care proceedings, I welcome the new provision contained in section 37 which provides that where an application is made by a health board for a supervision or a care order, the court may make what is known as an interim court order.  In deciding whether to make an interim care order pending further assessments being carried out, subsection (4) of that section provides that the court &ldquo;shall have regard to any reports or recommendations furnished by the health board&rdquo;.  That is an important innovation. Pragmatically, the courts have on occasion used the existing legislation in a way which could be interpreted as providing an interim care order, but legislatively it had not been provided for and this is a welcome provision.  It will provide a degree of protection for children at risk.</P>
    <P>I am curious about an anomaly arising in the context, not of interim care orders but of supervision orders or of full care orders.  In the light of section 37, which provides that if an application is made for an interim care order, the court&mdash;again <Col N="506" /> unfortunately being the District Court&mdash; shall have regard to reports furnished by the health board, section 38 is a very curious provision.  In dealing with the conditions required for the making of supervision or care orders, it provides in subsection (2) that &ldquo;a health board shall compile and make available such reports and undertake such inquiries as will assist the court in reaching a decision in relation to proceedings under this Part&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, in relation to care proceedings.</P>
    <P>We say that the health board are under an obligation to provide the background report, presumably on the family, relating to the welfare of children to a court which will finally decide whether it should make a supervision or a care order.  If the court is asked to make an interim care order it must have regard to the health board reports, but there is no similar provision when a court deals with the final decision of whether a child is definitely going to be taken into care by way of a full care order or whether a supervision order is going to be made.  There is no obligation imposed on the district justice deciding a case to pay any regard to the report of the health board or the social worker.  The health board are under an obligation to produce such reports, but there is no duty on the district justice to take any notice of them.  Anyone with common sense would say that a district justice will take notice of what is in the report.  But will they?  I do not know.  The present reality is that because of the large number of different district justices and the absence of any specialist training in this area and because many are solicitors who never in their entire professional lifetime dealt with child care legislation and know very little about it very often decisions on child care matters are made on the basis of the individual background and subjective judgment of the district justice who is asked to make a decision. I ask the Minister specifically to provide that not only shall health boards compile and make available such reports but also provide a specific obligation that the court shall have regard to such reports in deciding whether to make full care <Col N="507" /> orders.  That obligation should not be confined simply to interim care orders.</P>
    <P>There are other issues that this legislation does not deal with in the context of such reports.  It is essential that a court should have maximum information available to it in determining whether a child should be taken into care and whether a supervision order should be made.  For example, in the case of a child who is sexually abused and who is taken into care, it may be that the court may make a place of safety order or an interim care order.  However, there is nothing in the legislation that authorises a health board to have a child who is believed to have been sexually abused medically examined. The parents, as guardians, could withhold consent from the health board to have the child so examined.  If there is reasonable belief that a child has been sexually abused, there should be a basic power given to the health board to have the child medically examined.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the rights of access of parents to reports that the health board must make available to the court, whether it be for an interim order or a final order.  Not only must we protect the rights of children but we must ensure that when a question arises of taking a child into care&mdash;a fundamental and traumatic event in the life of a family&mdash; parents must have the right to know what allegations are being made against them. They must have the right to know the nature of those allegations, an opportunity of refuting them and an opportunity to call evidence to contradict what might be alleged against them by a health board or a social worker.  They should never be placed in a position where a secret report is made available to a district justice or any other judicial official, on the basis of which a child is taken into care, without their having access to that report.  It is not stated in the Bill if parents will be given access to such reports.  Nowhere in the Bill is it stated that there is an obligation&mdash;as there should be&mdash;on a health board to furnish to a parent in advance of a court hearing basic information containing the allegations in relation <Col N="508" /> to the parent and their behaviour towards the child.</P>
    <P>Another area which has not been dealt with, although our courts have been trying to deal with it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, relates to the position in Irish law of a neighbour who genuinely believes a child is being abused and reports that fact to a health board.  A social worker records on the report the name of the neighbour, interviews that person and then follows up the complaint.  As things stand at the moment, could that neighbour be civilly sued for defamation if a genuine mistake is made?  If the neighbour genuinely believes the child was being abused and, with no feeling of malice, reports that fact and then it transpires at court proceedings that the neighbour made a genuine mistake, what is the position?  If reports are to be made available, as they should be, there must be some form of immunity from defamation proceedings not only to neighbours but also to medical personnel. The latter, as a result of attending a child within a family or in an out-patient department, may also believe that a child is being abused.  There is a need to incorporate in the legislation a protection against a possible civil suit for defamation against somebody bona fide reporting such a fear, while at the same time ensuring that a person who is deliberately malicious is not at liberty to raise doubts about the capacity of parents to care for children.  In a marital conflict, a parent &mdash;more often the wife and mother&mdash;is granted custody of the child and it is not unknown for the father, who may regard himself as having lost out in the custody battle over the child, to keep reporting the mother to the health board or to the ISPCC alleging that the child is being abused when that is not the case.  In those circumstances there is a need to find a balance between providing protection for the person who bona fide makes a report and providing a deterrent in the case of those who may wish to prosecute their wife because they have lost out in a custody case or to prosecute a husband who has succeeded in a custody contest.</P>
    <P>A health board bringing care proceedings does not always necessarily get <Col N="509" /> it right.  This point has been raised in many reports and also by the task force. In a sense they are trying to prove their allegations while the parents are trying to deny them.  When there is a custody conflict between parents, it is the position of each parent that is presented, not that of the child.  In Canada, America, England and in a number of other countries they have taken account of this.  There is provision for the appointment of a children's advocate by the courts in very difficult cases relating to the care and custody of children where the courts believe it is in the interest of the child that a separate legal advocate should deal with the question of a child's rights and protection where there is conflict between contesting parties.  I regret that this Bill does not deal with the question of a children's advocate.  I am not suggesting that in every child case that should be necessary; but there should be a power vested in the courts in a case of particular difficulty where a separate and totally independent view may be required.  That party could argue the child's welfare outside the vested interests of parents and, on occasion, of health board personnel who may be anxious to make their case so that they will not be seen to have made an error.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill about the position of parents who cannot afford legal representation when care proceedings are brought before the court. Theoretically speaking, such legal representation can now be sought through the Government law centres.  The law centres operate without a statutory base and have been proved to be inadequate and overworked. Child care proceedings are often emergency proceedings requiring immediate legal advice and help.  I am not convinced that the law centres &mdash; due to overwork and no other reason &mdash; can necessarily cope adequately with this type of area.  I believe there should be a specific provision in this legislation providing that parents who find themselves involved in child care proceedings, where there is an application brought by a health board to take children into care, and who do not have sufficient means to pay for <Col N="510" /> legal advice should have an absolute right of access to such advice and a right to be represented.  That is a very fundamental right.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the articulation of parental constitutional rights, one could raise certain constitutional issues in this area in a situation in which a child was taken out of a family home without parents having adequate financial means or opportunity to obtain legal assistance.</P>
    <P>Moving away from that area I want to make a brief reference to section 42.  It is a provision concerning what is described as the welfare and wishes of a child and says:</P>
    <P>A health board shall, so far as practicable and subject to the provisions of this Act, promote the welfare of children in its area.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why that is hedged around.  That should simply read: A health board shall promote the welfare of children in its area.  Let us place an absolute duty on health boards to perform a function in the context of children. Subsection (2) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the performance of this function, a health board shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family or where this is not possible to provide him with such care as is most appropriate to his needs; </P>
    <P>I want to sound one note of caution here which arises because of the fears I have resulting from the two instances of children dying in 1981, children whom I believe should have been taken into care. In England the child care system had developed in a way in which all too often it appears children are taken into care unnecessarily.  The philosophy there was not developed in a way that one seeks to ensure, in so far as is possible, that children will remain within the family with supports provided for the family.  I very much support the view that where a child can remain within the family it <Col N="511" /> should do so, that where any fears about the child being at risk can be resolved by the making of a supervision order, that should happen.  But there is a danger that in this country we are at the other end of the social work extreme approach. Whereas in the United Kingdom it can be argued that far too frequently and sometimes unnecessarily children are taken into care, in this country I believe we are too cautious and that far too frequently, on occasion, children remain within families at serious physical risk, in the context of their future welfare and development.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the performance of the Eastern Health Board and other health boards that there have been occasions when parents have been brought to the courts and prosecuted for not properly caring for the children when there has not been the necessary follow-up, swift response of having care proceedings brought in respect of the children or proper supervision given in relation to their upbringing.  I absolutely welcome the concept that we do not go overboard in taking children into care, that generally speaking the approach should be that they should be cared for within their own homes.  But we should be cautious that we do not adopt the approach that only in extreme cases of major physical danger will children be taken into care.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Minister's approach in the sections to which I referred earlier, where I worried about their constitutionality, that that is not the Minister's intent, that he intends to try to deal with the welfare of children.  But I am a little bit worried about how that will interact with section 42 (1) and (2).  I am concerned that it could result, in a number of instances in supervision orders being made because of the emphasis on this section when it is in the interests of a child that he or she be taken into care. In that context, of course, &ldquo;taking into care&rdquo; does not mean institutional care. The emphasis in this Bill is on the importance of foster care and that is something I particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> Again subsection (2) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>in so far as is practicable, before making a decision or taking action in relation to a child in its care, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about that as well.  If we are talking about a six, seven, eight or nine year old child I am not sure to what extent the wishes of that child can be implemented or should necessarily be considered.  For example, a ten or 11 year old child, a daughter, being sexually abused by a father, or a 13 year old daughter being sexually abused by a father might express a wish to remain in the care of her father.  What principle is the health board to apply to deal with that issue?  We are talking here of children under 15 years of age, about 14 year olds or under.  I am concerned about how that provision will be applied in practice. Because it is contained in the Bill and imposes a duty on health boards, in a sense, as opposed to the courts, I am concerned as to how the courts themselves might apply it by analogy in dealing with this area.</P>
    <P>Also in the context of care orders, section 45 (1) says:</P>
    <P>A health board shall carry out a review of the progress of each child in its care and of his family circumstances not later than six months after his reception into care and thereafter at such intervals as it sees fit or as may be prescribed.  Such review shall include consideration of alternatives to the maintenance of the child in such care.</P>
    <P>Basically it talks about reviews of placements in care.  Then subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>A health board shall carry out a review in like manner as is required by subsection (1) of each child in its area who is the subject of a supervision order.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is adequate either. <Col N="513" /> One of the problems we have encountered in the operation of the community care teams within individual health board areas is the varied approach adopted in reviewing the position of children at risk. We have encountered situations of an horrific nature, where social workers had ceased employment and new social workers have come on to the scene, where one child has been transferred from one social worker's work list to another where there has been an extraordinary lack of follow-up, a lack of review, a lack of care in ensuring that children who are at risk but who are not yet the subject of care orders are being properly monitored. I would take the view that, as an absolute minimum, there should be a statutory requirement on all health boards to review the position of children subject in particular to supervision orders every three months, that as an absolute minimum should apply to supervision orders.  In the context of care orders, where a child is in foster care or institutional care, I accept that if a child is taken into care it is unlikely that within two to three months the child would normally be returned to the parents.  It may be returned some time later when matters have resolved themselves and whatever difficulties the parents had have been sorted out.  But in the context of a supervision order a statutory requirement that a review should take place every six months is absolutely and completely inadequate.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in the context of these sections, the Minister, if he does not regard himself as having the power under this Bill, would provide himself with power to impose on all health boards a uniform code of practice and standards in the care and protection of children and in particular in the monitoring of children who are the subject of supervision orders and the subject of care orders.  It can very well be that children who are taken into care, due to a short term family problem, could be taken out of care far quicker with regular reviews and returned to parents than would happen if reviews were carried out at six monthly intervals only.  I would certainly take the view that <Col N="514" /> the reviews of children in care should take place far more often than is suggested here.  I would suggest that this provision of the Bill be amended to read three months as opposed to six months.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I am concerned arises under section 46, which talks about the removal of children from foster care or residential care.  I am concerned particularly here about the removal of a child from foster care.  We deal with other aspects of this further on. The Bill provides that where a health board are placed in charge of foster care, they may at any time request the person taking such care to return the child to the custody of the health board.  If this request is not complied with the health board may apply to the District Court.  I have had the experience in the area of adoption where social workers attached to both the health boards and the adoption societies, who are untrained in adoption matters, have in recent years adopted the practice that a child has been placed with adopters for a number of months and in some instances for two or three years and where the adoption process has not been completed, of dropping in on adopters announcing that they want the child back because the mother wanted it.  In one case about which I heard a week ago not only did the social workers behave in that way but announced to terrified adopters that if the child was not immediately returned to the health board the Garda would be called to remove the child and the adopters, unaware of their rights, handed back the child.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about cases of children and foster parents where absolute powers are conferred on the health boards or on social workers to simply remove the child from foster care.  I am not sure how it is envisaged that section 46 will work but it seems to create a situation where an application can be made by the health board to the District Court if the foster parent does not comply with the request by the health board and if they still do not comply with the request they will find themselves liable to criminal prosecution. A child living with foster parents for <Col N="515" /> three or four years would establish bonds and attachments with its foster parents particularly if the child was placed at the age of one or two months.  A social worker not understanding the implications of what he is doing could go to the house of the foster parents and demand that the child be handed over, two or three years after the child had been placed.  It could equally be that the foster parents might form the view that it would be in the interest of the child's welfare that the child be handed over.  It seems that under this provision, if the foster parents refuse to return the child the social worker can apply to the court for a court order and if the foster parents still do not return the child, they are liable to criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>I would like someone to clarify the rights of the foster parents in the context of this section.  Will they be parties to proceedings brought under section 46? Will they have a right to appear before the court?  Will they have a right to be given reasons for the child's removal? Will the health board be required to furnish a detailed background report as to their intentions in relation to the child? In the context of this type of court application being made under section 46, what application will section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, have if we presume that it still exists statutorily, whatever about it being constitutionally suspect?  Will there be an issue of the welfare of the child to be determined &mdash; because there would be a contest not between parents with constitutional rights but between the health board on one side and foster parents on the other.</P>

      <P>I assure the Ceann Comhairle that I will conclude shortly.  I will not pin myself to a timescale but what I have to say will be a good deal shorter than what I have said to date.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for clarification as to how section 46 is to operate.  I am not satisfied that as it is currently drafted it deals adequately with the problem.  It can create major problems and it needs to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the maintenance sections of the Bill between sections 52 and 54, I will reiterate a comment I made during the opening stages of the debate. Under those sections because of the restrictive definition of parent a health board cannot require the father of an illegitimate child to contribute towards a child's maintenance if a child is in care. That is an anomaly that should be cleared up.  I wish to get rid of the concept of illegitimacy altogether, but when a child is in care there should be a power conferred on the health boards to require a contribution to be made by the father whether or not the child is illegitimate. An example is of an unmarried mother in receipt of affiliation payments from the father to take care of the child, who is not able to cope and who is in a situation in which unfortunately her behaviour is placing the child at risk and as a result the health board bring care proceedings and the child is taken into care and there would still continue to exist an affiliation order whereby the mother would be paid a sum of money towards the child's support while the child remained in the care <Col N="517" /> of the health board.  Under existing legislation once the mother ceases to care for the child the father of the child could apply to the courts to have the affiliation order terminated and the health board would not have power to seek support for the child from the father once the child was taken into care under this provision. I would ask that that be amended. It is only correct that there should be at least a power to seek such a payment in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are more fundamental problems in relation to the child care advisory committee referred to in this legislation.  For once I am in agreement with Deputy O'Hanlon in his contribution on this Bill. The provisions relating to the child care advisory committee are inadequate to meet the needs in this area.  They do not produce anything constructive or useful and they should be radically altered.  The legislation basically provides that a child care advisory committee shall be established by a health board and that the membership of that committee may include persons who are not members of the health board.  There should be child care advisory committees within each health board area and they should be independent of the health board.  They should have the function of monitoring the child care services provided by the health boards.  They should be required independent of the health board.  They to produce annual reports on the performance of the health board.  The reports should contain a lot of statistical information as well as information about the provision of services which are sadly lacking at the moment.  They should provide basic statistics as to how many children are in care in each health board area, the nature of health boards' involvement in court proceedings, the number of social workers available operating in community care teams concerned with children, the number of children in each health board area who are suspected of being at risk of non-accidental injury and so on. At present bits and pieces of information obtained through parliamentary questions are publicly available.  At the moment there is no coherent production <Col N="518" /> of information that gives us an opportunity to review the workings of the child care service.  These bodies should be independent of the health board but should have some health board personnel on them.  Voluntary organisations working in the area of child care should be represented in that composition to include members of such organisations as the ISPCC and Dr. Barnardo's, some of the consumers of child care services and representatives of bodies such as the Adoptive Parents' Associations and the Irish Foster Care Association.  They would all as individuals have a valid input to make in monitoring the child care service in each health board area and would perform a useful and independent function. I see no point in providing an advisory committee empowered by the health board who would wish to include personnel employed by the health board who would by virtue of that regard themselves as limited in expressing any criticism of the health board or in criticising services provided by the health board.</P>
    <P>What is envisaged here is inadequate. The concept is desirable, but it needs to be beefed up considerably.  Such a child care advisory committee within each health board area operating independently of the health board but with access to information on statistics, services etc., and with an input from some of the people at the receiving end of the health board services, would constitute a very good monitoring service, which does not exist at the moment.  We need more than that.  Other than the local committees we need a National Children's Council of the nature referred to in the report of the Task Force on Child Care Services at page 89, section 5.3, as follows:</P>
    <P>5.3.1 The Task Force has also discussed the merits of establishing an advisory committee on child care at national level.  The Kennedy Committee recommended that &ldquo;an independent advisory body with statutory powers should be set up at the earliest possible opportunity&rdquo; (Kennedy, 1970 paragraph 4.5).  It stated that the fundamental purpose of this body would <Col N="519" /> be to ensure that the highest standard of child care should be attained and constantly maintained.  The Committee also commented on the lack of research in this field in this country and it went on to suggest that &ldquo;if work in the area is to develop to meet the needs of child care, there should be continuous research&rdquo; (Kennedy 1970, paragraph 2.13).</P>
    <P>5.3.2. In conjunction with its decision to establish the Task Force in October 1974, the Government authorised the Minister for Health to set up in due course an advisory committee on the basis set out in the Kennedy Report.  In accordance with this decision and on the basis of our own consideration of the matter, <i>we recommend the immediate establishment of a National Children's Council.</i></P>
    <P>That was in the report submitted to the Minister in September 1980.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>5.3.3 Broadly echoing the recommendations of the Kennedy Committee, we suggest that the functions of the National Children's Council should be as follows:</P>
    <P> (a) To make recommendations on the development of the child care system, to concern itself with any areas of weakness which may appear during this development and to make recommendations for the eradication of those weaknesses;</P>
    <P>(b) To foster and encourage co-operation between the various bodies and persons engaged in different aspects of child care;</P>
    <P>(c) To promote research work in child care and to collect and disseminate knowledge in this field;</P>
    <P>(d) To create public awareness of development in the child care services.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>We should provide a council of this nature composed of individuals with specialist knowledge in this area to whom <Col N="520" /> child care advisory committees would furnish their reports so that the National Children's Council would be in a position to take an overall view of the child care services and their operation.  They would be a body independent of Government and required to issue an annual report; and, in the event of services falling down or legislation being inadequate, they would be in a position to highlight such problems and propose reforms.  Nobody in this country at present other than certain voluntary bodies such as CARE can hope to fulfil functions in this area. Nobody at present on a national level can monitor the operation of child care services.  Between the Department of Health, the health boards and representative Government the public and legislators are given whatever information suits the health boards and the Government to make publicly available.  Too much information is concealed.  I do not say it is deliberately concealed.  I am aware of the commitment of a number of people within the Department of Health and their concern about children and I am very much aware of the tremendous work being done on a personal level.  Nevertheless, we should have a national child care service which has a monitoring function, and this legislation does not provide for that.</P>
    <P>Part V of the legislation is another major problem area.  In the context of the making of custody orders and foster parents I welcome the intent of the legislation to provide the rights which do not exist at the moment.  There may be constitutional difficulties in the operation of Part V with relation to the custody rights of foster parents when they come into conflict with the custody rights of married parents of a legitimate child.  I have dealt with that earlier but it again arises in the context of the entirety of Part V.  There is no inkling in this Bill as to how this part of it is to operate <i>vis-à-vis</i> Part III of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964. No attempt is made to reconcile these additional powers with the provisions of that Act.  There is no indication of how we can operate Part V and what relevance Part V has to Part III of the 1964 <Col N="521" /> Act and rights of custody.  It is left to the judge in the courts to work out what principle would be appropriate in deciding a case.  The principles which should be applicable should not depend on which legislation parents or foster parents institute proceedings under.  The principle should be based on the child's welfare. There is a lack of clarity as to how interaction should take place between Part V and the Guardianship of Infants Act.</P>
    <P>In the provisions conferring rights on foster parents what is the effect of the 1964 Act, on the provisions of this Bill which provide for custody rights to be given to non-parents?  Where a foster parent has a child in his or her custody for approximately two years what is intended where there is a contest between parents and non-parents?  Can a case be made in favour of the foster parent where the child has been with the foster parent for less than two years?  What is the position of a testamentary guardian where one parent has died and the surviving natural parent wants the custody of the child? How is that to operate and interact with this Bill?  If custody proceedings are instituted within the two year period is some form of parental consent required?  The problems that arise under Part V have not been worked out.  There is no inkling in Part V of this Bill as to how it will interact with ward of court procedures. The Act preserves those procedures.  For example, if you do not succeed under Part V and you institute separate proceedings to have a child made a ward of court, what legal principles are the courts to apply?</P>
    <P>A whole series of problems arise many of which we will have to tease out on Committee Stage.  There is a whole series of problems in the operation of this section interacting with the Guardianship of Infants Act, with wards of court procedures and the requirement in some instances for parental consent before a custody order can be made.  In other instances there is a time limit, and two years must pass before orders can be made.  I understand the problem section 65 (1) is trying to deal with concerning restrictions on the <Col N="522" /> removal of a child from the custody of a person.  To whom does it extend?</P>
    <P>Will this criminal offence outlined in section 65 (1) apply between parents of a legitimate child where a custody order has been made in favour of the mother under the Guardianship of Infants Act and, three and a half years after that custody order was made, the father makes off with the child?  Will that be a criminal offence?  We must ensure that children are not kidnapped, but why the three year provision?  If a custody order is made in respect of a child by the High Court, or the District Court, or the Circuit Court, and a year or six months after the custody order was made one parent kidnaps the child, surely that should be a criminal offence in itself.  We have a major problem in this area.  The problem is that section 65 is viewed in the context of fosterage.  It appears to apply to other circumstances.  The drafters of this Bill have not worked out fully the other circumstances to which it has application.</P>
    <P>The final area I want to refer to arises under Part VI of the Bill and relates to court structures and court procedures.  I fundamentally oppose and object to this Bill providing that the District Court is apparently the court which will continue to deal with all matters relating to the care of children as outlined in this Bill. A litany of reports has been produced over the years setting out clearly the need to provide a specialist courts structure in this area.  I do not accept that there are major difficulties in providing a family court or, if we want to start off on an experimental basis, a uniform children's court to deal with the entirety of this area as something absolutely and completely separate from the District Courts structure. A whole series of reports has been produced over the years and a series of comments made on the inadequacies of the District Courts in dealing with these areas.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged here and elsewhere that there is a need to establish a specialist courts structure to deal with family proceedings.  There is an adequate precedent.  The Australian Family Law Act. 1975, established federal and state <Col N="523" /> family courts.  They deal with the qualifications to be a judge in such courts.  At present the only qualification necessary to be a district justice is to have been a qualified solicitor practising for ten years, which does not, of necessity, give you any great insight into children's law, or how to deal with it properly.  In Australia it is provided that, in addition to having legal qualifications, any such judge must by reason of training, experience and personality be suitable to deal with matters of family law.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Committee on Non-Accidental Injury to Children published in 1976&mdash;a committee set up by the Minister for Health of the day &mdash; it was specifically recommended that judges dealing with children should have some special training in the field of child care.  In the minority report produced by the task force on child care, recommendations were made for a specialist courts structure in this area.  For some reason the majority on that committee did not deal with this issue.  More recently we had the report of the review committee on adoption services.  Dealing with the area of adoption, that committee talked about the need for an adoption court and the possibility of such a court being extended and becoming a children's court and ultimately a family court to deal with all areas relating to children.</P>
    <P>I believe that in dealing with the issue that committee were wrong.  The suggestion of an adoption court as such arose due to feelings of frustration because of current inadequacies of the Adoption Board and the slowness of their practices and procedures.  The problem in the area of adoption arose because of the manner in which the board operate and because of the limitations on their powers and the manner in which they are staffed.  The problems of adoption and the Adoption Board can be resolved by statutory provisions. That is a separate area.  There is a great advantage in having an adoption board separate from the courts structure. This report seems to envisage providing an adoption court, which would make the <Col N="524" /> adoption process unnecessarily complicated and result in more legal difficulties in the adoption area than we currently have.</P>
    <P>The report however deals with the area of legal disputes such as the one I referred to in the constitutional issue I raised earlier where there are court contests between adopters and natural parents and difficulties arise in the adoption process or where there are other issues relating to the care of children.  In this context it proposes that a new type of court be established.  We should have a separate courts structure to deal with children's law.  The need for family courts was dealt with in great detail in the report of the marital committee.  I do not accept that we must pass children's legislation through this House in 1985 which fails to provide a specialist courts structure for children's cases and ultimately and more particularly for family courts to deal with this entire area.</P>
    <P>The aspirations expressed by the Minister in this Bill to protect the welfare of children, the talk about family proceedings or children's proceedings being conducted without undue formality, do not mean that the District Courts will be adequate.  They are completely and utterly inadequate in this area.  We have a form of justice administered in these courts in the area relating to children which lacks expertise and insight and will not be improved by extending <i>simpliciter</i> new powers to district justices.  We need a new type of court structure with specialist, formal welfare services attached to it, with proper back-up services, with a children's advocate forming part and parcel of it, and with specific provisions for specialist qualifications being necessary to adjudicate in a court of that nature.</P>
    <P>Over the years people have looked at various possible systems such as the one that exists in Scotland, and I am not necessarily in favour of that system.  It is a major error to enact legislation of this nature and not take the opportunity to provide a specialist courts structure.  I hope the Minister will consider that.  In principle I welcome the Bill.  I welcome <Col N="525" /> the Minister's openness of approach.  I hope he will regard the comments I made here this evening as constructive and helpful.  I hope he will consider introducing many amendments on Committee Stage to improve the legislation.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Children (Care and Protection) Bill has been awaited for 77 or 78 years.  We are now changing something which was enacted in the Westminister Parliament in 1908.  It was repealed and changed by the Westminister Parliament in the twenties.  We have not had insight, or commitment, or the desire to change it until now.  If we do not get this Bill right this time, if we do not deal comprehensively with all the problems which need to be dealt with, and if we do not make the commitment to the constitutional referendum which I believe is desirable, it may be another 77 or 78 years before we have another opportunity to do it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to be brief.  Like many other speakers, I welcome this Bill, although there are a certain number of inadequacies.  A lot of Deputies feel it has not gone far enough. I feel, it is a step in the right direction.  It is long past the time for presenting this Bill to the Oireachtas.  The present laws, as Deputy Shatter said, date back to Edwardian and Victorian times.  The world has changed much in the past 80 years and it is obvious that the whole structure of society and the family have altered significantly since then.  Many mothers go out to work and leave their children in day care centres, creches or even in the care of strangers.  It is obvious that these must be well regulated, especially with the scandals that have emanated in relation to child care particularly from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sexual abuse of children in the home and while in the care of others is on the increase.  It is estimated that one in six adult women were sexually abused or assaulted as children.  This has until lately been a taboo subject; yet many adults are walking around wounded, psychologically speaking, because of their experience as children&mdash;and because of <Col N="526" /> the inadequacy of statistics on deprived children or children at risk in Ireland we do not have a clear idea of the extent of the problem.  Approximately one million of the population are children, people under 17 years of age, and of these approximately 36 per cent are disadvantaged. They come from one parent families, low income families, badly housed families or some other deprivation.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Child Care Services, which published its final report in September 1980, recommended the establishment of a statutory body for each health board to be known as the child care authority.  As it often happens children in similar circumstances are dealt with by different agencies and in some cases by more than one agency, they were unable to discover the number of deprived children and children at risk. If we do not even know what the problem is how can we possibly deal with it?  The various services were initiated and developed piecemeal and this has led to gaps, overlapping and the present bizarre situation we have.  The task force attached particular importance to the services which can help families to cater for children in their own homes.  They recommended that professional home services be provided for families at risk. Obviously the number of children taken into care can be reduced by the provision of good family support services.  The provision of day care services by the health boards is obviously an important first step in this direction.  We would all welcome that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter dealt at length with the constitutionality of a number of sections. I am not a lawyer but I certainly have some problems particularly in relation to Part V, the granting of custody orders to foster parents.  This section grants legal custody to those bringing up a child and <i>ipso facto</i> removes it from its natural parents.  We all have great sympathy with the reasons stated for this section in that at present a child who has been placed by his parents in foster care or the care of a relative may be moved at any time regardless of how attached he has become to his foster parents.  It is obvious <Col N="527" /> that it is not in the best interests of the child to be arbitrarily removed from a stable home by people whose only relation with him may be a blood relationship.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Shatter and other speakers, I ask is this section constitutional? Article 41.1.1º seems to preclude the granting of a custody order, certainly when granted without the consent of the parents which may occur after a child has been three years with foster parents. Article 42.5 of the Constitution allows the taking of a child into care but it does not allow the granting of custody of the child to a third party.  I agree that the child's rights are paramount but I wonder about them overriding the rights of a parent.  Article 41.1.1º of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>Article 42.5 states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents of physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>Has the right of access to the child by his parents been given enough importance in this Bill?  It is only natural that a foster parent who has had continuous care of a child for more than three years and who has been granted custody of the child against the wishes of his natural parents might in some instances regard the visits of the natural parents as disruptive and attempt, and perhaps succeed, by applying to the District Court for a direction in curtailing these visits.</P>
    <P>It is obvious for the sake of the family, which is protected by our Constitution, and, more importantly, for the good of <Col N="528" /> the child that contact with his natural parents is imperative.  It is psychologically and extremely important for the child to feel that the parents who bore him love him no matter what the evidence to the contrary is.  I feel that self-esteem is probably one of the most important gifts we can bestow on a child.  If the natural parents refuse to give this consent to a custody order or, at a later date, wish to return to court to have the order revoked will they &mdash; Deputy Shatter touched on this &mdash; be eligible for legal aid if they do not have the means to pay for a solicitor themselves?  I note that the District Court will have jurisdiction.  This will reduce the expenses to some extent, but there are many families who cannot afford even that.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the report of the task force.  This report stated:</P>
    <P>There has been a strong tendency to rescue children from inadequate parents with consequent weakening or even severing of the bonds between child and parents even when the bonds were strong and should have been maintained in the child's interests.  We must never forget that a child can have emotional links even with the worst of parents and that these links may be of benefit to him emotionally.</P>
    <P>Part II, section 16, provides a welcome legal impetus to the present policy of placing children in foster homes instead of institutionalising them as at present.  I am sure everybody will agree with me that, no matter how good the institution is, there is no comparison between it and a normal home.  However, I am a little worried that there is not much emphasis on the need to keep a relationship going and maintain as much contact as possible with the natural parents.  This is for the good of the child, whose emotional and psychological development requires this.</P>
    <P>Registers of children at risk have been drawn up by the directors of community care.  I ask the Minister and his junior Minister are they being acted on or does the existence of the register lead to the feeling that something is being done to help the child whereas the only action <Col N="529" /> might be the placing of his name on a register?  With all due respects this is possibly the easy Irish solution &mdash; talking about a problem means that it is solved. It invariably does not.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part VII a prison sentence of three years and a fine not exceeding £3,000 is an inadequate sentence for the wilful assault or the ill-treatment of a child.  This is the maximum sentence and may cover such cases as infanticide and murder.  When one considers that allowing a child to engage in begging may lead to a fine of £800 and a prison sentence of six months, the other sentence seems totally inadequate.  Sentences have been increased drastically from the previous derisory ones, but they are still inadequate.</P>
    <P>Section 83 deals with solvent abuse.  In my home town of Waterford we have a significant problem in this area.  This section is very welcome but it does not go far enough.  A fine of £1,000, or 12 months imprisonment, for knowingly selling solvent-based products to children for sniffing purposes is totally inadequate. How will one prove that the vendor knowingly sold the solvent and was aware that it was to be used for glue sniffing?  It is fair to say that most shops voluntarily restrict the sale of such products to those over 18 years and perhaps the law should state this.  Having said that, solvent abuse, though a tragic problem in that it prevents a child from getting the most out of life and has on very rare occasions led to death, is self-limiting in that it is not a permanent addiction and children almost invariably outgrow it.  It is usually undertaken in response to peer pressure or taken by a group for kicks. The child who sniffs solvents has many other problems and in a lot of cases it is the symptom rather than the cause of their personality disorder.  This problem is a difficult one to deal with.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem in Waterford city with regard to glue sniffing and the Garda find that their hands are tied. There was an area of the town where there were glue sniffing parties every night and the Garda would raid them. The children would just run away and <Col N="530" /> when the Garda left, the party would start again in five minutes.  I have been in touch with the Garda about this on a number of occasions and they have suggested that their hands are tied. Hopefully when this Bill is enacted they will be in a position to seize these products. Unfortunately, the children will probably rapidly replace them with some other solvents which are obtainable in garages or tool sheds or they may transfer their allegiance to other products such as dry cleaning fluids.  They can get other solvents without too much difficulty.</P>
    <P>I would be critical of the media &mdash; not our own media in this instance &mdash; in relation to this.  Particularly in the British media there have been a number of sensational articles written detailing the different kinds of products which can be sniffed.  We will remember quite recently an incident where a British newspaper had a headline &ldquo;A High for 5p&rdquo; and underneath was a photo showing the various items children were sniffing.  This kind of attitude is unfortunate and can only be damaging to impressionable young children.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to see a section in this Bill dealing with under age drinking. Perhaps this will be dealt with in other Bills.  Our whole ethos militates against looking for a solution to this problem.  I saw a report recently, where a survey was carried out among girls in a convent secondary school in Dublin.  The girls were at intermediate certificate and leaving certificate stage &mdash; in other words, the majority of them would be between the ages of 15 and 17 years.  A substantial majority of these girls were drinking, mostly in public houses.  The teachers pointed out that the situation was no different from many other second level schools in Dublin now.  Why is there such reticence in the community in dealing with this problem?  Do we not know or care about the increasing number of teenage alcoholics?  Have we such a fixation about drug abuse that we have totally forgotten this very common and probably equally serious problem of alcohol abuse?  It is long past time that we insisted on some form of identity card with a <Col N="531" /> photograph attached for young people wishing to purchase alcohol.  When 15 to 17 years olds can say that they buy alcohol in public houses or off licences there is something wrong in our society and we must correct it.  Extremely stiff penalties would be necessary for anyone supplying alcohol to a person who is under age or for an under age person trying to procure alcohol.  These penalties should extend to anyone procuring alcohol for an under age person.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but wonder if it really goes far enough.  It does not go anywhere near including all the recommendations in the final report of the task force on child care services, but still I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill although I am disappointed that the Bills relating to children's rights are being introduced at three different stages.  At the same time, the overlapping that occurs when we talk about children in the home and in society leads to frustration in so far as we should like to address ourselves to problems such as Deputy Ormonde raised in regard to teenage under age drinking and the age of responsibility which was very pertinent in the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill.  While I am glad to debate this part of the Bill, I am aware that there are whole areas which impinge on it and we look forward to the introduction of the other Bills.  I note that the Minister said that he hoped to introduce a Bill on adoption at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also note that the Government are committed to the reform of the juvenile justice system which will be covered in a separate Bill.  We are talking about the protection of children's rights and we are also trying to protect the most vulnerable children in society.  Lamentably, as Deputy Ormonde said, a great number of children in the vulnerable section of society turn out to be victims in adult life also.  The system is always stacked against them and the deprivation of self esteem, which is so important in childhood, has a <Col N="532" /> terrible effect on them later on.  If children during their formative years are denied the love and care which they should get, the end results are horrendous. Their suffering leaves scars and they encounter many problems in adult life.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to abuse &mdash; particularly sexual abuse &mdash; of children which is only now being publicly discussed.  Deputy O'Hanlon made the point that those children suffered incredible trauma and guilt, that those who were the victims of incest often committed rape and that both men and women had a high level of drug addiction.  We cannot separate the traumatic and violent things that happen to children from the adults that they grow into.  The tragedy is that not alone are those children victims but that when they have children of their own they carry on the cycle of violence, deprivation and lack of relationship with their own children.  Therefore, when we talk about children, we are referring to society as a whole because the cycle is continued.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Shatter's speech was not brief, it gave a tremendous insight into many legal aspects.  Members of the House who do not have legal training must have learned a lot from his examples. From the lengthy explanation which Deputy Shatter gave in relation to decisions of the Supreme Court and the High Court, it is a matter of great concern that the recent case to which he referred indicated that this legislation might be at risk of being challenged constitutionally. We would all view with concern and anxiety a Constitution that seems to allow judgments to be made which would not place the welfare of the child as its first priority and which would even differentiate in regard to legitimate children as designated under Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution.  We could get into all sorts of difficulties in regard to the rights of legitimate children and the imprescriptible rights of parents over them.  Illegitimate children have been discriminated against down through the years in many areas but in this area they might have more protection in regard to staying with <Col N="533" /> their foster parents or those looking after them.</P>
    <P>While we recognise that the Constitution has been adequate, legally and technically, over the years, at the same time it contains certain Articles which seem to frustrate the very areas in which we are trying to work to bring about reform. Perhaps in 1987, 50 years after the Constitution was framed, we might look at it again to ensure that we can continue with reform instead of having constant referenda on various articles.  Perhaps we would end up with something less complicated like a Bill of Rights, which would not get us into legal and constitutional difficulties which occur at present every time we attempt to bring about much needed reform.</P>
    <P>The family, as we interpret it in the Constitution, seem to have a sacred and divine right and I do not think the rights of children were considered at any level. Of course, we recognise, ideally, that children should be brought up in a loving family with their parents who care for and cherish them.  Unfortunately, for many children this is not the reality and we should not be too preoccupied with the fact that children may be brought up in other circumstances as long as the care and love are there.  It worries me that in regard to children in care there seems to be an over-emphasis on the importance of children being cared for by the parents alone.  We know that there are vulnerable families and some parents, for different reasons, are not able to carry out the full responsibilities of rearing their families. In cases like that, we must take into account the greater good of the child and we should not agree that parents always have imprescriptible rights and that the welfare of the children is secondary.</P>
    <P>We will all be working to give support to the vulnerable families to enable them carry out their responsibilities in regard to the care of their children &mdash; socially and politically we have a lot to plan to enable them do that &mdash; but when the breakdown occurs we can see that it is not in the best interests of the child for this to continue.  Some people have been shy about putting children into care.  It <Col N="534" /> appears that we have inherited a type of Dickensian perception of the way children are treated.  In generations past children in care were woefully treated. Officials of the Department of Health who have been working on children's rights and carried out research into this area have given evidence of the type of institution that existed many years ago and the treatment meted out to children in care.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Health, and to Department and health board officials who have shown a great commitment to catering for the needs of children in institutions.  They have provided the resources to enable institutions to lose the harsher and more depriving aspects of child care that used prevail.  I am aware that in institutions children grow up in family type units.  We must never lose sight of the fact that modern institutions that care for children manage to give them the type of love and care and family relationship they need. The assessment of children is of supreme importance in care centres.  Children taken into care have been found to be behind their age group but by constant assessment and care in those centres they have caught up and reached the same standard as children outside.  That is an indication that if we use our resources properly and give the right protection and care to children they will benefit.  With the right care they overcome many of their problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that where children need to be taken into care the approach will be to provide them with the care they require in a family rather than an institutional setting.  I welcome the progress that has been made in that regard.  Positive results have been achieved. There has been a lot of talk about attempting to ensure that there is a constant review of children taken into care to ensure they are not kept in institutionalised care longer than necessary.  We need to look at the whole area of the family unit and the training of our social workers.  It appears that there is an over-emphasis on returning the child to the mother at all costs.  In some cases that is <Col N="535" /> to the disadvantage of the child.  We must ensure that we do not remove those children from skilled people too soon, even recognising that the ideal situation is a family.  We should not remove such children from those experts in order to ensure that the child is returned to the natural parent as soon as possible.  I am aware of cases where when that happened there were tragic results.  In the long term care, protection and security for the child are important.  To return a child to a parent, based on an over-emphasis of the need for a child to be with a parent, and later, following more violence and so on, putting that child back into care is not of benefit to the child.  That should be considered in the training of our social workers. We should not over-emphasis the natural bond of a mother-child relationship, especially if it will be to the detriment of the child.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate about the legal complications that may arise.  The Minister made reference to the drafting language used in the Bill.  Down the years that language has consistently been written using the male gender term.  In the Bill the only gender described is male. The parliamentary draftsman may say that this has been the tradition down the years but, bearing in mind that half of the children we are talking about are girls, I wonder if in legislation like this we should not say &ldquo;herself&rdquo;, &ldquo;her&rdquo; or &ldquo;he/she&rdquo;.  I have raised this before and it is a matter that should be considered in legislation that has an identity with the female gender.</P>
    <P>I share some of the anxieties expressed in regard to custody.  We must be very careful in that regard.  Deputies Shatter and Ormonde suggested that it might raise constitutional problems but we must also consider the human element involved. In the area of custody, of court cases and evidence given, every precaution should be taken to give priority to the relationships, particularly the bonding relationships, rather than the natural rights of parents.  I have known cases where, either for constitutional reasons or because emphasis was placed on the <Col N="536" /> rights of natural parents, very young children who have developed a very loving and secure relationship with people other than their natural parents have been wrested physically and violently removed from that loving bond which had been created in the formative years, and returned to the natural parents.  This decision was reached to fit the law rather than taking into consideration the damage which could be done to the child in the long term or in the short term.</P>
    <P>The ideal position would be the family unit.  I would like to see support for these children through child care facilities and support of vulnerable families.  We have failed lamentably to provide child care facilities.  In just a few years we have moved from a rural, almost agricultural based society, where children grew up among their grandparents, aunts and uncles as well as parents, brothers and sisters.  There was a sense of community in those families.  There did not exist a sense of paranoia we see today where it is said that children will not grow up properly unless all their time is spent only with their mothers.  I know that is not true.</P>
    <P>Because of the present economic circumstances today very often children are left with one parent during the day. Years ago children were not deprived because they were brought up in an extended family, with a group of relations, or perhaps even with people working in the area rather than by just one parent.  I want to put that on the record because that allegation has been made on numerous occasions, and I find it unacceptable; it is not even sustainable.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we have a great many single parent families.  Everybody recognises these people as being very vulnerable and among our most deprived families.  There is another group which is becoming the norm, where both parents are working. Rather than talk about an idyllic age where this did not happen, what we, as legislators, have to do is not only to keep in step with changes but, hopefully, anticipate them, because if we do not there <Col N="537" /> will be victims along the way, and the children will be the first to be caught.</P>
    <P>The many voluntary organisations which work for children and single parent families have pointed out the lack of child care facilities in Ireland and the urgent need for such a network.  The Minister said we should have some kind of standards and registration of the kind of child care we offer, but it is shocking that at present we do not have such standardisation and registration, particularly for children between the ages of two and five years of age.  It has been said that children learn between one half and two thirds of the learning they will acquire in their lifetime during that period.  After the age of five they acquire knowledge, but it is during their formative years that the real learning starts and these impressions stay with them for the rest of their lives.  That is why it is essential that we have the highest standards and give these children the best care possible in that short time. Unless we have standardisation and registration, there is no way we can guarantee that.  This lack has been a cause of great concern to the voluntary organisations who are interested in child care.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the report of the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents submitted to the Minister for Labour in March 1983.  They referred to the recommendations for child care facilities for all children regardless of whether the parents were working. They asked for regulations for day care services for children and suggested that a code of practice which would complement the legal framework should also be drawn up to include other desirable standards which day care facilities would be encouraged to adopt or to aspire to on a voluntary basis.  They also recommended that a national statutory child care authority should be established governing all areas of care, training and protection of children.  We cannot emphasise enough the need for this service.</P>
    <P>At present we do not have sufficient child care facilities; it is a fire brigade action.  If a person is wealthy enough and can afford to make choices, then there <Col N="538" /> are pre-school and creche facilities available; but if not&mdash;and here we are talking about those who are not among the privileged, that is single parent families who need to go out to work and low income families who need to go to work&mdash;there is no network of day care facilities available.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1972 the report of the Commission on the Status of Women recommended that no planning permission should be extended to a developer of either a local authority housing or a private housing development over a certain number of houses without such developer providing a building for créche and pre-school facilities.  The cost would be minimal, but can you imagine what it would have meant if we had implemented that recommendation some years ago?  It would have meant that, automatically, planning permission would depend upon that.  It would be an essential part of planning and development that an estate with more houses than, say, 40, 60 or 80 could not be built without such a facility being provided.  With a certain number of trained and professional staff, the voluntary help the community would give towards provision and sustaining of those pre-school and crêche facilities would be of inestimable value.  It would go far along the way the Minister wishes to go in the protection and security of children at that vulnerable age.  I ask the Government to reconsider that recommendation and to introduce it.</P>
    <P>We are not speaking outside the bounds of reality.  I am very aware, as is everybody else, of the resources and the investment needed for this proposal. That is one way of achieving the objective in a practical manner and with very little expense.  The Minister is committed to trying to reduce the high cost of our health and social welfare services, taking the services from the centralised institutional sphere into the community, and also using the input, energy and expertise of our voluntary organisations.  We are all being very realistic in wishing to use more effectively and efficiently our present resources for the benefit of our children.  The same applies to the support <Col N="539" /> of our vulnerable families to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I found of tremendous interest, and indeed optimism, a report brought out on behalf of the ISPCC on the Wexford family centre which centre was, in effect, an experiment.  The centre took families at risk and, with the help of voluntary organisations and a number of skilled people, they helped those families to the extent that the breakdown did not come with the removal of children and the parents being made to feel guilty. Surely that must be the whole thrust of this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill we are not speaking only of the protection of children but of support for parents, particularly those who did not get the opportunity to be adequate parents, as they would wish.  I am not ignoring the social factors that contribute to parents finding children removed from their care, through social stress, alcoholism, drug addiction and frustration expressing itself in violence towards the children &mdash; the more vulnerable people within the family.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the very impressive results obtained in that centre in the support of the families and the keeping of the children within their family unit.  In coming to their conclusions, the researchers into the operation of the centre highlighted as extremely important the provision of transport to and from the centre.  This would ensure the attendance of the children and their maximum benefit from the sessions.  There is no point in trying to set up centres for the care of children if we do not assist them to and from the centre.  That can be overlooked. The transport provided in Wexford ensured that the children all got the greatest amount of help.</P>
    <P>The centre concentrated on four aims: strengthening the family relationship, supporting and trying to help individual behaviour, giving care and training to the parents in the bringing up of their children and allowing the parents to look at their role as parents to see how they were succeeding.  They found that one of <Col N="540" /> the most common problems experienced by these families was a lack of self-esteem in the parents.  The social workers perceived an improvement in the physical care of the children in 12 out of 14 families. That is a very high success rate. The parents' role and performance had improved.  The mother's role and performance as perceived by the social workers improved in ten out of 14 of the families.  The other point made with great strength was that the family centre in Wexford was extremely successful in attracting and retaining a corps of volunteers to assist in carrying out a broad range of activities.  The consistency of the involvement of the volunteers was a notable factor in the development of the centre.</P>
    <P>This is the way in which the Minister wishes our resources to be used, by bringing this network of support into the community. The commitment that the voluntary organisations are prepared to give and the time they are prepared to spend is available as long as the structures are set up to allow them to come into play.  We should never overlook or cease to acknowledge this work.  We have made reference again and again to groups who got together and lobbied and who helped to support children.  Full acknowledgment must be paid to the voluntary organisations who have worked selflessly down through the years, with a great desire to do so.  The economic cost is not the only factor.  The resource of voluntary help can be called upon.</P>
    <P>The task force identified the four levels of planning and services for children as follows:</P>
    <P> 1. The child care services required to meet the needs of deprived children.</P>
    <P>2. Family support services required by some families, but especially by families under stress of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>3.  Social services required to see that children's needs are met.</P>
    <P>4.  Social planning required to <Col N="541" /> ensure that overall social objectives of Government policies are recognised and given adequate attention. </P>
    <P>There is one sentence in the report as follows:</P>
    <P>Thus, the cost to the State of keeping one child in residential care and one teenager in Loughan House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which was open at that stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>was greater than the entire cost of the ISPCC Family Centre in Wexford in 1981.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns (a) the failure of the Government in many instances to meet their statutory obligation to provide medical attention for persons in need of it; (b) the withdrawal of medical cards from persons who should be entitled to them; (c) the closing down of hospital wards; (d) the wasteful delay in opening Beaumont hospital; and (e) the general rundown of vital health and welfare services in every area.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came to power we have alerted the House on numerous occasions to the serious consequences that would arise from the policies they were pursuing in administering the health services. The Government chose to ignore the warning and now every health board is in crisis and people, particularly the less well off, are suffering a degree of hardship unknown in the country for the past 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not one health board was able to meet their financial commitments in 1984 and <Col N="542" /> the situation has deteriorated seriously during the current year, the direct result of the Minister's actions.  Every Member of this House, and particularly those who are members of health boards, are aware of the serious situation.  They know that it is the less well off, the elderly, the unemployed and the handicapped who are suffering most.  This is the result of actions of the Government who promised on coming into office &mdash; I will quote from their document, the Joint Programme for Government:</P>
    <P>In carrying through this programme of reform we shall ensure that the existing level and quality of health care will be maintained.  In particular, care must be taken to ensure that any adjustments do not militate against the less well off.</P>
    <P>Certainly the reverse has been the case because it is the less well off who have suffered.  There has been an unprecedented reduction in the level of services in acute hospitals, in long stay hospitals and particularly in community care services. The health boards are in a state of crisis.  They have done their best to provide health services within their reduced allocations.</P>
    <P>In his amendment the Minister says the Government have provided £1,071 million in the current year for health services but if inflation is taken into account the figure should have been £1,132 million. In other words, there has been a cutback of 5 ½ per cent in the allocation for health services since this Government came to office.  This is the cause of the problems.  It is the reason the health boards and the voluntary hospitals are in a state of crisis.  The Government have not given sufficient funding to ensure that these institutions can administer the health services as they should be administered.</P>
    <P>From reading an answer to a question I put to the Minister on 19 February 1985 it can be deduced that there has been a considerable reduction in the allocation to each health board.  The North Western Health Board have had a reduction in real terms of 6.7 per cent in the past <Col N="543" /> three years.  The Western Health Board suffered a reduction of 6.6 per cent, the Mid-Western Health Board a reduction of 5.9 per cent, the Midland Health Board a reduction of 5.6 per cent, the North Eastern Health Board a reduction of 5.1 per cent, the South Eastern Health Board a reduction of 4.7 per cent, the Southern Health Board a reduction of 1.6 per cent, and the Eastern Health Board a reduction in real terms of 1.2 per cent. When one takes into account the rapidly expanding population in the Eastern and the Southern Health Board areas, it is obvious that the reductions of 1.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent are not a true reflection of the real situation in those two health board areas.</P>
    <P>For the first time, the health boards this year were given an allocation to provide payment for the general medical services. They were informed that any excess in expenditure on the GMS would have to be met from their overall allocation. They were also told that if they saved anything they could use the savings elsewhere in administering the health services. However, there will not be a saving in the allocation for the GMS this year. In fact, each health board is in a serious situation as a result of having to fund the GMS.  Previously it was funded from central funds through the general payments board but this year the health boards are obliged to fund the service from the extra allocation given to them by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A week ago I submitted a question and today I received an answer.  Question No. 591 on today's Order Paper asked the Minister for Health &ldquo;the estimated overexpenditure on the GMS in each health board area in the current year; if it is intended to correct the deficit, and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;.  I received the following answer:</P>
    <P>The provision in Subhead G3 of the Health Estimate in respect of the expenses of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board is £93 million in the current year.  This represents a 7 per cent increase on the provision for <Col N="544" /> 1984, i.e. £86,681 million.  The provision was based mainly on an estimate of the numbers eligible for general medical services and on reasonable average levels of visiting and prescribing by general practitioners involved in the services.  I am concerned that the visiting and prescribing rates have shown an increase in the early months of this year, and unless the situation is corrected, problems may arise in funding the scheme.  The question of the measures which might appropriately be taken is at present under active consideration.</P>
    <P>The answer to my question explains many of the problems because I was able to find out that the estimated over-expenditure by the health boards is £8.04 million. In the North Eastern Health Board the projected deficit at this time is £1 million. The fact that it was not possible for the Department to give me that information is an indication that they are unaware of the problems facing the health boards. They do not appear to be in contact with the boards because I am sure they would have been only too willing to give the Department the information in view of the serious situation that exists.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the question was answered and the attitude and approach of the Minister to the health boards is probably a contributory factor to the very serious situation of the health boards. The expected deficit in the running of the general medical services will be over £8 million for 1985.  That leaves the health boards with three alternatives.  The first is to save money from other services, which is impossible in view of cutbacks, because all the other services in the health board areas are suffering as well. The second alternative is to allow the general medical services to collapse when the allocation for the current year has been spent.  It has been suggested to me that in certain health boards areas that could happen in the middle of November, that the health boards would not be in a position to pay either doctors or pharmacists for their services from the middle of November to the end of the year.  Their <Col N="545" /> third option is to curtail the level of service.  This appears to be the only practical option as a result of the new system of payments.  It would appear that this is what is happening in all the health board areas from the information I am receiving from my colleagues in this House and those on health boards.</P>
    <P>In a letter to the chief executive officers of the health boards of 30 April 1985 it was pointed out that there would be no increase in the allocation for general medical services in the current year irrespective of whether or not there was a deficit.  The letter detailed negotiations at present in progress with the medical practitioners and with the pharmaceutical industry.  The letter continues to say:</P>
    <P>In the short term, however, pending the outcome of these various negotiations, a significant contribution to cost containment can be made by health boards themselves through their control of the numbers covered by medical cards.</P>
    <P>That is telling the health boards to have a stricter interpretation, in other words, that people who would normally receive medical cards from the health boards will not now receive them.</P>
    <P>I might continue to quote the letter:</P>
    <P>Each additional person covered by a medical card will cost a health board nearly £80 a year on average.  The vigorous application of the guidelines for medical cards in accordance with the standardised procedures agreed in 1983, following the report of a working group established by the Department, would help to secure control of numbers. Applicants whose incomes exceed the guidelines should be issued with cards only where it is clear that hardship would otherwise arise.  Equally, control of numbers rests upon effective review procedures to ensure that cards do not continue to be held by those no longer eligible.  The issue of cards for the shortest realistic period and their review by the due date should <Col N="546" /> ensure a continuing turnover of partients within the medical card population. It may well be that this would produce a further significant reduction in the number of eligible patients and thus ease the problem of funding.</P>
    <P>We would all agree that medical cards should not be issued to persons who are not entitled to them for one reason or another.  Equally we would all agree that the CEO's throughout the health boards should decide on the guidelines from year to year.  I believe that the guidelines are too low and that they should take account of statutory deductions.  I gave an example in this House before of a man with four or five children who had a gross income of £145 and whose net pay after PRSI and tax were deducted amounted to £112 which left him ineligible for a medical card even though the £112 was well inside the guidelines for a married man with three or four children.  While we all accept that there has to be guidelines, what we are now saying is that the rigorous investigation, the manner in which this letter from the Minister's Department is being dealt with by the boards means that people who would normally receive a medical card will not now receive one.  We are concerned that there are many people, particularly those in greatest need&mdash;not necessarily those with the lowest income but those who are just outside the limit of the guidelines &mdash; who are not receiving medical cards because of the method of investigation, and who are not in a position to provide medical care for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in four of the eight health boards the number of medical cards has dropped considerably since the Minister came into office&mdash;the Midland, the Mid-Western, the North Western and the Western.  When one considers that we are in recessionary times, with massive unemployment and increasing redundancy, it is extraordinary that the number of people covered by medical cards has been reduced in any health board area.</P>
    <P>A rigorous investigation has been carried out.  Persons who are unemployed <Col N="547" /> have their income taken into account on the basis of their P60 for the previous year which does not always take account of their present income.  Redundancy money is taken into account in assessing eligibility &mdash; the small amount of redundancy money that a person would receive was not always taken into account, so that is something new.  Many people find themselves denied a service which they cannot reasonably be expected to afford because of insufficient funding by the present Government.  It is not the fault of the health boards because they were confronted with this situation.  They were told that in 1985 they would be responsible for financing the general medical services.  They were given an allocation and told they would have to finance the services from other sources if they had not sufficient funds in their allocation. As everybody knows, with the cutbacks, there is no other source within the health boards from which to find funding.</P>
    <P>There are over 80,000 persons on the waiting list for a dental service, over 40,000 of whom are children.  For example, there are 10,000 children on the waiting list in Kerry and 9,000 children on the waiting list in the Carlow-Kilkenny community care area.  This is an intolerable situation, to have young children needing fillings on a waiting list who, by the time they are seen by a dentist, will have to have teeth extracted.  How any Minister or indeed any Member on the Government side of the House could be satisfied with that level of service and could support the amendment submitted by the Minister is a mystery to me.  It is easy to quantify the dental service because the figures are there in terms of the waiting lists.  There is also the fact that the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme has been abolished in practically every community care area, which is an indication of the serious situation obtaining.  There are community care areas where children only will receive treatment: adults will not receive treatment, except expectant mothers and handicapped persons.  The reality is that those only &mdash; irrespective of their income, whether they have a <Col N="548" /> medical card, a pension, a supplementary allowance or anything else &mdash; who can afford to pay for a service will receive it. There has been no public service available to many people since this Government came into office.</P>
    <P>The sight testing scheme has been abolished in many community care areas, which means there are now many persons in the community who are unable to make provision for dental service or sight testing. These people have no access to such services at present.  For example, a widow with two children with a medical card receiving £67 a week made representations to me about her 15 years old daughter who had a number of precarious top teeth in the front.  No service was available to those people because the relevant health board did not have the funding to provide the necessary dental service.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 500 beds due to be closed in coming months as a result of the cutbacks.  This is as a result of the directive from the Minister to the health boards requesting a reduction in the number of staff employed, overtime and locum cover. For example, in the kidney unit attached to the Meath and St. James's Hospitals all the beds for those services have been closed in St. James's Hospitals and 15 have been closed in the Meath.  The waiting list has gone from 148 in May 1984 to 275 in May 1985.  The waiting list has doubled in one year.  This has put tremendous pressure on the staff of the hospital and must create a risk for patients.  I quoted in this House a letter from a consultant in a kidney unit in this city in which he outlined the case of a young man bleeding from his kidney who could not be accommodated immediately because 40 beds were closed at that time and in which he stated that he hoped to get the man in as soon as possible.  That was a potentially very serious condition and because 40 beds were closed the surgeon could not accommodate him.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Southern Health Board in Cork yesterday when an allegation was made that patients prematurely discharged from the hospital had died as a result of being discharged too soon, the <Col N="549" /> chief executive officer pointed out that the board were being forced by the Department to leave unfilled two out of every three vacancies.</P>

      <P>On numerous occasions the Minister stated that there had been no redundancies in the health services, but many vacancies have been left unfilled and this amounts to the same thing.  In one hospital in this city a patient <Col N="550" /> waited 15 hours in the casualty department to gain admission.  There are currently 3,000 patients on the waiting list of that hospital for outpatient treatment.</P>
      <P>Recently, an eminent surgeon in Dublin found it necessary to write a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> pointing out the serious difficulties and delays in admitting emergencies and urgent cases to hospital. He stated that in one hospital on the same morning there were eight emergency patients lying in the casualty department with no available beds for their admission. These included a person with coronary thrombosis, a person with a fractured leg, a person with a head injury and a person suffering from urgent pneumonia, and all had been over 12 hours in the casualty waiting urgent admission.  It is only in the last two years that such a thing has ever happened.</P>

      <P>One of our largest psychiatric hospitals.  Our Lady's Hospital in Cork, begins a series of ward closures this week as a result of Government cutbacks. It is estimated that 12 wards out of 40 will be closed for the summer months.  In Galway in the Regional Hospital in Merlin Park 287 beds will be closed for the months of July and August, causing problems in terms of the waiting list for both in-patient attention and out-patient services.  In Limerick a renal dialysis unit has not been opened as a result of the cutbacks.  In St. Lurke's Hospital a new very advanced chemotherapy machine or a radiotherapy machine is not in use although it has been there since 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's record since coming to office has been of cutbacks.  There has not been development in the services. <Col N="551" /> The Minister wrote to our health board and wished to know what plans they had to close and dispose of the local hospital in Monaghan before he would sign the contract for the building of Cavan Hospital. The Minister closed the maternity unit in Bantry and promised the people that they would have an ante-natal outpatient service in Bantry, but that has not been provided yet, and the Minister knows that there will not be an ante-natal service in Bantry because consultants in Cork would not consider it in the best interests of the patients that a service be organised from 50 miles away.  Numerous wards have closed, two thirds of the vacancies have not been filled, weekend cover has been reduced and specialist units are being closed and some units are trying to operate a day hospital.  Most of the patients in these units come from the country, and it is totally ludicrous to have a patient coming from the country and having to return home and come back again in the morning when coming for any medium surgery.  The locum cover is causing problems particularly where consultants are necessary, for example in the psychiatric service.  If a consultant goes on holidays or goes sick there is nobody to replace him except perhaps a registrar or junior staff, and that is not acceptable.  Fianna Fáil are not opposed to a review of the costs of the health service.  We accept that a health service is an expensive service and we are in favour of greater efficiency in the service. The Government are not concerned with the problems they are creating for people.  They are totally insensitive to the needs of people.  They keep referring to figures such as percentages of GNP when they should be taking into account the <i>per capita</i> expenditure.  We have the second lowest <i>per capita</i> expenditure in Europe. Only Greece is lower than us.</P>
    <P>The Government must decide what kind of health service they wish to provide for people.  The joint programme for Government seems to have been thrown in the waste paper basket, as the Government have gone in the reverse direction. Instead of looking after the needs of the <Col N="552" /> less well off the Government have created a situation in which these people must find the money to provide essential services.  The Government must produce and implement a positive policy before the whole service collapses.  All over the country equipment and buildings are standing idle.  When I asked the Minister what buildings and equipment were vacant as a result of insufficient funding the answer I got was that the information sought was not collected by his Department on a routine basis and that I could get the information by addressing an appropriate inquiry to the chief executive officers of the health boards who were in a position to provide it.  This is an indictment of the Government and the Minister, that they are not sufficiently interested to know what is happening as a result of their policies.  A cat scanner that cost £631,000 is not in use in Galway. I understand that the health board in Galway yesterday accepted an offer of £100,000 from the Minister to open that unit even though that money was insufficient to open it.  They accepted the £100,000 and I suppose are thankful that a local election was coming up because they felt that it was as a result of the local election they were getting that offer from the Minister who up to now refused to give them any money.  For the mentally handicapped a number of buildings are lying idle, and the Minister's reply to me in the Dáil was that this was because of the current restrictions on recruitment in the public sector and the lack of development funds.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the Government's stated policy to develop the services for the mentally handicapped in <i>Building on Reality.</i> I have quoted from a letter to a consultant from a family doctor explaining that he could not take a patient who was in urgent need of care into a hospital because he did not have the accommodation. The usual procedure nowadays is that people have to wait longer for admission to hospital.  They must telephone the hospital regularly to see when a bed will be available from them.  This is all new. Does the Minister accept that the health boards are in a crisis, that they have a <Col N="553" /> deficit?  Last year, 1984, the health boards' combined deficit was £10 million. In 1985 obviously they will carry that £10 million and the deficit will be £20 million, and it was estimated in December that they would have a deficit of £17 million. The Minister had consultations with some of the health boards and reduced this figure, but that did not take into account the £8 million projected as a deficit that the GMS will cost.  The time has come for the Government to ask themselves what kind of health service they intend to provide for the people.  It is obvious that they have thrown their programme for Government in the waste paper basket.  They must produce and implement a positive policy before the whole service collapses.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his amendment is asking Dáil Éireann to commend him for providing a comprehensive health service. No Deputy in this House could commend the Government for the manner in which they have administered the health services.  The cutbacks have been savage and every health board and voluntary hospital are facing a financial crisis due to the massive reduction in funding by the Government.  The Minister also states in his amendment that the resources allocated to the health services are sufficient, which everyone knows they are not.  The Minister deplores what he calls the constant exploitation by the Opposition.  I am sure that the Minister has more information than I have on proceedings at the annual meeting of the ITGWU, and I wonder if he includes them in the Opposition in view of their positive call on their national executive &ldquo;to initiate a programme of activity aimed at ensuring that the Government restore the health services to a level where they will be capable of catering for the needs of the people&rdquo;.  From reading the debate of the ITGWU it is obvious that they share the concern that we in Fianna Fáil share and have expressed here over the last two years, and recognise the deterioration in the level and quality of health care that is being provided.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and Deputy O'Connell wants to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>The main aspect I would like to address has been dealt with already in depth by Deputy O'Hanlon.  That is the question of the health administration and services being reduced to the level of financial support that has occurred.  This has never happened before since the foundation of the State and it calls for the condemnation of a Minister, particularly a Labour Minister, who should be concerned from the point of view of principle with ensuring that services are maintained, enhanced and developed.  The whole essence of the health services development in Ireland over the years, with all Government's particularly Fianna Fáil Governments, has been looked at in a highly principled manner.  More than any other area of public administration, health is a caring and compassionate matter which goes to the heart of the Irish people's way of looking at matters.  It is part of the idea of looking after our neighbours that sends so many of our people abroad to do work in that regard. This Government for the first time have started to reverse that attitude, approach and idea and to go into a calculated bookkeeping decision to cut back drastically on health services.  It is also spelt out in their document <i>Building on Reality.</i> The reality is a miasma.  On page 136 of that document we read that over the next three years there is a reduction in real terms in regard to current expenditure on health.  That is not referring in any way to the capital aspects.  That is a naked book-keeping transaction approach to an area that requires a highly humanitarian, sensible and Christian approach such as characterised all Irish Governments and Minister of Health until the present Minister came in here as a Labour Minister, and totally contrary to the ideals and principles with which he should have been informed, proceeded to implement a totally conservative monetarist financial policy in regard to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> I and many people outside the House would say that the duty of a Labour Minister and of the type of administration that we have at present is to ensure that health above all else is one area where Labour policy and ideology and ordinary humanitarian decency should obtain in regard to expenditure.  We in Fianna Fáil over the years have always initiated and developed a caring and comprehensive approach to the administration of the health services.  If we start on a course of neglecting people who are in ill health, then we are on the road to a ruthless way of life and a type of society totally alien to Irish traditions, values and ideals.  I warn the Minister for Health in this respect. I speak from very practical knowledge from going around in recent weeks among people.  The degree of neglect of our people in health matters at the moment is an aspect of which we cannot be proud and in regard to which we must carry a degree of shame and the responsibility lies with the Minister.  At no level in the whole administration of medical and health services is the Minister held in anything but the highest degree of public odium and contempt, and not only from the recipients, the patients who are the important people.  They are saying that they cannot get their beds or their operations. They are suffering, they are dying. They are not getting the services they are entitled to.  It applies to the medical profession, the nursing profession, the people who administer our hospitals and right through all aspects of health administration.  There is public opprobrium in a very big way for a Government who does not appear to care.</P>
    <P>The planned Government expenditure in this document shows precisely what I am talking about.  As a Labour Minister for Health the Minister is associated with it and he will carry the opprobrium.  It is part of general Government policy which epitomises the essence of this Government's reactionary approach in an area in which the Irish people have always had the strongest feelings because of our respect for human life.  In this document we have epitomised the whole <Col N="556" /> essence of the monetarist approach of the Government which has been spelled out so well by Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>
    <P>I should like to give way to another person who is well versed in this area, Deputy O'Connell.  It is an area in which Fianna Fáil's reputation stands very high. It is a very shame-making episode in our political history to have a Labour Minister in charge of the most reactionary, negative and back-tracking period of medical development since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished at the gall of the Minister for Health in bringing in his amendment.  No one but a fool, or an imbecile or a naive man would bring in such an amendment.  I was astonished to hear the Minister saying that they provided £1,071 million in comparison with the £895 million provided in 1982 by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister should do his homework and take into account the increase in inflation over those years.  This year the health services are short of over £106 million.  That is the state of affairs today.  Hospital beds are being closed.  There is a tightening up on medical cards.  The position has deteriorated so badly that we now refer to this Minister as the most hated man in the country.  He is the most despised man by virtue of the fact that he takes sadistic pleasure in everything he seems to be doing.  He has made enemies of the medical profession, the nursing profession and the para-medical profession because of the sadistic pleasure he has taken with regard to closures, cutbacks and delays in hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally I might find some justification for what the Minister is doing.  I can only attribute what the Minister is doing today to weakness at the Cabinet table. He is not able to ensure that the necessary finance is available.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, people are in a very serious condition.  People need operations. People need medical help.  People need cancer therapy.  These people are being deprived.  It is a damning indictment for the Minister that he should tolerate this.  I can only attribute it to a <Col N="557" /> terrible weakness at the Cabinet table. He is not demanding more money for this essential and vital service.  He should consider his background, to consider the fact that he calls himself a socialist.  A pseudo socialist would be more appropriate because of the attitude he has adopted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert: &ldquo;commends the Minister for Health for continuing to provide comprehensive health services for all persons in need despite the severe overall limitations in Exchequer resources, notes that the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 provided £895 million for such services compared to £1,071 million provided by the Government in 1985, further commends the Minister for Health's repeated assurances that the current resources allocated to the health services are sufficient with effective management to ensure the delivery of essential health services to the community as a whole and deplores the constant exploitation by the Opposition of the fears and concerns of the sick, the elderly and the handicapped and their families about these services.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment speaks for itself.  It has been circulated to all Members of the House.  The Fianna Fáil Party constantly criticise the Government for having allegedly failed to provide sufficient funds to finance expenditure in the health services.  Yet the same party criticise the Government for not reducing public expenditure to the extent which they regard as necessary in the present difficult economic situation. These are totally opposite viewpoints, and yet they are both critical of Government policy.  May I ask Fianna Fáil what precise policy they wish to pursue in this social policy area?  Is it to provide more funds for the health services?  If that is so, where is the extra money to come from?  This motion is yet another example of the &ldquo;hurler on the ditch&rdquo; syndrome of the Opposition Party.</P>

      <P>I urge the public not to be deceived by this replay by the shroud wavers in opposition exploiting the elderly and the fears of the Irish people, exploiting the nursing profession and stirring up trouble in hospitals and health boards.  Health care needs money, and some deliverers of the health services, and particularly some members of the medical profession with a specialised interest, will indulge in any amount of scare-mongering to gain more money for themselves generally on the backs of the taxpayers.  It is Government policy to provide responsible control of public expenditure.  This means the establishment of cash limits for each of the public services, including the health services, taking into account the relative needs of each service.  In the share out of the 1985 resources available, the health services <Col N="559" /> got £1,014 million in grant terms for noncapital expenditure.  This sum will support a gross expenditure level of about £1,200 million compared with about £1,130 million taking account of income from various sources at estimate stage last year.</P>

As Minister for Health, I would have wished to see more and more money made available for better, improved and more developed services along the lines outlined in the Government's national plan.  I have no doubt that, in present economic circumstances, the amount of money we have received is sufficient to provide adequate services and with prudent management we can provide health services, and they will be provided if the Opposition will stop indulging in shroud waving and if people do the work they are employed to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that many people do not yet appreciate the significant growth that has taken place in expenditure on the health services over the last decade.  In 1973-74 net expenditure was about £143 million representing about 5.2 per cent of GNP.  In 1982 the figure had increased to £952 million representing almost 8 per cent of GNP. The expenditure level in 1985, which can be supported by the Estimates provision, will reach about £1,122 million in net expenditure terms.  When direct income from patients' receipts accruing to health agencies is reckoned the amount available for expenditure on the health services in 1985 will, as I have mentioned, reach a total of about £1,200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies have any difficulty in accepting those figures, I will arrange <Col N="560" /> for a departmental briefing on how the figures are broken down.  The Book of Estimates is available.  Deputy O'Hanlon alleged that, out of a total allocation of £1,200 million, at the end of 1984 the health boards were short by £10 million. In fact, the figure is working out at about £6 million.  This time last year this alleged £10 million was in the region of £17 million. At the end of 1984 the health boards discovered they had deficits of about £6 million, which in the context of spending £1,200 million is a relatively small sum and spread over the next three years is absorbed into budgets quite easily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only got half an hour, some of which has already gone, and I want to deal with some other aspects.  The growth in expenditure has been caused by a very substantial degree of growth in our health services.  Admittedly, we have had pay and price inflation, and these have pushed up the cost of the health services, but our services have improved very considerably. Our acute hospital services, spread throughout the country, are as good as any in western Europe.  I have been in many countries since I became Minister for Health and I have been in many countries since I was on the Council of Europe on a health committee from 1970 to 1982 and I have a reasonable experience of hospitals in other countries.  Our acute hospital services are generally very good. Our psychiatric services have been very steadily improved.  Since I came into office I have put £6 million of capital money into our psychiatric hospitals to clean out some of the dirt and some of the incompetence in terms of the general improvement of our psychiatric services, and that money has been spent.  Fianna Fáil Ministers did not do that because psychiatric patients are not good voting fodder in terms of collecting votes at election time.</P>

      <P>A feature of the psychiatric service has been the general improvement in the standards of accommodation and facilities in district mental hospitals by the expenditure by this Government of £6 million on schemes of refurbishment.  I emphasise this Government. The staff, in fairness, are co-operating quite exceptionally in that regard. Increasingly we have the provision of prehospital training units and rehabilitation wards for such patients.  Our mental handicapped services are extremely good and are being progressively developed, with a particular emphasis upon community services.  If any Deputy thinks that I have not allocated moneys to our mental handicapped services.  I want to inform the House that I have, in particular, taken money from the acute hospital area and I have put money into the mental handicapped area.  I challenge any Opposition Deputy to come with me and see what has been constructed in Swinford, to come out and see Cheeverstown, to come to Belcamp in County Dublin, to come down to Creagh House in County Sligo, come to Glenmaroon or come to Drumcar in County Louth.  Deputy O'Hanlon knows the improvements going on there now.  I will take Deputies over to Galway and Ballybay or if they want to go to Gort where they will see that all these developments have taken <Col N="562" /> place because I have allocated the money directly into them and major improvements have been made in our mental handicapped services.</P>
      <P>Likewise, on the physical handicapped side Deputies have only to go down the road and they will see that for the first time in decades we are improving and redeveloping the school for the blind in Merrion and Saint Josephs in Cabra where we have pumped money into that institution as well.  It is not spectacular cat scanners.  It is not spectacular this or that in acute hospitals, it is money going into the most deprived people in our community. All Fianna Fáil are thinking about are beds in acute hospitals, waiting lists, imaginary and otherwise.</P>

      <P>At the moment four out of every ten people in the country are in receipt of medical cards.  In some counties six out of every ten people have medical cards.  Of course, the Opposition allege that we are taking medical cards from people.  This is entirely untrue.  The current situation is that the allocations <Col N="563" /> for the health boards and the other health agencies for 1985 have been determined in an equitable manner on the basis of the resources generally available to us.  I have acted in an even handed manner with the health boards.  I propose to arrange a series of meetings with the chairmen of the health boards and their management teams after the local elections when the new boards are in, which is a logical time to do it, to review the position on the basis of expenditure trends to date.  Meanwhile, senior officers of my Department can be called on at short notice by the health boards or hospitals to discuss detailed issues.  I was rather ironically abused when some health boards said they would be short £9 million in 1985.  One southern health board now work out that they might be short £2 million.  The Eastern Health Board were supposed to be short £3 million or £4 million in 1984 and it is now worked out they might be, out of a few hundred million pounds, a few hundred thousand pounds short.  That is the reality, and all the raving in the world will not convince people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have repeatedly stated that I am endeavouring to improve the overall position of the health board finances.  One positive step which I have taken is, as I have announced, that health boards will be allowed to retain moneys collected in respect of arrears of health contributions owed by the farming community. This means, in effect, that the boards' approved expenditure in 1985 may be increased <i>pro rata</i> with arrears collected with retrospective effect from 1 January 1985.  I hope this will induce local farmers to pay arrears due without further delay in the knowledge that their statutory obligation must be paid and it will help to ease the funding problems of their health boards, although I am somewhat sceptical about the Opposition's attitude, because Fianna Fáil have just announced that they will abolish the <Col N="564" /> car tax as some incentive to farmers to pay the health contributions.</P>

      <P>A specific aspect of the Fianna Fáil motion relates to medical cards.  I would point out that I was the first Minister for Health in the history of the State to bring in a particular age allowance for persons aged 66 years and over.  This allowance was introduced from 1 July 1984 and amounts to £5 per week for a single person aged between 66 and 80 years of age and £8 a week for persons aged 80 years and over.  The allowance is doubled if the individual is married.  The introduction of this allowance marks a significant improvement in the position of people aged 66 years and over.</P>
      <P>Under the existing income guidelines a married man aged 66 and over can have an income of up to £100.05 per week or £106.50 a week over 80 years of age and still be entitled to a medical card.  This limit will be even higher if he has outgoings in excess of £10 a week in respect of his house.  I have tried to do this on a responsible basis.  The Fianna Fáil Party gave medical cards to every pensioner over the age&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been prepared to make the necessary resources available for the equipping of the hospital to enable it to open on schedule, but I will not be blackmailed by anyone into opening this hospital on the basis of making public land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I reject the suggestion of the proposers of this motion that I am running down the health services. In 1983 there were 572,660 patients discharged following in-patient treatment in acute public hospitals.  That was a record <i>per capita</i> for any country in western Europe.  That was half a million people out of a population of three and a half million.  Out-patient attendances at these hospitals totalled over 1.5 million.  There were 23,000 admissions to psychiatric hospitals and the number of out-patient attendances was in excess of 45,000.  Our mental handicapped services catered for 9,000 people.</P>
      <P>There are some deficiencies in our services, but I deny that anything by way of the allegations of the Fianna Fáil Party stand up.  We are spending £23 million a week on our health services, a unique record figure.  In addition capital expenditure of £58 million will be incurred in the health areas in 1985 and a further £119 million over 1986-87 on the provision of hospitals and other infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks to section (d) of this motion, namely the wasteful delay in opening Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>The attitude which this Minister for Health has adopted towards the Beaumont Hospital project since he came into office and his failure to have this hospital fully equipped and opened can only be described as a major scandal.  When I came into office as Minister for Health in 1977 no progress of any kind in providing this hospital had been made by my predecessor, another Labour Minister for Health, who had been in office since 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I was aware of the urgent need there was for this additional major general hospital on the north side, I arranged as quickly as possible to have the site acquired, to expedite planning and to get construction started.  As a result of brilliant work by the professional team involved and equally prodigous efforts by the building firms and their workers, we completed the hospital in record time so that it was ready for occupation 18 months ago.  This urgently needed hospital built to the highest modern standards, at a cost of £53 million to the Irish taxpayer, has been lying idle since it was completed because of the confrontational, dictatorial policy adopted by the present Minister for Health.  The people of the north side of Dublin are being deprived of the first-class medical service this hospital could provide and the very considerable employment it could make <Col N="573" /> available in the locality because of the ideological antics of this Minister.</P>
    <P>When the grand design of this fine new hospital was being thought out, it was decided that a private clinic for consultants should also be established on the same site.  This was a sound, sensible decision and in keeping with the best modern medical thinking and practice.  It is essential that patients in a public general hospital have available to them readily and on demand the best medical specialist and consultant services.  By far the best way to ensure that the patients in Beaumont would have such a service available to them would be to have adjacent to the general hospital a clinic and consulting rooms in which consultants and specialists could carry on their practice. In this way, the valuable time of consultants would not be wasted going back and forward across the city but their essential skills would be immediately and readily available to the general hospital patients.  It is clear from the latest belated offer which the Minister has made that the basic common sense of this proposal is now accepted.</P>
    <P>I decided at the outset that it was in everyone's interest to make available in the grounds of the new Beaumont Hospital a site on which the private consultants of the two existing hospitals which are being merged into Beaumont would come together and provide the facilities that they would need.  I want to emphasise that this would be at no cost whatever to the State or to the public hospital patients. The idea was that a site would either be sold or leased to the consultants at the appropriate cost and all facilities would be provided by them at their own expense.  Nobody, except an ideological fanatic, could object to such a proposal. The present Minister for Health, however, in pursuance of his own personal vendetta, has sought to renege on that original decision and that is the sole reason why this hospital is not open today.</P>
    <P>The antics of this Minister for Health have been particularly disreputable.  He has changed his stance radically since he started the dispute.  Doing a complete <Col N="574" /> U-turn he has just recently offered the private consultants 70 beds free of charge&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for their own private use in the public hospital, thus acknowledging that the presence of consultants on the campus of the general hospital is simply essential.  However, his own ideological prejudice has led him into a position where he is now forced to offer public property to private consultants when he could have had all their services available at no cost to the State had he maintained the original position.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party, presumably because they are ashamed of their role in this matter and are very much aware of the widespread feeling of anger in the community at the failure of the Minister for Health to have this hospital opened, recently circulated a particularly audacious and disreputable leaflet.  In a tactic typical of this Minister they seek to divert the blame for the present situation to someone else.  The leaflet contains the following very cynical statement.  Referring to the hospital, it states that is was first proposed by Labour Senator Flor O'Mahony in 1974.  If that is an attempt by Labour to claim credit for the building of Beaumont Hospital, it can only be regarded as a joke.  In 1974, if my memory serves me right, Flor O'Mahony as he then was, was an adviser to the Minister for Health who was doing absolutely nothing about providing a hospital in Beaumont.  Nothing whatever was done about Beaumont Hospital until Fianna Fáil came into office in 1977, when we set to work immediately to get it built.  The Labour Party leaflet goes on to completely distort the situation by an unwarranted attack on the private consultants concerned.  It is typical of the Labour Party and the Minister for Health that they would seek to cover up their <Col N="575" /> own failure by trying to put the blame on anybody except themselves.</P>
      <P>The delay in the opening of Beaumont Hospital at enormous public cost and to the serious detriment of the people of the area is directly attributable to the socialist, ideology-based manoeuvrings of this discredited Minister for Health who is putting his own personal prejudices before the welfare of the people of the north side of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Labour Party are entitled to their belief in socialist medicine but they are not entitled to indulge them at public expense and to the detriment of the people of Dublin.  The record of this Minister for Health would make a British Tory Minister look like a fairy godmother by comparison.  He has wrecked our health services, closed down wards, deprived people of vital medical attention, imposed cutbacks on a scale never before experienced.  But perhaps his most personally damaging and prejudiced action is his failure to open this fine new hospital that Fianna Fáil built for the people in Beaumont.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers from Fianna Fáil I am glad of the opportunity to speak in this debate.  This is the third time in the past six months that Fianna Fáil have raised this issue concerning the cutbacks in the health services. Maybe we were naive in thinking that as a result of our previous motions we could expect some improvements in the position but, unfortunately, as members of all parties are aware instead of improving it has deteriorated.  The total inadequacy of funding is reflected in every region, in every hospital whether ran by health boards or voluntary concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that we once again bring forward such a motion is to draw attention to the plight of the poor and the underprivileged and to the hardship being inflicted on them by the Government, more astonishingly by the Labour element in the Government.  One can <Col N="576" /> recall that is was a Labour motion of no confidence which brought down the Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 and it seems all the more bizarre that a Labour Minister for Health is inflicting such hardship on our poor and underprivileged. I should like to jog the Minister's memory about that debate.  One of the Minister's colleagues warned the then Minister, and the incoming Government, the Coalition, that any attempt to worsen the health services would be fought with all the powers at the disposal of the Labour Party, hollow words indeed when one considers the performance of a Labour Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Should we be surprised?  Are these not the same Labour Members who stood idly by last summer and allowed the abolition of the food subsidies which was ably announced by the Tánaiste while his Fine Gael friends ran for cover?  Is this not the same Minister whose first action on taking office was to remove medical cards from old age pensioners and followed that by withdrawing medical cards from students?  Is it any wonder that he continues to inflict hardship on the poor sections of our community? The Minister promised new regulations for the 16-18 year olds when he removed the medical cards from them to ensure that they could at least get hospital services cards but two years later we are still awaiting those regulations.  The result is that that group are in no man's land; they cannot get a medical card or a hospital services card.</P>
    <P>In the last debate on this issue I pointed out that for the first time ever the allocation for the GMS was included in the overall allocation for health boards.  At that time I pointed out the dangers of such a move and said that for the first time ever the GMS was in open competition with the general hospital services for an already inadequate allocation.  Unfortunately, the warnings I gave then have been borne out.  Many health boards say that the funds available to the GMS will run out towards the end of October or the beginning of November.  What will happen to medical cards then?  Will they become another statistic to be noted, then forgotten about by the Minister?  Is <Col N="577" /> this why the Department of Health wrote to CEOs in recent weeks instructing them to rigidly apply the guidelines in relation to the obtaining of medical cards and, as a result, denying many who would under normal circumstances be entitled to them?</P>
    <P>The CEOs, it appears, no longer have any discretionary powers and in cases of financial hardship and severe medical necessity they can no longer grant these people cards.  The Minister and the Government, still insist that the underprivileged are not suffering.  There is a further danger from this action because the Minister has now introduced financial competition between the GMS and the general hospital services.  There is a danger that patients who require hospitalisation will be refused admission because of the financial position.</P>
    <P>In our last debate on health cuts I went through the shortfall region by region and those shortfalls have been well documented since by my party and the media. I should like to quote three headlines which appeared in national daily newspapers last weekend.  On Friday night the <i>Evening Herald</i> carried the following headline: Health Cutbacks Attacked by Nurse.  <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday carried this headline: Cuts In Health Services Deplored.  It is interesting to note that that headline concerned a report from the ITGWU annual conference in Cork.  That is the Minister's union.  At that conference delegates deplored the delay in opening Tralee hospital which cost more than £15 million. I note from this morning's issue of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> that the Tánaiste tried to jump on that band wagon and failed.  The failure to provide a dialysis unit at Limerick was condemned at the conference.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kevin Hunt from Galway told the conference that the democratic rights of workers in the health boards were being eroded by the cutbacks.  Mr. Joe O'Callaghan, secretary of the union's Cork Nos. 7 and 8 branches said that the health boards are an area of crisis.  Those comments came from the Minister's fellow trade unionists.  They did not come from Fianna Fáil but from men after his own <Col N="578" /> heart.  On Monday the <i>Evening Herald</i> carried the following headline: Cutbacks Blow to Hospital.  The story that followed described how 12 of the 40 beds in Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital in Cork are to be closed.  A short time ago the Minister loudly proclaimed what he had done for the psychiatric services but he did not tell us that they are closing those 12 beds in Cork.  Because the community cannot cater for those patients they will be put into the existing wards.  The workers at the hospital who are members of the Minister's union have said that the result of such a move will be a return to the conditions of 20 years ago.  That was not a statement from Fianna Fáil but from a member of the ITGWU, the Minister's union, at last week's conference.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the shortfall in each health board but I should like to refer to the position in the South Eastern Health Board.  In 1984 we had a deficit of £1.9 million.  All the clouding will not change that.  That amount becomes a first charge on our 1985 allocation and it will be reflected in the year's estimate.  Therefore, the very minimum shortfall we have in the south east in 1985 will be £3.8 million, irrespective of the cutbacks we achieve this year.  The effect of this shortfall will be a massive increase in waiting lists for surgical and medical clinics. There will be a closure of hospital beds for many weeks during the summer months and the health of patients will be put in jeopardy.  The non replacement of doctors and nurses on holidays will mean that for many weeks of the year we can only provide an emergency service.  Due to an inadequacy of staff we have the position in one of our hospitals of an anaesthestist having to cater for three surgeons at the same time.  Is the Minister saying that the patients involved are not at risk?  We have a singlehanded obstetrician in Clonmel who works almost 24 hours per day seven days of the week and we cannot get assistance for him.</P>
    <P>At the final meeting of Comhairle na nOspidéal &mdash; it may well be the last one if the Minister has his way &mdash; I asked what the guidelines were for a singlehanded obstetrician and I was told there were <Col N="579" /> none because Comhairle does not recognise such an entity and no such singlehanded post should exist, but it does in Clonmel.  At that same meeting we sanctioned an additional post of anaesthetist for St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, a seventh post.  Why?  It is my view that the reason was that the funding had been made available by the Department of Health.  Obviously, some hospitals are more equal than others.  It is bad enough having inadequate funding but it becomes all the more galling when those inadequate funds are unfairly distributed.</P>
    <P>I referred in the past to the scandal of the unopened units which cost in the region of £7 million and now lie idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What type of economic madness is it to build these units and then not staff them?  The one that really upsets me is the 26-bed geriatric assessment unit at Ardkeen which has been left idle for two years in spite of the pious platitudes contained in <i>Building on Reality</i> to the effect that it is the Minister's intention to make provision for the needs of the increasing number of elderly people. Those are laudable sentiments, but unfortunately the reality is something else.  I suppose there is no point asking what happened to the Regional Hospital in Waterford?  The report has been lying on the Minister's desk for three years and we are still no closer to opening this hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go on all night, but may I refer to one more subject?  The Midland Health Board are the only board managing to live within their allocation, but to achieve this they must close down the maternity services in Tullamore and transfer them to Portlaoise, and the <Col N="580" /> famous orthopaedic unit at Athlone, which was promised by the Taoiseach no less, is no more.  But then we know what that man's record is in relation to broken promises.  I wonder if the Government have managed to find candidates for the local elections in Athlone as a result of that decision?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I appeal to the Labour Party once again, if they have any conscience or even in the interests of self-preservation, to support our motion tonight?  They should not depend on the Coalition partners, because they will dump them as they did in the past.  The Labour Party should regain some of their dignity and professed consideration for the underpriveleged, and support this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will give details of the prison development programme which was sanctioned by the Government in 1981-82 and cancelled by the Government in 1983; and the costs and fees already incurred at the time of cancellation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The reference to the prison development programme is no doubt intended to relate to the capital programme.  It is not correct to say that that programme &mdash; or any part of it&mdash; was cancelled by the Government in 1983.</P>
      <P>Basically, what has happened is that financial constraints that have operated over a number of years now have made it impossible to proceed as quickly as would have been possible if those constraints had not existed but, while certain planned projects came to a halt or were slowed down, there has been no decision to abandon any of the projects.</P>
      <P>This is not a matter of semantics, as the facts which I propose to give will show.  First, however, it is necessary to note that the dates given in the question are not accurate.  The projects themselves were approved in 1979-80, rather than 1981-82 as suggested.  Already by 1981 the position was that financial constraints made it necessary to slow down or bring to a temporary halt various aspects of the work.  While there were subsequent fluctuations in the level of money being made available, there has never, since 1981, been a time when financial constraints were not operating to hold back some significant parts of the developments. It therefore is misleading in this context to refer to 1983 in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are and have been substantial developments in other institutions over the years, the question appears to <Col N="378" /> be intended to relate to four specific projects, two in Wheatfield, one in Cork and one in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>Of the two in Wheatfield, one is not only under construction, the contract having been signed last autumn, but is being constructed to a substantially expanded plan as compared with what was originally envisaged, with provision for 320 spaces rather than the original 150.  Significant progress has also been made in site works at the other Wheatfield project, and the plans for that project have been brought to the stage where tenders could be invited and a contract placed if resources were available.</P>
    <P>The Cork project has not reached tender stage and is at present halted but I have no reason to believe that the project will not continue as soon as resources become available.</P>
    <P>The fourth project was a new prison affording a high degree of security near to the present prison in Portlaoise.  This was planned as an additional prison, not a replacement for the existing one. Because it turned out that the initial plans would have been significantly more expensive to bring to fruition than had been contemplated, it was necessary to re-plan for a lower cost level and, by the time that was done, the general financial constraints made it impossible for the time being to proceed.</P>
    <P>While I have put some emphasis on the fact that none of the projects has been abandoned &mdash; as is indeed underlined by the fact that substantial progress has been made on some, despite some temporary slowings-down or halts&mdash; I must of course also say that when resources become available it may be necessary to have a fresh look at each project with a view to seeing how it measures up to the needs of the situation as it will then be in the light of all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he consults with the relevant Garda officer and/or the justice or judge who imposed sentence before <Col N="379" /> deciding to remit or reduce prison sentences or to order early release from prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A distinction must be made between a decision to mitigate or remit a penalty under powers conferred by the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, and a decision to grant what is commonly called parole, under powers conferred by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
      <P>The power to mitigate or remit a penalty under the 1951 Act is exercised almost invariably on foot of a petition and is exercised only after consultation with the judge or district justice and with the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The granting of early release in the sense of parole is a different matter and it has never been the practice to consult the Judiciary &mdash; mainly because the issues involved have very little to do with those that concerned the court of trial.  On the other hand, as a general rule, the Garda are consulted in those cases also, as well as those&mdash; including welfare staff&mdash;who have been dealing with the prisoner in prison.  In fact, in many cases, it is as a result of a recommendation by a review committee representing the different disciplines in the prison that parole is granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 443, 444 and 445 together.</P>
      <P>On completion of the normal consultation procedures, Foynes harbour trustees were informed in July 1983 of my approval of the proposed contract for the east jetty extension at a cost of £2.8 million. Notwithstanding the allocation in 1983 of a State grant of £300,000 and local loans fund loan of £700,000 towards development works at Foynes harbour, the trustees were advised at the time that there was no commitment to State funding of the scheme in 1984.  The trustees were accordingly fully aware that in order to proceed with the east jetty extension they would need to be able to service substantial commercial borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further local loans fund loan of £1.2 <Col N="381" /> million has been drawn down by the trustees and a State grant of £200,000 has been paid to the trustees in 1985.  The Minister of State has recently indicated to the trustees that he would be willing to receive a deputation later in the year to discuss the possibility of additional assistance to Foynes harbour in 1985 when the overall position in relation to the take-up of expenditure on harbour projects becomes clearer.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to employment at Foynes harbour is a matter which comes within the general responsibility of the harbour trustees.  However, the trading performance of the port and the trustees' financial position are the subject of ongoing review by my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the response to which the Deputies refer.  As recently as 2 May 1985 the Minister for Finance, in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy MacSharry, pointed out that the Shannon estuary has been the subject of a number of studies in the past.  The most recent study, which included an examination of the existing infrastructure and the infrastructural requirements of industry, was completed in 1983 and was jointly financed by the Mid-Western Regional <Col N="382" /> Development Organisation and the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>Most of the Shannon estuary is at present under the jurisdiction of the Limerick harbour commissioners but it is my intention to introduce legislation later this year to provide for the establishment of a Shannon ports authority.  The proposed authority will have an important role in advancing proposals for the development of portal infrastructure in the Shannon estuary and in arranging for the carrying out of any further studies which may be deemed to be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">

      <P>On the basis of an apportionment of the expenditure in each of the years 1984 and 1985 on public service pay as defined for budgetary purposes it is estimated that the gross salary bill for the twelve months ending March 1985 was approximately £2,200 million.  This figure includes the salaries of civil servants, teachers, health service employees, the security forces and of employees of non-commercial semi-State bodies; it does not include the cost of public service pensions.  Statistics <Col N="398" /> are not recorded in such a manner as would enable information regarding the amount of PAYE and PRSI deductions to be extracted.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 8 March 1985 and submitted a claim to the inspector of taxes for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment on 21 March 1985.  The claim was dealt with on 2 April 1985 by way of a review of her liability for 1984-85 and a cheque in settlement of the refund found to be due was issued on 15 April 1985.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer was married on 30 March 1985 and consequently she may be entitled to an additional repayment of tax for 1984-85 (the year of marriage) by reference to the provisions of section 6 of the Finance Act, 1983.  The inspector of taxes wrote to her husband on 9 May 1985 for the information necessary to determine the position and a reply is awaited.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a form P.45 (cessation certificate) was handed in to the tax office by the taxpayer's former employer on 29 May 1985.  On the basis of the figures of pay and tax deducted shown on the certificate a refund of tax is not due in this case.  However, certain information which is required for the purpose of carrying out a review of the taxpayer's 1984-85 liability is outstanding and the inspector will now take the matter up directly with the taxpayer.</P>

Farmers with holdings of 80 adjusted acres and over, while continuing to be liable for income tax, will receive a credit against that tax in respect of farm tax paid in the year of assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware the erection of St. Martin's Special School for handicapped children on the site at Lady Lane, Waterford, had to be abandoned because of the archaeological importance of the site which came to light when the building operations had begun.  The Waterford Corporation offered an alternative site at Ballytruckle and the board of management re-engaged their consultants to deal with the building of the school on this site.</P>
      <P>In March 1985 the bills of quantities were submitted to the Office of Public Works who have now approved them. The Office of Public Works will shortly be writing to the board of management confirming the arrangements agreed for the placing of a new contract at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Work on the design of a drainage scheme for the Owenmore catchment, of which the Arrow river forms part, has been suspended since February 1983 following a Government decision to halt arterial drainage planning pending the outcome of a review of arterial drainage policy. The review, prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works, is under consideration, prior to the submission of proposals to the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether or not any formal regulations exist in relation to the criteria by which adoptions are made; and whether or not the size of the existing families or prospective adoptive families are determinant in the consideration of proposed adoptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoption Board is responsible for the making of adoption orders, which it does in accordance with procedures and eligibility criteria set out in the Adoption Acts 1952 to 1976.  However, the actual decision to place a child in respect of whom a couple may apply for an adoption order is a matter solely for registered adoption societies, health boards, or the natural mother who may place her own child with the adopter(s) direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the placement agencies i.e. societies and health boards, recommendations to place a child with a particular couple are basically a subjective <Col N="407" /> judgement by the adoption worker involved, based on that person's knowledge training and experience and having regard to the agency's placement policy. Such recommendations are in turn subject to the scrutiny and approval of the placement agency's case committee.</P>
    <P>Although there are no formal standard criteria set out in regulations, the size of existing families of prospective adoptive families would be amongst the factors considered by an agency in assessing their suitability to have a child for adoption. However, the weighting to be given to that factor would vary from one family to the next and consequently could not be described as a determining factor for all cases though it might be in some.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health in view of the fact that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 had an income of £10,700 for the year to date of redundancy on 4 March 1985, but, with redundancy payments added, had an income of £14,172 after redundancy, if he will arrange for a hospital services card to issue to him urgently as the current card runs out on 31 May 1985. He is due to go into hospital for some days for treatment for a recurring ear problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of hospital services cards is a matter for the appropriate health board. I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that there is no record of the receipt of a formal application for a hospital services card from the person referred to by the Deputy.  I have recently increased the income ceiling for entitlement to a hospital services card to £13,500.  This new limit will apply from 1 June 1985 and relates to income for the year ended 5 April 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income for hospital services card entitlement purposes is based on income as calculated for income tax purposes.  In the determination of taxable income, <Col N="408" /> statutory redundancy payments are disregarded, and, consequently, such payments are also disregarded in determining eligibility for a hospital services card.  If the person referred to makes formal application to the Eastern Health Board, 1 James's Street, Dublin 8, I do not foresee any problem in the issue of a hospital services card if the income is established to be as stated.  An application form has been sent to the person concerned.</P>

As the health centre must be financed from capital moneys for which there are many competing demands, I regret that I am not in a position to say, at this stage, when it will be possible to sanction the construction of the new centre.  Meanwhile, the Eastern Health Board have, with the assistance of <Col N="409" /> Dublin County Council, made provision for temporary health centre facilities at Deansrath.</P>

      <P>The provisions in Subhead G. 3 of the Health Estimate in respect of the expense of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board is £93 million in the current year.  This represents a 7 per cent increase on the provision for 1984, viz. £86.681 millions.  The provision was based mainly on an estimate of numbers eligible for general medical services and on reasonable average levels of visiting and prescribing by general practitioners involved in the services.  I am concerned that the visiting and prescribing rates have shown an increase in the early months of this year, and unless the situation is corrected, problems may arise in funding the scheme.  The question of the measures which might appropriately be taken is at present under active consideration.</P>

This health centre was originally proposed in 1979 and has been the subject of discussion between my Department and the Midland Health Board.  As a result of these discussions certain improvements and modifications on the original plans were agreed.  These changes take account of the current and expected future needs of the area and, on this basis, I was very pleased to give approval to the final stages in the planning process.  I expect these stages to be completed this year and I am confident that construction work will also commence this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 592 to 595, 597, 598 and 600 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I approved in principle the Midland <Col N="412" /> Health Board's plan for a major rationalisation of general hospital services in the board's area I have given the question of improving the casualty service at St. Vincent's Hospital, Athlone, careful and detailed consideration in consultation with the chairman and chief executive officer of the board. As a result approval has recently been issued to the board for the provision of a general practitioner casualty service at Athlone.  The hospital will be a general practitioner access hospital with 24 hour cover and in order to ensure that the necessary back-up facilities for this service are available I have also sanctioned improvements to the x-ray facilities, the physiotherapy department and to the emergency ambulance cover at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The detailed arrangements for the establishment of the service are primarily a matter for the Midland Health Board and I understand that detailed discussions have been arranged between the board and the general practitioners for this week.  The precise details of the service and the timing of its commencement will be determined following these discussions. General practitioner access schemes are in operation at a number of centres and have not given rise to any particular medico-legal problems so I do not anticipate any difficulties in Athlone. The service in Athlone does not provide for resident medical staff but a doctor will be on call at all times to handle emergencies. Consultant cover will be provided at the appropriate consultant staffed hospital which in any individual case will depend on a number of factors including the medical condition of the patient which, for example, might dictate referral to a specialised centre in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 4 August 1984 and payment is being made at regular weekly intervals.  Arrangements have been made to have payment issued at regular weekly intervals on receipt of monthly medical evidence as long as she remains incapable of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Invalidity pension is payable in place of disability benefit to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for her to, <i>inter alia</i>, have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.  It is also noted that the person concerned is in receipt of pay-related benefit at the rate of £15.73 per week in addition to disability benefit.  As pay-related benefit is not payable in conjunction with invalidity pension it is not to her advantage to be <Col N="414" /> transferred to invalidity pension until her entitlement to pay-related benefit has been exhausted on 4 November 1985.  In addition it will be necessary to have her examined by a medical referee for an opinion as to her future capacity for work.</P>

      <P>Where a person has less than 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment, entitlement to disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks. According to the records of the Department the person concerned has only 78 contributions paid on his behalf since entry into insurance.  He claimed disability benefit from 26 March 1984 and was paid to 27 March 1985 after which date his 52 week entitlement became exhausted.  In order to requalify for disability benefit it will be necessary for him <Col N="416" /> to have at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions are paid.</P>
      <P>The claimant has indicated that he was employed in Britain from 1973 to 1978 and his insurance record has been requested from the British authorities. When this information comes to hand his entitlement to disability benefit will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for an invalidity pension he would need to have a minimum of 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment.  The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 28 March 1985.  Assistance totalling £15.05 was awarded based on a previously held qualification certificate which showed his means to be £39.75 per week, thereby bringing his total income to the appropriate weekly rate of £54.80.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for a retirement pension on 11 January 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that he had a total of 311 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984.  This is equal to a yearly average of only ten, and, therefore, he does not qualify for a retirement pension. Neither did he qualify for an old age contributory pension on reaching age 66 on 10 May 1985.  A yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
      <P>The British Department of Health and Social Security have been asked to trace his record of British insurance from the details which he supplied.  In the meantime his claim to a non-contributory pension is being investigated.</P>

      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 54 contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1976.  This is equal to a yearly average of only two and, therefore he does not qualify for contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>He was appointed to a permanent and pensionable post in the public service in 1954 and his employment then became insurable at a modified rate which provides cover for a restricted range of benefits.  This modified rate does not include any element of cover for contributory old age pension or retirement pension and is not reckonable for either pension.</P>
      <P>When his employment ceased to be insurable because his salary exceeded the insurance ceiling which applied in respect of non-manual employees up to 31 March 1974 he paid voluntary contributions at a low rate which does not provide cover for contributory old age pension.  He claimed a non-contributory old age pension in 1981.  This was disallowed because his means exceeded the statutory limit.

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance is intended to enable aged or incapacitated pensioners to have access to aid in an emergency.  The scheme applies to persons aged 66 years and over who are in receipt of a qualifying social welfare type pension or allowance and to <Col N="428" /> persons under that age who are in receipt of an invalidity or blind pension from the Department or a disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board, provided the person fulfills the living alone conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The application from the person concerned was disallowed as she is under 66 years of age and is not in receipt of a qualifying payment.  She was notified accordingly on 30 April 1985.  To extend the scheme to include persons under 66 who are not in receipt of a pension or allowance due to a permanent incapacity would alter the nature of this and the other free schemes administered by the Department and would have significant cost implications.  Such an extension cannot therefore be contemplated in present circumstances.</P>

A detailed letter setting out the full position with regard to arrears and offsetting overpayments will be sent to claimant shortly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a widow's contributory pension at the weekly rate of £42.25, (increasing to £45 from 12 July next).  This is the rate payable to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children and whose husband's yearly average number of insurance contributions is in the range 36 to 41.  For pension at the maximum rate (in her case £43.45) an average of at least 48 is required.  Her late husband's average of 41 contributions is based on his insurance record arising from his employment in the years 1947 to 1970 <Col N="460" /> during which he had a total of 949 reckonable contributions.  The number of years over which the average falls to be calculated is 23, i.e. from his entry into insurance (1947) up to the year prior to his death (1970).  The claimant herself had no insurance record prior to 1970.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme was developed for the express purpose of enabling <Col N="468" /> the large numbers of productive and energetic persons over 25 years who have been unemployed for an extended period &mdash; 12 months and over &mdash; to make a contribution to social and community development at a reasonable cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Participation in the scheme is confined to those unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The inclusion in the scheme of unemployment benefit recipients, even though they may be unemployed for over a year, could leave the scheme open to abuse and deprive persons genuinely interested in participating of places in the scheme.  The response to the scheme has been heartening and I am not aware of problems in recruiting persons for the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 728 and 732 together.  It is not correct to say that young workers employed at the Sacred Heart day unit, Waterford, under my Department's teamwork scheme, have been let go.  My Department approved the employment under teamwork of two young workers at the unit for 1985. Through a misunderstanding at the time of the terms of the approval, the unit authorities recruited six young persons.</P>
      <P>When my Department became aware of the situation which had arisen, the matter was investigated in conjunction with the Department of Health.  I am pleased to say that I have now approved a grant to cover the employment for 1985 of the six workers involved.  The unit authorities have been informed to this effect.</P>

      <P>The young person concerned was on a national manpower service work experience programme.  The sponsoring employer pays the young person a weekly allowance of £32.50 for a period of 26 weeks; this payment is recouped at six to eight weekly intervals in arrears from the Department of Labour.  The programme began on 30 October 1984.  The first claim for payment from the sponsor for the first six weeks was received in headquarters on 20 December 1984 and payment was made on 10 January 1985.</P>
      <P>Four further claim forms for the remaining 20 weeks for a total of £650 were received in headquarters on 28 May 1985.  I understand that these had been delayed at the local national manpower service office because of difficulties in obtaining properly completed claim forms and the failure of the young person to attend a group monitoring session.  The claims are now being processed and payment will issue shortly.</P>
