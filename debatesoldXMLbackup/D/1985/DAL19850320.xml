    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received any communications from the President of France since the last European Council in respect of what the President has described as a surprise initiative in relation to the European Community.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I assume from the Taoiseach's reply that he has not received <Col N="2" /> any direct communication from the French President has there been any informal indications of what the French President might have in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there has not been. I suppose it would not be a surprise initiative if there had been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought he might have been inclined to give even the Taoiseach some indication of what he had in mind. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he would have any anticipation that it might have something to do with weighted voting or anything of that kind?  While I <Col N="3" /> am on my feet in this connection I should like to ask if the Taoiseach will indicate whether he can provide us with a copy of the Dooge Report about which there has been so much comment recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there has not been any indication.  There has been some press speculation as to what the President's initiative might comprise but I cannot give any particular weight to that. After his subsequent meeting with Chancellor Kohl no reference was made to this suggested surprise initiative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why he accepted some of the remarks in relation to Northern Ireland made by the British Prime Minister in an address to the United States Congress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I thought that the Prime Minister was very positive in her reaction to the report of the New Ireland Forum and to the discussions in progress at the moment.  I am satisfied that this remark was justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not be prepared to accept that if he is <Col N="4" /> satisfied with the approach of the British Prime Minister in the House of Congress of the United States he is one of the few people here, or in the United States, who is?  Would the Taoiseach not think that in making references to &ldquo;Garret Fitzgerald and I&rdquo;, &ldquo;joint efforts&rdquo; and &ldquo;consulting together&rdquo;, the British Prime Minister sought to give the impression that the British and Irish Governments were at one in their approach to the Northern Ireland problem?  Will the Taoiseach not agree that that could not be the case particularly in view of the rejection by the British Prime Minister of the New Ireland Forum Report and, indeed, the concentration of British policy at the moment on the security aspects to the exclusion of political progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prime Minister's reference to myself related to two matters, our joint condemnation of terrorism or our being united in condemning terrorism which I know is the Deputy's own position, and the legislation we introduced in respect of the seizure of IRA funds which also had the support of the Leader of the Opposition.  I am not quite sure what the Deputy is complaining about.  His name could also have been linked with mine in the circumstances but was not for some reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach is being deliberately obscure about this matter.  Is the Taoiseach not aware of the fact that there is widespread consternation and disbelief here, and in the United States, that the British Prime Minister should attempt to convey to the United States Congress that there is in fact no difference between himself and herself about Northern Ireland, that the whole tenor and thrust of her remarks to Congress was that there is no problem and no real difficulty and that the only question outstanding and remaining to be settled is the question of security and terrorism?  Does the Taoiseach not feel it necessary to indicate that in this part of Ireland we have a different approach to the problem of the tragedy of Northern <Col N="5" /> Ireland, that we do not regard the situation as satisfactory and that it is entirely misleading of the British Prime Minister to attempt to convey the opposite to our friends in the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not, perhaps, have bothered to read what was said by the Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not be insulting; I have a copy of it in front of me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What she said was that we, referring to myself and herself, recognise the differing traditions and identities of the two parts of the community in Northern Ireland, the Nationalist and the Unionist, and we seek a political way forward acceptable to them both which respects them both.  At a later stage she said that we would continue to consult together in the quest for stability and peace in Northern Ireland.  Those are statements to which I certainly do not take exception.  They reflect accurately the position of our two Governments. The fact that the British Government, as made clear by the British Prime Minister, now recognise so clearly that the problem in Northern Ireland does comprise one of differing traditions and identities which have to be reconciled and respected, both of them, is important progress.  To have it on the record is something valuable which I would have thought the Deputy opposite would have welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach would refrain from these petty and insulting references to my not having read the speech.  I took the trouble to read it.  I would not go to the trouble of raising this matter here had I not read it.  I have a copy of it in front of me and I refer him particularly to the part where the British Prime Minister said that there is no disagreement on this principle between the UK Government and the Government of the Republic of Ireland.  Various other references of that kind by the British Prime Minister to the Houses of Congress gave the impression &mdash; I hope the wrong impression &mdash; that in our basic attitude <Col N="6" /> and approach to the problem of Northern Ireland there is no fundamental disagreement between the Irish Government and the British Government particularly in view of the fact that the British Prime Minister has recently extended the constitutional veto to cover any form of political progress which again is inherent in her remarks to Congress.  Does he not still agree with me that the <i>New Irish Forum Report</i> was a valid analysis of the situation and that, having rejected the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> in its entirety, the British Prime Minister had no right to go to the US Congress and suggest that all is well in Northern Ireland and all is well between the British and Irish Governments with regard to Northern Ireland and that the only problem really outstanding is to defeat terrorism, even though we all agree that that is a major part of the problem but only part of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Prime Minister has not rejected the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> in its entirety.  On the contrary, the communique which we signed at Chequers involves specific acceptance of a number of these proposals in paragraph 5.2 of the report, the only actual proposals in the report. Therefore, in that the Deputy is incorrect. The Deputy has quoted a reference from the speech in Congress that there is no disagreement on this principle between the UK Government and the Government of the Republic of Ireland. He omitted to quote the words before it, but I accept that it is not because he has not read it, it is because he chooses to quote selectively.  The words immediately preceding that are: &ldquo;If ever there were to be a majority in favour of change then I believe that our Parliament would respond accordingly, for that is the principle of consent enshrined in your Constitution&rdquo;&mdash; the US Constitution &mdash;&ldquo;and an essential part of ours.  There is no disagreement on this principle between the UK Government and the Government of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  That is a statement which I am very glad to see reported of support for Irish unity in the <Col N="7" /> event of consent and no holding back by the British Government because of any interest of their own in those circumstances. I would have though that the Deputy would welcome that too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has been in communications with the British Prime Minister over the reported remarks of the Northern Secretary, Mr. Hurd, to the effect that the search for a political solution of the Northern Ireland problem faded into insignificance in comparison with the task of overcoming terrorism; and if he has made clear to the Prime Minister the futility of such a policy which runs totally counter to the general approach of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  These remarks were made by the Secretary of State when he visited the scene of the bomb attack in Newry two weeks ago, and saw the appalling destruction and loss of life there.  My Government while condemning unreservedly the campaign of violence have always emphasised and will continue to emphasise our belief that any policy based on security alone will not minimise divisions in Northern Ireland but will increase and exacerbate them. Our policy is, as I have indicated, based on the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> and its statement of the requirements for lasting peace and stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite understand the Taoiseach's attitude on this very narrow and specific issue.  Does he agree with me that the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland stated, as I have indicated, that everything else in regard to Northern Ireland fades into insignificance compared to the task of defeating terrorism?  Does he not still agree with <Col N="8" /> me in the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> that that attitude is to misread the situation totally?  If he so agrees, will he not make an effort to put the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland right on this fundamental matter?  Does he not further agree that it is only in the context of political progress that terrorism will be defeated and that to suggest the opposite is a doctrine of futility by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland?  I ask these things of the Taoiseach very sincerely.  I ask him not to give me a partisan, political answer on this.  I believe that if the Northern Secretary of State believes that the only thing to do is to defeat terrorism, then we are in for a long period of futility in so far as Northern Ireland is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Without necessarily choosing the exact words the Leader of the Opposition has chosen, I agree in general with the tenor of his remarks in this respect, and that indeed was what I said in my reply to the question he asked me.  I add that Mr. Hurd made those remarks on the occasion of his visit to Newry Police Station after the appalling massacre there, and the following day when facing the press on Channel 4 and questioned about this view by others who shared our surprise at it, he said that we, the Irish Government, had made it clear that co-operation which was limited to security was of limited interest to us.  I think the point is taken by Mr. Hurd. Whatever he may have said on the spur of moment in the ruins of Newry Police Station, his remarks on the following day when he faced the press reflect his more accurate understanding of our position, and by that I mean the position of all sides in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be convinced of that, but I am sure the Taoiseach would agree with me that it is not appropriate for a person in the position of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and a politician of such experience to make intemperate, off-the-cuff statements of that kind.  The Taoiseach will agree with me that we would expect <Col N="9" /> a more mature, balanced approach even under provocation of witnessing scenes of terror and outrage.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that, apart from this remark, there have been unfortunate indications from both Mr. Hurd and the British Prime Minister of a preoccupation with the defeat of terrorism to the exclusion of everything else?  Does he not see it as the duty of the Irish Government and himself in particular to rectify that belief and to point out continually that peace and stability, as the <i>New Ireland Forum Report</i> says, will come finally to Northern Ireland only when there is a political solution to the tragedy of that area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the message which we convey persistently to the British Government and I believe that we have been doing so with some success, notwithstanding the comment made on that occasion by Mr. Hurd.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the nature of the communications he has had with the British Prime Minister since the beginning of July 1984 on the subject of the Kinsale Gas Pipeline Agreement with the Northern authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contacts with the British Prime Minister since the beginning of July 1984, I urged that the Kinsale gas project should proceed on the terms set out in the agreed Memorandum of Understanding signed on behalf of both Governments in October 1983, which was drawn up so as to be fair to both parties and which took full account of uncertainties about future energy prices, exchange rates and demand.  The Prime Minister was unable to accept the case I made and, as Deputies will be aware, the British Government subsequently indicated that they would not go ahead with the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the breaking of this contract represents a loss to the economy of approximately £600 million?  Secondly, <Col N="10" /> does he accept that it was a serious breach of faith on the part of the British Government to renege on this deal that had been solemnly signed?  Thirdly, will he agree with me that it is the most serious setback to North-South co-operation in the last number of years?  Will he make available to this House the contents of the letters which passed between him and the British Prime Minister so that we can judge whether a good relationship existed or if the language used in the reply was of a very curt nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to put a figure on the loss involved.  The calculation would be very complex, so I must leave the Deputy with his figure.  I could not confirm it or offer an alternative.  The calculation of the loss involved depends ultimately on the alternative use to which the gas is put and the alternative value got for it.  To say the least, that is highly speculative.</P>
      <P>We were disappointed that the understanding which was signed was not carried forward into full agreement.  As regards the correspondence, it would be contrary to practice to publish the contents of private correspondence between the Prime Minister and me.  I wrote to her on 10 July and received a reply on 1 August.  I responded to that on 8 August by way of a message to her.  A reply was received to that on 21 August.  We had a further brief discussion on the subject on 3 September. It would not be appropriate to publish the correspondence.  I very much regret that the understanding reached has not been implemented.  It is a serious set back to economic relationships between North and South.  The implementation of the understanding would have represented the biggest single act of North-South co-operation open to the two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not dream up the figure of £600 million.  That figure was used by the Minister at the time when, in the full glare of publicity, the agreement was signed.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that what was signed on 10 December was an agreement?  The Taoiseach did <Col N="11" /> not comment on whether the language used by the British Prime Minister was curt in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore there was an agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an agreement to agree which carries with it certain penalties if it is not carried forward.  It is a normal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are penalty clauses there must have been an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £600 million could be a fair representation of the value of the gas to be sold.  The Deputy suggested there would be a loss of that amount but that depends on what alternative use we put the gas to in the circumstances of not selling it to Northern Ireland.  That is more difficult to assess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Taoiseach to a statement issued by Mr. Adam Butler, Minister at the time.  He did not speak about an agreement to agree but the fact that he clinched a deal for the supply of Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland on 10 October 1983.  He stated that the agreement meant there would be gas industrial jobs for people in the next century. Clearly there was an agreement and a serious breach of faith by the British Government.  Clearly the Taoiseach was repudiated by the British Prime Minister at the time for attempting to interfere in her decision.  It was her decision in the final analysis that killed this deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to end the <Col N="12" /> deal was made by the British Government. They decided not to proceed with it in what they regarded as changed circumstances. We did not regard that as an adequate reason for not proceeding because the deal contained within it provision for flexibility and allowed for the possibility of a whole range of take-up of the gas.  Although the British Government made the point that a further examination and consideration of the prospects suggested that the demand for the gas would be less than the maximum figure originally provided for, the figure which then emerged, according to their studies, was within the range contemplated by the agreement.  It did not, therefore, seem to us to be grounds for not proceeding with the agreement.  That point was made very forcibly by us to the British Government at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any clause as regards cancellation of the agreement? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Cooper Lybrand report spells out quite clearly that the case for the supply of Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland is as strong today as it was then?  Did he mention this at the last Summit in December with the British Prime Minister or has he taken any steps to resurrect that deal which could be of significant benefit to both the North and South?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any possibility of reviving it, we will certainly do so.  The memorandum of understanding provided that a capital contribution of £5 million sterling was payable to the Minister for Energy when the memorandum was signed.  If the parties agreed not to proceed with the project this contribution would be refunded except for 50 per cent of the expenditure which had been incurred on the pipeline before the termination of the project.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of adoption orders made in each of the years between 1978 <Col N="14" /> and 1985, inclusive, in favour of: (a) Roman Catholic adopters, (b) Protestant adopters, (c) Jewish adopters and (d) adopters of mixed religion; and the reason the Adoption Board has omitted publishing information as to the religious background of adopters in all reports published by it since 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1977 the Adoption Board included religion of adopters in their annual report.  However, following a review of the report format the board decided to discontinue publishing this information from 1978 onwards.  An important consideration in the board's decision was the change introduced in the Adoption Act, 1974, permitting adoption by persons of a different religion to that of the child.</P>
      <P>Statistics on the religion of adopters from 1978 to 1985 are not available in the form requested by the Deputy.  However, I have arranged to have collated statistics in respect of the years 1978 to 1984, inclusive, in the same form as the analyses published by the board up to 1977 and I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate them in the Official Report.  I might add that of the 69 orders made by the board so far in 1985, 65 were granted to Roman Catholic couples, two were granted to Protestant couples and two were granted to couples of inter-Church marriages.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for arranging to give these statistics later. Is he aware that inter-religious married couples and couples who are members of minority religions are experiencing difficulty in adopting despite the changes introduced by the 1974 Act?  Will he consider, in any new legislation to be introduced in this area, appropriate changes which should be inserted in such legislation and in particular ensure that adoption societies and health boards treat adoption applicants equally, irrespective of their religious persuasion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, up to 1974 it was not lawful for a child to be adopted by a person of a different religion to the child, with some exceptions in certain circumstances for members of certain religions.  Section 4 of the 1974 Act removed that restriction. I am aware of the difficulty referred to by the Deputy.  In placing a child for adoption the society generally must have regard to a number of considerations apart from religion, the object being to place the child with a couple who best meets the child's needs.  The society take into account any preferences expressed by the natural mother and the general circumstances of the adoptive family.  I am considering the point raised by the Deputy in the context of amending the legislation dealing with adoption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's helpful reply, is he aware that some health boards who have powers under the adoption legislation to arrange for adoption placements have indicated an unwillingness to include in lists of prospective adoption applicants couples of minority religious faiths?  Will the Minister issue a directive to the health boards to clarify their legal obligations in this regard so as to ensure that all adoption applicants are treated equally when they seek an adoption placement through a health board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the removal of the legal restrictions I would have considerable difficulty in issuing a directive to a health board to give exceptional weight to the issue raised by the Deputy. However, I am considering it in the light of the report of the review committee. The committee did not make any recommendation on this matter, but inevitably it will come up in the framing of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister two brief questions.  In view of the fact that the review committee published their report some nine to ten months ago, <Col N="16" /> and in view of the fact that the Minister's Department and the Minister have indicated that the legislation is being prepared, will it be possible to have a debate in this House on the findings in the review committee's report so that Members of this House will have an opportunity to express their views on it and have some direct input into the preparation of the legislation prior to publication?  When does the Minister envisage that the new Adoption Bill will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is going ahead quite rapidly.  I intend to have it published this year.  I am anxious to have published the Children Bill at the end of next month as the first Bill.  The Adoption Bill will be the second one.  I will be glad to consult with the Deputy on this aspect in the preparation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with directors of community care who will be responsible for organising the programme locally, it has been decided that it would be more effective to begin the programme in the autumn rather than in the late spring as originally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publicity announcing the measles vaccination programme will therefore begin in September and the vaccination programme will begin in October.  The Northern Ireland authorities will be running a similar vaccination programme at <Col N="17" /> that time.  It is considered that the programmes here and in Northern Ireland will be more effective if they are carried out simultaneously.</P>
    <P>With regard to funding, the detail of the manner in which the programme will be introduced in each health board area is currently the subject of discussions with the health boards.  The precise allocation to each board will be decided in the light of these discussions.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate the extent to which his Department feel this vaccination programme is required?  Is it proposed to operate this scheme through the schools, or how is it proposed to operate it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 40,000 cases of measles each year.  The side effects of the disease put enormous pressures on the health services in the short and long run.  The annual cost of the disease to the health services and to the economy as a whole was estimated at £2.7 million in a recent cost benefit study of a measles vaccination programme for Ireland carried out by my Department.  The Government set aside specific moneys in this year's budget at my request for a measles vaccination programme.  I want to thank my counterpart in Northern Ireland for agreeing to co-operate on a joint basis in the programme.  It will be completed in each community care area and will mean initially a six weeks intensive mass immunisation of all susceptible children in the 15 months to five years age group and in subsequent years the vaccination each year of at least 90 per cent of the children between the age of one and two years and then the establishment in each community care area of systems to identify unvaccinated children and for the surveillance of the disease. This is a matter which the House might consider &mdash; possibly the certification of measles vaccination or evidence of natural infection as a requirement for entry into a school.  Many countries have that requirement.  We have not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that, <Col N="18" /> following consultation with the directors of community care, it was decided to postpone this immunisation programme until the autumn.  Originally the Minister told us it was due to commence in March of this year.  Was it on the advice of the directors of community care that the decision was taken?  Can he tell me the total amount allocated this year for the measles vaccination programme?  Is he satisfied that the amount allocated will be sufficient to cover the cost of such a programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Half a million pounds has been allocated.  The cost of the initial programme will be £450,000, that is, the mass immunisation programme, and it will be £166,000 in subsequent years for the routine vaccination aspect.  I have received the co-operation of the directors of community care and the Irish Medical Organisation.  We have had discussions with the IMO and it has been decided that the general practitioners will be officially involved in the national measles vaccination programme. They will be paid £3.22 for each vaccination.  A fee of that amount will be paid to doctors on receipt of notification of the details such as the names and addresses by the DCC and MOH.  There will be a second fee of £7.80 per ten vaccinations.  That has been agreed for the monitoring of the immunisation programme.  I am pleased that the GPs are agreeable to co-operate in this essential basic preventive measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some misgivings. We had discussions with the directors of community care and the medical officers of health in December last.  It was agreed that an autumn start would be more advisable.  A commencement date at the end of April or the beginning of May would be very near to <Col N="19" /> the summer months when parents would be preparing for holidays and would not be atuned to thinking about the health of their children to the same extent as they would be at the onset of winter.  It was felt that the beginning of winter was the better period.  We will be using television quite a bit and during the summer months the fall off in television viewing is quite marked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us the fees which will be payable to the GPs.  Will this vaccination be available through the health board clinics?  In what way will the scheme apply to people who have medical cards, or will they be affected in any way by the implementation of the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The public at large will not be paying for it.  The Department will be paying the GPs direct, following reports from the directors of community care.  To that extent, it is a general eradication scheme which is being undertaken here.  We shall be involving the Health Education Bureau, the health boards and the directors of community care.  I shall be asking Members of the House to urge their constituents to avail of the scheme because the incidence of side effects of measles is extremely high and it is a very dangerous illness.</P>

I understand that the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped will be submitting their observations very shortly.  I also understand that UVOH devoted the two days of their 1984 annual general meeting to discussing the Green Paper, while the Irish Wheelchair Association at their conference in Ennis in October last on residential care for the physically disabled discussed the Green Paper.  The Department of Health will be organising a conference to discuss certain key aspects of this paper.  The date, venue and final agenda have not yet been decided because we are due to receive the major responses such as that of the NRB in June.  Much work has been done by the voluntary bodies and the statutory agencies on the Green Paper since it was published.  I expect to have all their views within a matter of, at the most, two months.

The important thing is to give them independence. There are many areas where legislation will not be required.  Would the Minister consider, for instance, the health boards' review of long term care institutions and homes, with a view to giving the disabled some more input into the running of these centres and also some income in their own right, which they do not now get?</P>

      <P>As one who initially shared the Deputy's view, all I can say is that certainly in the past five years there has been an exceptional degree of change in this area.  We are getting away from the institutional structures for the physically disabled.  The changes which are manifestly evident in giving independence, home ownership and hostel accommodation within the community, have blossomed in the past four or five years.  There are very considerable changes which go back to the work of dedicated individuals in the late seventies and early eighties. The changes are coming very rapidly.</P>

      <P>In so far as I was directly concerned in December 1982, as part of the exemption to the embargo on the recruitment of staff in the mentally handicapped services, I approved the recruitment of 30 extra staff to enable the remaining three units to be commissioned in Saint Michael's House.  That was quite an exceptional change of policy at the time.  Then, in October 1984, I met a delegation from St. Michael's when the difficulties facing the house became evident because they had recruited additional staff without the approval of the Department. As a consequence of reviewing that situation in 1985 we allocated another £150,000 to meet the costs of pay of those staff which had been met heretofore from private resources within St. Michael's. Officers of my Department will be discussing these matters with St. Michael's House shortly with a view to resolving all of the difficulties within the limits of their 1985 allocation.</P>
      <P>The only point I would make to organisations such as St. Michael's House is that they should keep in the closest touch with my Department so that we and they know what is going on.</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware of this facility.  I raised it in the House not so long ago.  It seems to me to be a matter of public scandal that there are so many hundreds of persons who are mentally handicapped on the priority waiting lists of the health board for residential care who cannot get that residential care simply because the accommodation is not available.  It is a matter of public scandal that, in that context, there is a fully equipped facility <Col N="24" /> available in St. Michael's House while all that is required for it to be brought into use is that the Minister sanction sufficient funding to allow St. Michael's House to staff that facility.  I might ask this specific question of the Minister: does he intend to provide sufficient funding to St. Michael's House for the specific requirement of staffing the facility to which I have referred in my question?  The Minister has failed to answer that specific question on the Order Paper which I have asked twice already.</P>

      <P>The present position is that I do not have at present a detailed request from St. Michael's for further staff.  I have made available an additional £150,000 for 1985 to enable St. Michael's to pay the staff they recruited without formal sanction; they were paying them privately.  I am quite prepared to discuss with St. Michael's House any additional moneys they might need for 1985 but they have received a substantial increase.  I have to balance their needs with, for example, the opening of Cheeverstown, where we are spending an additional £1 million this year, on the south side of the city, on their catchment area.  I can assure <Col N="25" /> the Deputy there has been no shortage of funds for St. Michael's, and that their capacity to twist arms is quite substantial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My views in relation to the development of services for people with mental handicap are contained in the Government Green Paper on Services for Disabled People &mdash; Towards a Full Life &mdash; with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar.  I have also invited the views of agencies involved in the provision of services and their response to the Green Paper will, of course, be taken into full account when formulating policy on mental handicap issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is part of the on-going dialogue which is a feature of the relationship which I and my Department have with <Col N="26" /> groups involved in the provision of mental handicap services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that his policy was fully outlined in the Green Paper on Services for Disabled People &mdash; Towards a Full Life.  In reply to an earlier question he told us that he was unaware of any voluntary body or health board not having sufficient finance to carry on their responsibilities in regard to the disabled. Would the Minister not accept that both health boards and voluntary bodies are totally under-financed and are unable to provide the services they wish?  Will the Minister furthermore accept that there are a number of buildings, some built as far back as 1981, not yet in operation because the health boards do not have enough staff for them?  Will the Minister also accept that there is a total lack of accommodation for numerous adult mentally handicapped, that there are mentally handicapped people aged 18 being sent home from residential care centres to parents who are unable to look after them because there is no accommodation available for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If I may blow the trumpet of the Department a little on this question, I have deliberately transferred resources out of the acute hospitals area into that of the mentally handicapped.  For example, in recent months I have made an additional £200,000 of annual revenue on an ongoing basis available to the Brothers of St. John of God.  These brothers, particularly in relation to St. Mary's in Drumcar, urgently need additional resources and those resources have been made available. The same applies in relation to Galway.  Again in recent months I have authorised additional resources to facilitate the opening of a further house for severely mentally handicapped children in the Pope John Paul II Centre in Ballymahon. In addition, Cheeverstown this year will have 130 residential places and 154 day care places which did not exist last year or the year before.  Therefore, there has been a lot of extra money given. The Deputy will be aware that, in relation <Col N="27" /> to the Brothers of Charity as well &mdash; and I have had discussions with both the Brothers of St. John of God and the Brothers of Charity &mdash; I made a very considerable amount of money available for 1985 and they are now reviewing how they propose spending that money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant to this one.  Indeed as you and I know, in our constituency, there has been a building lying in Cootehill since 1981 that has not been opened because money has not been allocated for staff.  Furthermore, is the Minister aware and concerned at the implications of the very large reduction in the allocation available from the European Social Fund in the current year and its effects on the mentally handicapped in every health board area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree at all.  I would strongly suggest to the Deputy that he speak, in particular, to the religious orders who are doing outstanding work in this area.  I met the Brothers of Saint John of God and I am giving them very substantial allocation for 1985 to enable them to open new units.  The same applies to the Brothers of Charity.  We made a substantial sum of money available to them only a fortnight ago on an ongoing revenue basis.  Cheeverstown in Templeogue is also being renovated and last year, for example, I made almost £1 million available to them which they did not spend.  In relation to the capital side, towards the end of last year I made £700,000 available for community based facilities and this year I am <Col N="28" /> spending another £1.2 million on maintenance work in mentally handicapped areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is based on a number of premises which are incorrect. There is not, not will there be, a possibility for the entire Spanish fishing fleet to have access to Irish coastal waters or, indeed, to Community waters.  The present negotiations in Brussels are about the accession of Spain to membership of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been negotiated in regard to the fisheries chapter is the integration of Spain into the Common Fisheries Policy, involving access to Community waters for <Col N="29" /> a limited number of Spanish vessels which would be subject to strict controls.  While membership of the Community implies non-discriminatory treatment for all member states, the Government are now negotiating a derogation which would exclude Spanish vessels from the Irish Box for a long period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there is now widespread confusion in well-informed circles about the negotiating position adopted at present by the Irish negotiating team.  I am sure the Minister is also aware that at the recent Dublin Summit it was agreed within the Community that there would be a ten year plus five year transition period before any further consideration would be given to Spanish fishing vessels operating in Community areas.  Will the Minister clarify what the present negotiating stance is at Community level and will he rectify the situation which is causing anxiety, fear and widespread confusion, not only throughout the industry but also in well-informed circles?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>To coin a phrase, the negotiations are ongoing and necessarily are in that category.  They are also extremely complex.  I wish to assure the Deputy and the House that the Irish representatives at those negotiations are extremely well aware of the importance of this matter and I have total confidence in their ability to negotiate the best possible derogation for Irish fishermen.  I take Deputy Daly's point that there is confusion; indeed there were two contradictory headlines on this matter in two daily newspapers today and a debate, necessarily truncated in question and answer from here, will not clarify the situation. We are negotiating a derogation which will be in ease and aid of the Irish fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

Will he, confirm that that principle will not be conceded?  That is all we are looking for. We are not interested in descriptions of the complexity of the negotiations.

      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the position in regard to legislation to deal with the affairs of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  I wish to remind the Taoiseach that we in Fianna Fáil have been very responsible in our attitude to this debacle.  Naturally, as is our duty, we have sought to put first the national interest and the stability of our financial institutions.  Accordingly, we have been very restrained in our comments and in our reaction until now but I would point out that many questions are presenting themselves to the public mind at this stage and we consider that the time has come for a full disclosure of all the relevant facts and information. We have given the Government and the financial institutions every opportunity to deal with the crisis situation that arose and I am asking the Taoiseach now if he will ensure that the House is given an opportunity to debate every aspect of the debacle and in particular to answer questions such as the question of whether the taxpayer is to be called on to pick up the bill for the mistakes of others.</P>

I am not questioning your decision.  I am sure it was arrived at after considering all the factors but I do not understand how the amendments could involve an extra charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases were presented in a way that suggested they would be in line with inflation for the entire year but they will only come into effect as and from 11 July. Acceptance of my amendments would not involve any cost to the Exchequer if the increases had been more honestly <Col N="114" /> presented and if the true rate of 4 per cent or 4½ per cent from April was set out.</P>

      <P>Amendment Nos. 1 to 4 were put down by me and by Deputy Mac Giolla on the basis that the increases should apply from the beginning of the tax year.  It has become the practice in recent years to postpone social welfare increases later and later into the year.  On Second Stage I indicated there was a possibility that inflation rates were going to rise and that the increases provided for in the Bill would come nowhere near the actual increase in the cost of living for social welfare beneficiaries. Consequently, we put down the amendments seeking to restore the increases to April, the traditional time for such increases to apply.  I note the amendments have been ruled out of order because their implementation would cost the State money.  Nevertheless, the argument stands that the increases will not be sufficient to meet the increased cost of living in the coming year.  Even if the <Col N="115" /> increases were maintained at the rate of inflation, in many cases they are so low they will not allow people to maintain a normal standard of living.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy De Rossa I should like to query why the increased benefits will only come into operation from July.  Since I became a Member of the House benefits have generally applied from the beginning of the financial year and what is happening now appears to be a change in procedure.  Is there any special reason for this?  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The pattern has been established that since 1983 the end of June or the beginning of July has become the standard time for the rates increases. The increase in 1984 fully matched inflation to the middle of 1985 and the increases this year are expected to do the same to mid-1986.  Regarding the general point raised about a 1 per cent increase in the rates of social insurance, social assistance and occupational injuries benefit, the cost will be £90 million per year.  In budgeting for the unemployed, for each 1,000 persons on the live register in a full year the cost will be £2.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has confirmed that this policy of postponing the date of implementation of the increases has become established since this Government came to office.  In 1983 the increases were operative as from June, last year they were operative as from the first week in July and this year they will become operative in the second week in July.  It is getting later all the time and if we continue with this trend it will be almost Christmas before increases are granted in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the unfortunate people who have the lowest standards of living, those on welfare payments, will suffer.  Most of the people who are unemployed have no work through no fault of their own and many of them would give their eyes for a job.  At the moment there are 234,000 people unemployed and they, <Col N="116" /> with the sick and the old age pensioners, will have to bear the increased costs imposed as a result of the budgetary policies of the government.  They will have to pay increased VAT on clothes from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, on fuel from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, and on footwear the VAT rate has gone from zero to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Already these people have less disposable income than they had before the budget and this will get worse as time goes on.  They are finding it almost impossible to put food on the table and they are being treated with scant disregard by the Government.  They should have been cushioned from the effects of the increased VAT charges in the interim until they get their social welfare increases.  It is quite amazing that increased charges which mean more revenue for the Exchequer are implemented immediately but anything that might cost the Exchequer money, such as increased social welfare payments, is postponed for as long as this Government can do that. This policy will ensure that there is increased poverty.  I do not think anyone can deny that the numbers of people who are finding it impossible to provide basic needs are growing all the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the high cost involved in paying social welfare and unemployment benefits. Unfortunately the escalating costs arise from the failure of Government policies on unemployment.  If this Government had given the right type of leadership and encouraged confidence, unemployment would not have escalated to the present level.  Even the Minister will have to concede that their great document which was supposed to be the answer to unemployment is way out in its calculations.  This document calculated that at the end of 1984 the unemployment register would include approximately 220,000 people. When this document was actually published they were approximately 13,000 people wrong in their calculations.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take account of what I have said in relation to the <Col N="117" /> increased costs which social welfare recipients have to bear between now and July and I would ask the Minister to consider how they can maintain any reasonable standard of living until they get these increases.  The Minister should consider giving the increases earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Government came to office and including the increases in this Bill, the short term payments have been increased by 25 per cent, long term payments by 28 per cent and the long term unemployed have received the highest increase of all, 33 per cent.  The consumer price index in the same period from mid-1983 to mid-1986 is expected to increase by 20 per cent.  There is a real increase in social welfare short term payments of 5 per cent, in long term payments of 8 per cent and in long term unemployment payments the increase is 13 per cent.  These are compound increases, which is the only way to take them.  The increase in net take home pay in the period mid-1983 to mid-1986 has gone up by 23 per cent, so social welfare, despite the appalling budgetary constraints on the Government, has matched inflation and in the case of a large number of recipients inflation has been more than matched. The argument that the Government are imposing a particularly punitive regime on social welfare recipients does not stand up.  If we had given only an inflation increase from mid-1983 to mid-1984 the rate of old age pension would not be £38.60, it would be £37.50.  In that budget, for the 12 months forward, there was a real increase of 2.9 per cent.  Likewise, in last year's budget if we had stuck rigidly to an inflation increase for the year ahead the old age pension would have gone up to £40.52 instead of to £41.30 which was a real increase of 1.9 per cent. In this year's budget, looking ahead, taking the projected rate of inflation, if we had just given an increase to match inflation the long term non-contributory rate of old age pension would be £43.78 instead of which it will go up to £44 which is roughly a half per cent higher in real <Col N="118" /> terms than the anticipated rate of inflation from July 1985 to July 1986.</P>
      <P>The same applies in terms of unemployment assistance.  If we had stuck rigidly to inflation in last year's budget the unemployment assistance long term rate would have been £31.48 but we brought in a rate of £32.80 last year which was 4.2 per cent higher than the rate of inflation.  I do not suggest that it is a large amount of money, but that would have been the situation had we stuck rigidly to inflation.  Likewise, this year we are bringing in a new rate from July 1985 to £34.95 and if we had stuck to inflation it would be £34.77.  Despite the fact that every 1 per cent increase costs £19 million we have managed in the overall provision for social welfare, a quite exceptional figure.</P>
      <P>I wonder how many Deputies recall that I said that in 1982 on unemployment-related expenditure we would spend £345 million.  In 1983 we spent £452 million, in 1984 £518 million and this year the provision is for £578 million, an increase from £345 in 1982 to £578 million in 1985. The increase in unemployment-related expenditure is indeed quite low but the increase alone between 1982 and 1983 was 31 per cent from £345 million to £452 million.  If we had an upturn in the economy and if we had fewer people unemployed we could release resources to be spent in other areas of social need and job creation, bearing in mind that 1,000 persons off the unemployment register releases £2.6 million to the Exchequer.  This is the position we are in and my role is to ensure that there is enough money on a day-to-day basis in the Department of Social Welfare to pay out the unemployment-related expenditure and other major expenditures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have avoided giving these huge increases in the costings for unemployment benefits.  The figures are an indictment of the Government's failure in their employment policies.  The Minister should not boast about that figure, he should be ashamed to admit it. The projected figure for unemployment <Col N="119" /> payments this year instead of giving any reassurance to the unfortunate people hoping for jobs casts further gloom on the position and highlights the fact that the Government do not have any policies in regard to job creation.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us of the increases people received in payments last year. Quite honestly I think he is subtly trying to play acrobatics with the figures because the fact that the increases operated from 1 July meant that the 6 per cent and 7 per cent increases amounted to 5 per cent and 5½ per cent in real terms. That did not match inflation and the Minister should not try to pretend it did. The pittance of increases given by a Government who commenced their term of office with a so-called firm social policy will not help the less well off.  The Government said they were committed to looking after the needy, those unfortunate enough not to have a job, the sick and the aged but they have not done that.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Social Welfare Bill in 1983 expressed disappointment at the extent of the increases and a fervent hope that the following year the tide would turn and the Government would be able to give more realistic increases.  The Minister must be more disappointed when he considers that after two years the Government have not made any attempt to grant realistic increases to compensate for increases in the cost of living.  I would have thought that the Government would have abandoned their policy of postponing the date, which amounts to fiddling with the percentage figure.  The Government are trying to pretend that they are giving a figure that they are not giving.  An increase of 6 per cent or 6½ per cent over eight and a half months amounts to about 4 per cent or 4½ per cent in real terms and that figure does not match the increase in the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how anybody, no matter how good an economist he or she may consider themselves, can predict accurately what the inflation rate will be from July onwards.  We have sad recollections of inflation figures being wrong in the <Col N="120" /> past and they may be wrong in the future. I should like to ask the House to compare the Government's increase of 6½ per cent long term and 6 per cent short term from 11 July this year, the 8 per cent long term and 7 per cent short term from 1 July last year and the 12 per cent long term and 10 per cent short term from June 1983 with the clear increases given to social welfare recipients by Fianna Fáil.  In 1980 Fianna Fáil granted an increase of 25 per cent long term and 20 per cent short term while in 1981 a similar percentage increase was granted.  In 1982 an increase of 25 per cent across the board was granted by Fianna Fáil.  Those increases applied from 1 April and amounted to real increases.  Fianna Fáil did not pretend about the extent of the increases. Those increases were not fractionalised by being paid late in the year.  Will the Minister tell the House why the Government have decided to postpone the increases each year?  In 1983 the increases were postponed to June while in 1984 they were put back further, to the first week in July.  This year the Government have put back the operative date to the second week in July.</P>

      <P>There was not any other reason for putting the date back to July.  The thing I find most regrettable <Col N="121" /> about increases of 6 per cent, 8 per cent or 12 per cent is that we keep harping back in our inflation preoccupation to increases granted of 20 per cent or 25 per cent although we are well aware that such increases were no more than paper increases.  At that time inflation was of a similar order.  I find it difficult to convince people that an increase of 8 per cent at a time when the annual rate of inflation is 6.7 per cent amounts to an increase in real terms.  It is of considerable benefit. There is little point in granting an increase of 25 per cent if the rate of inflation is 22 per cent.</P>

      <P>I appreciate some of the points made by the Minister but I must point out to him that he has not answered the question.  The increased charges are effective from 1 April but the benefits are not effective until July.  Why is there such a difference?  If the charges apply from 1 April the benefits should apply from the same date, as happened in the past.  The fact that the benefits apply from July effectively means that the benefits will be in operation for eight or nine months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the change in PRSI is to coincide with the income tax changes.  It has always been the case that tax changes occur on 5 April and changes in ceilings and rates of PRSI occur in that month also.  I must make the broad point that I am probably the first Minister for Social Welfare in the past decade who in three consecutive budgets did not increase the rate of PRSI. It would have been easy to make a marginal change, to increase the rate from 5½ per cent to 6 per cent.  The social insurance fund would be increased but the change would amount to additional taxation. I am not urging an increase in the rate of PRSI but I want to bring into the PRSI net over the next year or two as many self employed and members of the farming community as possible.  I must point out to the House that while we are paying about £500 million in contributory pensions we are paying £300 million in non-contributory pensions towards which people do not make any contributions <Col N="122" /> through PRSI.  I must make the point also that I do not know of any other member state that manages to pay social welfare increases to the extent that we have been able to pay in the past three years.  Other wealthier countries have cut social welfare benefits in real terms in the last two or three years.  We have not done so in this country.  We have matched inflation. We have gone marginally above it in a number of instances, but we have not reduced in relation to it.  I would have thought that this was not possible.  We have a high income tax level, a high PRSI level and a high level of social welfare.</P>

      <P>As regards a passing reference, it is appalling that in the three years they have been in office this Government on only one occasion, last year from August, gave any increase in children's allowances and then it was a <Col N="123" /> miserable 7 per cent operative from August which was effectively worth only about 4 per cent.  Therefore, they have given a 4 per cent children's allowance increase in three years.  This is very specific anti-family policy that has hurt households.  As we are all aware, many mothers rely very much on the children's allowances to get the moneys necessary for emergencies and crises in the house.</P>

There is no point in our running away from the fact of the increased charges on VAT which they will have to pay and have been paying since the budget.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that you are powerless to do anything about it, but the whole idea of amendment in relation to the Social Welfare Bill or the Finance Bill is rendered totally impotent by that Standing Order.  Again, I am not criticising you for applying it.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is related to social welfare assistance and our spokesman.  Deputy McCarthy mentioned that VAT charges are in existence and that people going into the shops doling out their paltry sums of money must dole out more as a result of the added VAT.  It is a pity that we could not have a debate on the amendments. I think we could convince the Minister that it would be only right, equitable and just to have these payments made from 1 April, but we cannot do that.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a few things about social assistance.  Already in this House on occasion when the Minister was answering questions I raised the whole matter of the attitude of officials towards the recipients of social assistance.  I got an assurance from the Minister in this House that he would see to it that his officials were instructed to treat the citizens who are in the unfortunate position of having to get social assistance with the dignity and respect that such citizens deserve and that there would not be a Mr. Bumble the Beadle attitude towards these people, a grudging, suspicious attitude and at times behaviour by officials in investigations which nobody, neither Minister nor Member of this House, could stand over.  People in receipt of social assistance are not criminals and should not be treated as such by public officials investigating their means.  As the House knows, the amount of social assistance received is determined by the income of the persons involved.  It would be helpful if the Minister would issue a list of what is reckoned as means and of what could be discounted by way of expenditure or outlay.  There does not seem to be any logic from one case to another.  I appeal to the Minister to bring out a small leaflet giving that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that unemployment <Col N="126" /> assistance will be paid on 3 July, deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance and single women's allowance will be paid on 11 July; old age pension and blind pension will be paid on 12 July. There seems to be a progression and the most destitute are left for the day of the Orange parade, 12 July.  Is there a hierarchy of values in the Minister's office which places unemployment first and blind pension, old age pension, widow's pension and orphan's pension second last?  I cannot understand that.  If it is for administrative purposes &mdash; that excuse has been used often enough in the House &mdash; I should like to know why that order was chosen.  We have heard about the benefits of computers in public administration. We were told that the Department of Social Welfare was highly computerised.  Is it fully computerised? Why the long delay?  Why must it take a week to make payments to those who deserve them?  If it is a matter of the workload in the Department, surely a computer could be used to enable the Minister to pay these social welfare benefits from 1 April?</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister talking about PRSI.  He refrained from raising the amount.  Employers are of the opinion that the present rate is a disincentive to employment.  As regards non-contributory old age pension, the Minister spoke about the desirability of increasing the finances from PRSI and so on because there were many people drawing noncontributory old age pensions without, as he put it, having made any direct contribution. I do not think the Minister was being unjust or uncharitable in the exact form of words he used but there was an imputation that people who did not contribute were less deserving of a pension in their old age than those who did so.  The House and the Minister's party would refute that.</P>
    <P>Some officials are attaching themselves like leeches to old people, quizzing them and sucking at them in order to find out if they have a few bob here or there.  This has surfaced recently in regard to the raids on the elderly in rural districts.  I will not deal with that but the point was <Col N="127" /> made.  When the Minister for Finance was asked where he would get certain moneys from I was perturbed to see on the leaflet which was issued that figuring prominently was a saving of £2 million on non-contributory old age pensions.  I ask the Minister to see to it that this is not bounty for the Department of Finance gained by people going around and ferreting into the affairs of old people, literally scaring them out of their wits.  I will give one example to the House regarding the prescribed relative allowance.  An official arrived at a house and saw that the table was set for three people.  There were only two people resident in the house; the pensioner and the person in whose interest the prescribed relative allowance was being paid.  This snoop thought he had found three people in the house.  The bean an tí was not entitled to prepare a meal for a visitor.  That is the kind of behaviour I am talking about.  I know the Minister would not have condoned that and I ask him to see to it that it is known throughout his Department that he will not stand over this kind of treatment.</P>
    <P>As regards the list it would be no harm if a letter from the Minister's office stated: &ldquo;your means are made up as follows, so much from this and so much from that.  This is how we reached the figure.  We deducted all this from what you would get if you had no means at all&rdquo;.  If a letter along those lines was issued people would not be confused.  It would save a great deal of letter writing and bureaucratic work.  It would mean that the applicant would be able to challenge the assessment.  For example, if someone on social assistance was assessed as spending £200 on transport and the person had spent £250 on it he would be able to produce evidence to the Department to that effect.  However, the answer &ldquo;your means were assessed at so much and this is above what you are entitled to earn&rdquo; is no good to anyone.  The person is not satisfied and the public representative has to go through the rigmarole of extracting information from the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> It we cannot have the payments made on 1 April, then can we have dealings with citizens carried out at a dignified level and can we have reasons given for the assessment of means?  Will the Minister issue a leaflet outlining the general principles regarding that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I should like to see the benefits introduced on 1 April.  However, I accept what the Minister says.  We have a dwindling number of workers who must maintain the system.  The figures which the Minister has given are rather intimidating.</P>
      <P>The system of assessing who is and who is not entitled to unemployment assistance must be called into question.  There are several anomalies in the system. There is a distinction made between urban and rural living.  I appreciate that when this system was first introduced in 1934 there was some justification for it. There was a significant difference between urban and rural living.  A large percentage of our population were living off the land and enjoying certain benefits such as food, milk and things of that nature which the urban dweller did not have.  This is long outdated.  A commission are due to report at the end of the year and I hope one of the recommendations of the commission will be that we should abolish the system which differentiates between urban and rural living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ridiculous that in some parts of the country people who live in an area which is designated as a rural area have to come into a town or a city to sign on at the local exchange.  They have to travel greater distances than people living in urban areas.  Yet they qualify for a reduced rate.  That cannot be justified.  I hope the Minister will take a serious look at it.  A contribution is made by the local authority. Now that local government is to be restructured, this charge should be taken away from the local authority and funded by the Exchequer directly.  The local authorities get a payment and they are then supposed to make a contribution towards unemployment assistance.  This is creating frightful problems for them. I hope the commission will give some <Col N="129" /> consideration to this problem which has existed for too long.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which highlights the injustice of the system is that if you live in an urban or rural area and you are in receipt of benefit that does not matter, but if you are in receipt of assistance it does matter.  When your contributions run out you go onto a reduced scale.  You go two steps down rather than one.  I do not think we can continue with this system for much longer.  A figure of 7,000 people has been mentioned as qualifying for an urban rate.  There are many satellite towns in the Cork area.  In effect they are towns but they have not got urban status.  This affects the payments of people living in those areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to highlight another anomaly, that is, the difference between the short duration and the long duration entitlements.  I do not know the rationale for that, but it is creating a problem.  It is proving to be a disincentive to people who could get short term employment.  If you are in receipt of long term assistance and you are offered a job on a building site for the summer months, when you revert to unemployment assistance you have a short duration entitlement. This is a definite disincentive to anybody who wants to work.  This is happening right across the board.  It is one of the great injustices.  We are told it may be necessary for people to take short term employment, but there is no greater disincentive to people taking short term employment than this system.  I should like the Minister to take a careful look at that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the method by which single people living at home with their parents are assessed.  If the father has a reasonably good income that weighs against the entitlement of his son or daughter.  I know cases where boys and girls aged 19 or 20 years are in receipt of £7 a week.  A father in receipt of £120 a week is not in a position to maintain them, to clothe them and give them pocket money and allow them to live as near normal an existence as possible on £7 a week.  That is penal.  The whole system should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> A person who has reached the age of majority should have full entitlement.  If we are to treat a person as an adult we have to give him an adult entitlement, regardless of whether he is living at home with his parents or living alone in a flat. This could attack the fabric of the family. No young man of 18 or 19 years wants to go to an unemployment exchange and receive £5, £6 or £7 per week.  That is not a dignified way to treat young people.  I ask the Minister to look at that problem.</P>
    <P>I consider people in receipt of unemployment assistance and living alone to be the real poor in our society.  Like other speakers I should like to see all benefits raised to the level of the full non-contributory old pension.  That should be the Threshold.  With the new increase it will be £44 a week.  I appreciate that this would cost money, but there should be a gradual reduction in the difference between the various rates.  A single person living alone is very vulnerable. Women under the age of 58 years may have worked in a factory and then found themselves redundant.  They have no living alone allowance, no free electricity, nor free fuel, no free television licence. These have become accepted as the basic necessities and comforts of life. They are deprived of them.  As the years go on the Minister should close the gap in each budget.  An effort should be made in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson touched on something about which I have felt very strongly for a long time, that is, the prescribed relative allowance.  There is one sure way of reducing the cost of hospital bills and the cost of maintaining medical services, and that is to widen the scope of the prescribed relative allowance.  This would take many people out of hospital.  I could cite cases of people who are forced to give up work.  They endeavour to work and look after an elderly relative for a couple of hours.  If they were offered a reasonable allowance under this heading, they could cater for the needs of the elder members of their families.  That would be a very humane thing to do.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous scope for reducing the cost of geriatric care in hospitals <Col N="131" /> and bringing people home where they would not be disorientated as many of them are in hospitals and institutions. This could be of tremendous benefit to the community at large.  As it stands, the allowance is too restrictive and too meagre to encourage anybody to give up employment and look after elderly relatives.  I would support Deputy Wilson on any movement in that area.</P>
    <P>Something has come home rather forcibly to the inhabitants of Cork city as a result of the recent closures of Ford, Dunlop, Lunham, Verolme Cork Dockyard and the Eagle Printing Company.  A major problem has arisen regarding the method of assessment for unemployment assistance, because all redundancy payments are being taken into account in this assessment.  I know that a scale applies and the Minister gave me details of this when I raised the matter with him, but, I ask him to consider, first, completely disregarding the means test in this case. I am not saying this is peculiar to Cork alone, but in that city we have several thousand people who will never work again.  What we are saying to them, under the present system, is that while they have some money in the bank they are to draw on it and when they become penniless they will get their entitlement. There is no justification for that.  This should be viewed in a very charitable way.  We are not likely to provide jobs for most of these people, despite the best efforts of the IDA and other agencies. We will not get people over 50 years of age back to work again in significant numbers &mdash; that is the awful situation facing us.</P>
    <P>Those who received redundancy payments are now being penalised.  The money comes from two separate sources. First, there is the statutory entitlement and I suggest that it is quite illegal to take this into account.  This compares with a person who makes a contribution towards the social welfare system under PRSI. These people have contributed and no one has the right to interfere with that, just as a person has a right under the contributory pension scheme.  This is <Col N="132" /> something which must be looked into. There is a case.  Rather than go through a likely court procedure to determine whether the Government are within their rights in doing this, the Minister should take the initiative and I now ask him to do so.  We have redundancy payments above the statutory entitlement which should be charitably considered.</P>
    <P>Recent events are very annoying and disturbing.  On the one hand, the Government come in to bail out the major financial institution of the country and on the other they take from those who receive a once-off payment for life &mdash; a sum of money that they will never handle again. I am concerned about the method by which some of these people are being assessed, although I would not go as far as Deputy Wilson on this point.  They are being asked to produce receipts for every penny of redundancy money which they have received and spent.  This is quite degrading and humiliating to people who have in many cases contributed to the system since 1935-36 without a break.  I have seen men and women stripped of their dignity by the method of assessment at present in operation.  I ask the Minister, as a colleague and friend, to take these points into consideration before this Bill goes to the Seanad and comes back to the Dáil for final approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the points made by Deputy O'Sullivan are valid.  I would propose only to refer to one or two of these.  Specifically, I want to refer to the assessment of unemployment assistance for single men and women living at home.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned young people who are left with £4 to £6 a week as a result of the method of assessment.  It certainly is bad enough to have them depending on that kind of income, to clothe and feed themselves and pay for their keep.  However, it is even more serious when older men and women, in their thirties and forties, who are single and living at home are also assessed for unemployment assistance and money deducted from the basic level of assistance because they are living at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> In my contribution on Second Stage, I indicated one case where a 36 year old man is taking home £12 per week unemployment assistance while the eldest of his family, single and living at home and brothers and sisters younger than he are taking home six or seven times that amount because they are fortunate enough to have a job.  I put down an amendment No. 9, to section 4 of the Bill, which has been ruled out of order. The intention of that amendment was to urge the Minister to look into the manner in which unemployment assistance is assessed for single men and women living at home.  It adds nothing to their dignity when they have to sit at home week in week out, because they have not enough money to move outside the door.  A visit once a week to a cinema would virtually wipe out the money that they are receiving on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The basic premise behind the deduction of money because a person is living at home is incorrect.  It is no less expensive to be fed and clothed and do all the other things which one must do to have a decent standard of living while living in the parents' home than when living in a private or corporation flat.  If the Minister has the statistics available, could he indicate to the House how many men and women are in this category and how much it would cost to give them the full rate of unemployment assistance?  This amount is not great.  For long term unemployed, it has been increased to £34 by £9.95 in this Bill.  No one will be able to head off for the Bahamas on his or her holidays this year or next year as a result.</P>
    <P>The other point which I would put to the Minister is on the question of appeals against disallowance of unemployment assistance, and, indeed, in some cases unemployment benefit.  It has been my experience that a person with a fairly high level of education is better able to cope with unemployment assistance appeals procedures.  Apart from having such education, that person will not be intimidated by the whole process or by officialdom. He or she will be able to cope and, more often than not, will succeed in their <Col N="134" /> appeals.  I have come across quite a number of people who are intimidated by officialdom, whether or not that is intended.  The amount of information provided for people who are being disallowed benefit is minimal.  I have come across many people who, having been disallowed benefit, simply go home and do nothing further about it because they were unaware that they could take any steps to restore their benefit.</P>
    <P>There is need for a series of simply written information leaflets.  I stress &ldquo;simply written&rdquo; basic information leaflets on what are individuals rights in relation to the various benefits available. I know there are information leaflets available but they are certainly not simply written; one would need a degree from a third level college to understand most of them.  There are not many working class people with that kind of third level education who by and large are those dependent on such benefits.  Indeed I have come across some fairly well educated people who could not decipher some of the information leaflets available.</P>
    <P>There are two things the Minister should do.  First, he should look immediately at the question of allowing single people living at home unemployment assistance at the full rate and, second, set about providing basic information to people on their rights regarding the benefits available, ensuring that such information is readily available at labour exchanges, health boards, clinics and so on, where people are most in need of it. Were the Minister to do both of those it would constitute a marked improvement in the whole of the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>A number of amendments in the name of Deputy McCarthy have been ruled out of order.  They dealt with section 3, in which he asked that payments of social assistance be made from April rather than from July.  They were ruled out on the basis that they involved a potential charge on revenue. While I accept that the payment of 6 per cent from the beginning of April for the full year would constitute a charge on revenue, if the Minister were to come <Col N="135" /> into the House and say he was giving 4½ per cent from April for a year that would not constitute an extra charge on the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, potential, but if the Minister were to come in and tell people exactly what he was giving them, which is a 4½ per cent increase in social welfare assistance for the full year rather than telling them he was giving them 6 per cent &mdash; which is not in accordance with facts because he is giving them a 6 per cent increase for nine months of the year only &mdash; that would be more honest. It is important that people realise they are receiving only 4½ per cent.  There are justifiable reasons that such payments be made from 1 April, indeed why payments of 6 per cent or more should become effective on 1 April, this year more than any other.  It is extraordinary that the Minister is reducing the rate of increase in successive years.  This year we are down to a 6 per cent increase for short term recipients and 6½ per cent for long term recipients.  We are now talking about the worst off sectors of our community, the elderly, widows, deserted wives and particularly the unemployed, the majority of whom are unemployed through no fault of theirs who suddenly find a very sharp drop in their level of income.  After their right to unemployment benefit has been exhausted they must then depend on unemployment assistance.  The longer these people are on unemployment assistance naturally the more difficult it becomes for them to manage on the money available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons this year why a larger increase would have been necessary merely to ensure that such people had an adequate standard of living.  For example, during last year the Government removed half the food subsidies, putting up the price of food, and there has been no compensation to social welfare recipients therefor.  As a result of pressure from Deputies in this House the <Col N="136" /> Minister introduced the family income supplement two months earlier, following the removal of half the food subsidies; but that was of no benefit to the people about whom we are speaking here in section 3 &mdash; for example, those in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Irrespective of how low their income was they were excluded from the receipt of the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>There have been increases in value-added tax with no extra allowance to those on social assistance on account thereof.  Indeed, those on short-term assistance have been excluded by direction of the Minister from participating in the national free fuel scheme, which is most extraordinary.  That scheme allowed discretion to the local community welfare officer and the relevant health boards as to who should and should not receive free fuel vouchers.  In the two years since the Minister came to office the circular to health boards has been exactly similar to that of his predecessor except for the insertion of one paragraph excluding recipients of unemployment assistance and disability benefit from participation in the national free fuel scheme which imposes an intolerable burden on many of them, particularly those with families.  As I said on Second Stage to the Minister in the case of a family, where the husband, wife and four children had £84 a week, they could afford only one bag of coal a week, which lasted three days, leaving them without any form of heating for the remaining four days of the week throughout the winter.  They were excluded from participation in this scheme.</P>
    <P>There is provision also for an increase in the supplementary welfare allowances. I would ask the Minister to examine the whole administration of the supplementary welfare allowance.  For example, it is difficult to understand why in County Cavan there are only 55 recipients of social welfare allowance, the lowest in the country, which is practically half the figure two years ago before this recession really hit hard.</P>
    <P>There is an area warranting examination. It is not sufficient merely to increase <Col N="137" /> the amount such people may receive.  We need to ensure that people entitled to such assistance do receive it.  The delays in the processing of claims should also be examined by the Minister.  All of this is relevant to the delivery of the whole of the social welfare scheme.  It is disappointing that there are no innovations evident for those dependent on social welfare assistance similar to those in the past, particularly when the leader of our party as Minister for Health introduced the free telephone rental scheme.  Everybody knows its benefits now with these brutal, vicious attacks on the elderly in rural areas.  The Government should be capable of introducing some particular benefit in kind, as happened in the past, to ensure that these people have an adequate standard of living.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the whole question of providing sufficient benefits for old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives, blind pensioners and those on unemployment assistance. They should be able to enjoy a normal standard of living.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with a number of points raised.  Deputy Wilson and I have an occupational disease in that we tend to let our tongues run away with us now and again.  He indulged in regrettable rhetoric when he said that social welfare officers tended to behave in a leech-like manner when they assessed people for assistance schemes. There are 3,500 people employed in the Department of Social Welfare and very many of them live in the same areas as the people they assess.  To my knowledge they do not behave in an irresponsible way and do not bring excessive pressures to bear on people when it comes to assessing income.  Irish people have an enormous propensity for not disclosing their income and, even when they are entitled to benefits, they are reluctant to do so. Giving information to an official is regarded as a social sin and the attitude frequently is that officials are not entitled to this information.  In a social democracy, where we try to redistribute resources to those in greatest need, there has to be some way of assessing incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> I assure the House that the Secretary of my Department and the Assistant Secretary, who is responsible for personnel, would not in any circumstances tolerate discourtesy by any officer of the Department towards anyone in the discharge of his duties.  I can count on my fingers the number of cases where Deputies or individual citizens have complained about an official behaving in an outrageous manner.  All complaints are thoroughly investigated on the spot in the Department. The officials are interviewed, statements are taken and, when there is cause for censure or reprimand, disciplinary action is taken immediately.  However, I stress that such occasions are rare and I frequently have to defend officials who are abused in employment exchanges. They are subjected to enormous pressures when they seek information and have grounds for doing so.  On occasions they are physically threatened and, in Border counties, their lives have been threatened.  I want to stand up for officials who have manfully defended themselves in situations of that kind.  There are enormous pressures on the staff of the Department of Social Welfare, especially with the growth in the numbers claiming who are entitled to benefits and whose claims have to be processed as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>Nearly every Minister for Social Welfare dreams up a new scheme and there is a multiplicity of these at present.  There is no need for information to be unavailable regarding the means test as the Department have a wide range of leaflets which give details of the means test and other schemes.  A special booklet was produced last year to explain how the means test operates in the case of unemployment assistance.  It shows how capital, cash income and income from farming are assessed.  The booklet was widely distributed to Members of the House of the Oireachtas and I will make copies available to any Deputy in any reasonable numbers which they require to distribute to their constituents.</P>
    <P>There are one million people dependent on various forms of social welfare and we have the highest degree of servicing <Col N="139" /> our social welfare system compared to any other country in Europe.  We have over 200 Members of Parliament, the highest ratio in Europe for any electorate. There are about 900 councillors who daily serve their constituents and impart all kinds of information.  We have a multiplicity of public servants from health boards to social welfare offices servicing the electorate; and no other country in Europe has a backup in Parliament of about 300 people with electric typewriters despatching letters day and night to various State agencies.</P>

Some of them even write to the Ceann Comhairle.  I often receive ten letters about one person.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point you are making.  In dealing with the question of social assistance payments, I wish to make the point that anyone in the country can almost instantaneously find out their precise entitlements under the social assistance scheme and, if the Deputies have any difficulty in getting the information, I will do my best to help in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of the urban-rural unemployment assistance difference.  This problem is recognised. It is being considered by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The supplementary welfare allowances rates are linked to the rural unemployment assistance rates and any change in the unemployment assistance scheme would have a knock-on effect so it would be better to await the overall review from the commission rather than to make <i>ad hoc</i> changes in respect of the urban-rural differences. I expect to have the report of the commission shortly.</P>
      <P>The social assistance schemes in general, including the differences in the rates between old age pensions and the other payments as well as the question of a possible wider role for the prescribed relative allowance are being examined also by the commission.  I will be urging them to expedite their report on these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the question of the assessment for assistance of single persons living at home.  In calculating the means of such applicants, account must be taken by some way or other of benefit accruing to the claimant by reason of his residing at home.  The legislation does not specify the method by which the means should be calculated.  Each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household in question and the circumstances of the applicant.  Therefore, there are administrative arrangements for setting standards in this respect so as to ensure that the level of assistance arrived at takes account of the standard of living enjoyed by the applicant by reason of his residing at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose is to endeavour to achieve <Col N="141" /> some degree of equity between applicants whose parents are in relatively comfortable circumstances and those whose parents are in very poor circumstances. This may not be the most satisfactory way of determining the amounts that ought to be paid but without some such criterion young people living in relatively affluent circumstances would be entitled automatically to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are relatively poor.  In the case of wage earning families, the method of calculation is to arrive at the net income of the parents, that is, the gross income less income tax and PRSI contributions, an amount to provide for rent or mortgage repayments and a set parental allowance and to divide what is left among the non-earning members of the family, including the applicant. The sum to be paid takes into account the value of the board and lodgings. Generally, the amount is about 12½ per cent of net income and that can be considered a reasonable assessment.</P>
    <P>If we were to abolish that means of assessment I do not know how many would automatically have their names entered on the live register overnight. The last investigation in this area that I can recall was in 1980 when the Department of Finance with the Department of Social Welfare undertook that type of investigation.  It revealed that approximately an additional 20,000 people would automatically be entitled to unemployment assistance if there was to be no question of taking into account benefit derived by way of board and lodgings. The estimated cost of such a change at that time was £21,500,000.  Perhaps we would be talking about double that amount now and of course the numbers would be very much higher.  The whole question of this means of assessment is being examined also by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Deputies will be aware that the commission are reporting this year.</P>
    <P>On that aspect of assessment, the same would apply in terms of farming families. It is not possible to give unemployment assistance to the son of a farmer in the absence of some assessment of yearly <Col N="142" /> income from the farm.  As in the other case, that sum is divided between the parents and the dependent members of the household and on that basis an assessment is made in respect of the applicant. That point must be stressed.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length about assistance schemes but equally I make the point, one that I have made here repeatedly, that our pension provisions on the contributory side, and on the non-contributory side too, are in many instances as good as, and in some cases substantially better, than the rates in Northern Ireland or in the UK in cash terms.</P>
    <P>On the contributory side, 200,000 persons are not affected in any way in their entitlement by reason of savings.  So far as the non-contributory side is concerned there are 140,000 pensioners who are in receipt of their pensions as a result of means testing but complaints from those people are few and far between, despite the impression that one might get from time to time.  Savings are taken into account in calculating the amount of a non-contributory pension but people can have quite large amounts by way of savings and still qualify for pensions.  For example, a single person could qualify for a full old age non-contributory pension even if he has up to £2,987.50 in the bank but has no other means.  A married man can qualify for the full non-contributory old age pension while having up to £5,975 in the bank and he would be drawing interest on that, too.  I would not mind having that much in the bank myself. Therefore, the means test scheme is generous in that regard.  A person who is single and living alone may qualify for a minimum non-contributory old age pension even if he has up to £22,747.50 in the bank but has no other means.  A couple can have £45,495 and still qualify for a pension.  These amounts will be increased from next July as a result of the increased rates provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan raised the question of redundancy payments assessments. This matter is being reviewed and I have been asked to prepare a general report for the Government on it.  I have had views about redundancy payments for <Col N="143" /> many years.  I have been involved in many negotiations in the trade union movement and I was one of the advocates of the introduction of redundancy payments. The assessment of redundancy payments in calculating means for unemployment assistance is a contentious issue and is very difficult.  It is linked directly with the calculation of means for pensions and for other forms of social welfare entitlement.  Therefore, it has to be reviewed on a broad basis and not solely in respect of a lump sum payment to an individual with regard to assessment for unemployment assistance.  It would be difficult to ignore totally the question of capital in that regard.  Capital sums in terms of non-contributory old age pensions would be affected and there would be enormous implications for the Exchequer right across the board if redundancy payments were not included. However, the matter is under review and I have had discussions about it with the trade unions in the recent past.</P>

      <P>During the debate the free fuel scheme was mentioned but the Minister did not refer to it in his reply.  If a person is living in Dublin city and is drawing assistance or benefit he or she will qualify for the scheme but that does not apply when the person concerned is living in the county.  I am sure the Minister will agree there is an anomaly here and I should like some information on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the frustration of many Deputies with regard to that point and also with regard to the two existing separate fuel schemes.  However, there is a serious problem, namely that a large number of people by virtue of their status alone qualify automatically for free fuel and if there is to be rationalisation of the scheme that aspect must be included.  No Minister for Social Welfare so far has succeeded in convincing the Government of the day of the way that rationalisation should take place.  In my <Col N="144" /> view such rationalisation should be introduced but in regard to people who currently have automatic entitlement because of their status their case would have to be reconsidered.  At the moment no matter where such people live, or with whom they live or what may be their income, they are entitled to free fuel. That would have to be changed if the scheme were rationalised on a national basis.  Naturally, the first people to kick up about that would be those who would lose while those who would gain would be pleased but would not necessarily say much about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that income from assistance should have some bearing on the matter. I know of a former employee of Clondalkin Paper Mills who is drawing about £60 per week in assistance to support himself, his wife and his unemployed son but he is not entitled to free fuel because he is living in County Dublin.  I am sure the Minister will accept there is no justice in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I throw the question back to the Deputy.  Let us take the case of a widow who has a contributory widow's pension, who is living at home in comfortable circumstances in Dublin city, who has a full time job and who qualifies automatically for free fuel.  The Deputy has spoken about a person with a low income who is living on unemployment assistance in the County Dublin area and who does not have automatic entitlement to free fuel.  Will he not agree that, relatively speaking, one person is given quite exceptionally favourable treatment as against the other person? When the question is raised the answer is given that everyone should be entitled to free fuel.  I do not have before me a figure giving the cost of the free fuel scheme but it is running at well over £20 million.  If that scheme were extended on a universal basis one would have to find another £15 million or £20 million and there is no way one could justify such a scheme on a national basis without some kind of assessment of means.  I share the <Col N="145" /> concern of the Deputy.  The matter has been considered on a number of occasions by former Ministers for Social Welfare, including Fianna Fáil Ministers who considered the matter on three or four occasions.  However, on each occasion the various Governments have shied away from taking what should be a fair decision.</P>

      <P>If I write to the Minister in relation to this case perhaps he will have it examined?  I am sure he will agree that the point made by him in relation to the person who is obtaining a contributory widow's pension does not solve the problem of the person to whom I referred.  There should be some flexibility in relation to this scheme.  The man I mentioned was employed for more than 30 years and he paid social welfare contributions during that time.  He became unemployed not through his own fault but because the industry in question closed down.  Yet, what benefits does he get?  I will write to the Minister about this matter.  I may have asked a parliamentary question already about it but I will send him all the information I have.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter sympathetically. If a person drawing a contributory widow's pension and who is also in employment can get free fuel, surely the person to whom I have referred should be entitled to it also?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with the Minister that in the social welfare system means must be tested and that that is not an easy thing to do.  I disagree with the Minister as to the volume of complaints and the dissatisfaction at the delays in processing applications.  If the Minister is not directly aware of the frustrations caused he must know about it from the volume of Parliamentary Questions and representations relating to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the staff of the Department who are courteous and efficient and who are doing their best given the resources available to them.  It is not all the fault of the deciding officers and the people assessing the means.  Because of the number of schemes, the volume of appeals and the large number of applicants there is an understandable delay in making decisions and this creates a huge amount of dissatisfaction.  I would remind some of the officials of the Department that it is their job to assist people with their claims and not to harass them. There is widespread anxiety at the manner in which a minority of officials are dealing with cases.  Perhaps these <Col N="147" /> officials are frustrated in their work due to staff shortages.  There are various schemes necessitating different methods of assessment and it is not easy for them to come to a fair decision.  If we succeed in making the Minister aware of the problems and of the widespread dissatisfaction and if we succeed in bringing home to him the need to remedy the situation we will have been successful in this limited debate.  It is time that there was decentralisation of the decision-making process in the Department.  There should be a decision making process at local level.  This would cut down on delays and alleviate much of the hardship.  It would certainly minimise the correspondence and the pressure on public representatives, county councils and on the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty-five is the end of the Decade for Women, and one major inhibiting factor in regard to Ireland's signing the UN declaration on the elimination of discrimination against women is our social security system.  Because of the differing rates of payments and the special conditions applying to women, particularly married women, in relation to qualification for unemployment assistance and a variety of other discriminations in the social assistance area there is an urgent need to tackle and resolve this problem so that we can eliminate this impediment to our being a party to the UN declaration.</P>
    <P>The Minister would make a major contribution to the social welfare code if he tackled this area of discrimination against women.  Nineteen eighty-five is an opportune time, the end of the Decade for Women, to tackle this issue.</P>
    <P>Recently a review has taken place in relation to the prescribed relative allowance and the allowance has been cancelled for many pensioners.  I am aware of a substantial number of cases where this allowance has been discontinued even though it had been granted for the past two or three years after a thorough examination. Because of expenditure saving techniques employed in the Department a large number of pensioners have been <Col N="148" /> refused the allowance, even though their conditions have not altered upwards or in some cases the conditions, if anything, have deteriorated.  I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps immediately to curtail the activities of officials in his Department who are reinvestigating claims which had already been favourably decided.  This is an area where there has been argument as to whether or not officials at local level should have discretion in making the decision to pay the allowance. The system is clear-cut, the conditions are printed in the social welfare booklets, but many pensioners who were in receipt of that allowance have had it discontinued for no apparent reason other than that it was a cost-saving device initiated by an official in the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to stop that immediately and have decisions announced on all appeals before the Department.  The allowances should be restored because the appeals adjudicated upon were upheld.  In many cases the same official was involved.  The position is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to highlight the fact that the means testing system is in total disarray. Urgent action is needed to deal with this before people are driven to the point of frustration and annoyance.  The Minister should try to decentralise the decision making process in some way.  If he does that, many of the problems that arise can be rectified locally and people will not have to go through the massive bureaucracy which is stifling the system and causing severe hardship for many old and handicapped people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with two points referred to by the Minister.  The Minister indicated that a lot of information was available to social welfare applicants and that it could be made available to Members.  I am sure the Minister would prefer if Deputies were not involved in the whole process of writing letters to this and that Department trying to sort out the entitlements of applicants or recipients or trying to deal with appeals.  It would be better <Col N="149" /> where a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance is disallowed if he is advised fully of his rights in regard to appealing the decision.  People should be made aware of the basis of their appeal, what they should do and what they are entitled to claim.  It would be better if a person on unemployment assistance or disability benefit was advised fully of their rights rather than being told that they can appeal.  At present that is almost all the information they are given apart from being given an address to which they should send their appeal.</P>
      <P>It is as a result of that lack of information that Deputies and councillors get involved in this treadmill of writing letters, making phone calls and doing work which they should not be directly involved in.  Obviously, there will be cases where Deputies and councillors should be involved.  For instance, a Deputy or councillor should make representations to ensure that the correct benefit is paid and that the correct procedures are pursued. However, a lot of the time wasting and time consuming letter writing referred to by the Minister could be avoided if recipients were given information where they need it most, at the labour exchanges or when they are notified that a disability benefit has been disallowed.  Like the Minister I would like to see an end to this clientist process we are all so heavily involved in.</P>
      <P>In many cases success depends on whether one is literate or pushy enough to go after an appeal in the correct way. That is unfair.  I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a fair degree of illiteracy among the population in regard to such matters and that not everybody is prepared to get annoyed or up on their high horses when told abruptly that they are no longer entitled to a benefit.  Many people go home and assume they are not entitled to the benefit.  There should be a process of ensuring that people get what they are entitled to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of assessment of means for unemployment assistance for single people living at home.  I go along with the argument that where a person is in receipt of cash <Col N="150" /> income there are few grounds for ignoring that income.  Obviously, there is a case to be made in regard to redundancy benefits, tax rebates and so on.  I must argue strongly in favour of the single person who is living at home and is forced to depend on the charity of a brother, sister, father or mother in order to lead any kind of half decent existence.  It is not reasonable or humane to expect an adult man or woman in their mid-thirties or forties to live on £12 per week cash.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that there should be a total overnight transfer on to benefit for everybody over 18 but that we devise a system to provide at least a basic minimum income for adults.  The £34 or £35 which single people receive if they are not living at home is a bare basic minimum income.  The Minister should improve on that amount.  I realise that the commission will be reporting this year but, given the speed with which such matters are dealt with, it is highly unlikely that legal changes or a new social welfare system will be introduced by the time the next Social Welfare Bill comes before the House.  The Minister should ensure that single adult men and women depending on unemployment assistance are given a basic income so that they can survive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Daly raised the question of the prescribed relative allowance.  People who apply for that allowance are subject to a means test such as small farmers living with their elderly parents.  I am aware of a small farmer whose application for the allowance was turned down.  I felt strongly about that decision and I made representations to the Minister.  The matter was investigated, but unfortunately the Minister in his reply said he could not pay the allowance because the individual was not giving full time care and attention to his parents.  I can assure the House that the individual concerned was giving full time care and attention to his father and mother as well as looking after his small farm.  People who care for their parents are entitled to the few pounds under the prescribed relative allowance scheme.  As well as that they are keeping their fathers <Col N="151" /> and mothers out of institutions and looking after them.  In rural Ireland with the number of robberies of elderly people at the moment, it is wonderful to see the sons and daughters living with their fathers and mothers.  I feel very strongly about this.  The Minister should examine it again to make sure that these bachelors or spinsters as the case may be are entitled to the prescribed relative allowance. Deputy Daly raised this and I want to follow it up.</P>
      <P>Another question is that of wives who were working, are now at home and have drawn maternity allowance. When they go back to work there is no job for them. When they sign for unemployment benefit they must get letters from the National Manpower Service and from employers stating that the job is no longer there, and they are not qualified for the unemployment benefit for which they apply.</P>
      <P>Those are two points I wanted to make and I hope that the Minister will reconsider in particular the prescribed relative allowance for the dependants of elderly people who are living alone at the moment.</P>

I have already expressed the concerned that I share with Deputy De Rossa for single people living at home, but at least they have the benefit of family support.  The real poor in our society are single people who must live alone and who do not qualify for social welfare benefits that other pensioners enjoy such as free fuel and electricity allowance.  I ask the Minister if a special case could be made for them.  To expect somebody who is on short duration unemployment assistance to survive on £32.75 a week is not realistic.  I suggest that we increase the amount to the level of the non-contributory old age pension of £44 per week.  I would like the Minister to go back to the Cabinet with proposals <Col N="152" /> for the care of this section who are the most vulnerable in our community today. I accept that we must cater for the elderly to ensure that they end their days in dignity, but we should not let people stand and wait until they reach the age of 66 years before they can achieve any level of dignity, and that is what this system is doing at the moment.  Again I ask the Minister sincerely to make a special case for single people, men and women under the age of 50.  Women at 58 years enjoy a slightly improved benefit but it is not sufficient.  These people have no fuel, electricity, television or telephone allowance and many people under the qualifying age need a telephone because they live in isolated areas.  I hope immediate action will be taken on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he would make a submission to the Cabinet regarding the assessment of redundancy payments, and I welcome that.  I would like him to accept my suggestion regarding the method of assessment, that the Revenue Commissioners take into account lump sum payments of this nature.  Up to £6,000 is ignored for this purpose and I suggest that that be increased to £10,000 if there is repayment from pension contributions. Following the first year of unemployment there is a further clawback, a matter of top slicing in the second year of unemployment. We cannot, on the one hand, say that the Revenue Commissioners will accept this and, on the other hand, the Department of Social Welfare will not accept it.  There is a contradiction there. I would like that to be taken into account in the submission to the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken about the prescribed relative allowance, in support of Deputy Wilson.  Here is another anomaly in that the allowance is paid to the pensioner. First and foremost, the allowance is not adequate, as I have pointed out.  Here is tremendous scope to reduce our hospital bills in the area of geriatric care, but the small allowance paid is creating real social problems at the moment and the elderly person is not inclined to hand it over to the person caring for him or her. If the allowance is to be given it should be to the person who is providing the care <Col N="153" /> rather than to the pensioner.  Conflict arises from time to time regarding this. The sum is minute but all this should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you, Sir, that I will not delay the House very long.  I am resisting all the invitations that might arise from the multiplicity of cases that I deal with throughout the year.  Rather I will concentrate very briefly on one.  I state unashamedly that when last I brought this case before the House I expressed to the Minister here and outside my disappointment that he had not as a socialist &mdash; a man who has a reputation for appealing for people; even if he has not, arising from the office he holds he should have it &mdash; a feeling for particular cases.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the case is that of two people, more especially one, the lady, a young lady in my constituency who married a chap who is in a wheelchair.  When she married him he was in receipt of two allowances, an invalidity allowance of £40 per week and a mobility allowance of £6 odd per week, giving him a total income of £46 per week, a certain sense of independence and what this House would regard as the minimum financial allowance a young man who has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair should get.  He had what I would regard as the good fortune to meet with a young lady who fell in love with him and was happy to marry him.  She was and is working in not very attractive employment which requires her to get up at 5.30 a.m. and carry out whatever duties are necessary so that she can report to the local bakery where she works until 3 p.m. each day.  Living with the chap in the wheelchair before he married was his invalid father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the opportunity to co-operate with them and Dublin Corporation in providing a special extension to the house that would help Terry in the matter of his disability.  Terry and his father are now living in the house with Terry's wife Margaret. After he married, Terry was full of the joys of being a married man. Unfortunately he reported that he was <Col N="154" /> married.  Arising from that the two allowances which he received were taken from him.  I let the House ponder on that. Anyone I mentioned that to said it could not happen and that there must have been a mistake.  There was no mistake. The Minister confirmed that this was as it had to be.  This great State and a Minister who boasts of the finances he handles and the staff who work for him can justify removing from a chap in a wheelchair the only independence he had which amounted to £40 odd per week.  I criticise the Minister and in so doing hope that he might exercise the powers he has at this stage.</P>
    <P>As a junior Minister there were times when my civil servants reminded me, and indeed threatened me, that I could not create a precedent.  There were several occasions when I was able to identify a special case and was only creating a precedent for anything similar that might occur.  If the Minister says a shoal of these cases will arise I could understand how that could make a demand on his resources. However, there are not too many cases of a young lady marrying a chap in a wheelchair and he being deprived of his allowances.  She works in a local bakery. I should not like to predict ill health for anyone but if this situation continues she will be on unemployment benefit before long.</P>
    <P>What annoyed me was, having raised the case here, the Minister in defence of the appalling situation reminded me that Terry and Margaret were living with his father and so they should be thankful because, he presumed, they had no great rent demands made on them.  Within a month of my raising it here &mdash; I do not say it was the Minister or his Department who sent out word &mdash; a Dublin Corporation inspector visited Terry, his wife and invalid father and said that when Terry and his father lived alone they were on a minimum rent of £1.60 but now because Margaret was working and received a gross pay of £90 odd she was now the major income earner in the house.  He said that under the differential rent system the rent must be increased to £16.50.  I hope it was not as a result of <Col N="155" /> my raising this case here that people got on the blower and asked Dublin Corporation to examine the new position in the Boland household at 1 Casement Green, Finglas.</P>
    <P>What is the point in us speaking about our regard for people?  Each Deputy would regard his or her case as being the most important one.  However, I ask Deputies listening to me, the Chair and the Minister if they have ever come across a similar case.  Apart from the material and financial side of it take the social and psychological side.  This is a newly married couple setting up their home and straight away the State indicates its acknowledgment of this new union by saying to Terry that his penalty for getting married is that he loses his two allowances. The State tells Terry Boland senior that at present he is paying £1.60 rent but because he has admitted Margaret to his house to look after Terry and be his companion the rent will be £16.50.  There is no need to make a meal out of a case like that.</P>
    <P>I still have faith in the Minister.  Perhaps when he replies my residue of faith will disappear but he will not lose any sleep over that and neither shall I.  I ask him to indicate to the House the inhibitions which he has in respect of the restoration of £40 per week to Terry Boland. He can tell me that the regulations are there and add sauce to it by saying they were in existence under my leader, Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Health.  He can give me that historical treatment in an attempt to exonerate himself from the blame I attach to any Minister who would tolerate this situation.</P>
    <P>The facts are precisely as I have indicated to the House.  There are other facts which are not material to this discussion. I will not bring them into consideration or use them for any purpose.</P>

      <P>Apparently the Minister <Col N="156" /> is inviting me to tell the House that this man of 29 years of age finds himself in the position he is in because of the fact that he was in an accident in a car that was not properly licensed or insured and which was not his own.  I give the Minister all that and let him savour it all anyway he likes.  It now makes the Minister less entitled to have that position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going on memory but as far as I am aware the person concerned was on disability person's maintenance allowance and not invalidity pension as the Deputy stated. The Deputy's facts are not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as far as I recall. The Deputy raised this matter on the adjournment.  He was not on an invalidity pension but on DPMA.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They are two different issues.  The person concerned was involved in a car accident.  He was driving the car illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As a consequence, he tragically received a very severe disability which confines him to a wheelchair for life.  He was not insured.  He received no compensation and had no means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to judge anyone who drives without insurance. These are the realities of life.  He applied for a DPMA on the basis of a nil means assessment.  He received it in accordance with the regulations which <Col N="157" /> have been in existence since the inception of this scheme.  I say that because it was strongly put to me in the House that I had changed the arrangements in relation to this matter affecting the Deputy's constituent. He was also in receipt of a small mobility allowance which is £300 a year or £6 a week.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation out of their own resources at the request of the family &mdash; I put it on record that I am going on memory &mdash; built an extension to the house especially for him, spent public funds in so doing and gave him every possible assistance.  He married.  The DPMA system is an income related payment to persons who are disabled.  His wife had a gross income in the region of £100, or £105 or £108 per week.  She was in the bakery and confectionery trade. Her net take home pay was around £96 per week.</P>
      <P>I had nothing whatever to do with the revision of rent.  I have no function in that matter.  The case received so much publicity here and in the national newspapers that it would have to be an unusual rent officer who would not see a specially built extension.  Possibly the couple have medical cards.  I do not know the exact amount, but rent would be taken into account.  I understand that when he was in receipt of DPMA there was no rent involved on his part.  The rent was paid by his parents.  There was no discrimination against him.  There is no discrimination against any other person in a wheelchair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister indicating to me, as he inferred the other night, that because of the nature of the complaint and because of the manner in which this appalling accident occurred, he feels less committed to this unfortunate man than to somebody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not apply in another case because the person would have got £50,000 compensation.  I do not know why the Minister mentioned it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If an insured person <Col N="158" /> was driving an insured car he would probably have received substantial motor vehicle compensation and would be deemed to have a substantial income and would be ineligible for DPMA.  By virtue of the fact that he was uninsured and driving a car illegally &mdash; I understand the car was not his own &mdash; he had no income and he automatically qualified for DPMA.  That is relevant to the assessment of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give way to me?  The Minister has made my case.  He has told me that, if this young man had been injured while driving his own car, under the law he would have obtained a substantial amount of money presumably to help him to live for the rest of his life.  The Minister is now telling me that because the accident happened in the fashion it did happen that young man is not entitled to any consideration. I thank the Minister for having made my case even better than I could make it myself.  He would have got £80,000, £90,000 or £100,000.  Irrespective of whether he married that would have been the amount he would have got to help him to live as normal a life as possible. The Minister is now saying he gets nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not got the point.  There is a family income involved.  He is married and his spouse has an income.  Under the regulations, which were brought in by the Deputy's own party and are of long standing, the family income is taken into account, the income of himself and his spouse.  If he were not married and had no income, he would automatically qualify for either the full rate of DPMA or the reduced rate, depending on his income.  Does the Deputy want to bring in a system under which anybody with a disability is automatically entitled to a payment irrespective of means?  The Deputy is free to advocate that, but there is a problem.  I would have to find about £500 million because automatically every non-contributory old age pensioner on reduced rate would have to get the full rate, every <Col N="159" /> widow on reduced rate would automatically have to get the full rate, and everybody on reduced rate of unemployment assistance would have to get the full rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said Fianna Fáil introduced this scheme.  There are times when we are told from the other side of the House that what was good enough for Fianna Fáil is not good enough for them.  Would the Minister consider introducing a new regulation? A boy in a wheelchair and a girl may marry and not have a nest egg available to them.  I do not think there would be more than half a dozen such cases.  It would help the Minister's reputation if he would introduce a provision that where a boy confined to a wheelchair and with no income marries, that regulation will not apply.  Would it cost all that much money if the Minister were to make that amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to change that regulation.  That would mean that everybody would have an automatic entitlement to a similar payment on a non-means test basis.  Admittedly, I have not the full facts in front of me, but the man concerned would appear to be entitled to a medical card, to all wheelchair needs, medical, drug and other disability needs.  In the event of his wife ceasing to be employed and thus having no income, she would be entitled to a dependency payment for him on her insurance when equal treatment comes into operation, as it will in due course this year.  Her husband would be regarded as a full dependant of hers on a reciprocal basis and payment would be made.  That is one good reason for bringing in equality legislation.  The Deputy cannot argue that this family are in any way discriminated against.  They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair and our spokesman for allowing me to monopolise the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to be as brief as possible and just touch on one of the many anomalies which exist under the <Col N="160" /> present structure of the social welfare system.  Any Member looking back on discussions which usually follow the budget will find the same questions being asked about the means test.  How often have Deputy O'Sullivan's questions been asked in the matter of redundancy payments? The people involved here have been contributing all their lives to the social welfare system and when they receive redundancy payments they are means-tested.  The Minister has had ample opportunity to create a new social welfare structure, more modern in its concept.  The present scheme is open to all kinds of abuse and is riddled with anomalies.  Yet, continually we come into this House and ask the same questions about why a certain person is not entitled to this or that benefit.  I appeal to the Minister, as a Labour Party member, to create a new and more positive structure.</P>
      <P>I go along with Deputy O'Sullivan in his remarks about the means test.  The gap should be narrowed between non-contributory and contributory pensions. On the other hand, the contributors may say that they have contributed all their lives to the social welfare system and how is somebody who has never contributed on the same income as they?  Here again we are talking about the anomaly created by the means test in the present structure. We cannot cope with this problem because we have mass unemployment. The Ford worker after 15 months will be means tested and likewise the Dunlop worker.  Any worker in any part of the country comes under the means test 15 months after his contributions end.  Every year more people come in under the means test and we talk about the complaints. Of course, there are complaints because there is not additional staff to meet the challenge of the demand made by the applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork city is the worst area with regard to unemployment and how many additional assessment officers were recruited to meet that demand?  Deputy O'Sullivan and many others have often tried to establish why a person is waiting three or four months for a decision on his or her case.  Yet those are people who have <Col N="161" /> contributed all their lives to social welfare and there must be positive records of that in the Department.  Why are Government officials haring down to their locality, knocking on their doors and asking so many questions, when everything is on file in the Department?</P>
    <P>There is some confusion about the next matter to which I will refer, and I hope for some clarification.  A boy and girl in receipt of unemployment assistance may become frustrated and bored at having to queue at a labour exchange and may decide for the following two years, since they have no hope of getting employment, to continue to advance their education. They return to school, to some evening classes, but immediately their unemployment assistance is withdrawn. When they inquire about it they are told that they are not available for work. Young people that I know of had informed the local officer that they were returning to school and that if employment became available they would take it up.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter last year to the Minister and he received it, I thought, sympathetically.  We are not talking here about people actively employed in community work.  If they have a letter from, or a form filled in by, the community welfare officer they are still entitled to unemployment assistance.  We are talking here about young people who are advancing their education, many preparing for the leaving certificate.  Could the Minister comment on this, because it is vitally important?  This is keeping our young people off the streets and having them doing something worth-while for themselves in promoting their education. They should be encouraged to do this.  I ask the Minister the exact position because there is some confusion among the different branches dealing with social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to have additional staff recruited for the Cork area to meet the huge backlog of applications for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister some time ago, when in <Col N="162" /> response to a suggestion of ours he pointed out the enormous cost, it appears he has become afflicted by a very heavy dose of fiscal rectitude.  The Minister for Finance appears to have passed it on to him, he appears to have been a receptive subject, his antibodies are not resisting the disease.</P>
      <P>The point the Minister made about representations of elected Members here and elsewhere unfortunately reflects the breakdown in the system, how it has failed to answer effectively and with any degree of speed whether a person is eligible for whatever social welfare payment they are claiming.  As I said on Second Stage, to a large extent the system has broken down.  As a consequence many applicants must wait interminable periods of time to have established whether or not they are eligible for the benefits for which they apply.  While many are indeed eligible, they must still await many weeks for, say, disability benefit, unemployment benefit or old age pension payments; and many are not aware that in the interim they could claim supplementary welfare allowance, that is if they are eligible and have no other income.  Therefore many, while awaiting the processing of their claims, bite into whatever meagre saving they have.</P>
      <P>It should be advantageous for such people to be more clearly informed that while awaiting the processing of their claims, they could claim supplementary welfare.  This matter has necessitated people approaching politicians of all shades.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that the backbenchers on his side of the House write to him as much as do Members on this side of the House, that it is not one-way traffic.  All one need do is note the number of questions for written reply to the Department of Social Welfare on any one day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have endeavoured very often to have problems resolved through the straightforward political channels, making telephone calls to the relevant Departments. I have never bothered the Minister very much by letter, because when I wrote to him he never replied &mdash; obviously he did <Col N="163" /> not think too highly of my representations. Since then I have elicited information by way of telephone call or direct contact with the Department involved, particularly in regard to disability benefits.  Despite such representations applicants' claims were not being processed and they were experiencing interminable delays.</P>
    <P>How often were payments not made because the Department thought that Johnny So-and-So or Mary So-and-So had an inadequate number of contributions? But when Deputies have had enough of that and submit questions for written reply, suddenly payments are made much more rapidly, suddenly the Department are able to establish that Johnny So-and-So or Mary So-and-So satisfied their requirements.  I make that point because I should like to eliminate the task of submitting unnecessary questions for written reply and I know many of my colleagues feel similarly.  That is an area the Minister and his Department might examine.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated earlier that there were 3,500 people working in the Department of Social Welfare.  That was mentioned in regard to some comments of Members regarding the investigating of entitlements which were means tested, the implication being that there was some degree of harassment taking place in some cases.  In general the Minister did not agree with that view and said that many such investigating officers lived locally, the implication being that they would not harass their neighbours.  I am not suggesting that this happens on a large scale or that many personnel of the Minister's Department are involved in an unusual style of investigation or that many of them are excessively aggressive. But there is a very small minority of investigating officers who are excessively aggressive, who do ask extremely personal questions of applicants.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has said that Irish people have a remarkable propensity for not disclosing information relating to their means.  Perhaps that is so; I will not dispute that fact with him.  Traditionally <Col N="164" /> we have rebelled against intrusion into our privacy in whatever area that may take place, whether it be in an endeavour to ascertain how much money we have or whatever else.  I accept that the Department must have reasonable details of one's means.  But some questions being asked of simple, ordinary and in many cases old people with regard to their lifestyle and habits &mdash; how many bottles of whiskey they drink a week, how any pints of beer they drink a week, whether they go to the races, how often they buy new suits &mdash; are being posed by a small percentage of investigating officers.  That style of interrogation should be terminated.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the prescribed relative allowance by a number of Deputies. I agree with those who said that such allowance should be withdrawn very slowly.  There are figures available to us, from the reply to a question I asked last week, showing that the number of prescribed relative allowances being paid now are just 2,500 as against 2,850 in 1981.  A number of these have been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies said, this is an important payment.  It is saving the State money because many of these unfortunate people would otherwise have to be hospitalised at the expense of the State. The Minister and the Department should proceed very carefully in withdrawing that allowance from anyone.  I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to whom that payment is made.  He rightly said it is made payable to the pensioner rather than to the person providing the care, and very often the person providing care does not get any payment.  Perhaps there is a good reason for this and, if so, I should be pleased to hear it.</P>
    <P>With regard to means testing for old age pensions, the Minister endeavoured to reassure us, as he did in his Second Stage speech, that people claiming the non-contributory old age pension could have considerable means before they are deemed ineligible.  I accept his figures. But, unfortunately, many old people, especially those on the western seaboard, are still hiding their money in roofs, <Col N="165" /> under the thatch, under beds and carpets, in boots and wellingtons, because they are not aware of their entitlements.  It would be of great benefit, and would perhaps save serious injury or even loss of life, if the Department would issue a circular telling people what the Minister has told us.  He should reassure them in that regard and I am sure they would then invest their money in safer places like the banks, although I wonder whether I should say that at present.  What is a safe investment for money nowadays?</P>
    <P>I am also worried about disability benefits.  I know that the Minister's Department have acquired more medical referees.  There are now 18 referees as against 15 in March 1981, although three extra will not set the country on fire.  It is important that the Department should have sufficient referees.  I concede that examinations by medical referees are important, because in many cases a family doctor may find himself in a difficult position in regard to a patient or family he has known for many years.  It is often hard to get them off national health certificates and in such cases it is important that there should be an assessment by an independent medical referee.</P>
    <P>In answer to a query, I was informed that 26 per cent of those examined in 1984 were deemed to be capable of work as against 21 per cent in 1981 or, in numerical terms, 8,446 people were deemed capable of work in 1981 as against 13,372 people in 1984.  That is a considerable rise and I am worried about some decisions taken by medical referees in recent times.  I am not suggesting that there is a deliberate attempt by his Department to ensure that people are taken off disability benefits.  It is a difficult area because there is often a conflict of medical opinion and evidence.  However, I know of cases in which appaling decisions have been made by medical referees.  People have had major operations, substantiated by consultant medical opinion and confirmed by the patients' own doctors, and yet medical referees have seen fit to deem these people capable of work.</P>
    <P>When that happens they are in a very <Col N="166" /> difficult position.  I know of a case concerning a man working in a factory who had an operation on his spinal cord.  His personal doctor was also attached to the factory and he wrote national health certificates for him on a weekly basis certifying that he was eligible for disability benefit.  At the same time he provided certificates to the factory stating that his patient was unfit for work.  One of the Department's medical referees decided that this gentleman was fit for work and he was then in the unfortunate position of having his disability pension cut off. His own doctor decided, because he had been informed by the Department that he was capable of work, that he would not write any more certificates to the Department, although he still provided them for the factory, stating that he was unfit for work.  This unfortunate man was not eligible for disability benefit because the medical referee had cut him off, his own doctor would not allow him to work in the factory because he was unfit for work because of illness and, therefore, he was also ineligible for unemployment benefit or assistance.  He was in a social welfare cul-de-sac.  These anomalies should be corrected.  If there is substantive, consultant medical opinion on a case it should be generally accepted.</P>
    <P>I tried to elicit information from the Department about how long appeals take.  The Minister was not able to furnish me with that information but we know that a considerable length of time elapses before an appeal is determined.  It has been suggested that much of the delay has been due to the absence, for reasons of illness, of some appeals officers.  If that is the case I suggest that additional staff be employed so as to expedite these cases because it is not fair that people have to wait indefinitely before being informed whether their appeals are being upheld.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Minister for Justice to provide the resources necessary to deal effectively with the present level of violent crime and lawlessness throughout the country and demands that the Government take all necessary measures to restore law and order in the community.</P>
    <P>The necessity to move this motion is a reflection on this House and on society generally.  This might be regarded as an almost emergency debate dealing with the very serious deterioration in law and order.  In recent months this deterioration has manifested itself in old people being terrorised in their homes and robbed of their meagre life's savings.  In one instance two old people had the sad experience of having to flee from their home in the middle of the night and then finding that their house had been set on fire.  Our people have not experienced incidents of this nature since the time of Cromwell.  In our towns and cities the Garda, despite their best efforts, are being totally frustrated by organised bandits. In one night alone three patrol cars were rammed by young terrorists who are openly defying this House, the Garda and the courts.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have no desire to make political capital out of these tragic events.  Neither have we any desire to score political points from the human tragedy, the fear and insecurity being experienced by an increasing number of people and which are the product of this new wave of violence.  However, the time has come, perhaps it is long overdue, for the Minister to take some emergency action, action that will succeed in restoring public confidence in this House and in the capacity of the Garda to protect our citizens and their property.  It should be said that our Garda enjoy, as they have always enjoyed, the confidence and respect of our people but a changing social environment demands that a new approach be taken and that there be a greater degree of co-operation <Col N="168" /> between the Garda and the public.  That is why greater emphasis must be placed on the old system of community policing where both the garda on the beat and the public can identify with each other and enjoy each other's respect and confidence.</P>
    <P>As legislators we must, in co-operation with the Garda and if necessary the Army, make available the full resources of the State in ridding our country of an element who would not find their equal in the most uncivilised countries in the world.  Having said that, it is important that we do not take this problem out of context or create unnecessary fears among our old people particularly.  We must assure them that they will be protected and we can protect them and their property if we face up to our responsibilities in this regard.  Regrettably, despite assurances given here by the Minister last week and despite the assignment of two special detective units to the west, almost by way of instant criminal response and of defiance of this House, there were other serious attacks on old people and their homes and also another major bank robbery.</P>
    <P>The attacks on the elderly particularly have been taking place on an increasing scale in the past couple of years.  They are increasing not only in intensity but in ferocity.  It is even more disturbing that there seems to be emerging a pattern of premeditation and organisation in many of the attacks.  One wonders why there has been such a concentration in this regard in the north west of the country. Perhaps because a high proportion of the population of these parts live in remote rural areas, they are easy targets, but this new era of crime must be dealt with without delay.  While the attacks on old people have been in one area of the country mostly, they have been taking place on a smaller scale in every county, including my own county of Laois.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister told us that no Garda stations have been closed in recent years.  That may be correct from a statistical point of view but every rural dweller knows that the presence of gardaí in rural stations has been reduced seriously in <Col N="169" /> the past couple of years and that this reduction is a direct result of Government action and Government cutbacks. Replacing a garda by way of the provision of an intercom system on the outside wall of a Garda station is hardly the answer to the need for more effective community policing.  I am asking the Minister to consider seriously increasing the strength of the Garda in rural areas.  The understandable concentration of Garda personnel in urban areas to the detriment of rural areas is creating a situation in which the criminals are retreating to the relatively safer environs of those rural areas and they are doing this with the aid of cars stolen in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The concern and insecurity of rural dwellers on this whole matter of law and order was demonstrated at the weekend by the spontaneous response of thousands of people in their attendance at public meetings, particularly in the west. I congratulate Muintir na Tíre especially on their continuing display of community concern.  The fact that there is a need for such meetings indicates how unhappy the public are with the present state of law and order.  We should assist in harnessing this community action, not for the purpose of establishing any kind of independent vigilante groups but for the purpose of assisting the Garda in their very difficult task.  This action should help to allay community fears and restore confidence in our security forces so that no individual would feel the need to provide for his own protection by restoring to firearms. Such a development would not only be undesirable but would be extremely dangerous, although I suppose one could fully understand why people would wish to resort to that kind of undesirable protection.</P>
    <P>Earlier I referred to the increasing incidence of car thefts.  We have now reached an all-time low in our cities and towns where one cannot leave a car in safety without having it stolen, burgled or crashed, often resulting in fatal accidents. There are very serious repercussions arising from the theft of cars by young, reckless drivers who are often under the influence of drugs or drink and this is a <Col N="170" /> nightmare for road users, many of whom have been killed or seriously injured in accidents without access to compensation of any kind.</P>
    <P>We must take every action possible to come to grips with this serious problem. In this connection it should be put on record that many members of the Garda Síochána have placed their own lives at risk in apprehending car thieves.  A major contributory factor to the increasing crime in the past few years is the fact that the Garda and the courts have been frustrated in their efforts because of the inadequacy of the detention system operating here.</P>
    <P>There is little point in the Garda apprehending criminals and the courts applying sentences if the sentences cannot be implemented because of the lack of adequate prison space.  In this regard I welcome the decision of the Minister to open Spike Island as a detention centre.  However, I regret I must add that this is a panic measure forced on the Government because of the deterioration of law and order.  I regret the decision was not taken two years ago.</P>

      <P>The Minister will have to measure the blundering and miscalculation of the deferment of that decision as against the money he will have to spend in the short term in a panic situation in relation to the opening of Spike Island as a detention centre.  Naturally we support this decision because of the seriousness of the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government's failure to provide adequate prison accommodation has brought our police and legal system into unnecessary disrepute.  It has led to the open defiance of the law because law breakers now know they will not have to serve their sentences.  More and more prison space is needed but the opposite would have been the case had the law been enforced fully, particularly in the last two years.</P>
      <P>In the short term we must provide prison accommodation.  We must take out of circulation people who are openly defying the law.  The availability of adequate accommodation, even if it is not used, by itself would be a deterrent to potential law breakers.  The absence of places of detention must not be a deterrent to our courts in applying maximum prison sentences, as it has been up to now.  We must ensure that the sentences imposed on criminals, particularly criminals of the kind to whom we have been referring in this debate, are carried out. Criminals must not be allowed to flout the law or snub the police force, the courts and even this House in the knowledge that they will not serve their sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week in reply to a Fianna Fáil Private Notice Question the Minister said that the inadequate prison system was something he inherited from us and he made the same accusation here this evening. After three years in office it is time for this Government to stand on their own feet and to be accountable for their own actions.  The Minister's reply in the Dáil has since been discredited by this own actions in opening Spike Island as a detention centre as a result of public <Col N="172" /> pressure and protest.  The Government did not make any provision for this in their Estimates and obviously it did not require any planning.  Surely the Minister's response and the circumstances in which it came about is a greater indictment of the Government's unwillingness to tackle the problem of law and order than anything I might say.  By the Minister's own admission, the inadequate prison accommodation is a major contributory factor to the deterioration of law and order but why did he wait for almost three years to open this centre? By his failure to act he has discredited the Garda Síochána, he has made a mockery of our judicial system, he has made a laughing stock of this House and he has placed at risk the lives and property of many thousands of our people.</P>
    <P>I hope this belated action by the Minister will be the first step on the road to the restoration of law and order.  If it is, he will have the full backing and support of Members on this side of the House. However, in conjunction with this effort, I urge him to implement urgent and essential reform of the judicial system which is outdated, cumbersome, irrelevant and often inconsistent in judgments. I urge him also to update and improve the training procedure for the Garda Síochána and to make available to the force all the technological aids available to their counterparts in other countries, and which in many cases are also available to criminals.  Police work is becoming exacting and scientific and it calls for a high level of training.  It must be accepted that six months training is no longer adequate for recruits and that there is an urgent need for in-service training for established members of the force.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government must take urgent action to arrest the present deterioration of law and order. However, this cannot be done in the absence of a political and financial commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent of the increase in crime in recent years has become a serious and major source of <Col N="173" /> concern for all the community, not least for Members of this House.  The scope of the problem can be seen from the fact that the number of crimes reported to the Garda Síochána increased from less than 40,000 in 1973 to approximately 103,000 in 1983 which is the last year for which figures are available.  In the same period the detection rate has fallen from 49 per cent to 32 per cent.  While there has been a serious increase in crime in rural areas, particularly during the past number of weeks in which a new development has taken place &mdash; attacks on elderly people living alone, in isolated areas &mdash; thousands of old people living alone in rural areas are living in fear.  This development is escalating at a rate that has taken the community by shock.  That major problem has been relevant to urban areas for some considerable time and especially in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>In the last figures published on crime, about two-thirds of crime committed took place in the Dublin area, even though Dublin has only one-third of the population, and incidentally only one-third of the Garda force are stationed in Dublin.</P>
      <P>A large proportion of crime is committed by persons under 21 years of age.  The numbers of persons convicted in 1983 who were under 21 represented over 50 per cent of the total.  The number under 17 years of age accounted for nearly 20 per cent of the total numbers convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to investigate the cause of increasing crime in Dublin and other urban areas we can easily recognise that the vast number of offences are committed by the same persons who appear to hop in and out of detention centres on a weekly or a daily basis.  These youths are involved in what the authorities have for far too long called, petty crime, which include the specific crime of burglary, larceny, unauthorised taking of motor vehicles and thefts from unattended motor cars and other vehicles.  I have been unable to obtain the exact figures for stolen cars for 1984, but in 1983 it is estimated that almost 25,000 cases of unauthorised taking of motor vehicles were reported to the Garda.  That figure <Col N="174" /> can be added to the 104,000 indictable offences already referred to.  In 1983 the taking of a motor car was not an indictable offence and was not included in the statistics of the more serious crimes committed.</P>
    <P>Nearly 8 per cent of stolen cars in the Dublin area are used for the craze of joyriding and this craze &mdash; the more realistic term now used for those involved is &ldquo;motor rat&rdquo;&mdash; is not only on the increase but is becoming a cause of murder and destruction.  Not only the ordinary people are endangered but also the Garda who are supposed to act as guardians of law and order for the benefit of the public. Crime in Dublin has developed into an orgy of violence and destruction and hundreds of youngsters have now quite publicly thrown down the gauntlet to the authorities.  It is a horrifying and frightening situation that night after night dozens of stolen cars are being driven at high speeds through the suburbs and youngsters are on the look out for squad cars to take on.  During the past few weeks we have witnessed what must be a most humiliating experience for any garda apart from the risk of serious injury and death: gardaí running away to escape from brutal youngsters.  What type of society are we living in when instances such as this can happen while our laws, the courts and the Garda seem powerless and defenceless in the face of onslaughts by children who have gone berserk and who have no respect for authority, their homes, the schools, the Church or the courts?</P>
    <P>How can the existing laws and the Garda support and protect our older communities in Dublin who are faced by young thugs breaking into their homes? The effects of burglary and vandalism on the health of old people are seen in the admission wards of hospitals.  The hospitals are now studying this problem in greater detail.  It appears that approximately 12 to 15 people with a history of traumatic experience that has undermined their health are admitted each month to all the city hospitals.  These patients form just the tip of the iceberg because many more will be treated at <Col N="175" /> home or will remain untreated at home. The majority of patients admitted are female and living alone.  Most appear to be socially isolated with little family support and many have been subjected to repeated burglaries, vandalism and assault.  In some cases the thieves have become so daring that they actually stay in the house and cook a meal for themselves while their pals vandalise the furniture and property in the home.</P>
    <P>It has been established that many of the patients also have a significant physical disability.  Hospitalised elderly patients have had their homes burgled and vandalised while they were in hospital.  Many elderly people refuse to leave their homes to attend hospital for necessary treatment because they fear their homes will be vandalised while they are away.  If any group in society should be protected from such abuses and stresses, it is the elderly. These people are less able to cope psychologically and physically with such stresses.  These burglaries are often described as minor crimes, but they are major crimes when they affect old people as they can precipitate a chain of events which can lead to serious ill health or death.</P>
    <P>Society has reached a stage where people are afraid to identify those whom they have seen committing offences and are afraid to give evidence in court because of the risk of reprisals.  It is well known that most young offenders are out of the detention centres a few days afterwards. They go back on the trail of even greater destruction, violence and vandalism. It is easy to understand the fears of people reluctant to give information to the Garda.  It is painfully obvious in too many cases that the Garda have neither the facilities nor the powers to give adequate protection to those who render assistance to the authorities in bringing offenders to justice.</P>
    <P>The public feel that crime has got out of control.  Many solutions have been suggested, among them the need for more gardaí, better equipment, more effective powers for the Garda and, above all, the need for justice to be seen in the courts <Col N="176" /> in handing down sentences, which is an area which has been falling down badly. The Garda are in the front line and we look to them to be the guardians of law and order.  The Minister for Justice is the person in charge and it cannot be overlooked that when things continue to go horribly wrong over a number of years the onus is on the Minister to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Nearly two years ago the Minister introduced the Community Service Bill the purpose of which was to have young offenders work in the community under supervision.  That legislation was hailed by the Minister as being progressive and far reaching and the Minister assured the House that it would be seen to curb the activities of young offenders.  We were also assured that the provisions of the Bill would be in operation within approximately one year.  Nothing has happened since then and that legislation now gathers dust on the shelves of the Department of Justice.  I do not subscribe to the view that that Bill would have any greater effect in diminishing crime in the community. The Minister a short time ago during one of his many press conferences, at which he excels himself in public relations, told the country that crime was now on the decrease and that the Garda had the situation totally under control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody believed that at the time because crime was already growing at an alarming rate.  Garda stations and Garda manpower in the city have not kept pace with the growing population.  Suburban stations catering for approximately 40,000 to 50,000 people have in many areas only one car at their disposal.  When crimes are reported to the local station &mdash; my constituency colleague will verify this &mdash; it may take up to an hour before a garda is available to go to the scene.  The drastic cutbacks have deprived the Garda of equipment and facilities that are urgently required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total Garda manpower is in the <Col N="177" /> region of 12,500 of which approximately one-third are located in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Obviously, all 12,500 gardaí cannot be on duty 24 hours each day.  Therefore, when one makes due allowance for time off and the overtime cutbacks we have experienced we are left with 2,500 gardaí on duty at any one time throughout the country and only one-third of that figure on duty in the Dublin metropolitan area where crime is at such a hideous level.  It is time that the Minister faced up to his responsibilities not only to the Garda but to the country.  We are being led to believe that the opening of Spike Island as a detention centre will solve all the problems, but if the Minister was honest he would accept that the opening of Spike Island will deal with only part of the problem.  The Minister has sat on the fence too long and has not done anything except involve himself in public relations exercises about nothing.</P>
    <P>In my contribution I have dealt with local crime only, which is at a serious level, but we must remember that we also have a serious drug problem.  According to recent reports it seems to be gaining further momentum despite assurances by the Minister to the contrary.  Only last weekend there were reports that Dublin had become the centre for drug trafficking with distribution taking place from Dublin to other European cities.  The assurance the Minister has given is similar to the other assurances he gave a month ago, that crime in general was on the decrease and that the Garda had the situation under control.  The Minister's action in opening Spike Island is an admission of failure for which he must accept full responsibility.  His performance &mdash; it could be described as his lack of performance &mdash; has been disastrous and his record since he took office speaks for itself.  Never before in the history of the State has crime risen at such an alarming rate as it has since the Minister took office.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects I could deal with, but I have confined my remarks to the main problem in the Dublin area. Many parts of Dublin are now no-go areas.  There are areas where gardaí dare <Col N="178" /> not go near.  Those areas are not patrolled. Youngsters from those areas go to the local Garda stations and try to coax the gardaí to come out so that they can have a go at them.  Dublin city is a place one must have serious regrets about.  It is not the city we all knew some years ago, a place where one could walk the streets in the evening time.  That is the terrible position we are faced with today.  It is obvious that unless the Minister takes further drastic action &mdash; I might add that I welcome the opening of Spike Island and I hope it will help to deal with the problem &mdash; the situation will deteriorate. If the Minister decides to take further action he can be assured of our support. We do not wish to make any political capital out of this.  We are all concerned about the problem and the Minister will get our support for any decisive action he may take.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the measures being taken by the Minister for Justice to deal with crime.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If my amendment is accepted the motion will read: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann supports the measures being taken by the Minister for Justice to deal with crime.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the House this evening to endorse the action that, as Minister for Justice, I have taken and am in the course of taking to deal with the crime problem. Listening to what has been said already on the opposite side I am struck by the lack of reality in the approach of the Opposition to this question and their insistence on treating it in purely political terms.  They condemn the Minister for allegedly failing to provide the resources to deal with crime knowing full well that the record shows &mdash; and I will demonstrate that presently &mdash; that the Minister has provided resources in very adequate measure.  They criticise the Minister for failing to deal with the causes of crime <Col N="179" /> knowing only too well that the treatment of the root causes of crime is a highly complex issue necessarily long-term in nature and that, in any event, many of the measures necessary to deal with it are not and could not come within the ambit of responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  These obvious facts are, of course, conveniently forgotten because political advantage necessitates that the issues be reduced to their most simplistic. But if Opposition politicians can, like armchair generals, draw the battle lines to suit themselves and ignore reality because it inhibits their freedom of action, Government Ministers and those who must use the power of office with responsibility and in the interest of the common good are unable to indulge in such self-delusion.  Reality must be faced and one of the hard realities of modern society is that the problem of serious criminality &mdash; not just in Ireland but in Britain, in the United States, in virtually every democratic country &mdash; is plaguing our way of life and threatening freedoms and basic rights.</P>
    <P>In Ireland the current obvious and publicised manifestations of the problem are the twin menaces of the so-called joyrider in our major urban centres and the hideous and brutal attacks on elderly people in the more remote and isolated areas of the west.  In other countries the problem seems to present itself in different forms &mdash; in Britain, for example, the most recent cause for public concern is the appalling behaviour of hooligans who turn football pitches into bloody battlefields; and in New York, if one is to judge from recent reports, there is serious concern about the spate of robberies and muggings on the subway which has produced a response of a particular kind that is certainly not to be advocated.</P>
    <P>In pointing out &mdash; as I have &mdash; that Ireland is not alone in Western society in having a crime problem, I am not to be taken as implying that a fatalistic approach to it is a necessary or an inevitable response.  Fatalism is, I think, understandable only in the sense of accepting that there may be inherent in <Col N="180" /> the kind of society that has evolved here a dynamic for causing criminality and that we may perhaps never totally eradicate it.  But that does not mean that we ought to shrug our shoulders and say that there is little we can do about it.  There is, of course, much that we can do &mdash; indeed must do &mdash; to control it even if in the short run we are unable to grapple successfully with its causes.</P>
    <P>Mention of the causes of crime prompts me to reflect how often we hear demands &mdash; as indeed we will hear this evening &mdash; from politicians and others that measures that are being taken to deal with crime fail to address themselves to its underlying causes.  Sociologists and criminologists everywhere have for long been preoccupied with seeking an answer to the causes of crime and, while it would be foolish to suggest that they have not contributed to increasing our understanding of the problem, they have not yet &mdash; so far as I am aware &mdash; been able to prove that one particular factor more than any other is responsible.  They can of course show that poverty and social deprivation have a lot to do with it.  That seems reasonably clear.  Yet, as I have pointed out before in this House, that does not quite explain how it is that many people who are poor or live in what might objectively be termed deprived circumstances never commit crime at all.  It does not explain how rapid increases in crime seem to have taken place in the country at times of growing affluence.  And it offers no guide either &mdash; in causative terms &mdash; to the increasing incidence of so called white-collar crime committed by people who do not suffer any obvious social deprivation.</P>
    <P>What then can we say about it?  Looking at what has been happening in Ireland some facts seem reasonably clear.  Up until about the mid-sixties this country enjoyed &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash; a very low crime rate, certainly a rate far lower than the major industrialised countries, and even lower than most other developed countries of comparable size. Then things began to change and change very rapidly.  In the ten year period 1973 to 1983 the recorded number of indictable <Col N="181" /> offences rose from 38,022 to 102,387 &mdash; an increase of almost 167 per cent.  We are, therefore, a society which has experienced a transition over a very short period of time from a position in which crime &mdash; at all events serious and violent crime &mdash; was a relative rarity to one in which it is an everyday occurrence affecting the lives of many people.</P>
    <P>While there might be some comfort in the thought that all that has happened in the ten year period I have referred to is that we have caught up with the crime levels which prevail in some other developed countries, the fact that we have done so over such a short space of time has had a shock effect on us.  In saying that I am not to be taken as suggesting that our crime level is somehow acceptable. Indeed, I do not beleive that any level of crime can ever be acceptable, but I make the point merely to show that our experience of crime is not exceptional and that there are still other societies with far worse problems.  It helps, reflecting on crime, to keep matters in perspective.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of crime is attributable to young persons.  The 1983 crime statistics show that juveniles under 17 years account for about a third of the total number of persons arrested for serious criminal offences.  This propensity of the young towards crime and the fact that such a high proportion of our population is under 25 years of age accounts to some degree for what has been happening.  It is also a matter that calls for a comprehensive policy in relation to youth, a subject to which I will be returning.</P>
    <P>The advent of drug abuse in the 1970's has been another major contributory factor.  There is undoubtedly a link between drug abuse and crime.  It is well known that many addicts turn mainly to crime in order to finance their expensive habit.  I will say more about this problem in a moment in the context of the specific measures being taken to deal with crime. I mention it here only in relation to its contribution as a causitive factor.</P>
    <P>Another unsavoury influence has been the overspill of violence from Northern Ireland.  This has led not only to an <Col N="182" /> increase in offences such as armed robbery but it has also given rise to an increased use of firearms by criminals in general.</P>
    <P>From what I have said it will, I think, be clear that I believe there may be much to the proposition that generally persons involved in crime come from under-privileged backgrounds and have been reared in conditions of social deprivation with limited opportunities for advancement, but we must be careful in trying to identify the causes of crime that we do not regard these causes as in any way excusing crime.  I accept also that in present circumstances unemployment may be a factor.  These are matters we must take into consideration in formulating a balanced policy for dealing with the ills of our society, including crime &mdash; and by balanced I mean a policy that combines economic and social measures directed at the underlying causes of our problems.</P>
    <P>However, the social and economic conditions that give rise to crime cannot be eliminated overnight, as I think most reasonable people accept.  Social change on the scale required will take many years to bring about and the general aim and thrust of overall Government policy is towards this end.  However, law-abiding citizens who are the present-day victims of crime should not be faulted if they were heard to say that &ldquo;That is all very well but we cannot be expected to wait until such change is brought about&rdquo;.  They have a legitimate right to demand security in their persons and property now and it is the duty and responsibility of the Government to do all they can to provide them with that security.</P>
    <P>What then is the Government's strategy for dealing with crime now?  How does it propose to bring greater security into the lives of ordinary people?  As the House knows, it is primarily my responsibility as Minister for Justice to advise the Government on the appropriate measures to deal with crime and, as far as I am concerned, the central features of the policy that I am pursuing to contain crime and to control lawlessness in our society is, first, to strengthen and make more effective the Garda Síochána so that <Col N="183" /> there will be a greater likelihood that criminals will be caught; second, to ensure that the law and practice as administered in our courts is such that criminals can be effectively and expeditiously dealt with when they are caught and, third, to provide whatever prison accommodation is necessary to contain people who are sentenced to imprisonment so that they will serve their sentences in full.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied and the Government are satisfied that the position has now been reached where the priority of Government policy must be the protection of law-abiding citizens.  It must be regretted that this necessarily entails using the sanction of imprisonment to an increasing extent against the so-called joy-rider, the mugger and the attacker of the defenceless amongst us just as we now inevitably use it against the rapist, the drug pushed and the murderer.  I am firmly convinced that the most effective deterrent that we as a society can arm ourselves with is neither the birch nor the shotgun of the vigilante but the creation of a position where the detection and apprehension of the criminal is a virtual certainty, and in which conviction and punishment &mdash; by long terms of imprisonment if necessary &mdash; follows as inexorably as night follows day.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are, of course in the forefront in bringing about the conditions for the creation of that deterrent. It is to the Garda force that we look to secure the detection and apprehension of the criminal.  For that reason it is vital that we have the most efficient and effective force possible and it is to that end that I have directed the major emphasis of my programme since I became Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Not only is it untrue to claim, as the Opposition motion does this evening, that I have failed to provide the resources necessary to deal effectively with crime, on the contrary, in the two years that I have been Minister for Justice more has been done to improve the training and the organisational efficiency of the force and more has been done to provide it with the most up-to-date equipment and <Col N="184" /> technology than perhaps at any other time since the force was founded.</P>
    <P>Let me begin by dealing with numbers in the force.  The current strength of the Garda Síochána is approximately 11,400, the highest ever figure.  The national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> provides that the strength of the force will be maintained at this level &mdash; 11,400 &mdash; over the period 1985 to 1987.  This means that, notwithstanding restrictions on public service numbers generally, recruitment to the Garda Síochána will be continued and vacancies filled.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office in December 1982, over 1,150 recruits have been appointed to the force.  Allowing for wastage due to retirements and deaths etc., there has been a net increase of over 700 gardaí since the beginning of 1983. The additional gardaí have been assigned to the areas where the Garda authorities considered that the need for their services was greatest.  It is the policy of the Commissioner to have as many gardaí as possible on foot patrol duty.  There has already been a substantial increase in the number of uniformed gardaí who are performing foot patrols and, in addition, the operation of new rostering systems is giving an improved Garda presence on the beat at the times of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Increasing Garda numbers is not of course, in itself, the only response to meeting the policing needs of the community. Steps have been, and are being, taken to improve Garda effectiveness and to ensure that the available resources are used to best advantage.</P>
    <P>I have already made it clear that I intend to raise the standard for entry to the Garda Síochána.  What I have in mind is that a basic education examination such as the leaving certificate would be accepted as the qualifying educational standard.  In addition, aptitude test would be introduced and final selection would be by means of competitive interview. Proposals along these lines are currently being examined in my Department in consultation with the Garda authorities and the Civil Service Commission and my intention is that the new procedures will <Col N="185" /> apply to the next recruitment competition.</P>
    <P>As regards the important area of Garda training, I am endeavouring to ensure that training at all levels in the force is improved and up-dated.  To this end, the Commissioner, with my approval, recently established a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Thomas Walsh to undertake a thorough review of Garda training needs.  The committee, who include people from the private sector and the academic field who are experienced in personnel training and development, have been asked to examine Garda training at all levels from recruit intake up to and including the courses provided for senior management in the Garda college and to make any recommendations considered necessary. While, of necessity, it will take the committee some time to complete their deliberations, they have been asked to give priority to a review of recruit training so that any revised training procedures that may arise from that review can be in operation for the next recruit intake.</P>
    <P>As regards Garda promotions, I believe that it is vital to the success of any organisation that it should have a sound personnel policy and a key feature of any such policy is the development of a promotions system that ensures that the best available people are selected for positions of supervision and higher management. The introduction, since I became Minister, of a new promotion scheme for the Garda Síochána, which has the full backing of the Garda Commissioner and of all the Garda staff associations, will I think make a major contribution towards achieving this goal in the years ahead.  I will be looking also, in consultation with the Garda authorities and the staff associations, at other ways in which management in the force can be improved.  The aim must be to ensure that the force attract and retain a reasonable proportion of the most able and best educated people &mdash; men and women &mdash; in our society and also that the specialist needs of the force for highly trained professional people are met in full.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> As well as having well educated and well trained gardaí, they must be provided with the resources to do their job properly and, since I am being accused this evening of failure to provide the Garda with adequate resources, I think it is necessary to deal with this question. There are two main aspects to the question of resources that I want to deal with. First, there is the question of the tangible physical resources &mdash; equipment and the like &mdash; and, second, there is the matter of legal resources in terms of the powers the Garda need to bring criminals to justice.</P>
    <P>When one considers how widely gardaí, of necessity, are deployed throughout the country, manning about 700 Garda stations, and the necessity to contact members when they are on operational duties away from their stations in cars and on foot, their need for a first-class national communications network is obvious. Such a system is now being provided. Approximately £7 million has already been spent on this project and about a further £2 million will be spent before the end of this year.  The network is already operational in the Limerick Garda division and will be going &ldquo;live&rdquo; in other rural divisions within the next couple of weeks.  This new system will provide a facility for instant communication between the divisional headquarters and each district in the division and between each district headquarters and the stations attached to it.  This will mean that at practically all times gardaí out on patrol and other duties will be in contact with their stations and this will ensure a quicker response to requests from the public for Garda assistance.  A particular facility of the system which is worthy of mention is the provision of radio telephone equipment, known generally, I understand, as the &ldquo;Green Man&rdquo;, at small rural stations.  This equipment enables the public to get into immediate and direct contact with the gardaí at times when their local station is closed.  It should be extremely useful in small rural communities where station opening times are restricted.</P>
    <P>Work is also well under way on the <Col N="187" /> provision of a new communications network for the Dublin metropolitan areas. This will include a computer-aided system which will direct and control the most efficient use of all gardaí and patrol cars on operational duty.  Similar systems have proved to be of very considerable benefit to police forces in cities abroad and I am confident that it will also be of immense value to the gardaí in Dublin. A contract for the Dublin radio system will be placed within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Computerisation is another area of technology which can be of considerable assistance to the Garda Síochana.  The garda have their own computer since 1981 and they are at present operating systems on it such as stolen vehicles, firearms, crime and criminal records.  The service was considerably expanded late last year when about 60 visual display units and ancillary equipment were purchased. This equipment has enabled all the 18 divisional headquarters and some other major stations outside the Dublin metropolitan area and nine of the busiest stations within the Dublin area to have a direct link to the Garda computer. Improvements in Garda computer facilities are being made continuously.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, any discussion of Garda resources must include reference to the important question of the legal powers available to the force.  One of the first things that I undertook when I became Minister was the completion of an urgent review of our criminal law and procedures.  I was anxious to ensure that the force was not inhibited by outmoded laws from carrying out the task the community required of it.  I was glad, therefore, to be able to bring forward the Criminal Justice Bill within a short period of assuming office and, as the House knows, many of its provisions came into force on 1 March.</P>
    <P>I do not intend now to resurrect the issues debated in this House during the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill.  The House knows, I am sure only too well, what happened and how some Members <Col N="188" /> of the House opposed the central provisions of the Bill.  With the benefit of hindsight and in the light of what has occurred and is now occurring in relation to crime, I am sure few &mdash; if indeed any &mdash; Members of the House would now consider that the Bill was unnecessary.  Many indeed might regret that the detention powers of the Bill and some of the other key provisions are not yet in force as undoubtedly they would be useful in dealing with some of the current problems.  I hope to be in a position to rectify that situation very shortly by bringing before the Oireachtas the Bill to set up a Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the necessary regulations dealing with the treatment of persons detained in Garda stations.  That will honour in full the commitment I gave the House.  It will also pave the way for the necessary strengthening of the hands of the Garda.  One of the immediate effects will be that those suspected of taking cars will be liable to be detained for questioning and they can be fingerprinted and subjected to other forensic tests.  The Garda assure me that this will greatly help them to eradicate the problem of car thefts in our cities.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the Criminal Justice Act let me very briefly remind the House of one or two other provisions in the Act which I believe will also be of enormous benefit in dealing with crime: the dreadful trade in illegally held firearms is being tackled by making it an offence to withhold information about them and by increasing penalties generally for firearms offences.  I will say more about the general question of penalties shortly. The trade in stolen property is similarly addressed in the Act and this should make it easier to get at those who deal in stolen goods &mdash;&ldquo;the fences&rdquo;&mdash; who are, as we know, the lifeblood of criminal activity.  Court procedures are being improved so that gardaí can give evidence in certain circumstances in writing instead of orally thus freeing greater numbers of gardaí to deal with crime instead of having them tied up in court. Majority verdicts, which have helped obtain more convictions in other countries, are being introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> Before leaving the question of policing I want to say something about crime prevention. I believe that as well as dealing effectively with detection and apprehension of criminals the Garda Síochána must promote to the maximum extent practicable measures aimed at preventing crime.  Crime prevention is cost effective. It can save lives and, of course, large sums of money.  The Garda Síochána has within its ranks a full-time crime prevention advisory service.  Apart from that special unit, however, all members of the force have a responsibility in the prevention of crime as part of their ordinary Garda duties and the Garda authorities are anxious that all members of the force should promote public interest in crime prevention.</P>
    <P>I attach great importance to the improvement of Garda-community contacts and this is a matter that is being pursued by the formulation and implementation of a policy of community policing. In recent years there has been a growing recognition of the need to involve the community at large in crime prevention activities and specific policies are being developed to this end.  One such policy is neighbourhood watch.  Neighbourhood watch is essentially a network of public spirited people who observe what is going on in their own neighbourhoods and report any suspicious or unusual happenings to the Garda.  In simple terms the civilian become the eyes and ears of the force with a view to counteracting the activities of the criminal and vandal.  Early indications from the experiments that have been carried out suggest that neighbourhood watch has a useful role to play in crime prevention and it will be expanded and developed throughout the State as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The need for better Garda-community co-operation is nowhere better illustrated than in the response to the recent spate of attacks on elderly people living in isolated areas.  This is an area where the Garda alone cannot provide the answer and where they need the active support of the community not only in the passing on of information about suspicious events or <Col N="190" /> suspicious characters in a locality but in providing a very positive security screen for vulnerable old persons.  I am glad to say that the community has responded well in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, not only is it an essential part of the policy I am pursuing that there should be better detection; it is also essential that the court system should function smoothly and play its part in dealing with crime.  In this respect there is often criticism about delays in dealing with criminals in the courts and about inadequate sentences being imposed. As far as the District Court is concerned, the position is that where a person is arrested by the Garda and not released on station bail he is brought before a peace commissioner or a district justice as soon as is practicable &mdash; in effect not later than noon on the following day in places such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>Where such cases are dealt with summarily in the District Court they are normally disposed of within two to three weeks.  Where a defendant pleads guilty his case is often disposed of on his first appearance.  There can never be any question, however, of speeding up the working of the courts to such an extent as to deal with all accused persons on their first appearance as has recently been suggested.  Nor do I think it is practicable to introduce special court sessions for &ldquo;joy riders&rdquo; to get over the problem caused by granting bail.  Many offences, including unauthorised taking of cars, are inherently serious and in those cases there is a right to trial by jury.  But even where cases are dealt with summarily in the District Court, it is frequently impossible to avoid adjournments to enable an accused to obtain legal aid or for social or medical reports or for other valid reasons, and, as I will mention in a moment, bail is mostly unavoidable in these cases.  Where a case is not being disposed of in the District Court, that is, where a defendant is being sent forward for trial, a book of evidence has to be prepared by the State solicitor and this inevitably gives rise to delays.  Of course, delays can also occur in cases where <Col N="191" /> adjournments are sought by the prosecution or the defence.</P>
    <P>There are delays of up to two months in the Metropolitan District Court in forwarding appeal papers to the Circuit Court in cases where defendants are on bail.  There are no delays in forwarding appeal papers to the Circuit Court in cases where defendants are remanded in custody.  The delays in non-custody cases are due to staff shortages.  I hope to be able to do something about these delays and I intend to have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>In relation to the criminal trials in the Circuit Court, I am aware that there are delays in some circuits.  In an effort to improve the situation the Government appointed an additional circuit judge last year and it is expected that his services will have a substantial effect on the position over the coming year in that the President of the Circuit Court will be in a position to assign additional assistance to the circuits most seriously affected.</P>
    <P>With regard to criticisms frequently voiced about inconsistencies and inadequacies in sentences being imposed by the Judiciary, the position is that under our legal system the law provides generally for maximum penalties for criminal offences.  This enables the judge or justice to exercise his discretion, within the maximum penalty, by reference to the conclusions he has reached after trying the case, hearing all the evidence, assessing the culpability and the circumstances of the accused.  This means it is inevitable that there will be divergencies between sentences even for the same offence because the circumstances will differ from case to case.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Presidents of all the courts will continue to do what they can to promote the future development of a sentencing jurisprudence in this jurisdiction. There may also be scope in the superior courts for greater use of practice directions in relation to sentencing which could be a help.  There is already provision in the law for meetings of Justices of the District Court to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the avoidance of undue divergencies in <Col N="192" /> the general level of fines and other penalties. There is no similar provision in the case of other courts, but I am aware that over the past few years regional conferences of judge have been convened to discuss the administration of justice.  The holding of such regional conferences was recommended in the 12th Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, be aware that the Constitution provides that all judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it would be improper of me to comment on an individual case in a way that would amount to interference with that independence. It is against that constitutional background that I am making these suggestions which may help to achieve greater uniformity in sentences.</P>
    <P>One area which was very much in our minds in this House in debating the Criminal Justice Bill &mdash; and it is a matter about which concern has again recently been expressed &mdash; is the problem of offences committed by persons while on bail.  There is, I believe, a widespread feeling that bail is too readily granted. Most people want to see bail harder to get and they want the courts to be able to refuse it where there is a likelihood that the person will commit further offences while on bail.  People are understandably affronted at reports of car thieves being arrested and charged and then being released immediately only to be caught in the act the next day.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a real difficulty about this stemming from a 1966 decision of the Supreme Court which was to the effect that to refuse bail on the grounds that further offences might be committed by the accused would amount to a form of preventive detention and would be unconstitutional.  I am advised that that position cannot be changed except by amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>However, the law relating to other aspects of bail was reviewed in the course of preparation of the Criminal Justice Bill and different approaches to the problem were considered.  The Government opted for three measures contained in sections <Col N="193" /> 11 to 13 of the Act and these have been in operation since March.  First, the law now requires any sentences for an offence committed-on bail to be consecutive on any other sentence passed or about to be passed on a person for a previous offence. Second, the aggregate term which can be imposed by a district justice when passing two or more consecutive sentences is now two years instead of 12 months.  Third, failure to surrender to bail or, as it is more commonly known, absconding, has been made an offence for the first time and carries a sentence of up to 12 months imprisonment.  Offenders who continue to engage in criminal activity while on bail can now expect much harsher punishment from the courts.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by referring to the situation in the prisons.  While it is true that previous administrations spent £13 million on the design of prisons on foot of decisions taken in 1978 and 1979, they never proceeded to build them.</P>

      <P>Thank you for giving me time to propose amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;country&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;;recognises that much crime and vandalism has its origins in social and environmental factors, and notes that crime has grown as the level of unemployment has increased; deplores the failure of successive Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments to tackle these problems; and calls on the Government to (a) recognise that in the long term a significant reduction in crime depends on the ending of poverty and social deprivation, and (b) ensure that in the short term all the necessary finance and resources are made available to the Gardaí to enable them to protect people from crime&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with the Minister's general thesis in regard to the relationship between crime and poverty or social deprivation, and the fact that we get crime in times of prosperity and in prosperous communities, I do not think anybody can seriously dispute the fact that the link between criminal vandalism and poverty or social deprivation exists.  It is not a coincidence that the levels of crime and vandalism are worse in the areas of poorer housing and inadequate social facilities.  It is not a coincidence that crime has risen as unemployment has soared.  Governments who have allowed those conditions to develop must accept some responsibility for the situation which exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing this issue tonight in the context of two major factors which developed recently on top of the level of <Col N="195" /> crime already existing.  The first is the enormous increase in the number of attacks on families in isolated rural areas. People are being attacked and robbed by a small number of gangs, perhaps four or five.  They are doing this on an organised scale particularly in some western counties. The second is the enormous development of car thefts and the use of stolen cars in crime in Dublin.  Cars have now become a major weapon of the criminal to break into premises by ramming them. They are the getaway weapon and the weapon for attacking the gardaí when they come on the scene.  This has been an extraordinary development in the past couple of months.  The criminal uses the car in this fashion.  So-called joyriders are also using stolen cars to attack the gardaí. These factors must be dealt with separately from what we might call the normal increase in crime.</P>
    <P>Over the past three or four years we discussed community policing.  This was discussed by the Garda and particularly by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors who produced documentation on the need for community policing and how it could be developed.  To my knowledge, this idea has never been accepted or promoted by the Department of Justice, the Garda Commissioner or the senior members of the Garda.  The present Commissioner paid some lip service to it but the manner in which the whole discussion on community policing has been scaled down to almost a silence in the past year or so worries me very much.  The Garda force and the community must work together.  If they work separately against crime they will increasingly come into confrontation. Surely the Department of Justice and the Garda Commissioner must see the need for this co-operation, but I have seen no developments in that direction.  Since the Minister came into office he has been doing everything possible to get increased powers for the Garda and to develop and expand the prison service and so on, but we do not see any efforts being made by him on this matter, although he has <Col N="196" /> commended the idea.  The message of co-operation between the community and the Garda does not seem to have percolated down through the Garda force.</P>
    <P>The local government reform idea could also have been used for discussing and introducing the idea of policing and police committees coming under local government structures, so that there would be a liaison with the garda in the development of community policing in their own area under their own local authority. They would be able to discuss the type of policing and resources and analyse the type of crime in their area, and in that way help the Garda.</P>
    <P>Another area which has been allowed to decay is the area of juvenile liaison officers.  Some years ago these men were doing excellent work but have been starved of resources, under-manned and totally unable to carry out the jobs they are supposed to do.  They are completely frustrated.  They are being used for other jobs.  These officers could be a vital link with juvenile delinquents or potential offenders.  They would be able to assess these at an early age, in an effort to ensure that they would not graduate into more serious crime.  These officers could be operating with the young, with what we call joyriding car thieves who are doing this for kicks.  This could have an enormous influence in reducing criminal activity among young people, particularly in their area, when they would get to know these young people.  Finance would need to be increased and the officers would need to be taken out of any direct involvement in arrests, searches and interrogation so that they could gain and maintain the confidence of the young people in their area.</P>
    <P>We must accept that all these things may be slightly long term and of little comfort to elderly people living in fear and to those in the city who are terrified right through the night with cars chasing up and down their streets and lives being endangered by people driving stolen cars and by vandalism.  Immediate steps must be taken to deal with this problem by giving the necessary resources to the Garda and by the use of more modern <Col N="197" /> technology in dealing with speeding vehicles. The Garda should be provided with heavier and more effective vehicles to counteract these activities.  The present situation is very damaging to their morale.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister tonight, one would think that we should leave the House waving flags because all of a sudden he has found a formula to beat crime.  Most of what he has said we have already heard and I am not too confident about some matters to which he referred tonight.  To quote the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 14 March, &ldquo;The thugs have never had it so good... The guards cannot catch them.  Judges are erratic in sentencing them.  The prisons can't keep them.  And legislation isn't dealing with them&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and the Government to protect the people of this State.  We are told on many occasions that the Garda have failed in their battle against crime, which is an unfair statement.  It should be said that the State &mdash; the Government and the Minister &mdash; have failed in their battle against crime.  People are entitled to be frustrated, annoyed and disillusioned with what is happening at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Government allocated over £200 million in aid to the Garda in their fight against crime, but much of this money was not used in the best interests of that force.  Many of the duties which the Garda force are carrying out at the moment should not be their responsibility. I have referred to this on a number of occasions, in this House and elsewhere. The Minister mentioned the importance of improving community <Col N="198" /> relations with the Garda.  In my own city of Cork we see gardaí putting parking tickets on cars in the same streets where crimes are being committed, shops robbed and houses burgled.  The Garda also are called upon to carry out duties for the Departments of Social Welfare and Agriculture.  Last year I asked the Minister to look into this and to ensure that the Garda carried out duties for which they were highly and expensively trained.  They should not be carrying out jobs for which they are not trained.  There are thousands of unemployed people who would be well capable of doing some of these duties.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Garda are being utilised in my own area of Cork to the full extent, as the Minister would like us to believe.  We have four Garda stations in one area of roughly two miles in diameter.  A new station was built and it was intended that a superintendent, an inspector and other ranks would be located in that station, but this has not happened.  In a reply to a recent question from me, the Minister informed me that all ranks were located at that station and that the needs of the area would be kept under review.  I am talking about the utilisation of the force to the best possible advantage of the community and I am critical here that some decision was taken, political or otherwise, not to locate a superintendent in that station. Could the Minister elaborate on that matter?</P>
    <P>In Cork at present the duties of gardaí are overlapping.  They are located in different stations because of the geography of the location.  Take Blarney as an example. This is almost seven miles from the city of Cork but covers a developing area of Knocknaheeny within the city boundary. We have made representations regarding this and there have been no developments or no improvement.  There was a murder incident in the Glanmire area with the superintendent in Cobh conducting the investigations into that case.  The headquarters of that investigation were sited in the new Garda station in Mayfield.  If the Minister is serious <Col N="199" /> about the situation, about the deployment of the Garda, he will ensure that this situation is immediately corrected.  I have been critical of the Department of Justice, of certain people in headquarters, whether that be in the Commissioner's Office or elsewhere, that they will not move with the times to ensure that the force is used to the best of its ability and in the best way possible for the protection of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the present level of the force is 11,400.  I am not satisfied that the Garda have all the resources they need available to them.  I contend their manpower is not at full strength and it should be remembered that, when Fianna Fáil left office, it was their intention to recruit 600 extra gardaí. That has not happened.  Irrespective of whatever figures the Minister gave here this evening I contend that their strength is 600 under the level intended.</P>
    <P>The Garda are suffering as a result of the public sector recruitment embargo. Thirty seven civilians employed by the Garda left and their duties must now be carried out by a corresponding number of gardaí, which is most unacceptable in this day and age.  How many of us know of terrorized people who have been mugged or robbed in their own homes?  We pay lip service to what is happening outside this House.  Too many of us are removed from the realities of what is happening on our streets at present. Unless we move quickly the situation will have deteriorated beyond belief.</P>
    <P>The Minister read a 25 page speech here this evening, much of which we heard already.  The reality is that people are now losing faith in the institutions of State, in the Garda in particular.  Here I want to defend the Garda.  I contend they are not receiving the assistance of their superior officers, and certainly not that of the Minister and the Government.  I can back up that assertion in the examples I have just given.  A very serious problem obtains.  The Minister said in the course of his remarks that guns do not constitute an answer to the problem, nor do people <Col N="200" /> taking the law into their own hands or vigilantes.  I support the Minister fully in that.  But, that being said, it demonstrates the frustration felt by people at what is happening on our streets.  It is an indictment of this House, of the Government on their failure to provide adequate protection for the people, a protection to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>It has been contended that an estimated 100 accused persons were allowed to go free from our courts because Garda overtime was disallowed, because gardaí on night duty &mdash; I see the Minister shaking his head but he did not refute or deny that allegation when it was made some time ago, when Deputy Woods made a statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned neighbourhood watch.  Would the Minister explain in greater detail what is happening the neighbourhood watch because I do not see any activity in Cork in that regard?  The Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, of which I am a member, submitted a report to this House which was approved.  I share the concern of Deputy Mac Giolla when he asserted a lack of commitment on the part of people at the top with regard to the implementation of a community watch.  The community at large are not being encouraged, the Garda in lower ranks are not being encouraged to become involved and I am not accepting the Minister's line here this evening as policy.  It has been clearly shown that community watch is not being encouraged by the top brass in the Garda and in certain sections of the Department of Justice.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on that issue.  We spoke of assistance to the Garda.  We had a situation recently in Cork in which a patrol car in a certain Garda station &mdash; which happened to be my own &mdash; was out of order for a number of weeks and it was contended because it had not 75,000 miles registered it could not be replaced.  That <Col N="202" /> car was replaced very quickly because of the publicity the incident received.</P>
      <P>I contend that there are areas of the Minister's Department warranting close scrutiny regarding the availability and use of the facilities the Garda need to fight crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opening of Spike Island. That is sad but, unfortunately, it has become necessary because the vast majority of people are law abiding citizens. While unemployment and other factors are being said to be contributory, the majority of the unemployed abide by the law and are entitled to the protection of the law.  We must deal with criminal offenders effectively.  People must see that the institutions of State are used in the best way possible for the protection of our people.</P>
      <P>I might refer briefly to the courts.  The Minister said he could not interfere with the Judiciary.  That is fair enough but I want to remind the Minister that the way in which the Judiciary implement the law affects us all and is not proving very satisfactory. The inconsistencies of the Judiciary in their sentencing is not good enough.  Nor is it good enough for the Minister to say he cannot interfere.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is some consistency.  I accept that no two cases will be exactly similar but one must question reports of some people in jail serving sentences for owing a few pounds to a moneylender or for other small offences, such as parking offences, who serve every day of that sentence, while serious criminal offenders wander free on our streets doing what they like because of the inconsistency of those sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if I offended the Minister but I was hoping I was helping him in his endeavours to deal with the problem obtaining.  We must be realistic, there is a very serious problem.  I am merely expressing the frustrations of people, as I have been elected to do. Unfortunately, the electorate now believe that we are out of touch with reality.  The reason people have advocated vigilantes and the like is because they see us as a failure.  Before it is too <Col N="203" /> late for everybody concerned I appeal that every possible effort be made, allowing the electorate to see that the institutions of State are used for their protection in every way possible to fight these vandals and criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of speaking on what is perhaps the most serious problem at present facing Irish society.  People are jaded listening to statistics on crime in Dublin and elsewhere being trotted out.  I even wonder if the excellent series &ldquo;Crimewatch&rdquo; in <i>The Irish Times</i> is followed, as it should be, to give an in-depth analysis on a day to day basis, minute by minute, of exactly what is happening in our capital city.</P>
      <P>The April edition of the <i>Garda Review,</i> as I am sure the Minister is aware, stated that in America there were 1.7 policemen per 1,000 population, whereas in Ireland the figure is 3.14 per 1,000.  That figure shows that Ireland is twice as well policed as America, so what is wrong with our present system?  We must coolly look at the situation and ask if crime is stabilising or getting worse.  All pointers indicate that the situation is steadily deteriorating, a fact which must be admitted and faced up to.  We must ask why this is and what measures we must urgently take to solve the problem.  I am convinced that one of the prime reasons for the increase in crime is that the deterrent is not treated seriously by the perpetrators of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The softly, softly approach is not a system which can work in the long term, given the fact that, regrettably, 2 per cent of our population, or indeed any population, is genetically programmed to be anti-social.  However, a logical approach is needed and we must look at it in the long and short terms.  In the long term I have three suggestions I should like to make.  One is the establishment of a civic youth corps, a civic service corps, to effectively utilise the energies of thousands of young people who are currently unemployed.  Such a corps should be introduced for a number of reasons, primarily to develop a sense of community <Col N="204" /> and civic responsibility in young people, to provide the manpower for useful local projects, to allow young people time to mature and to help them to get suitable jobs and to learn how to fend for themselves. Such a corps could usefully supplement and complement the social services, with young people visiting the aged, the disabled and the disadvantaged and running meals on wheels or other similar tasks.  Such a corps would be seen as an alternative to military service where people are conscripted into a compulsory term of service to their country.  Members of the corps would live at home reporting each morning at civic service centres and they would be under the control of a civic service authority.  They would be paid a weekly wage which would substitute for dole money.  This corps is needed to give dignity and direction to thousands of young people who are vainly searching for work.  However, it must be done in an organised and programmed way, allied to career guidance and counselling, social services, voluntary bodies and AnCO.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the establishment of citizens' support bureaux.  Rising crime, violence and wanton vandalism call for the establishment by the Department of Justice of such bureaux to encourage, educate and co-ordinate the efforts of ordinary citizens in aiding the Garda in the prevention and detection of crime.  Such a programme is needed to undertake an organised campaign to persuade the public to be positive, helpful and forthcoming in the support of civil authorities.  I am sure the Minister is aware that for historical reasons many people are less than lukewarm in providing practical support for the Garda.  On &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; week in, week out appeals are made for witnesses to come forward, very often in the case of daylight robberies committed in sight of dozens of witnesses.  Such appeals should not have to be made, people should come forward out of a sense of obligation to help and protect fellow citizens who are the victims of crime.  Citizens' support bureaux would initiate programmes of education in schools, colleges and public organisations to make people aware of <Col N="205" /> the practical ways in which they can help to detect crimes.  Indeed, in some countries with perhaps a less traumatic history than ours, especially Switzerland and Scandinavia who have a strong law abiding tradition, it is not unusual for citizens to exercise their right of arrest.  Reckless drivers, juvenile handbag snatchers, vandals and other perpetrators of crime are often placed under arrest by outraged citizens and marched off to police stations. Could one imagine that happening in Ireland?</P>
    <P>A change of public attitude, a sense of greater responsibility in relation to crime and its prevention, is needed.  This cannot be brought about without a major and continuous educational effort by the Department of Justice and such citizens' support bureaux, well staffed and supported by public funds, would be capable of effectively complementing such an undertaking.</P>
    <P>The third point I wish to put is one which I mentioned two years ago and on which I am very keen: the extension of the community watch scheme.  I am sure you remember that I raised this question on the Adjournment some time ago in conjunction with attacks on the elderly. I am very disappointed that the scheme has not been extended.  Obviously, there is a reason for the Minister not extending that scheme rapidly in our capital city. We all know that statistics prove that this system is a great deterrent.  The Detroit experiment showed that it reduced crime by 30 per cent.  Why is there such reluctance to extend the scheme here?  Perhaps the Minister fears infiltration by subversives. If so, I appreciate his concern, but it is a system that has proved its worth.  In London they now have something like 300 groups who are working to great effect.  Perhaps we have one or two on an experimental basis, but we are chasing crime instead of being ahead of it.  I warmly welcome the decision to sent young offenders to Spike Island, but that is not enough.</P>
    <P>Curative measures are needed and democracy is abused here at present.  The rights of the public are abused by a tiny minority.  The public are entitled to be <Col N="206" /> protected by the arm of the law, but yet crimes are committed every day.  I will give one example and I am sure other speakers will give many more.  An elderly lady, a constituent who lives in Adelaide Road, was stabbed 100 times for a paltry sum of £30 or £40.  That speaks for itself, and I have a litany of many others.</P>
    <P>An extension of prison accommodation is of paramount importance.  The Minister should examine the possibility of engaging the Army in some practical way to supervise prisoners in detention centres, particularly to ensure that when they are released they are better citizens instead of being allowed to go to seed, as it were, in prisons that are overcrowded and which perhaps only compound the problems of these people.  Perhaps the Minister would consider using the Curragh detention centre in this way.</P>
    <P>There is a very big problem in so far as drug related crime is concerned.  In these cases the responsibility should rest directly with the pusher because he is the one who puts the problem into the households of those who become addicts. Similarly, parents should have to carry responsibility for the crimes of their children up to a certain age.  A very strong case can be made too for identification of hardened criminals in the sense that photographs of them would be placed in Garda stations.  This would help in making local people aware of the identity of the perpetrators of crime.  It may be said that this was something that obtained in other times but it could prove effective. Shopkeepers, for instance, would be very pleased if on an ongoing basis the Garda provided them with the names and addresses and photographs of criminals in their area.</P>
    <P>I support this motion very strongly. The Minister is now about half way through his term of office and he has the opportunity of adopting a radical approach to stemming the deterioration in the whole area of law and order.  It can be said of my constituency of Dublin South-East that all human life is there. At any time I can think of about half a dozen cases in my constituency that are similar to any case I read of in the papers.</P>

      <P>I should like to conclude with a thought that was running through my mind earlier.  It relates to the case of a justice, now deceased, who after she had been mugged on Waterloo Road said that because this had happened to her she would take a slightly different attitude from then on and would have to become a little tougher with those people.  That was an indication that the courts were not tough enough with the criminals.  Much tougher action will have to be taken to counter the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of the Minister and the measures being taken by him. Many speakers have outlined the general position regarding the serious crime situation. We must toughen our attitudes towards these criminals and from this House we must condemn unequivocally what has been happening in the area of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to recognise the measures that were taken last year by way of the Criminal Justice Act but, despite that legislation having being introduced more than a year and a half ago, we are still waiting for the setting up of the complaints procedure, in the absence of which a number of the sections of that Act are inoperable.  We might ask what the attitude is now of those people who criticised so strongly that measure during its passage through the Oireachtas.  The Minister brought the legislation before the House on foot of a commitment of the Government.  I trust that when the complaints procedure is before us there will not be the same sort of charade as that which continued week after week when that very necessary piece of legislation was being put through.  I trust the <Col N="208" /> Opposition and also all Members on this side will ensure that the complaints procedure legislation is given a speedy passage through the House.  The Minister is anxious that the complaints procedure be brought into effect as soon as possible. Having regard to the efficiency with which he introduced some recent legislation I doubt if his Department are causing the delay.  However, I am glad to hear him indicate that the legislation will be before us very soon.  I trust that it can be dealt with as expeditiously as was that other piece of legislation.  We must not be ambivalent in our attitude to recent events.  We must not appear to be condoning them in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to incarcerate criminals on Spike Island.  It is clear that, despite an increase of about 500 prison places, these extra places having been made available by this Minister last year, there is still not sufficient accommodation in our prisons.  That is why Spike Island should be made available as soon as possible for this purpose.  In addition we must make prison less palatable for the inmates.  There is no point in having something of a holiday camp atmosphere and making certain facilities available to prisoners.  Those who are sent to prison more than once should be treated in a way that will leave them not ever wishing to go there again.  While adhering to the fundamental rights of prisoners, there is no point in prison being a place that they have no objection to returning to.  There has been too much pussyfooting, too much of the softly, softly attitude for too long.</P>
    <P>Most people I have been speaking to in recent months want a commitment from the Government and from the House generally in the matter of law and order.  It is only by a combination of the efforts of all of us that the problem can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in relation to extending training for gardaí. Recently I visited Templemore where I witnessed the great efforts being made there.  After so many years there is an obvious need for improvements and in <Col N="209" /> that context the whole question of training should be considered.</P>
    <P>I trust that the public will co-operate with the Garda to the greatest extent possible by way of supplying them with information.  The gardaí will have the necessary facilities and equipment and the Government will provide what resources are required, but it is not at times as simple as the Opposition seem to think.  What is needed is a general commitment by everyone to deal with this problem.  There must be a general hardening of attitudes and we must condemn crime where it occurs.  No group or individual can opt out of this.  I support the Minister in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on all sides should applaud the genuine efforts of the Minister in trying to deal with the problems he has been facing.  The motion before the House is very flippant and glib and does not do justice to the serious problem.  I should like to make a few constructive suggestions in the short time available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge a continuing review of the work of the Garda.  A key in the battle here is the effective use and deployment of Garda resources and I should like the review of the work they are doing to continue.  It is highly nonsensical to engage very expensive and highly trained garda personnel in many of the functions they are carrying out at the moment. By this I include such obvious areas as licensing and carrying out certain traffic duties when local authorities and other bodies are well equipped to deal with that kind of work.  Let us try to refine the work of the Garda and take from them those extraneous and peripheral areas that are not their central occupation and give it to people who can do that work just as well.  I include in this much of the time spent in courts when a few simple changes in the rules of evidence might allow, for example, affidavits to be used in certain minor cases instead of having the courts cluttered with gardaí who have to sit around all day waiting for cases to be heard.  In many instances their cases are adjourned.  A simplistic demand for <Col N="210" /> more gardaí is not the answer: what we need is the better use of Garda resources.</P>
    <P>My second suggestion concerns the redeployment of many gardaí.  They should be where the crime is being committed, but this is not the case at the moment.  A statistical evaluation of the deployment of gardaí will indicate that in many cases they are in areas that have a low crime frequency rate.  There are all kinds of reasons for that, some of them local political reasons and some not the most noble of reasons.  However, the fact remains that there are not sufficient numbers of gardaí in areas where crime is occurring and I suggest this matter be given some consideration.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there should be a formal structure encouraged by this House &mdash; we cannot force it &mdash; among the Judiciary so that there will be an obvious rationale in relation to sentences.  The difficulties that have been experienced on occasion in that respect could be dealt with in this way, by encouraging the responsible members of the Judiciary &mdash; and they are the overwhelming majority &mdash; to ensure that the difficulties that have arisen do not continue.  They are a source of scandal and do all of us an injustice.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the community should be involved.  Crime prevention and detection involves all the community: it is not a job that is done by the Minister or the Garda outside the community.  I suggest that, systematically and delicately, we should extend our efforts in that connection to involve the young, community groups and indeed every citizen in a nonviolent, carefully studied and systematic approach to protecting their own property and that of others.  We must ensure that people in communities care for each other in a systematic way because there has been a major breakdown in that regard.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, I should like to suggest that there be an urgent examination of the detection rates.  The truth about crime is that the best deterrent still remains the conviction in the mind of the criminal that people will be caught if they commit crime and that they will serve sentences. That is not the position at the moment. <Col N="211" /> In my view the detection rates are of almost crisis proportions and I know that the Minister will be concerned, as are the Garda, to see that the situation improves.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, I suggest that the attitude of misguided compassion which is the usual response to first offenders be reviewed. The first offence is the time to show young people, not in a draconian way but in an effective way, that a life of crime is not what some of them think it to be.  At the moment many of them are allowed and almost encouraged at times to carry on with their criminal activities.  The responsibility of parents should be underlined and perhaps enshrined in law.  It is about time we said that people have a responsibility to some extent for the actions of young children.  I would not be averse to the idea of our considering legislation on these lines.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have got to get to the root of the problem of crime.  As long as we appear to neglect the huge social and economic challenge of inner city areas, where there is an ingrained pattern of poverty and deprivation, we are failing in our duty and these areas will continue to spawn huge crime levels.  That also involves changes in the educational curriculum, but that is a huge debate and is not appropriate to a five minute discussion.</P>
    <P>We should review also our sentencing policy.  Up to now there has been little emphasis on the debt due to the victim. Therefore, I suggest that in respect of sentences there should be an emphasis on the victim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment proposed by the Minister. The record of this Government and of the Minister for Justice in their determination to tackle crime has been outstanding.  It is very easy to indulge in political point-scoring, to blame the Minister and the Garda for the crime problem and to say that enough is not being done but the truth is that no Government or Minister for Justice has done more in such a short time to reform <Col N="212" /> and strengthen the criminal justice system.  I understand that provisional Garda figures for 1984 indicate that the level of serious crime reported has decreased in that year.  As the measures and reforms introduced by the Minister begin to take effect in the months and year ahead, I have no doubt this improvement will continue.</P>
      <P>It is not serious crime that impinges mostly on society but rather cases of petty vandalism such as handbag snatching and the general lawless attitude displayed by many of our young people.  The evidence of vandalism is all too apparent when one walks through our cities or towns. Vandalism not only seriously blights our environment but it has an adverse effect on tourism.  It also gives rise to substantial repair bills for local authorities who can ill afford such costs.  It should be stressed that it is only a small minority who are engaged in mindless acts of violence against property.  The majority of our young people are decent, upright citizens who have no time for such destructive acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many acts of vandalism may be trivial in themselves they can often be a cause of danger or serious inconvenience as, for example, where damage is caused to lifts, bus shelters and telephone booths.  It is an unfortunate fact that vandalism and other crimes of a petty nature are indulged in mainly by the young.  It is also a fact that children and teenagers who indulge in this kind of anti-social behaviour often graduate to more serious crimes as they grow older.  Therefore, it is vitally important that parents fulfil their obligations to their children and, by discretion and example, train them to be honest and caring citizens.  For the same reason it is important that as a community we provide the necessary support for families and the conditions in which parents can fulfil their duties.  The House will be aware that many of the young people who come into contact with the law come from deprived areas.  With the limited resources available, the Government are doing all they can to redress the social imbalance that gives rise to these <Col N="213" /> conditions.  As was stated in <i>Building on Reality</i> a key strategy for income maintenance will be to provide adequately for the welfare of children in needy families; but perhaps as a society not doing enough.</P>
    <P>There are many pressures and many evils in modern society that did not afflict previous generations.  One such evil is the abuse of drugs and alcohol by some of our young people.  Drug abuse is a cancer that entered our society in the early seventies and grew at an alarming rate. There is no doubt this has contributed to a large extent to the present high rate of crime.  We have tackled this, and we as a Government have attempted to take positive action in this area.  We will gradually see the results of this action.</P>

      <P>This problem would severely tax the statement made by Father Peyton that &ldquo;There is no such thing as a bad boy&rdquo;.  That statement could be challenged today.  The crime problem must be dealt with in the short term, in the long term and in terms of eliminating the causes.  There are different levels of crime &mdash; the sophisticated racketeer, organised crime, urban vandalism and the rural attacks.  Bob Dylan once said that he met a lot of men that could rob one with a fountain pen.  In terms of some of the events that take place one wonders about the various levels of crime.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rural attacks, these mindless thugs have destroyed the hospitality and friendship which existed for generations in the west of Ireland where for years in areas ravaged by emigration the people depended upon each other. We now see padlocked doors and fear in people's eyes.  I commend the Minister for his actions to date in dealing with this. The friendship and hospitality may have gone but not the human concern, as has been in evidence in massive collections to help people in Third World countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should continue to draw up the register of vulnerable people in remote areas.  Many of these people have an independence and pride and they do not want assistance.  Some of them support the IRA because they were born <Col N="214" /> into that heritage.  These people should be known and understood by the Garda, by the voluntary organisations and by the people who draw up the register which should be reviewed on a frequent basis. There was a suggestion that telephones should be installed, but some of these people do not know how to use them. There are also sirens which can be installed, and all these things are useful in the case of attack.</P>
    <P>In many cases in western Ireland shotgun licences have been given to people to eradicate vermin.  The attitude among many people now is to use their shotguns, as the shotgun was used in the Ballyfermot case.  The Minister should make a comment rejecting the use of guns and the Garda should be seen to be achieving results.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Commission on Training as it is not possible within 22 weeks for a Garda to be able to deal with the level of crime with which they must deal today.</P>
    <P>I commend to the Minister the continuation of the supply of radio links and increased mobility to the Garda.  This is an absolute necessity.  The vast distances which must be travelled in rural Ireland are an advantage to the Garda.  The area of Erris is as large as County Louth but there have been very few robberies here because there are only three roads into it and out of it.  Through mobility and a radio link the advantage must be continued to be given to the Garda.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rural policing scheme, I would ask the Minister to set a specific termination date on this scheme.  There are gardaí and sergeants in that scheme who do not and could not know the people in villages 20 miles from themselves. The &ldquo;green man&rdquo; system has not worked in some cases.  The Minister said that this was a pilot scheme and when it is over it should be assessed and terminated.</P>
    <P>In relation to promotion, I welcome it. Where possible gardaí should be encouraged to live within their own areas.  I know it causes difficulties with wives and families.  But we must look at the English system.  The Lancashire police are born and reared in their own areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> In relation to strangers selling goods and taking deposits for televisions and that sort of thing, I would ask the Minister to look at the hawkers licence situation and extend it to strangers who are selling in rural Ireland.  Let them have a licence for £500 a year, let them notify the local superintendent beforehand that they intend to sell their goods in the area and, if they do not have a licence there should be an automatic following fine of £500.  I do not mean this in relation to travelling shops, such as bread vans and butchers vans and so on, that have been there for years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in relation to Spike Island but there should not be TVs or videos down there.  We might have the first national conference of joyriders held on Spike Island.  Some people claim that joyriders should be out cutting turf and thinning forests to provide free fuel for the old people.  A combination of these suggestions implemented by the Minister will, like Synge's play, &ldquo;Riders to the Sea&rdquo;&mdash; or should it be &ldquo;Joyriders to the Sea&rdquo;&mdash; end up so that we can say &ldquo;They are all gone now and there is nothing more that wind or sea can do to me&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister on the recent initiative he has taken in reopening Spike Island.  This debate takes place against a backdrop of consistent persistent public demands for immediate action in relation to specific serious crimes that have been on the increase. The public are calling for the kind of measures which the Government took in the last few days, but they are also calling for a much stiffer system of penalties in the sense that they now expect that the criminal convicted of the serious crimes of drug trafficking, car stealing and robbery with violence should be treated in a manner in prison which would bring home to criminals that they have perpetrated a serious crime against society. The general public do not want criminals to have modern conveniences such as colour television sets and all the mod cons that go with modern prison life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to car stealing, we have had debates over the past few years on this <Col N="216" /> topic.  I have always felt that when a car is stolen the thief is in a situation similar to that of a person holding a loaded gun. In fact, recent events have proved that to be an accurate comparison.  The Minister's initiative in that area is proving to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In relation to robbery with violence, the only simple answer is detection and punishment and the punishment will have to fit the crime.  The people with criminal tendencies will have to know before they embark upon a life of crime that they will be caught and punished.</P>
    <P>So far as drug trafficking is concerned, there is considerable public opinion that for far too long the perpetrators of these crimes have been treated with kid gloves. The time has come to call a halt.  There are a number of causes for these crimes, but time does not permit me to dwell on them.  I have always held that unemployment is a major contributory factor, although not the only one.  As the Minister has said, we had unemployment in the past and there are a number of people who are now suffering deprivation who do not necessarily embark on a life of crime.  However, unemployment is a major factor and we will have to spend money resolving that problem in order to alleviate the situation.</P>

      <P>I support the motion in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady in relation to crime.  The Government have failed miserably to come to grips with the spiralling crime situation.  They have not dealt adequately with the position in the west and north-west where many elderly people are being attacked or with the problem in Dublin city where car thieves operate.  I will confine my remarks to the position in my area, the north-west and the west.  The attacks on the elderly are unprecedented and have left behind a trail of fear, terror, injuries and smashed homes.  Earlier it was suggested in the House that the situation in other countries in relation to crime was worse, but that is not a consolation to the many people who have been attacked in my area and live in fear in their homes each night.  We should not lead from behind.</P>
      <P>Up to last year the elderly people in rural areas were able to go about their daily business without fear of being attacked and live out the remaining years of their life in relative tranquility and security.  Now they retire at night not knowing if they will be brutally attacked by the gangs of thugs who roam our countryside, who break into isolated houses, terrorise the occupants and steal their savings.  In some cases the takings represent the life savings of people while in others attacks are carried out for paltry amounts.  However, in all cases the victims are society's most vulnerable citizens. In the past a knock on the door at night signalled the arrival of a neighbour or friend to visit, but now a knock on the door is an indication of the arrival of a gang of thugs to ransack the house and physically assault people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must pose the question: is there to be any end to this?  Will the gangs who smash their way into homes in remote areas and before leaving issue out threats of murder, be dealt with?  I believe such gangs escape into the mists of time.  It is beyond human comprehension that our elected Government have nothing more to offer people in this barbaric atmosphere than simple cosmetic replies, stock answers such as &ldquo;the situation is under control&rdquo; or &ldquo;new measures <Col N="218" /> are being introduced&rdquo;.  The Minister told us that he viewed these attacks with great concern.  Last Wednesday he told us that there was every reason to hope that what was being done would achieve results quickly.  I must point out that the criminals operating in County Donegal never had it so good because there are not enough gardaí in the county to apprehend them.  The Government are not giving leadership on this issue.  They are not doing much to deal with the criminals and the situation will worsen.</P>
    <P>My constituents are enraged and are planning to form community action groups to support the Garda.  Discussions on such plans are taking place.  I am pleased to say that there is no immediate suggestion to set up vigilante groups but it will be difficult to dissuade those enraged constituents if the Government do not take action.  I cannot rule out vigilante groups in that area, but I appeal publicly to those who are thinking on those lines to help the Garda in their efforts to bring law and order to rural areas.  The country needs leadership.  The people in the west, the elderly in particular, are more interested in law and order than in Bills dealing with family planning or discussions on divorce.  I view them as diversionary tactics to cover up the inefficiency in Government Departments, particularly in regard to law and order.  The Minister should admit to the House that law and order is gradually breaking down.  His Cabinet colleagues must be aware of this. The Government should take immediate action to deal with the problem.  The prospect of vigilante groups being set up worries me and we must all speak out against that prospect.  However, it will be difficult to convince people in rural areas not to embark on that course.  As responsible politicians and leaders in our communities we should impress upon our constituents that setting up vigilante groups will not resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to challenge the Minister in regard to a reply he gave me on 7 March concerning the number of attacks in County Donegal from November 1984 to February 1985.  The Minister said that, while attacks of this nature would always <Col N="219" /> have to be regarded as serious, he understood that in only one case of the 35 was physical injury caused to an elderly person.  I have spoken to many of the 35 people who were attacked and they were appalled to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>We must be concerned about the effects of such attacks on elderly people. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the view of a leading psychiatrist employed by the Eastern Health Board, Dr. Brian McCafferty.  He said that psychiatric training was not needed to know that the life of virtually every old person subjected to attacks was ruined even if they escape without serious physical injury.  He said that suffering extends far beyond the victims and a wave of fear spreads among old people. In his view it was impossible to calculate the damage such attacks do to old people. I understand from a psychiatrist that the attackers do not have any feelings whatever for their victims.</P>
    <P>Are the Minister, the Department or the Garda Siochána aware of a brutal attack on a brother and sister in west Donegal when the brother was held against the wall by timber rafters while be was being abused and assaulted?  His earpiece was smashed on the ground and his sister was held with a knife to her throat.  That attack was not referred to by the Minister in the reply he gave me last week.  More up to date information should be obtained by the Minister on attacks in Donegal.  It is ironic that the attack I have referred to was not highlighted, in spite of the fact that I mentioned it time and again, until a number of equally serious attacks occurred in the west.</P>
    <P>What feeling has the Minister in his heart for the Donegal lady who was held captive in her house for more than two hours at knife point?  That lady handed over a sum of money, but the attacker remained in the house and gave her the various reasons why he would not kill her. Such attacks are frightening.  Recently an elderly man was beaten after he had been robbed of a sum of money.  His attacker fled after locking him inside his wrecked <Col N="220" /> cottage.  Later in the day he was found and removed to hospital.</P>
    <P>In recent months the criminal scene in Donegal has got blacker.  It is estimated that in the region of £200,000 has been stolen from elderly people in my county. People in the twilight of their lives should enjoy peace and serenity instead of being besieged by fear and loneliness.  I must give credit to the Garda who are doing their utmost to track down the perpetrators, but their equipment is ancient.  In rural areas they are too thin on the ground.  Greater backup is needed.  In Donegal and the west one garda and one patrol car cover four or five stations. Without wishing to make a political point I must state that morale among the Garda is at its lowest since the foundation of the force.</P>
    <P>Every time we referred to an attack in Donegal we were met with a chorus of condemnation from Government spokesman, and rightly so, but that is not what we require.  Only positive action will achieve results.  The Minister informed us last week that they knew the identify of some of the thugs and gangs and the registration numbers of cars, but what action has been taken to bring these thugs to justice?  The Minister must be naive if he believes that such a wave of crime is under control.  Does he not believe that unless the Garda seek a backup from the Army we will have more and more serious crimes in my county?</P>
    <P>I make some suggestions to the Minister. The attacks which we know of are only some of the many attacks which take place.  Many of these attacks are not reported because of the fear of reprisals. We are not seeking anything more than a constitutional right, a commitment here from the Minister and the Government, to use the necessary powers and resources to protect the old and the not so old in their homes and to guarantee that punishment fitting these crimes will be meted out by the courts.  In these rural areas more gardaí, more mobile patrols and backup from the Army are required, because many of these gangs and thugs <Col N="221" /> are breaking through the Garda checkpoints and it is impossible for the Garda to apprehend them when this happens.</P>
    <P>We should revert to the system of the 24-hour barrack orderly which we had many years ago, in peaceful times.  At that time a garda was available at every station and he could co-ordinate everything that happened in his area.  While the &ldquo;green man&rdquo; may operate in areas that have an automatic exchange, the county I represent still has a considerable number of manual exchanges.  The headquarters, Glenties, and my area are manual while most of the other areas are automatic, so it is almost impossible to make contact there.  Rural areas throughout the country should have a 24-hour telephone service and an alarm system and, in addition, a community alert system should operate.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take into consideration some of the suggestions that have been made from this side of the House and the fact that we have moved this not as a political motion but to assist the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <P>Any lowering of the credibility and undermining of the authority of the Garda Síochána in the public mind at such a key moment in the history of the force, at such a vital time in the fight against the appalling crime rate, can have very serious consequences for the stability of our society.  A feeling of apathy towards the Garda tends to lead communities to turn to other groups for support and assistance in tackling crime <Col N="222" /> in their areas.  This sliding slope towards vigilanteism is one of the most dangerous developments in recent times and it has been referred to by all my colleagues who spoke here this evening.  The recent apathy of the public towards the Garda has been fuelled by the latest epidemic of brutal attacks on the elderly, the lowest possible form of crime, and also the high incidence of joyriding, which leads to serious injury and sometimes death of law-abiding people going about their business.  The aforementioned crimes are in themselves bad enough, but when all categories of crime are examined the picture is indeed very grim.  The foot dragging of people in authority must cease and remedial action in its many and varied forms must be seen as urgent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposed provision for detention at Spike Island, even though it is somewhat belated.  The new provision will serve a twofold purpose.  It will go some way to alleviate overcrowding in the prisons and will provide a centre for the detention of persistent young offenders.  Early release of persistent offenders is an insult to the Garda, the Judiciary and the taxpayer.  This action compounds the problem and greatly minimises the deterrent to young offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me return to the plight of the elderly living in remote areas.  They are the builders of our new State and must be protected from outrageous attacks no matter what the cost.  In recent times the reduction in the numbers of gardaí in rural stations must have contributed greatly to this epidemic of attacks on the elderly.  Most rural stations have suffered the loss of one garda.  For example, a station with one sergeant and two gardaí formerly may now have a sergeant and one garda.  This downgrading effectively reduces the station's working to one-man level when holidays, sickness and free time are taken into account.  This is the greatest cause of our problems in rural areas.  As the Minister stated, in the last ten years we have not seen the closing of Garda stations.  However, we have seen a downgrading.  Often stations are not manned at weekends, the vital time.  The <Col N="223" /> presence of gardaí in a rural station is much more important than their residing full time in the area.  The servicing of very large rural areas is most important, as is the presence of the gardaí.  People see them when they go to Mass, on their way through the village, etc.  Rural areas must receive greater Garda patrolling in the long term rather than saturation with gardaí drawn from a wide area, including Dublin, when some old person is murdered. That is closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>I turn my attention to the beleaguered people living in urban areas, particularly Dublin, who have seen what must be described as a total breakdown of law and order.  They are afraid to leave their homes.  They have their property stolen. They are afraid to be in their homes, when an intruder may kick down their doors in the middle of the night and cause them personal injury.  The business community are suffering greatly at the hands of the criminal and more and more people are being forced out of business by persistent attacks, robberies and damage to property.  This can only lead to further unemployment and great hardship. Urgent solutions are needed.  More gardaí should be on the beat.  Cutbacks have been responsible for failure to appoint more clerical assistants in Garda stations in order to release more men for the beat.  Unnecessary paper work in Garda stations should be reduced.  The administrative system is archaic and antiquated and should be simplified.  Trained gardaí should not be wasted in offices but should be assisting in the fight against crime.  The embargo on public service recruitment should not be implemented in the case of the Garda.  Clerical assistants, male or female, should be employed in local Garda offices to do the simple chores of typewriting and telephone calling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice, for whom I have expressed admiration in this House, has not seen fit to accept the simple motion before the House.  The motion is aimed at (1) establishing a need for additional <Col N="224" /> resources to deal with crime and (2) highlighting the need to restore law and order. That is all the House is being asked to accept.  The Minister by introducing his amendment is rejecting the need for additional resources &mdash; if he can demonstrate in his reply that that is not so we will be very happy &mdash; or else he is trying to demonstrate what everybody in this House tonight has established, that an emergency exists in the country and we have not got normal law and order.  They are the hard facts.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I had an opportunity of directing the attention of an almost empty House to the fact that death and slaughter by joyriding in Dublin has reached emergency proportions.  The position has worsened every day since then.  The Minister has rejected the statement which bears out that it appears there are not adequate resources to contain this situation.</P>
      <P>I would direct the attention of the Minister to legislation which he brought before the House, the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill, 1983, in which there was a new approach which would solve our problems.  I was critical of the approach in that resources were not being made available to the Minister for that which he envisaged.  At column 162 of the Official Report of 3 May 1983, when the Minister was introducing the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill, I stated:</P>
      <P>It is now May 1983.  Please God we will all be here in May 1984.  I hope I am wrong but I predict that what is envisaged here will not have got off its feet.</P>
      <P>May 1984 has passed and we are almost into May 1985.  A fortnight or three weeks ago the first case was brought under that legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a representative of the State and he is charged with the responsibility of guaranteeing that Article 41 of the Constitution is honoured. That article guarantees protection to the individual.  Anyone who walks the streets not only of Dublin but of Ireland, be they worker, shopkeeper, industrialist or unemployed, walks in terror.  We hear much talk about the old people being attacked in the west.  Two of those who suffered recent attacks were relations of mine, so what I have to say will not be taken as playing down the position of the old in the west.  At least they can walk about freely during the day.  For the last two years the old people in Dublin have been confined to their houses.  They are afraid to move out and while they are in they are afraid of being attacked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of hard earned taxpayers' money we give £250 million to the Garda and £30 million to the courts.  Our courts have been turned into a mockery.  People who are sentenced to six months' imprisonment are referred to Mountjoy or St. Patrick's.  Within two or three days a civil servant will speak to the governor and tell him that they intend to release convict A.  Law and order is being administered by civil servants, and by convenience. Every criminal and aspiring criminal knows that a six months' sentence means nothing.  The Minister tried to deny that, but it has been confirmed by the prison officers and every garda in Dublin.  One garda in Dublin told me he followed a fellow for six months and brought him before the courts.  He was sentenced to six months in prison but two days later a civil servant asked him would he mind if the prisoner was released.  The prisoner <Col N="226" /> met the garda on the street and gave him a Harvey Smith sign.</P>
    <P>The free legal aid scheme has become an absolute racket.  We have the scandal of taxpayers being attacked while their hard earned money is used so that legal people can advise criminals, who admit to them that they have stolen a car or rammed a police car, to plead not guilty. I do not see why the legal system should be set up to defy anyone to prove that a person is guilty when the world and its mother knows that the person is guilty. The Garda and solicitors defending him know that he is guilty.</P>
    <P>This matter has displaced all the other economic and social problems we face because of the concern of people that personal freedom is being taken from them.  Perhaps that is how the national handlers want it.  Perhaps they want to divert attention from economic matters and from the terrible unemployment and social problems we have.  Perhaps they want to busy giddy minds with other quarrels.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that the Garda are not satisfied that they have the resources or the legal backup they need.  I would be critical of those Members of the House who during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill put the Garda under a microscope. Instead of commending the Garda for the job they do, when they go to court they are put in the witness box.  We are not concerned about commending them for work well done but about the academic examination of how they discovered the criminal.  If by any chance they left a &ldquo;t&rdquo; uncrossed or an &ldquo;i&rdquo; undotted in so doing, the judge would throw out the case.  The criminals retire to the local bar and clap their hands and say &ldquo;This is great&rdquo;.  That has happened every day for the last 12 months and the Minister knows it.</P>
    <P>The Garda suffered an affront by the Minister and his Department in relation to the establishment of a committee to examine the training and retraining of gardaí.  They did not think it worth their while to put a member of the Garda on that committee.  If that was a move aimed at indicating the confidence we had in the <Col N="227" /> Garda, I cannot understand it, and I hope the Minister will explain it.  Is there anything more calculated to insult the Garda than to set up a committee to examine the inadequacies of Garda training and retraining and to exclude the Garda from it?  The Minister and I belong to the teaching profession.  How would we react if the Department of Education set up a committee to examine the training and retraining of teachers and left out representatives of the TUI and ASTI?  We will not get the best result from any group of people by insulting them.</P>
    <P>There is an emergency in this country. Desperate ills need desperate remedies and not just the chairman of the Labour Party castigating the press for daring to speak about it.  There is no doubt that the Fourth Estate has been very vigilant.  The Minister should not press his amendment to our motion but should accept our motion and accept the view on every side of the House that there is an emergency, that there is no law and order, and he has not got the resources.  If he has, he is not using them properly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Tunney asked is there any other way to insult the Garda.  The biggest insult to them appears in an example I will give.  Gardaí arrest and bring to court a person who has robbed old people.  That person lives outside the jurisdiction of the State and he puts up half the money he is alleged to have stolen as bail and walks out of the court.  That is a disgrace, and it is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as a Labour Deputy I believe the Government are committed to solving this problem.  There are only two people who can solve it, the Garda and the community.  We have one of the best police forces in the world.  On occasion the community can be two-faced.  I pity the Garda, who have to deal with illegal organisations, drug pushers and gangs who attack the old people.  The community cannot have it both ways.  In cases where illegal organisations committed murder and kidnapped people, when the Garda went looking for support, some of <Col N="228" /> the community remained silent.  If the community hold back information or harbour murderers, they cannot expect the Garda to work efficiently on their behalf.</P>
    <P>We have 11,400 gardaí.  I have never been ill-treated by any of them.  Nobody has ever come into my clinics who was wrongly arrested or ill-treated by the Garda.  The community must recognise that most gardaí have wives and families. They are dealing with very serious crimes.  Are their wives and families being harassed and intimidated?  It is time for the community to stand behind the Garda and see that people who are in illegal organisations, or pushing drugs, and attacking old people, are brought to justice.  If our police force get the cooperation of the community they are well capable of doing their job.</P>
    <P>Much of the blame lies with our courts. Gardaí have worked hard and brought people to court and they have been let off under the Probation Act or they have been allowed to walk scot free out of the court.  We cannot be two-faced.  I gave an example of people who were arrested for robbing old people of £6,000 or £7,000. When brought to court they can put down bail of £3,000 and walk out.  They do not even live in the State.  What incentive is there for a garda to arrest such a person again?  The garda's wife and family could be under threat when we are dealing with people living outside the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look seriously at the sentences.  I disagree with one thing the Minister said.  He thinks the sentences in court are reasonably all right.  I do not believe that.  Judges take a peculiar attitude having regard to their style of life. Judges who have come from a wealthy background would take a very dim view of damage to property and they are not half as severe in dealing with cases of murder and other serious issues.  The Minister should do something nationally about sentences.  When people are brought to court they should be properly sentenced.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has spoken so far has welcomed the new jails.  I also welcome new jails, but people who are sent to them should get proper training and <Col N="229" /> education so that when they are let out they will not be worse than when they went in.  Educational facilities should be provided in jails.</P>

      <P>The general level of lawlessness and crime is unacceptable to us. The public are scandalised at the apparent ease with which car thieves and house thieves and robbers can operate not just in this city but throughout the country. We must look at the scale of the problem to bring home to the Minister just what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>There were 40,000 burglaries last year, 100 per day.  Goods worth £11 million were stolen last year, £7.5 million worth in this city.  There are 200 vehicle stealing offenders wandering around the streets of the city.  There is daily condemnation, but what is required by the public is action.  They demand that action be seen on the ground.  The public feel disillusioned about the limited effectiveness of the police agencies.  There is a growing restlessness in the community.  Without results people are being propelled into making their own arrangements for security.  If &ldquo;Saturday night specials&rdquo; were freely available in gun shops in this city, we would have an enormous escalation in the number of people arming themselves for their own security.  This is entirely unacceptable to us.</P>
      <P>The recent spate of attacks on old people in isolated areas has caught the imagination of the people of this state. This violence has reached a new level of savagery.  We thought we had seen the end of it after the incidence last year of this type of crime.  It was always understood in rural areas that this kind of activity was associated with cities.  We always had the benefit of the open door tradition in the west of Ireland.  Because of that the impact of this new spate of crime is all the more serious.  It is destroying the hospitality to strangers which was the hallmark of rural life for centuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad day when the literature of our national promotional agency on behalf of tourism has to include a warning to tourists that they are unsafe on the streets of our capital city.  There is widespread <Col N="230" /> fear among the old and the families of the old.  All the efforts to date to deal with this matter did not contain it.  That is evident from the new level of viciousness attached to the recent spate of crime in the west.  These violent attacks for small sums of money are all too common.  The gangs are highly mobile.  The Garda cover is very thin on the ground because they have to cover hundreds of miles.  It is obvious that an over-centralised system of policing is not the answer for rural Ireland.  The level of mobile patrols currently operating on the ground is not acceptable to us.</P>
    <P>Local communities are responding and want to respond.  They must only respond under the very closest Garda supervision. I ask the Minister to appoint a community alert officer in each division to deal with the members of the community who want to co-operate and to give them proper guidelines.  These community alert officers would be able to report back to the Garda.  We want no vigilantes and we want no private armies in the west of Ireland or anywhere else.  There is too much talk about guns, and too many people, feeling insecure, are taking the option that they will restore the old gun or the old piece of equipment that they had, to deal with their own security matters. The public are asking us to get our priorities right.  They are saying that there is over-indulgence in so far as police security matters on the Border are concerned, while people cannot sleep safely in their own beds at night.  The community alert officer whom he appoints from among the Garda should do a proper survey of all the elderly in particular areas.  There should be proper maps made available, free of charge to the communities, so that they can properly locate the people at risk.  I recommend as the method of dealing properly with this that the Minister should ask the communities to adopt the old in their own areas.</P>
    <P>The major incidence of these crimes takes place between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. It is absolutely necessary to have some extra manpower available in the sensitive areas.  It is also essential to have more <Col N="231" /> plant by way of mobile cars made available. We must increase the number of mobile patrols in the isolated areas and we must increase the vigilance of the Garda.  The traffic corps should be taken off that duty in the short term and specifically appointed to the protection of the old.  There should be special investigation units appointed to the various divisions in the short term, until we get on top of this problem.  The presence of the Garda is vital.</P>
    <P>There are two matters which the Minister should support in so far as electronic surveillance is concerned.  An alarm unit could be made available in a neighbour's house with technical assistance and a little grant assistance to provide this service at very little cost.  A survey which I undertook last weekend in 12 small townlands in an isolated area outside Castlebar showed that there were 23 people at risk.  If one multiplies that across the whole country one gets some idea of what exactly we are talking about in isolated areas.  There has been a pattern in the raids.  I am satisfied that these gangs are arriving in the west of Ireland with local knowledge and local help.  If there is a direct line of inquiry, as the Minister stated last week, then I suggest that these people be brought to justice if, as we now believe, he can name the culprits.</P>
    <P>There is another area where the Minister could ask for help from his colleagues, the Ministers for Social Welfare and for Communications.  If one wants an extension installed from the home of an elderly couple to a nearby house of a son, daughter or neighbour willing to allow that extension to be put in and if the subscribers to the telephone are in receipt of a free telephone rental allowance, as soon as they make an application to have the extension put into the neighbour's house they are debarred from the free telephone rental allowance.  That is a scandal. It will cost the Minister nothing and an immediate announcement in that regard would bring considerable ease to some of those who want to provide themselves with that little extra security.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The Minister says that he has a direct line of inquiry going on and that the RUC have been helping out in this matter.  Is it not very strange, then, to hear that the mobile patrols on the Border have been reduced in number and many of the checkpoints have been lifted?  We do not regard that as an acceptable response if some of these gangs of thugs are located inside the Border.</P>
    <P>The penalty must fit the crime.  I support those Members who say that there should be a rehabilitation process on Spike Island or wherever these people are incarcerated.  The short term response of opening another jail does not tackle the basic underlying problems which are the cause of the crimes.  We wonder if the Minister is not undermining the morale of the Garda in some instances.  Criticism of the Garda when they are under pressure is not the kind of response that invigorates a greater response by way of communication with the Garda.  Take one instance.  The fact that 1,600 detectives are opposing the new promotion regulations indicates that the new system is no incentive for promotion in the detective ranks.  There is no vertical promotion there at this time.  I cannot understand how the expertise and experience in specialised areas of the Garda are being lost to the force in the recommendations now on the Minister's desk for implementation.</P>
    <P>There are detectives with special training, a special preparation period, special CID courses.  These people, to get the promotion due to them have to leave the detective ranks and go into the uniformed ranks, but they hope to come back to the detective units again.  I cannot see how the Minister can support that point of view.  Is he aware of the intention to reduce the detective strength in the force from 15 per cent to 11 per cent?  With subversives as active as they ever were and with major crime on an escalating pattern, this is not the time to reduce the numbers of detectives operating in the force.</P>
    <P>According to a survey done between January 1977 and June 1978, 66 per cent of all indicatable crimes in this city were <Col N="233" /> detected by the detective units and they are only 7 per cent of the Garda force in the city.  How can the Minister justify his present position in supporting this proposed new system of promotion within the detective ranks?  The old system worked well and detectives got their promotion from experience and expertise.  It worked well in the national interest and the Minister should stick with it.</P>
    <P>We want to encourage communication between the Garda and the community. We recognise that the Garda are the first line of defence in protecting the community from the ravages of lawlessness and crime.  We want to support them as our first line of defence against the creeping paralysis of crime which is pervading every single community, not just in the urbanised areas but the isolated rural areas, also.  There is need in this House for verbal support of the Garda but there is need also&mdash;and greater need&mdash;for our commitment to providing the resources, manpower and plant necessary for the Garda to do the job entrusted to them on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>Certainly the public need to be reassured that we have an effective response to their just demands in the matter of security.  The Minister's efforts to date leave a lot to be desired in combating what is now a national scandal and disgrace.  It is his duty, not just to the population but also to the Garda, to provide the sinews of war for the battle against the crooks and gangsters who are running loose in our country.  We await the Minister's response in that matter. <Col N="234" /> We want him not to undermine the morale of the Garda or to show delay in bringing offenders to answer for their crimes.  We want a guarantee that offenders, when sentenced, will not be on the streets inside the period of sentence imposed on them by the justice in the court.  There must be a better process of dealing with offenders.  There must be better means of rehabilitating those who are unfortunate enough to fall foul of the law and have to be incarcerated.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of commitment from the Minister in so far as the provision of money, of resources and of plant is concerned to enable the Garda to do their job effectively, not just in the urban areas but also in the rural isolated areas.  We expect the Minister to outline in greater detail precisely what he has in mind by way of making these resources available to the Garda.  We want more talk about the new training processes for the Garda. We expect the Minister to do his duty in this regard and do not want to listen to lip service and verbalisation which go on here <i>ad infinitum.</i> The general public desire some return from the taxes they pay so as to give them security in their homes and places of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that you ruled my amendment to this section out of order.  However, we will not oppose any measure which gives an increased income to lowly paid families.  I am sure the Minister concedes &mdash; his Department have freely and openly admitted it &mdash; that the family income supplement has tragically failed in its purpose.  Originally, when the scheme was introduced in November and backdated subsequently for payment from 1 September, the Government, with a great display of triumphalism, tried to ensure that the scheme would get the greatest publicity possible. They suggested that 35,000 families would benefit from the scheme and that this was their answer to those who were badly paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister and the Department know, by 7 February this year, only 9,300 applications had been received and, out of those, only 4,400 families had been granted the supplement.  The Government should ask themselves why the scheme has failed.  Do people feel that this type of supplement was not worth taking because the money offered was just a pittance?  Was it because the methods of processing the applications were not efficient?  I am a little sceptical regarding the figure of 9,300 applications because I know of one family who filled up an application form on two occasions. They also made two or three telephone calls to the Department and, on each occasion, they were informed that the applications had never been received. <Col N="238" /> Since then, they made a third application and I hope that reaches the right destination. I wonder if there were similar cases which are not recorded in the Department.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister in the Departmental Estimates has revised the allocation downwards.  Originally, it was envisaged that this scheme would cost the sum of £13 million but, in the light of information regarding the reduced number of applicants, it has been reduced by £2,500 million.  The family income supplement was supposed to be the Government's cornerstone policy on poverty but it has failed.  I should like some information from the Minister as to what plans his Department have to ensure a bigger take-up of this scheme following the increases.  When the scheme was introduced in November last with a fanfare of trumpets, the impression was given that it would solve the economic problems of the poorer families. It was introduced at a time when very sensitive and delicate discussions were taking place between the two partners in Government.  The scheme was welcomed particularly by Deputy Bell who was very concerned about the issue but obviously he was easily appeased once the scheme had been backdated to 1 September.  I would question the sincerity of any Member of the House who would be appeased so easily by a scheme which the people have not seen fit to take up.</P>
    <P>What plans has the Minister to ensure that the scheme is more effective?  We on this side of the House would be only too pleased that every family who would be entitled to participation in the scheme would benefit from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the scheme was to help maintain the poor.  Deputy McCarthy lays the blame for the failure of the scheme at the feet of the Government.  If there is any failure in this area I suggest that the blame rests with the social partners because what the scheme sets out to do is to subsidise people who do not receive sufficient pay for their efforts.  I welcome the increases. Deputy McCarthy tells us that 4,400 <Col N="239" /> people have been approved for participation in the scheme.  Despite the fact that the 24th round of wage agreements is in the process of being negotiated, the social partners have failed to produce a formula that would ensure a decent wage for people who are in full employment.  This is all the more regrettable when many of these people are in the employment of the State or are in the semi-State sector. As a Government and as an employer as distinct from legislators, we have no reason to be proud from that point of view.  We are bolstering up a system which does not give a just return for one's labour.  I agree that some incentive should be given to those who are working but is this the best possible way of doing that?  The scheme raises many questions.</P>
      <P>Regarding qualifying for the scheme.  I take the point that the assessment is on the basis of gross income but I would make the distinction between this case and the case of medical cards in which respect, both here and in Britain, outgoings above a certain figure are taken into account in assessing income.  This should apply also in the case of the family income supplement so that any outgoings in excess of say, £8 or £9 would be taken into account in the assessment.  As I say, there is a precedent for this in the medical card system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate the range of applicants who have applied for participation in the scheme.  For instance, of the 4,000 or so who have qualified, how many are in Dublin compared with the rest of the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 provides for an increase in the income limit in regard to qualification for participation in the family income supplement scheme.  I should like to cite one case that has been brought to my attention in this respect. It is the case of an auxiliary postman who must attend at the post office every day but who because his working hours were short by one hour in relation to the number of hours required to be worked <Col N="240" /> in order to qualify for the scheme was not considered eligible for participation though his income of about £73 was way below the minimum.  He has a wife and two children.  Perhaps he would be receiving much more by way of unemployment benefit.  This scheme like many others becomes so restrictive that many fewer than anticipated qualify for participation. The postman in question would have to be available for overtime, for the distribution of election literature and for the rush at Christmas, yet he was disqualified for participation in the scheme.  In cases where people have to be available on a daily basis but who, through no fault of their own, do not work the minimum number of hours required, they should be brought within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The up to date figures in respect of the family income supplement scheme is as follows: there have been 9,626 applications.  So far 4,197 have been allowed and 3,647 have been refused while 782 are under examination. A second campaign of advertising commenced last weekend with advertisements in the newspapers. Advertisements have also appeared today in three evening papers and in the provincial papers and they will appear in the local Dublin newspapers at the weekend.  There will be posters distributed to post offices, to health centres, employment exchanges and the Department's public offices.</P>
      <P>The take-up has been slow, but that is the way with most new schemes.  On balance a take-up by 5,200 families is quite reasonable and that number will increase.  When a similar scheme was brought in in the UK and in Canada it was very slow in getting off the ground and even today in those two countries the claim rate is only 50 per cent of those who might have claimed.  There is also the fact that the scheme will be subsumed into the proposed child benefit scheme as from April of next year.  It is only payable to families where there are children and the person employed has to work in excess of 30 hours a week.  The income has to be within a certain limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> In the case of the two-child family referred to by Deputy Leonard, the proposed increase is from £71 to £76 arising out of the change that will occur in July and they may then have the prospect of qualifying.  Anything less than 30 hours will not be regarded as reasonably fulltime employment.  There had to be a cutoff point, otherwise workers with part-time employment would qualify.</P>

      <P>That must be a very tough health board.  The scheme was particularly for people who work more than 30 hours a week in low paid employment to give the breadwinner some additional income.  I have been very cautious about this scheme because one could always get an employer who would deliberately pay a breadwinner a very low wage and tell him to get the family income supplement, particularly if he had four or five children.</P>

      <P>I presume it is taxable? The processing of these applications has been extremely slow.  Is there a deliberate attempt on the part of the Department and the inspectors to slow down the process? I had to make many inquiries in respect of applications and they were being sent from one section to another. Applications for social welfare benefits seem to go on a merry-go-round and the people concerned do not receive their cheques on time.  They judge us and the Department by results.  I should like to know why there has been such a long delay in the processing of applications.  Is there the necessary personnel to deal with this matter in the Department and also on the inspectors side?  The application forms that were sent out were quite comprehensive and one person said to me one would need to be a barrister to fill them.  With regard to the miserable amount of £6 per week, I will leave that to the people to judge.  It is no wonder there were only 10,000 applications, of which only half have been processed.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Connolly, I am appalled at the average increase of £6 per week per family.  The Minister has told us that 4,400 families were granted the supplement on 7 February and that this has increased to over 5,000.  I am glad that this has happened.  The Minister must realise that this scheme was primarily introduced as a result of the Government's decision to halve the food subsidies, a decision that was politically unpalatable.  Many families have suffered badly as a result of that decision.  As a consequence of halving the subsidies, the estimated increase in food costs for a family is £5 per week.  Now the Minister tells us that families who have been successful in their application under this scheme will receive £6 and that just balances the extra cost.  On the Minister's own admission 5,000 families have been successful out of an estimated 35,000. One-seventh of the families have been granted this pittance of an increase of £6 to counterbalance their increased food costs of £5 per week.  Where have the other 30,000 people who would have benefited from this scheme gone to? Those people have had to bear this cruel rise and I would like to know what has happened to them.  Have they emigrated or got lost?</P>

      <P>We have a habit of selling ourselves short.  I will just give one example.  In a three child family at the moment, if the income of the breadwinner is under £79 a week there is an automatic entitlement to £11.50 a week, maximum supplement and as and from July a breadwinner earning £84 a week with a three child family will get the maximum supplement of £13 a week.  It is a supplement to the family income generally. It is only when we have a fairly substantial number of applicants going through the system that we will be able to judge the effect and the average payment will become more meaningful in terms of analysis.  There is no delay in the processing. Out of 9,626 applicants only 7 per cent or 8 per cent are actually under examination.</P>

I would love to have the Deputy by my side to twist the arm of the Minister for the Public Service in getting sufficient staff for that section.  I am sure the Deputy would have made a delicious partner in terms of our common cause to get sections of the Department of Social Welfare properly staffed.  We got staff from the Minister by agreement but with the usual difficulties. We have a section staffed to deal with this scheme.  The advertising is imaginative and good and one does not need even the qualification of a TD to fill in the application form.  Anyway there are enough public representatives around to fill in anything for a person these days. The scheme is becoming well known and more and more people are applying.  I have no doubt that by the middle of the year there will be 10,000 or 11,000 current claims in operation.  The main thing is that the money is going to families with low incomes.  That is why I am particularly anxious to build up the scheme and then transfer it over into the child benefit scheme.</P>

It is a straight income limit and within the income limit the family get it whether they are not paying rent, are paying a fixed rent of a couple of pounds or £20 per week, it is a different system to the assessment for a medical card.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Connolly the Minister referred to Dublin being the central base for dealing with these applications.  Will the Minister agree that delays occur and that they are getting more extensive?  Will he agree <Col N="247" /> that the delays are being caused by virtue of the fact that the social welfare system is a complete duplication in regard to the many benefits people must avail of?  The health boards carry out an investigation and the Department of Social Welfare later carry out a similar investigation. That must result in an enormous expense on the Exchequer because there is a duplication of work by two sets of officials. The whole system is being fouled up and health boards cannot get their refunds from the Department.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the ongoing battle between the health boards and the Department in regard to refunds.  The Department should take a hard look at this aspect and either accept responsibility for the payments or make the health boards responsible for them.  If we are to get satisfaction and, above all, get the assistance to those who are in dire need of it there will have to be a dramatic change in the administration of the scheme by the Department.</P>
      <P>There is a grave anomaly in regard to the 30 hour condition in order to qualify. Many people will not qualify if they are employed by a State-sponsored body or a Department on short time.  Those people must be on call for the entire week.  Those who make a full social welfare contribution and qualify for all the benefits in relation to the amount they pay should be brought into benefit.  They are entitled to unemployment benefit or disability benefit if they exceed 20 hours per week. I appreciate the point the Minister made in regard to employers availing of this to overcome the payment of wages but irrespective of what scheme is implemented there will always be people shrewd enough to find a loophole to operate the scheme to their benefit.  It is a matter for the officials of the Department to ensure that that does not take place. The Minister should have another look at the anomaly that exists in the case mentioned by Deputy Leonard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not have been fairer to consider the person who pays full PRSI contribution and is unable <Col N="248" /> to avail of work rather than having a 30 hour minimum qualifying limit?  The person who pays a full contribution should be brought into the scheme.  At present once a person works in excess of 18 hours that person is compelled to pay the full PRSI.  When having another look at the family income supplement scheme the Minister should consider the entire area of supplementary benefits.  I heard a report at a recent meeting of the health board that a huge amount of money is not recoupable.  I understood that where people were paid supplementary benefits a check was carried out with the local health board to ensure there was no duplication and to collect arrears.  I understand millions of pounds are lost annually by people being paid on the double.</P>
      <P>It is time the Department had another look at the double assessment system. An assessment is carried out for an old age pension but that is not accepted as an assessment for a medical card.  It should be because an old age pensioner can have a maximum pension and an income of £6 per week and qualify for a medical card.  However, there is no guarantee such a person will get a medical card because health board officials are liable to assess a person in a different way from a social welfare officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the point raised by Deputy McCarthy in regard to the backdating of payments. Deputies will be aware that the scheme was introduced on 1 November 1984 with payments backdated to 6 September of that year for any person who claimed before 1 December.  We allowed reasonable leeway in that regard.  A substantial number were backdated.  I will send details to the Deputy when we have the final figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised the issue of means testing multiplicity.  I agree with him that there is an urgent need to rationalise the whole system of means testing. It is fair to say that it is the bane of the social welfare and health board <Col N="249" /> systems.  I forget how recently somebody made out the number of means tests, but one figure was something like 27 separate systems of means testing in operation. There is a very grave need to rationalise and effectively develop the social welfare system in this regard, but I throw the point to the Deputies.  Just as we must rationalise the fuel scheme which is one of those <i>ad hoc</i> schemes which has grown up over the years, a £20 million scheme, no means test system can be rationalised unless some people who are currently getting benefit have their benefit reduced or do not get it at all and others who are not getting it will get it and should be getting it on a more equitable basis.  You cannot rationalise upwards in one direction because the inherent inequity in the method of assessment will still remain. Frequently inherent injustices and inequities are inbuilt over the passage of time and the change in social circumstances in our means testing structures.</P>
    <P>If we want to do the root and branch job in relation to our income maintenance systems, we must approach it on the basis that it will be a very difficult exercise.  We have just seen the appallingly difficult exercise of trying to bring 30,000 smallholders from a rateable valuation system of assessment on to a factual assessment basis for payment and the extreme difficulty posed by that.  We did not do it as an Oireachtas until we were told to do it by the courts and forced into doing it as a result, ironically, of action taken by the farmers in relation to the PLV system.  There was no great saving of money in that exercise, perhaps £1 million up or down, one way or the other, nothing of great consequence.  Some smallholders have received substantial increases while others have suffered substantial decreases and one way or the other a system of more equitable means testing has been introduced.  Deputies are well aware of the enormous difficulty which they face particularly in the western counties on that issue.</P>
    <P>As soon as I get the breakdown for Deputy Walsh of where these 5,500 persons currently come from I will send the details directly to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline our reasons for opposing this section.  Last year the Government raised from £36 to £43 the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating rates of pay-related benefit and at that time they saved £2.8 million to the Exchequer.  This year they carry on the exercise further and increase it from £43 to £49 and in so doing another £2.08 million will be saved to the Exchequer.  These savings are being made at the expense of unfortunate people who become unemployed, disabled or sick.  I am sure the Minister is aware that many of these people who become suddenly unemployed or ill will find themselves, as a result of these losses, much worse off than they are and they will find it extremely difficult to cope and will be unable to meet their commitments. That is why we oppose this section of the Bill.  It is another attempt to erode the incomes of those on short term payments and it is a ploy which has been adopted consistently over two years by this Government to ensure that extra moneys are saved to the Exchequer at the expense of the recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A matter raised on Second Stage to which I would like to refer concerns unemployment benefit for migrant workers.  People are being deprived of their pay-related benefit.  Anybody who is unfortunate enough to have to go outside the country to seek employment will have an entitlement under EC regulations, but one of those regulations is <Col N="251" /> creating a considerable problem.  That regulation took effect from 1 April 1973 and under it a person who works in Europe for a number of years and then comes back here will find it necessary to have one contribution here before he has any entitlement to benefit.  Many such people would have pay-related and unemployment benefit entitlement by virtue of the fact that they cannot secure employment and cannot make a contribution, but they are then deprived of the benefit until they can make this contribution. That is penal and I ask the Minister to initiate some action on it.</P>
      <P>I realise that this has emerged from the EC, but it should be rectified.  I know of a young man who worked in Germany for three years, who returned here last October and has been unable to get any benefit because he cannot get a week's work which would give him his full entitlement. This is not a great incentive to people to go out and seek employment. No one wants to see the reintroduction of wholesale emigration such as we saw in the fifties, but in recent times the point has been made here and outside the House that in future greater mobility of labour will be essential, yet those who become mobile are being penalised for doing so.  I ask the Minister to arrange to have the matter taken up in the European Parliament in an effort to rectify this penal legislation.</P>

      <P>No.  I would like to make a brief point on it.  I can give Deputy O'Sullivan information on the matter he has raised.  According to the EC Regulations on Migrant Workers there must be the one standard.  There is no option and we must enforce the EC Regulation as such.  I can supply Deputy O'Sullivan <Col N="252" /> with the details of the Regulation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCarthy referred to the raising of the floor from £43 to £49.  That applies only to any new claim after 1 April.  Current claims are not in any way affected by the change.  Therefore, its effect is very reduced.  If the floor were adjusted on an inflation basis from 1974 onwards when it was £14, it would need to be something in the region of £79 per week.  It was £14 in 1974 when the flat rate was only £6.55.  It was double the flat rate.  Today if it were double the flat rate it would be £79.  Instead it has been kept at £49.  It did not rise during the seventies. In April 1981 it was at £20 and today it is £49.  I am very sensitive about this issue and assure Deputies I will keep a close eye on it.  It is a very valuable supplement to benefit.  Other countries, for example, the UK, have done away with PRB because they could not afford it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases it is not possible to get full contributions so I suggest that if a person were allowed to make a voluntary contribution we would then be complying with EC regulations. Take the case of a young single man who worked abroad for three years.  At this stage any money which he earned has been spent.  He does not qualify for supplementary welfare allowance because he lives with his parents and their income is taken into account.  He has now become a burden on the household, which is most unjust.  This is not an isolated case.  There should be some way in which a person could make a voluntary contribution if they are not able to secure employment and thereby comply with the EC regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. <Col N="35" /> 496, 497 and 498 together.  Ireland promotes the implementation of the elements of the resolution on Concerted International Action against Apartheid by supporting relevant policies and actions in international for a such as the United Nations, its specialised agencies and other international bodies.  Ireland also implements domestically policies which are in accord with the provisions of the resolution.</P>
      <P>The Government have increased Ireland's pledges of assistance to United Nations funds which assist the victims of apartheid from £42,000 in 1984 to £50,000 in 1985.  They also granted aid to a nongovernmental organisation for a project in South Africa which will assist the education of black school children, who are discriminated against by the South African education system.  Such assistance to non-governmental organisations in South Africa will continue to be a feature of the bilateral aid programme.  The Government also participate in and contribute to the work of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference, one of whose aims is to reduce the dependence of Southern African States on South Africa.</P>
      <P>There are no cultural, scientific or academic agreements between Ireland and South Africa.  The Government discourage sports contacts between Ireland and South Africa by persuasion, by withholding funds from organisations which engage in such contacts and by their preparedness to refuse entry to representative sports teams from South Africa.</P>

The primary responsibility for any company's performance rests, of course, with its owners and management.  However, the state agencies involved with the furniture industry have given all appropriate assistance possible to McElroys since its establishment.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 500 and 501 together.  The terms of the resolution passed by the Dáil on June 16 1982 were complied with by the instruction to the then liquidator to find a purchaser for the studios who would use it for film-making and related purposes.  This instruction was effected by the inclusion of covenant, <Col N="37" /> as follows, in the special conditions attaching to the sale contract of the Ardmore property:</P>
      <P>The Purchaser hereby undertakes and hereby expressly agrees with the Vendor that the premises, the subject of this sale, shall be used exclusively for the purpose of Film Studios or otherwise for the business of Film Making or similar or related activities for three years following the close of sale but in the event of sale or change of user within the three year period, the purchaser will give to the Minister for Industry and Energy three months notice in advance in writing of the proposed sale or change of user.</P>
      <P>A covenant to this effect will be contained in the Conveyance to the Purchaser together with a further covenant that any future Conveyance within the said three year period shall contain a similar covenant as to the user of the premises the subject of this sale.</P>
      <P>I believe that the terms of the foregoing covenant comply with the terms of the Dáil resolution in so far as they ensured that sale of the studios took place to a concern that did intend to use them as film studios.  I note with regret that a liquidator is again in the process of selling the studios.  My Department has been in contact with the liquidator to advise him of the existence of the covenant and that developments will be monitored closely.</P>

      <P>My approval in principle to the proposals for the Wexford main drainage scheme issued on 7 November 1984 subject to the submission of a report on a number of technical aspects of the scheme which required clarification.  That report which was received on 20 February 1985 is being examined in my Department with a view to the early approval of the preparation of contract documents. The question of making capital available for this scheme will not arise until the contract documents have been prepared by the local authority and submitted for my approval.</P>

      <P>The application made in this case was for the installation of water and sewerage facilities, the building of a chimney, the provision of a bathroom and bedroom and the carrying out of major necessary repairs to the fabric of the house.  A grant cannot be allowed for the installation of a water supply as this work is being grant aided as part of a group water scheme.  Grants cannot be allowed for the bathroom, sewerage, and chimney aspects of the application because these facilities are already in existence in the house.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as the taxpayer's total income for the current year is not likely to exceed the appropriate age exemption threshold of £6,600, he is not liable to income tax for 1984-85.  Accordingly, the question of tax relief in respect of medical insurance payments does not arise for 1984-85.  A certificate granting tax exemption for that year was issued to him in October 1984 and this replaced the normal certificate of tax-free allowances (which would have included a figure in respect of medical insurance relief).</P>

      <P>The person concerned reached age 66 years on 28 September 1984 and claimed a contributory old age pension on 1 November 1984.  He was awarded the pension at the maximum rate with effect from 28 September 1984, the date on which he reached age 66 years. A contributory old age pension book containing orders payable from 25 January 1985 was issued to the designated post office on 23 January 1985 for collection by him and he was notified accordingly. He was in receipt of invalidity pension up to the previous week.</P>
      <P>All arrears of contributory old age pension due to the person concerned have been issued to him by payable order. Pensions are paid weekly in advance and are not payable in respect of periods less than a week.  Accordingly, the amount of invalidity pension paid to him from 27 September 1984 fell to be deducted from the arrears of contributory old age pension due to him from 28 September 1984 to 24 January 1984.  The splitting of the payment of pensions between Thursdays and Fridays is done to avoid congestion in post offices.</P>

      <P>The means of the person concerned were assessed on the basis of his earnings from self-employment as a general labourer.  Following an investigation of his case by a social welfare officer his earnings were estimated at £3,640 per annum and as this amount exceeded the statutory limit applicable to him, £2,935.40 per annum, his unemployment assistance claim was disallowed <Col N="83" /> accordingly.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and an appeals officer also assessed his means as being in excess of the statutory limit of £2,935.40 per annum.  He was informed accordingly and he has not signed as unemployed at his local office since 26 February 1985.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the Department's services are already decentralised to a considerable extent.  For example unemployment payments are made through the Department's countrywide network of employment offices.  In the case of long term benefits, such as pensions and children's allowance where the periods of entitlement can be established well in advance, although the entitlements are decided centrally, payment is made by means of books of vouchers cashable at local post offices.  Some 362,000 pensioners and 454,000 families on children's allowances are paid by this method. There are no immediate plans to transfer administration of disability benefit and other benefits from headquarters to local offices.  Such a move would require considerable extra resources by way of staff, accommodation and equipment and the local offices are already under severe pressure because of the increasing number of claimants for unemployment payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little doubt but that a disability benefit system which could relate more closely to local circumstances would lead to greater efficiencies in administration and provide a better service to the public. To this end visual display terminals linked to the Department's computers have been installed in many of the Department's offices to provide a rapid inquiry service in relation to disability benefit claim.  It is intended to equip all the Department's information offices with these inquiry terminals in due course. Further development of these inquiry facilities to provide a claims processing function for disability benefits at local offices will have to await a more comprehensive computerisation of all the services provided in the local offices.  Such a programme is planned for but will take <Col N="88" /> several years to complete.  The administration of the Department's services, including the actual method of payment used in the individual schemes, is kept under continual review with a view to its improvement to the advantage of beneficiaries by the use of modern technology and administrative methods.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for continued receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a claimant must continue to make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to prevail on her husband to contribute to her support and maintenance and that of their children.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer held that this condition was not satisfied by the person concerned and terminated her benefit with effect from 13 December 1984.  She recently appealed against the decision and the case is being sent to an appeals officer for hearing at the earliest possible date.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension is that there must be, on either the late husband's or the widow's own insurance, a yearly average of at least 39 contributions in either the last three or five contribution years prior to the husband's death (or his reaching pension age, whichever is the earlier) or a yearly average of at least 24 contributions over the period from entry into insurance up to the end of the contribution year prior to his death (or reaching pension age). The late husband in this case was a farmer and had no insurable employment for social welfare purposes.  The widow herself however was insured prior to her marriage in April 1963.  According to the records of the Department she had a total of 793 contributions over the period from 1947-48 (the year she entered insurance) up to the time she married.  This gives a yearly average of only 22 contributions over the thirty five years from 1947-48 to 1981-82, the contribution year before her husband's death in November 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She had no insurance contributions in the three or five years immediately prior to her husband's death so she does not therefore qualify under any of the three average tests.  Further inquiries are however being made to see if the claimant has entitlement to any additional insurance contributions which might serve to qualify her for a pension.  Her claim for a non-contributory pension was refused because her means, assessed at £57.69 per week derived from a farm holding, exceeded the limit of £44 applicable to her as a widow under 66 years with no qualified children.  She was notified to this <Col N="98" /> effect and of her right of appeal against the decision.</P>

      <P>Internationally accepted medical and scientific information suggests that asbestos may cause cancer and asbestosis.  As a carcinogen (cancer causing agent) there is no known safe level for asbestos exposure. As it is not feasible on technical, scientific or practical grounds to dispense with asbestos products at the present time, the European Communities have adopted a Council Directive for the protection of workers who are exposed to asbestos at work.  Among other provisions, the Directive sets a limit value (maximum permissible exposure) of 1 fibre per cubic centimetre as being the maximum level of asbestos in air to which workers may be exposed.  In the case of crocidolite or blue asbestos (which is thought to be more hazardous than other types of asbestos) the Directive sets a lower limit value of 0.5 fibres per c.c. This Directive is due for implementation by member states by 1 January 1987.</P>
