    <Title>Dublin Transport Authority Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year will be a year of major overhaul and reform for transport in Ireland. We have four major Transport Bills before the Oireachtas at this moment: the Road Transport Bill, the Air Transport <Col N="1150" /> Bill, the Canals Bill and now the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.</P>
    <P>Within a week I will be circulating the Free Ports Bill and during the course of the year we will have the CIE Restructuring Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill, the Shannon Port Authority Bill and the Rosslare Harbour Authority Bill.  In addition, during the summer recess, a Green Paper on national transport policy will be published.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this Bill is part of the most substantial overhaul of the transport scene in Ireland for many years, the intention of which is to give to transport a vibrance, vitality and efficiency which it has for too long lacked.  I should say at the outset that this Bill is quite different from the draft heads of Bill prepared by my predecessor, Deputy Wilson, and I make no apologies for that.  When I came into office, I examined Deputy Wilson's proposals and I felt that the net result of what he proposed would be to add greatly to bureaucracy and almost certainly reduce the vitality of transport.  Therefore, what we are bringing before the Dáil in the present Bill is a set of proposals greatly revised, giving a much leaner and fitter structure to the Dublin Transport Authority &mdash; DTA for short.  For example, under the previous proposals the DTA would have become a very substantial bureaucracy of road designers and planners, replicating what is already duplicated in the local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  Moreover, final road plans would have fallen to be decided by the Cabinet which would have become a super-planning committee for Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>I say this not as a criticism of Deputy Wilson's proposals, but just to point out that I felt there was a better way, a more efficient way, a cheaper way of achieving the same objectives and these are the proposals I have now before the House. Moreover, there was a need to correlate this measure with local government reforms in Dublin.  This has now been done.</P>
    <P>The need for co-ordination of transport investment, traffic management and public transport services in the Dublin <Col N="1151" /> area is self-evident and the aim of this Bill is to give it that co-ordination so as to rid Dublin of traffic jams and to give it a reliable and cheap public transport system.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority will:</P>
    <P> (1)  be connected to the new local authority system for Dublin city and county;</P>
    <P>(2)  take over from the Garda Commissioner the role of road traffic authority in its functional area;</P>
    <P>(3)  assume responsibility for all traffic management schemes, i.e., traffic lights, road signs, etc.;</P>
    <P>(4)  take over responsibility for the taxi service from the Department of the Environment and the local authorities;</P>
    <P>(5)  have responsibility for the routing, pricing and licensing of all bus services;</P>
    <P>(6)  be the advisor to the Government on transport infrastructure investment in the Dublin area on road, rail and bus;</P>
    <P>(7)  have the right to make recommendations to the local authorities and to the Minister for the Environment about local authorities' development plans and road plans, and the right of consultation by the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála on all planning applications and appeals with significant implications for traffic management or provision of transport services;</P>
    <P>(8)  have the power to direct local authorities to bollard roads, to convert long roads into a number of cul-de-sacs to prevent joyriding;</P>
    <P>(9)  have power to direct local authorities to ramp roads to prevent speeding;</P>
    <P>(10)  have control over the provision of public car parks in the Dublin area;</P>
    <P>(11)  have control over the timing and co-ordination of road works. </P>
    <P>As far as transport planning for the <Col N="1152" /> Dublin area is concerned, there is a clear need to ensure that public and private transport requirements are treated in an integrated and co-ordinated manner.  In particular, the development plans and road proposals of the local authorities must take public transport needs fully into account.</P>
    <P>Secondly, co-ordinated planning should in turn result in co-ordinated assessments being made of the requirements for annual Exchequer funding of public and private transport.  This is vital if the limited Exchequer funds available are to yield the maximum benefits to the community.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, as far as public transport services are concerned, monitoring of CIE's performance and regulation of such matters as taxi services and the provision of bus services by private operators should all be entrusted to a body whose functions relate to every major aspect of private and public transport in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Finally, the regulation and management of traffic in the Dublin area needs to be put on a new statutory footing. The establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority was the principal recommendation of the Report on Passenger Transport Services in the Dublin Area, presented by the Transport Consultative Commission.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Task Force, the non-statutory forerunner of the DTA, has achieved quite a lot.  I wish to record my appreciation of its efforts. Comprising senior representatives of the Government Departments directly concerned, the Garda Commissioner and the Dublin City and County Manager, and with the assistance of CIE, the Task Force has achieved a number of important improvements in traffic management in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>These improvements have been secured as a result of the development by the Task Force of a strategy aimed at reducing traffic congestion at peak hours by getting commuters to switch from cars to buses.  The strategy has involved a combination of improvements to the bus services and a parking policy which discourages all-day parking in the city <Col N="1153" /> centre.  Among the measures implemented have been the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash; over 600 new or re-engined buses are now in service in CIE's Dublin fleet, which numbers about 840 buses in all;</P>
    <P>&mdash; buslanes have been successfully implemented at 65 locations, covering virtually all of the main arterial routes into the city centre;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the traffic warden service has grown from a small number working on a part-time basis to 109 full-time and 16 part-time wardens;</P>
    <P>&mdash; 1,700 on-street car parking spaces formerly available for all-day parking have been converted to short-stay use by the provision of parking meters. </P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these improvements traffic congestion persists as a very pressing problem.  The continuing lack of a single statutory body with responsibility, and the necessary powers, for traffic management in the Dublin area and the consequential complexity of arrangements has meant that traffic problems could not be tackled with sufficient speed, vigour or thoroughness.  A non-statutory grouping such as the Task Force, which is dependent on the combined efforts of its member-agencies, each of which has its own priorities and concerns, is not equal to the task except on an interim basis.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate at this juncture for me to indicate in detail how the Dublin Transport Authority proposed in this Bill compared with what was proposed by the Transport Consultative Commission.  As regards functions, as recommended by the Commission the DTA will have functions in the areas of transport planning and funding and public transport services, in addition to traffic management.  However, the Authority's planning functions exclude a substantial element recommended by the Commission, namely, that the authority itself would draw up a comprehensive Dublin Transport Plan.  Such a plan, <Col N="1154" /> when approved by the Government, would be binding on all concerned.  This recommendation was not accepted because of the risk of duplicating the on-going planning work of the local authorities and CIE.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Bill required the Authority to assess the plans of those bodies and make recommendations to the Ministers for Communications and the Environment, as appropriate.  Any recommendations to Ministers by the Authority in relation to local authority functions will also be submitted to the Dublin Metropolitan Council when that is established in due course.  In these ways the integration of transport planning recommended by the commission will be achieved.</P>
    <P>In practice, the Dublin Transport Authority would have to operate having regard to the settled general planning strategy adopted for its functional area by the local authorities in question.  It will input into that strategy.  The Authority's planning functions will be reviewed in the light of how the authority is operating. Additional functions in that particular matter, or in other matters within its remit, may be given by ministerial order under section 9 of the Bill, subject to Oireachtas control.</P>
    <P>As regards the structure of the Authority, the commission recommended an executive board below the Authority itself.  The Authority would have 15 members, including elected representatives of the Dublin local authorities and other relevant interests.  This would be too unwieldly an organisation and could not therefore be accepted.  Instead, the Bill provides for a more concise and unified Authority, with a maximum of 12 members, to be appointed by the Minister for Communications on the basis of appropriate experience and expertise in transport and other relevant matters.  Four members of the Authority will be members of the four proposed main Dublin local authorities who are nominated by them for membership of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Under section 10 of the Bill, the DTA's functional area will generally cover all of the areas of the three existing Dublin local authorities, Dublin Corporation, <Col N="1155" /> Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation.  It may be desirable, however, that for the purposes of specific functions, for example, in relation to public transport services, the Authority's area should be somewhat greater than that.  Section 10 provides the necessary flexibility in that the authority's functional area may be varied in respect of all or any of its functions by ministerial order, subject to Oireachtas control.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill is accompanied by Explanatory Memorandum, it is not necessary for me to go through it in any detailed way.  I have already referred briefly to the planning functions of the Authority, which are set out in Part III of Bill.  I indicated how the DTA will integrate the roads and land use planning of the Dublin local authorities and the public transport planning of CIE.  It will also have an advisory role in relation to planning applications and appeals which have major implications for traffic management or the provision of transport services.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, major road works in the Dublin area have included the Clontarf Embankment Road, development of the Airport road, the construction of Templeogue Bridge and by-passes at Swords, Palmerstown, Cabinteely and Santry.  In recent years, three new bridges have been erected over the River Liffey &mdash; the Frank Sherwin Bridge at Heuston Station, the Matt Talbot Bridge at the Custom House, and the East Link Bridge which has facilitated some through traffic in avoiding the city centre and a substantial time saving is being achieved by users.</P>
    <P>In the major road plans already approved by the Government, the road situation in Dublin will be completely transformed by the end of this decade. The motorway box around the city from Stillorgan to Swords will be completed in three parts, the Southern Cross Route at one end, the Northern Cross Route at the other end and, in the middle, the Western Parkway, which only in the past few days has got the go-ahead from Dublin County Council.  This will include a high-level toll bridge over the River <Col N="1156" /> Liffey at Strawberry Beds.  In addition, the Airport by-pass, already well advanced, will be completed; the Chapelizod, Lucan and the Bray/Shankill by-passes, together with the new Navan Road, will be completed.  So, too, will the inner tangent route.</P>
    <P>This massive infrastructural investment has been accompanied by a huge public transport investment in the electrified rail services on the Howth-Bray line, or DART as it has become known. The DART services commenced in July of last year and the public's response so far has been encouraging.  However, even to cover its operational costs, it would require twice as many passengers per day as have now been achieved and it is CIE's aim to achieve this by 1987.</P>
    <P>I must express grave disappointment at the failure of CIE and the unions to agree so far on the provision of feeder services for the DART.  If the huge public investment in the DART is to be even half justified, it is absolutely imperative that these feeder services commence without further delay.  CIE and the unions should know that if they are not prepared to provide the feeder services, there are many private operators who would be so prepared; and I am under some considerable pressure to consider this option.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Rail Rapid Transit Study of 1975 saw the electrification of the Howth-Bray line as the first phase in a city-wide electrified rail system.  The next phase recommended was the provision of electrified services between Tallaght and Heuston Station.  Discussions have taken place between CIE and the Department of Communications in recent years about the question of providing electrified services between Tallaght-Clondalkin and Heuston Station with, initially, a feeder bus service to the city centre.  The cost of that proposal could be in excess of £100 million.  The possibility of various cheaper alteratives such as a busway to Tallaght, or diesel rather than electrified rail services, has been discussed with CIE but no definite proposals have yet emerged.</P>
    <P>The question of what public transport services are to be provided for Tallaght-Clondalkin <Col N="1157" /> and other developing areas west of the city, and whether such services should be provided by rail, road or busway, will require priority consideration by the DTA.  Consultation will be necessary with the local authorities and CIE.  Given the constraints on resources, the high cost of rail projects will require that cheaper bus-based alternatives are brought to the forefront in the DTA's consideration of these questions.</P>
    <P>As far as funding of transport is concerned, the authority will make recommendations as to the priorities in annual Exchequer allocations, both capital and current, for roads and public transport to the Ministers for the Environment and Communications, respectively, to which section 21 refers.  The importance of striking the best balance between the transport modes is readily apparent.  In 1984, Exchequer grants to the Dublin local authorities for road maintenance and improvement works totalled £25 million, while CIE's Dublin services were subvented by the Exchequer in the amount of £34 million.</P>
    <P>Section 21 should provide the Authority with an effective budgetary role to complement its planning role, without the additional procedures which would be necessary if the relevant funds were to flow through the DTA to the local authorities and CIE.  Again, however, the budgetary functions of the Authority merit reconsideration when experience of the working of the Authority is gained. The ministerial order mechanism under section 9 of the Bill provides the necessary flexibility.  In the area of traffic management, where a more direct regulatory role is proposed for the Authority, the DTA will disburse Exchequer funds under section 42 of the Bill to the local authorities to have specific schemes implemented.</P>
    <P>In the area of public transport services, which is dealt with in Part IV of the Bill, the Authority will set objectives in relation to the extent and standard of bus and suburban rail services to be provided in the Authority's functional area by CIE, within their Exchequer subvention.  The <Col N="1158" /> Authority will also monitor CIE's progress on meeting such objectives.  This will impose a healthy discipline on CIE, and will enable value for money to be assessed as far as Exchequer subvention is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that CIE will not vary their fares for Dublin bus and suburban rail services without the approval of the Authority, given with the consent of the Minister for Communications. The DTA will also take over responsibility from the Minister for Communications for the licensing of private bus operators to provide public transport services in Dublin, if thought necessary, and for the control of taxi services in the area.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of CIE will involve the separate administration by subsidiaries of Dublin city services, provincial bus services and the railway.  Links will, therefore, have to be established between the DTA and the new CIE subsidiaries with responsibility for Dublin city services and for the railway &mdash; which is likely to retain responsibility for DART &mdash; or directly with CIE itself.</P>
    <P>While the preparation of the new CIE legislation is in hands, the restructuring of CIE will take some time to effect.  The Government are anxious to get the DTA working as soon as possible.  The interface between the DTA and the new CIE subsidiaries with responsibility for Dublin bus and suburban railway services will broadly follow the lines of the interface between the Authority and the present CIE provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I must now refer to the continuing industrial relations difficulties in CIE's Dublin bus services which have contributed to a continuing decline in bus usage in the city.  The number of man days lost through industrial action averaged over 12,000 per annum from 1980 to 1984, compared with approximately 4,000 per annum in the preceding five years.  In 1984, 25, 181 man days were lost.  These stoppages have adversely affected public confidence in the reliability of the service, despite the real improvements brought about by investment in new buses and bus priority measures.</P>
    <P>The new organisational structure for <Col N="1159" /> CIE will enable any management defects in the industrial relations area to be remedied. The DTA will be intensifying the pro-public transport traffic management strategy begun by the task force, so that the operating environment for buses and trains will be further improved.  It is not too much to ask that the unions and management resolve the various defects on their sides, particularly that of unofficial or unalloted industrial action on the union side.  The Government and the general public are entitled to demand good industrial relations in order to aid the major efforts that are being made to help CIE.</P>
    <P>The DTA is being given the function, now the prerogative of the Minister for Communications, of licensing private bus operators to provide public transport services, subject to the Minister for Communications having an appellate function in the matter.  The licensing question will, therefore, be one for the Authority in the first instance.  While there may well be scope for the provision by licensed private operators of limited or specialised bus services in the Dublin area, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the likely extent of such provision.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the establishment of the DTA and the reorganisation of CIE will provide the environment in which CIE management and staff should be able to deliver an efficient and reliable service.  It would be inconsistent at the same time to permit private operators to provide scheduled services on any extensive basis, even if they were in a position to do so.  CIE must avail of the opportunity being provided for them, however, and no doubt the DTA will keep the licensing question under continuous review.</P>
    <P>The DTA will be the regulatory body for taxi services in the Dublin area.  Matters such as the licensing of vehicles and drivers and the approval of maximum fares will be controlled by the Authority. Taxi services are part of the public transport system and should be consciously developed as such.  They should be an element in the overall traffic and transport strategy for Dublin.  Taxis should <Col N="1160" /> provide a flexible service to complement the bus services, for example, in the city centre areas to meet the needs of business people and shoppers particularly.  Such a service, particularly if attractively priced, would make it easier for people to leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the Authority will approve maximum taxi fares and also any change in CIE fares.  This Bill also provides that the authority will control charges for public car parking, both on street and off street, in the Dublin area. The involvement of the National Prices Commission in settling these various transport related charges and fares will cease.  This is not a removal of price control, of course, but a transfer of that function to the Authority from the NPC. This is in view of the overall nature of the Authority's role in transport matters and in the interest of minimising the number of agencies required to be involved in those matters.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill sets out the traffic management functions of the Dublin Transport Authority.  The Authority will both devise traffic and parking measures and make by-laws to give effect to them. These functions have, heretofore, rested with the Garda Commissioner acting either on his own initiative or at the request of the local authority.  The consent of the Minister for the Environment will be required for the Authority by-laws. This will ensure the necessary degree of compatibility with the national &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; regulations made by that Minister, and with other local traffic and parking by-laws throughout the country which will continue to be made by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Authority will also regulate public car parks and roadworks under powers being provided in legislation for the first time.  The other important new power which is being provided in section 32 will enable the Authority, by means of bollards, to restrict, wholly or partly, the use of public roads by vehicles and, by means of road ramps, to restrict vehicle speeds on public roads.  This power will have particular relevance for controlling traffic in built-up areas and housing estates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> This new power will be an extremely important one.  Unfortunately, due to the alarming growth of what has become known as joyriding, many residential roads have become dangerous racetracks where life, limb and property are constantly endangered.  Moreover, with the growth of vehicular traffic, many motorists use residential roads as &ldquo;rat runs&rdquo; or short-cuts from one arterial road to another.  It will now be possible for the Dublin Transport Authority to decide, where appropriate and suitable, to make existing residential roads in whole or in part, into <i>cul-de-sacs</i>, by means of bollards. I have no doubt that this power will be warmly welcomed by many communities throughout the city as a means of making their roadways safe once again.  We are also providing power for the Authority to arrange, where suitable, for ramps on Dublin roads in order to inhibit joyriding or excessive speeds.</P>
    <P>The traffic warden service will be transferred to the Authority under section 15, but otherwise the Garda will continue to be responsible for traffic law enforcement. The traffic and parking schemes will be implemented by the local authorities on behalf of the Authority with funds provided for by the latter.</P>
    <P>The objective of traffic management is to make the optimum use of the existing roads network for the movement of people and goods.  Traffic management is vitally important.  Traffic management works can yield significant returns, in terms of alleviating congestion, from relatively low levels of expenditure.  In 1985 £2.7 million approximately will be made available by the Exchequer for such works in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I will be looking to the Dublin Transport Authority to revamp and intensify the traffic management efforts of the Task Force, and to examine afresh existing traffic arrangement.  In particular, I wish to see the Authority develop a comprehensive parking strategy in favour of the short-stay parker, as against the all-day parker.  Such a strategy would embrace off-street and on-street spaces, charges, parking periods and types of <Col N="1162" /> parking controls and, in particular, effective measures against illegal parking.</P>
    <P>No traffic management strategy can succeed without proper enforcement. The transfer of the traffic warden service to the DTA should result in a more effective and professional service.  The provisions of the Bill dealing with the transfer include guarantees against any worsening of the wardens' pre-transfer pay, conditions of service and superannuation entitlements. I would like to see the development of a supervisory structure for the Dublin traffic warden service which would improve efficiency and, also, provide incentives for advancement for the traffic wardens.  The Garda too, I feel, could step up their traffic law enforcement efforts considerably, notwithstanding the many higher priority demands that are made upon them.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specific functions I have outlined, the DTA will have the general functions under section 8 of the Bill of ensuring, in so far as they can, the proper planning and efficient operation of road and rail transport in their functional area and of promoting and engaging in public education and research related to road and rail transport. There should be no overlap or duplication between the education and research functions of the Authority and functions of An Foras Forbartha and the National Road Safety Association, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The maximum penalties for offences under the Bill when enacted are set out in section 52.  The actual penalty imposed in any case will, of course, be a matter for the court.  Maximum penalties of £1,000 and/or one year's imprisonment on summary conviction, or £50,000 and/or five years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment, are provided for in respect of three types of offence.  These are unauthorised disclosure of information by a member or employee of the Authority, failure of an Authority member or employee to disclose a beneficial interest in matters being dealt with by the Authority, and unauthorised roadworks.  The maximum penalties provided for in these cases are high, but rightly so I believe, in <Col N="1163" /> view of the potentially very serious nature of the offences.</P>
    <P>Section 52 also provides that the same penalties as apply under the Road Traffic Acts for the country as a whole will apply to other offences under the Bill, namely breaches of the Authority's by-laws under sections 31 and 36.  Under section 43 the levels of the fines-on-the-spot imposed for parking offences will continue to be set in regulations made by the Minister for the Environment.  He is currently reviewing the levels of these fines.</P>
    <P>As far as the Authority's running costs are concerned, the Bill provides for financing of the Authority by the Exchequer, and that staff numbers and salary levels will be subject to ministerial control, in the interests of economy and efficiency.  I can, if necessary, avail of the flexibility provided by the commencement provisions of the Bill to assign functions to the Authority on a phased basis.  I can assure the House that the Authority will be a lean and fit body.</P>
    <P>With this approach, the running costs of the DTA will not be permitted to exceed £400,000 in their first full year of operation.  This figure is net of the costs of the traffic warden service, the transfer of which will merely result in a re-allocation of Exchequer funds between the Vote of the Garda Commissioner and that of my Department.</P>
    <P>The terms and conditions of the staff of the Authority will be analogous to the terms and conditions of staff in the local authority service.  I am hopeful that the Authority will be able to select staff among existing competent and experienced public service personel.  This should enable some offsetting staff savings in other bodies, but, at this stage, it is not possible to quantify the likely level of such savings.</P>
    <P>After their first year of operation, the staffing of the Authority will be reviewed in the light of experience, and in the light of any additional functions which might be given to them and of their capacity to bring about worthwhile savings to the Exchequer or to the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> It is very clear now that traffic and transport problems in Dublin are currently imposing massive hidden costs on industry, public transport and private motorists and will continue to do so until the problems are properly tackled.  I am convinced that the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, with the comprehensive range of functions and powers contained in this Bill, is the way in which to tackle those problems.  I am confident that the benefits which will accrue to the Exchequer and to the community from the establishment of the Authority will greatly exceed its costs.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Having called on numerous occasions on the Minister to bring the Bill before the House I must say that my disappointment at what has been brought before us is great.  This is precisely the sort of Dublin Transport Authority Bill which Dublin city does not need at the moment.  The amount of thought and work put into the problems of Dublin city transport since the Transport Consultative Commission were set up, and reported in March 1980, was an indication of the importance attached to the Dublin transport problem as far as Dublin city was concerned, and as far as the whole country was concerned because it is a matter of great consequence for all citizens how transport is managed in the capital city which is either the focal point or starting point for so much transport.  It is quite obvious that either the Minister's heart was not in the Bill or, and this is more likely, that the Minister was outvoted or outmanoeuvred by his colleagues in major elements which the Bill should contain.  It is a weak and inadequate Bill, one which makes no new demands on the interested parties, those with vested interests in transport in Dublin, to improve in a scientific and positive way the traffic in this our capital city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter that is obvious to anybody who is travelling through the city of Dublin that the provision of the new link bridge and, of course, the numerous industrial and commercial shutdowns, <Col N="1165" /> have caused an easement of traffic congestion but I would like to think that the House would not relate our transport policies to the present position.  Hopefully with a change in economic policy, consequent upon a change of Government, of course, because there is no hope otherwise, industry and commerce will revive in the city.  In order to cope with the heavy traffic that will result we will have to have intelligent, effective transport legislation to take us on to the end of this century and beyond.  The Bill is not it.  The very wording of the Explanatory Memorandum to which the Minister referred in his speech is anaemic and apologetic.  There is no drive behind the phrasing.  I should like to quote from the explanatory memorandum:</P>
    <P>Transport planning: it will be responsible for appraising and making recommendations to the relevant local authorities and to the Ministers for Communications and the Environment, as appropriate, on the long term planning of road and rail transport in the Dublin area, both as regards infrastructure (roads, bus and rail facilities, etc.) and public transport services.</P>
    <P>Appraising and making recommendations indeed.  Appraising and making recommendations is a national pastime. We are wonderful at appraisals and making recommendations.  What we want is some vehicle to make those appraisals and recommendations effective.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph of the Explanatory Memorandum reads:</P>
    <P>Transport funding: it will make recommendations annually to the same two Ministers in relation to priorities in both capital and current expenditure on road and rail transport in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is no fund available to the authority and consequently no power to decide on the allocation of funds to road or rail or to determine priorities between them. There is a theoretical power to determine priorities but there is no muscle in the Bill <Col N="1166" /> to have those priorities, when decided, made effective.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph in the Explanatory Memorandum reads:</P>
    <P>Public transport services: it will set service objectives and standards to be achieved by Córas Iompair Éireann in the Dublin area within its Exchequer allocation, and will monitor Córas Iompair Éireann's progress.  It will also be responsible for the licensing of private bus operators to provide public transport services and for the control of taxi services in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It &ldquo;will monitor Córas Iompair Éireann's progress&rdquo;: The whole nation spends all its time monitoring CIE's progress, or lack of progress.  All we have here is verbiage and flummery.  It is a waste of time bringing this Bill before the House: &ldquo;it will set service objectives and standards to be acheived by Córas Iompair Éireann in the Dublin area&rdquo;.  Originally the relationship envisaged between the Dublin Transport Authority and CIE was that CIE would be the agent for the DTA in the area covered by the DTA.  I have no objection to the licensing of private bus operators and so on.  This is at least giving a little power to the Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>In effect the new authority will be nothing more than a statutory replacement for the Dublin transport task force.  It lacks the dimension regarding traffic plans &mdash; and the Minister knows that is a weakness in the Bill and referred to it in an apologetic manner in his speech &mdash; and it lacks the dimension of the budget which the Fianna Fáil Bill catered for in 1982.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this Bill even on the Second Reading on the basis of its inadequacy and weakness.  This is a changeing, not the healthy child the Minister found, and which he criticised at the beginning of his speech, when he went into the transport office in December 1982.  It will be the purpose of the Opposition, and an obligation on the Opposition, if severely critical of the Bill to suggest alternatives and I shall be putting down a series of amendments to try to <Col N="1167" /> strengthen the Bill, to put some muscle into it, and I will outline what those amendments will be in broad terms, not in detail, for the House.</P>
    <P>Before I do that I would like to make a few comments on the Minister's speech. In his opening paragraphs he sounded the tocsin for vibrancy, vitality and efficiency. He chose three suitable nouns if the Bill he was bringing before the House was vibrant, vital or making for efficiency. I will qualify the last noun because there are areas of the Bill which will make for improved efficiency, but as it happens, they were in the original Bill the Minister found when he went into that office.  One statement he made at the outset and which I want to repudiate is &ldquo;I felt that the net result of what he proposed&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;he&rdquo; being myself &mdash;&ldquo;would be to add greatly to bureaucracy and almost certainly reduce the vitality of transport&rdquo;.  Vitality of transport in Dublin at the moment &mdash; God save the mark.  As far as I remember a budget assessment was made of the costing at that time and with the transfer of functions and duties from existing officers in communications, the budget was very low indeed.  There was no question of an accretion of bureaucracy and I want to repudiate that straight away.</P>
    <P>Another statement the Minister made and which I want to repudiate is: &ldquo;Moreover, final road plans would have fallen to be decided by the Cabinet who would have become a super-planning, committee for Dublin city and county&rdquo;.  That is a ridiculous statement and is not in accordance with the facts.  There was not the remotest possibility in the original proposal that that would be so.  I will tell the House why the Cabinet did come into it.  When there was a question of a dispute between the Dublin Transport Authority and the local authorities &mdash; then Dublin Corporation, Dublin Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council; now there are new local authorities but the area is the same &mdash; and it could not be settled between them, then, and only then, would the matter be referred to the Cabinet. I am challenging the Minister on <Col N="1168" /> that.  Am I right in saying that that is what he found in the original suggestion for legislation?</P>
    <P>The Minister thinks his way is the better, more efficient and cheaper.  I have dealt with the accusation that it would not be a cheaper way, and it remains to be seen what will happen about efficiency, but I do not believe the proposals before the House will make for more efficiency.  I will now skim through the points made by the Minister.  He said the Dublin Transport Authority will be connected to the new local authority system for Dublin city and county.  That is true, it has to be, but all they are doing now is connecting to the new system in place of connecting to Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  The Dublin Transport Authority will take over from the Garda Commissioner the role of the road traffic authority &mdash; that too was in the original Bill.  The DTA will assume responsibility for all traffic management schemes &mdash; that was in the original Bill. The DTA will take over responsibility for the taxi service from the Department of the Environment and the local authorities &mdash; that was in the original Bill.  The DTA will have responsibility for routing, pricing and licensing of all bus services &mdash; that was in the Bill.  The DTA will be the adviser to the Government on transport infrastructure investment in the Dublin area on road, rail and bus &mdash; that was in the Bill by implication, but there was more to it.  The Dublin Transport Authority proposed by me had far more muscle with regard to road, rail and bus infrastructure in the relevant area.</P>
    <P>No. (7) refers to the right to make recommendations to the local authorities and to the Minister for the Environment about local authorities' development plans and road plans....&rdquo; As they say nowadays, I am not &ldquo;into&rdquo; the recommendations aspect of this Bill because of their weakness.  All the suggestions, advising, monitoring, recommending, and so on, are examples of this weak and wan Bill.</P>
    <P>Items (8) and (9) are new.  If my memory serves me correctly, this is about <Col N="1169" /> bollards and ramps.  Instead of calling this the Transport Authority Bill it should be called the Bollards and Ramps Bill.  That is about all the novelty that this Minister and his officials could think to put into it.  Admittedly, bollards and ramps have become important since the heads of the original Bill were put together in November-December of 1982, because of what is wrongly called joyriding.  If that is all that we can expect from the Bill, then it should be called the Bollards and Ramps Bill, 1985, and it will be a useful bit of social history later on when all these problems.  It is hoped, are resolved, to find a Bill with such a flamboyant name on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>No. (10) states that the DTA will &ldquo;have control over the provisions of public car parks in the Dublin area&rdquo;.  That is also in the original drafts of the Bill.  No. (11) says that the DTA will &ldquo;have control over the timing and co-ordination of roadworks.&rdquo; That is very important and was also in the original Bill.  So was the provision of taxi services.</P>

      <P>I am just indicating to him that his Bill contains much of what was in the original Bill, but it is nevertheless, as I characterised it at the outset, a changing, a weaker baby than the one he found.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister in what he said about the Dublin Transportation Task Force, which is non-statutory as we know, and part of the purpose of this Bill is to give statutory authority to a body which will continue with the work the Dublin Transportation Task Force were doing, and doing very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly objects to people claiming this or that.  Administration of Government is a continuous flow, but the Minister has claims about re-engined <Col N="1170" /> buses and new buses and I must claim some credit for part of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went through a number of recommendations made by the TCC, for example, functions in the area of transport planning and funding and public transport services.  As far as the planning and funding are concerned, we interpret those recommendations in a certain way and they are totally excluded from the Bill.  I want to read a sentence from the Minister's speech as follows: &ldquo;However, the Authority's planning functions exclude a substantial element recommended by the Commission namely, that the Authority itself would draw up a comprehensive Dublin Transport Plan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The plan and the budget put together, to my mind, are the substance of what should be in this Bill and that is totally excluded.  The Minister said that the plan as originally envisaged, when approved by the Government, would be binding on all concerned.  &ldquo;This recommendation was not accepted because of the risk of duplicating the on-going planning work of the local authorities and CIE.&rdquo;  I interpret that this way.  The environment lobby objected to this from the very word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  There was an on-going argument between the Departments of Communications and the Environment.  The Department of the Environment did not want to allow any input whatsoever from the new Transport Authority in this area. My interpretation of that sentence is that the environment lobby won.  They certainly did not win rounds Nos. 1 and 2 but, to use a metaphor which is at present appropriate to my constituency and that of the Ceann Comhairle, they certainly seem to have won in the end, overall on points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am puzzled by the following sentence: &ldquo;Additional functions in that particular matter, or in other matters within its remit, may be given by ministerial order under section 9 of the Bill, subject to Oireachtas control.&rdquo;  I am not objecting <Col N="1171" /> to the principle of a ministerial order and I know that in evolution certain developments may take place which require a ministerial order to cover matters which were not relevant or pressing at the time when the legislation was put on the Statute Book.  I am not particularly enamoured of the whole process but would ask, why not now?  If there are matters high on the Minister's consciousness in this area, as there would seem to be from that quotation, why not now?  Elsewhere in the Bill there are similar kinds of provision.</P>
    <P>I envisaged a nine member authority. It has been increased to 12.  I think the Commission recommended 15.  However, I agree with the Minister.  We continue to tell the story of the camel being a horse designed by a committee.  It is important to have a reasonably small membership and I could not criticise 12 members if there are to be four from the local authority.  One of the difficulties which surfaced when we were debating this whole problem was that if you have a representational type of authority, then you will have a transfer of dog fights from many areas over the transport field to the Authority.  This will leave the Authority less effective and will paralyse their efforts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functional area, I suppose it is wise that the Minister is taking power to himself to change that area at any time he finds it necessary.  I am a little puzzled about the necessity with regard to the planning.  We have an elaborate and I might add an expensive &mdash; Bord Pleanála.  We have expertise available to that board and while it is only natural that the Dublin Transport Authority should have an interest in planning which would affect traffic flow, such as the building of roads, or railways, and so on, I am wondering whether it is necessary to cater for that elaborately in the actual legislation.  I agree with the Minister the decisions on the rapid rail services will be paramount in the consideration of the Dublin Transport Authority as soon as they are established.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister's comments <Col N="1172" /> regarding DART.  I know the Minister was less than enthusiastic about it.  The Taoiseach drove me on the DART on the inaugural journey &mdash; I felt quite safe because there was a qualified man beside him &mdash; but when it was pointed out to him that a lot of money had been spent on DART his response was that Fianna Fáil were responsible for that.  I am glad that at least he attributed it to Fianna Fáil.  I have great confidence in DART and in its possibility for making a profit.  I know that what the Minister said is true, that CIE must attract many more passengers if DART is to make a profit. A selling job is needed.  Recently I saw that people in charge of the planning of conferences had planned them for places easily accessible to those using the DART line.  It was precisely that kind of thinking that always buttressed my hopes for that service.  In addition, it is a kind of semi-circle with many seaside resorts along the line and there is great potential for sales in that area also.</P>
    <P>I see pictures in today's newspapers of the chairman of An Post with a postman's cap on and selling his service.  I should like to see super selling of the DART line.  That leads me to support fully what the Minister said about the failure of CIE and the unions to agree on the provision of feeder services.  I support the Minister 100 per cent in what he has said on that point.  I ask him to take initiatives to prod and to stimulate them to resolve that matter for the summer.  Admittedly the weather we have been having recently is not very good and perhaps the loss on the line is not that great yet in so far as the utilisation of DART is concerned for resorts along the way from Howth to Bray.  It should be a priority in the Department and in the boardroom of CIE to resolve the problem.  There appears to me to be a little threat at the end of that paragraph and I do not think that will be very effective.  However, it may be a little prodding on the part of the Minister when he referred to private operators.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister points out that the cost of providing electrified services between Tallaght-Clondalkin <Col N="1173" /> and Heuston Station could be in excess of £1 million.  He also makes the following comment:</P>
    <P>The possibility of various cheaper alternatives such as a busway to Tallaght, or diesel rather than electrified rail services, has been discussed with CIE.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say if it had been discussed between himself and CIE.  He also made the statement that no definite proposals have yet emerged.  Did the Minister tell CIE he would make available a certain amount of capital for the development of the line, did he ask them their views on the economics of the proposal and so on?  I do not understand what he means by the words &ldquo;but no definite proposals have yet emerged&rdquo;. Did the Minister tell the board of CIE that he wanted them to adopt a certain course, that he would give them a certain amount of money over a stated period and did he ask them if they could or would do it?  I should like the Minister's comment on his statement.  The constraint on resources seems to be the cadenza if not the burden of the Minister's tune.</P>
    <P>I am quite pleased with the section of the Bill dealing with traffic management and I have already said that.  With all the improvements that have been made such as traffic lights, bus lanes, a proper transport authority, good buses, efficient services, lists of times that could be adhered to generally and a better traffic flow, I cannot see why the Dublin city services should not be able to pay their way.  It is a mystery to me.  We have about one million people in the conurbation and they would use the services if they were available.  If we had the Fergal Quinn type of approach the Dublin city services should be a paying proposition.  A habit of mind has developed that this cannot happen and this, in itself, is self-defeating. Pessimism grows with the belief that the services cannot be made to pay.  I had a look at some European cities roughly the same size as Dublin and this city did not compare badly with those other cities with regard to public transport.  There is <Col N="1174" /> a basis for hope that they can be made to pay.</P>
    <P>I have always believed in the bona fides of the Minister.  I think I can read between the lines in some of the sections of his speech.  He told us that section 21 should provide the Authority with an effective budgetary role.  That is a laugh. I will come back to that later when I talk about the budgetary role I had envisaged and that I am going to try to get inserted by way of amendment on Committee and other Stages of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Section 21 should provide the Authority with an effective budgetary role to complement their planning role, without the additional procedures which would be necessary if the relevant funds were to flow through the DTA to the local authorities and CIE.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what the Minister should have in the Bill.  He should have the plan and the budget but both are excluded. For that reason I regard this as a changling Bill, a weak and wan Bill, instead of a strong, vigorous and efficient Bill to use the Minister's own words.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Again, however, the budgetary functions of the Authority merit reconsideration when experience of the Authority is gained.</P>
    <P>That is a significant sentence.  He knows that the absence of that budgetary function represents a weakening of the Bill.  I see hope in that.  I see a possibility of the replacement in the Bill of the two items I mentioned, namely, the plan and the budget.</P>
    <P>I support what the Minister said regarding the number of man-days lost. It is simply appalling that they numbered on average over 12,000 per annum from 1980 to 1984 compared with approximately 4,000 per annum in the preceding five years.  In 1984 some 25,181 man-days were lost and, as the Minister pointed out, public confidence in the reliability of the service was affected.  It is very disheartening for anyone who is committed to having an efficient service in our <Col N="1175" /> capital city.  The Minister says that the new structure will enable any management defects in the industrial relations area to be remedied.  I hope he is right. There must be a reason for so many stoppages and for the loss of so many man-days. This area is a major priority so far as the transport services are concerned. People do not go on strike without reason.  They do not regard a few days or a few weeks off work as a joyride.</P>
    <P>A serious attempt must be made to determine the cause of the discontent that leads to strikes, strikes that are unnecessary and are damaging the transport system.  I trust the Minister is correct in stating that the new division will make easier the task of coping with industrial relations.  What we do not want is a new layer of industrial relations experts who are way up in the clouds and far from the chap who is dispensing the tickets or driving the bus.  We have plenty of expertise.  Universities and other colleges are turning out people with qualifications in that area, but a determined effort must be made to solve the problem.  It is a problem that has been developing for many years; and, if we believe that small is beautiful, the smaller sectors who will have to deal with industrial relations should be given the opportunity of turning over a new leaf.  I read with interest the chapter by Mr. Todd Andrews on industrial relations in CIE during his time there.  There are plenty of insights in that chapter that we could apply to today's situation.  We should do everything possible to find the reasons for the problem and then endeavour to resolve it.  I approve also of the appellate function given to the Minister in cases in which private bus operators may be refused licences.</P>
    <P>I have no fault to find with that section of the Bill which deals with traffic management. Already I have complimented the task force for what they have done without having statutory muscle, but if there is any muscle in the Bill it should be in that section because elsewhere whatever muscle might have been in it has been emasculated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> The Minister referred to education and research and to the danger of overlapping or duplication of functions as between An Foras Forbartha and the National Road Safety Association.  That is a very important part of the Bill and I shall return to it later.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the integrated planning and operation of transport in Dublin, Fianna Fáil consider that a purely advisory body are useless.  I have pointed to weaknesses in the Bill in this regard. In our opinion all that woolly area of recommendations, appraisals, monitoring, setting of objectives and so on will not make for an effective Dublin Transport Authority.  The authority should not be an amalgam of vested interests.  The Minister's prudent judgment in selecting the members of the authority should ensure that it will not be an amalgam of vested interests.  The representation from local authorities may mean that, if there is a question of a demarcation dispute as between one local authority and another, each will be fighting solely for their own corner.  It may be important that they should have a voice in such cases and the fact that they will have four out of 12 members will mean at least that the vested interests aspect of the authority would not be paramount.  We proposed an authority of nine members but I do not think the Minister's 12 are out of kilter.  Action is what is needed and small is beautiful so far as committees are concerned.</P>
    <P>Basic to our ideas and firm proposals, proposals that were incorporated in the heads of the Bill we sent to the parliamentary draftsman in December 1982, was a transport plan.  The power of budgeting for road and rail was number two in that plan because these are the essentials.  The Bill could be called something else with regard to traffic management rather than a Bill setting up a Dublin Transport Authority.</P>
    <P>The Authority were not to be standing back, advising CIE, monitoring them or making recommendations to them.  CIE were to be the agent for the Authority.  I do not know what transpired when the Minister was putting the Bill together but <Col N="1177" /> it seems as if CIE said that the Authority could advise them, monitor them, and make suggestions to them but that the company would not be the agent for the Authority.  The question of traffic management is very important and our Authority would have had strong and well defined functions in the area of research and education.</P>
    <P>We envisaged that the Dublin Transport Authority would put together a plan to cover a certain period.  A period of five years was mentioned, but that was not to be <i>de rigeur.</i> There was to be a plan covering a substantial number of years. The plan was to be renewed or varied or improved or extended at the end of the period decided on.  There was to be the reconciling of the plans of the Dublin local authorities, now four in number and covering roughly the same areas as Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council. The overall plan and the plans of the local authorities were to be reconciled and made consistent with each other. One of the strengths of the original proposal was that there was to be statutory and all round consultation and comment from local authorities and other bodies &mdash; Dublin Port and Docks Board, CIE and so on &mdash; in regard to the making of the plan.  A draft plan was then to be published and a public inquiry was to be held at which statutory bodies, ordinary citizens, people who had the wisdom or expertise in this field would be free to make their contribution.  It was not until then that the plan would be put before the Government for approval, modification or rejection.  The Government were entitled to alter and then approve.</P>
    <P>Also any dispute between the Dublin Transport Authority and local authorities would be settled by the Government. The Minister's claim that there would be constant Government sessions deciding on plans and so on was somewhat of an exaggeration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I commented on it and <Col N="1178" /> quoted the Minister directly from his speech.  I do not think it was a valid criticism of the original proposals.</P>
      <P>To my mind the budget is a crunch issue.  Theoretically anyway, in a sense the budget would follow upon the plan. What we have here is an advisory, recommendatory, monitoring Authority. There is not any strength or muscle in that.  To effect substantial improvements in the transport situation in Dublin my contention is that the budgetary power should have been given, as originally proposed, to the Dublin Transport Authority. The areas to be covered were (a) the non-capital Exchequer support, which was to be given for the operation of public transport services; (b) Exchequer capital for the provision of new transport infrastructure and assets, plus traffic management facilities; and (c) non-capital Exchequer funds for the maintenance of roads and traffic management facilities.</P>
      <P>In respect of the first I mentioned there, the whole consideration of the passenger miles, the levying of fares and the budgetary implications were to be incorporated.  The authority, as we envisage it, would allocate funds to CIE or private operators.  The Minister mentioned private operators for the suburban railways, capital works, rolling stock or buses and local authorities for improvements and maintenance of roads and traffic management facilities.  The idea was that the Authority could take a comprehensive view of the transport situation. They would be in a position to balance off the claims of people who were exclusively dedicated to rail development, who could see nothing else, and people who were exclusively dedicated to bus or road development and who had the wisdom and expertise to make a decision between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of now we could have a March hare situation with people developing their predilections without consideration to what others are doing.  This could apply as far as roads are concerned with Dublin Corporation, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, Dublin County Council.  It could apply as far as the rail sector of CIE <Col N="1179" /> is concerned, developing rail, the road sector, developing the roads, without any overall, comprehensive view and power of decision, which is important.  The Dublin Transport Authority, as now envisaged, will not have the kind of strength to be able to do that.  They can recommend, monitor, appraise, propose but, if they had their plan fully thought out, discussed and agreed, backed up by a budget, they would be in a position to provide the capital city with the kind of transport system it deserves.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Dublin city services and the new CIE arrangements. In replying he might let the House know when he thinks the CIE legislation setting up by statute the new CIE bodies will come before the House.  It is a pity the Minister did not insert into his Bill a section indicating that CIE would be statutorily obliged to operate bus and suburban rail services in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority's overall plan.  They seem to have been able to back off a responsibility which should be placed on them and which the Dublin Transport Authority should be in a position to place on them.  I do approve of the provisions with regard to the licensing of private operators and of the provision that there should be a right of appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The regulation of taxi services is an area on which we could spend a good deal of time in the House in an effort to see how best the overall service should be regulated and developed in the city. We do an awful lot of talking about tourism, about having for our citizens and for visitors an efficient transport service &mdash; public, taxi or whatever.  It is an area which impacts on tourists to a great extent.  A good, well run, efficient and clean taxi service is something found in many cities which impresses visitors and makes them want to return.</P>
    <P>Car parking is important.  I do not quite understand why the National Prices Commission should be excluded.  If it is with a view to speeding up operations then I would go along with it.  One of the main complaints that those who studied <Col N="1180" /> the question had originally with regard to traffic management was the long, slow, lethargic, drawn-out process of effecting any changes.  This Bill seeks to speed up that process and I am fully in support of it because there was too much red tape in the old system.  As far as I remember there was an illustration in the Transport-Consultative Commissioner's report showing what had to be done to effect the simplest little change in by-laws.  In so far as the Bill removes that obstacle it is welcome.</P>
    <P>Some time ago &mdash; I think it was in this House &mdash; somebody raised the question of public car parks, of their being foreign-operated and controlled.  I do not see why the Dublin Transport Authority should not be empowered to develop car parks, to employ people to run them and to charge for them.  Our citizens, homegrown entrepreneurs should be encouraged in that regard rather than have us import people.  After all, there cannot be that much expertise required to run an efficient car park.  Even charities could be given a licence and it would ease many of their campaigns.  I am sure it has to be a paying proposition.  It must be a business in which it is easy to make money.</P>
    <P>With regard to roadworks and road openings, the Dublin Transport Authority should have extensive powers.  It is a general joke that the ESB rips up the road and then closes it, that then An Bord Telecom comes in and a few feet away rips up and closes the road, and then the gasworks, the waterworks, sewerage works and so on all come in and have a hand at the game.  For years there have been complaints.  It is easy to be cynical and laugh when one does not know the inside story.  One is inclined to believe that rational planning and thinking obtains in these matters.  I am afraid that experience teaches that that is not so. The stronger the powers of the Dublin Transport Authority in this regard the better.  The Transport Authority should also have an eye to the damage that can be done by the various public agencies when they are about their business.  Last <Col N="1181" /> year, there was consternation in an area of South Dublin when the ESB attempted to undermine a whole row of beautiful whitebeam trees that had been growing for 20 years in that area.  Were it not for the fact that the citizens who lived along the road objected when this was happening all those fine 20 year old trees would have been heeled over and an amenity would have been lost.  The Dublin Transport Authority should employ some sort of officer to keep an eye on the environmental aspects.  Also the co-ordination, timing and manner of execution of roadworks and road openings should get the close attention of the authority and should be under their control.  If one is not an expert one is inclined to believe the best of the engineers, planners and so on.  However, on dozens of occasions in the middle of the tourist season or the horse show or some international event, the main arteries leading to and from the RDS are ripped up and piles of stuff is left on the middle of the road.  The Dublin Transport Authority should have strong powers for dealing with that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister does not give much consideration in his speech to it, I am glad that education and research have been incorporated, as it was, in the original heads of a Bill.  The whole area of transport studies is practically a new applied science and especially in areas like Dublin city, Cork and Galway, we need a section to study the problems.  I know that our universities have in recent years employed in the economics departments people who have specialised in the transport area.  With the development of electronics and computerisation &mdash; we are now using computerisation for traffic light co-ordination and so on &mdash; there is an important field for study.  There is also a need for social studies with regard to traffic and traffic management, for instance relating to industrial and commercial working times which impact very much on transport and traffic problems. We need to study the opening and closing times of schools, third level institutions, factories, shops or offices and the pressure that that puts on traffic.  We should have research and discussion on these <Col N="1182" /> subjects with a view to possibly organising times so as to relieve congestion and improve traffic flow.  Every new fad gets great publicity for a time, and some time ago we launched the idea of flexitime. It is working in some areas.  We should research that idea and see if the idea could be fitted into a system that would ease traffic flow.  A data bank also has been mentioned and I would like if that idea were provided for.</P>
    <P>On the Bill itself, my main criticism is the exclusion of the overall plan and the exclusion of the budgetary powers which the Dublin Transport Authority have.  I have already indicated my support for the rest of the Bill.  I regret that other lobbies, other pressure groups seem to have got into the act and weakened the Bill.  Section 9 (1) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service, and where matters within the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment are concerned with the consent also of that Minister, may by order confer....</P>
    <P>It reminds me of Swift &ldquo;So nationalists observe a flea hath smaller fleas that on him prey; and these have smaller fleas to bite 'em and so proceed <i>ad infinitum</i>&rdquo;. The Minister was looking over the two good shoulders that he has and if he had two more he would have to look over those to see who was trying to trap him. That is apparent in the explanatory memorandum and the result has been a very weak Bill.</P>
    <P>I had been pressing genuinely and sincerely for a long time, as not many other Deputies do.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Kelly attacking this kind of convention, decrying it and saying it was a great pity that when some IDA officer had achieved something a Minister who had nothing to do with it came into the House and claimed it.  It was in that context I was speaking and I was going to back the general philosophy of Deputy Kelly.  This is a Bill that should have been brought before the House.  The Dublin transport situation required this Bill.  It required the kind of muscle that was in the original proposal which was before the parliamentary draftsman when the Minister took office in 1982.  I am gravely disappointed with what has come before the House.  I think it will improve the situation with regard to traffic management and other areas which are important but are not at the heart of the matter.  As I have said, people have found an easement in the traffic in Dublin recently as a result of the East Link bridge in particular and, of course, as a result of industrial and commercial shutdowns where so many people are unemployed.  I hope that we will not be gearing our policy to that as a priority.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I will be putting down amendments to try to put a bit of muscle into this Bill, and I am afraid that the Minister's appeal at the end of his speech that the House find this Bill commendable is meeting with a negative response from me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the arrival of this Bill, for which we have waited a very long time.  The 1980 report of the Transport Consultative Commission envisaged that within six months an interim transport authority would be in operation.  It is sad that we have had to wait for five years instead of the hoped for six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill that has come before us is like the curate's egg, good in spots and, I am afraid, bad in spots too.  The picture of Dublin transport at the moment is bleak.  We have serious traffic congestion <Col N="1184" /> in the streets throughout many hours of the day, not only at peak hours.  We have also a very sad picture on the public transport front.  Public transport in Dublin is attracting only about one-tenth of all travel spending by people in the city. Since 1970 we have seen a continuous decline in the usage of the public transport system run by CIE.  It has fallen since 1970 by 25 per cent, a very sad situation not unique to Dublin, let it be said.  It is affecting many western cities.  In the face of falling numbers of that magnitude we have been increasing our bus numbers and employment in CIE, so it is scarcely surprising that this has wrought havoc for both the taxpayer and the traveller in terms of the cost of what must be paid for.  In Dublin travellers have faced year on year increases in fares of the order of 4 per cent every year over and above inflation, a real eating into the spending power of people who are travelling by bus and train in the city.</P>
    <P>We have seen also the sad growth in the subvention to the Dublin city services.  At the beginning of the seventies there was no subvention at all, and since then it has reached a peak of 40 per cent; the taxpayer was paying 40 per cent of all spending by CIE on their operations in the city.  That peak was reached in 1981. I have nothing against paying subventions to public transport.  Indeed, it is the pattern throughout Europe and the western world that public transport must be sub-vented. However, what is sad in the Irish case is that it has been a decline in passenger numbers that has forced the Government to pick up the tab for unprofitable services.  It is not that the Government have identified worthy social objectives or the need to, say, take passengers out of cars at peak periods and say, &ldquo;We will pay for that&rdquo;.  That has not happened here.  We are paying for loss making services and, generally speaking, we do not know what precisely are the loss making services or why they are loss making.  This Dublin Transport Authority Bill presented an important opportunity to confront what we are paying for in the city and, sad to say, it has fallen short in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> Before leaving the present picture of Dublin transport I must say that since 1981 there has been some progress.  For a start, there has been a slow down in the decline of passengers on CIE buses and trains, and that is welcome.  No doubt it has been achieved by the bus priority schemes pioneered by the task force who have been working in the city.  We have also seen a halt in the productivity losses in CIE, and it is encouraging to see that the subvention which was so bad at 40 per cent in 1981 is now decreasing and it was only just over 20 per cent in 1984. That is a little bit of encouragement on the horizon.</P>
    <P>This Dublin Transport Authority will be facing in the next 15 years very daunting tasks and not only the existing rather bleak picture which I have painted.  We are told by An Foras Forbartha that within the next 15 years up to the end of the century we will see a further doubling of the number of cars in the city.  Anyone who has sat in congested streets in the day or at peak times with the present level of cars can imagine what is going to happen if we have doubled the number of cars in the city by the year 2000.  Our streets will become more like car parks than streets carrying traffic.  The DTA will have to take a very firm hold if they are to reverse the trends that are apparent now in the uncontrolled growth of car numbers and the sad decline in the use of public transport.  The DTA will have to be very assertive and a very effective executive if they are to deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling what the Transport Consultative Commission saw the DTA doing when they proposed it in 1980.  It provides a worthy basis for comparison with what we have before us.  According to the TCC, the authority were to have the following functions; overall responsibility for integrated planning and operation of transportation; channelling to Government all plans and budget proposals in relation to Dublin transportation; the release of all Government funds for transportation and monitoring the expenditure of the various bodies like CIE and so on; overall responsibility for traffic <Col N="1186" /> management.  They were to have responsibilities in relation to licensing road passenger and taxi services and for public education, promotion and research in relation to transportation.</P>
    <P>In many of those areas this Bill is very different from what the TCC envisaged. While I do not go the whole way with what they envisaged, I feel that the Bill has fallen short in some respects.  In particular the present proposal does not envisage the Transport Authority channelling to government the plans of other agencies like CIE and the road authorities. They will not have that control over the investment proposals of these authorities, nor will they have control over the release of Government funds.  I think those are going to prove to be serious weaknesses in the operation of this authority.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as the Minister said, that in section 9 he is retaining for himself the power to expand the role of the DTA should he see fit, but I must sympathise with Deputy Wilson's suggestion that section 9 seems to be the most unwieldy section possible.  Certainly three Ministers and their Departments will have to give agreement before anything can move there.  That will be an ineffective section in the long run.  The Dublin Transport Authority must have more control than is being envisaged in relation to planning transport and controlling the investment proposals of various authorities. If we are to get the best value for scarce resources in the city there must be some authority capable of ranking different proposals and deciding that one proposal is more valuable than another or that a certain proposal should be amended or delayed.  It is sad that this will not be the position.  This Authority will have the power only to make recommendations to the Minister.  It will not have the more central role of evaluating and ranking schemes, as was originally envisaged.  I am concerned that this will prove to be a serious weakness.</P>
    <P>Other authorities such as Dublin Corporation and CIE will still have powers to decide on what investments will go through, with the approval of their own <Col N="1187" /> Minister.  In the case of Dublin Corporation, approval would be sought from the Minister for the Environment.  These proposals will not go through a central channel where the real choice about how to use resources most effectively could be made.  This is a serious difficulty.  At a very minimum the Minister should require that not only should the Dublin Transport Authority have the power to make recommendations but that the other authorities who might have investment proposals should not be permitted to go ahead without the approval of the DTA.  We should shift more power towards the DTA and allow them to be a sanctioning body.  All the scattered agencies who have major proposals concerning rail and road transport should have to seek the approval of the DTA. I suggest that the Minister amend the legislation to require these bodies to get difinite approval from the DTA before going ahead.  That could be quite an easy amendment.  It would not involve a large and unwiedly Dublin Transport Authority which would be duplicating the work of other bodies but it would mean that a final sanction would have to be obtained from them.</P>
    <P>There are some key problems on the horizon which the Dublin Transport Authority will have to face.  One of them is the choice between bus and rail transport in the city.  For a long time we have had proposals about a rapid rail system. My feeling, which is not based on hard analysis, is that it would prove a very expensive proposal.  I do not think anybody has produced a hard analysis.  It was envisaged that such a system would take 12 per cent of peak hour traffic in Dublin if implemented.  Some people might have ignored the statement in the small print that the bulk of that extra traffic would be coming from the buses.  If rapid rail goes ahead we will see a cut of at least 30 per cent in bus patronage.  We might have a Rolls-Royce rapid rail system showing a reasonably good performance but we would build up huge losses in the bus system.  The Dublin Transport Authority should look much more seriously at the <Col N="1188" /> option of rapid bus corridors.  Feeder buses will be needed to make the rapid rail system effective.  Why not go the whole hog and have effective bus services along rapid bus corridors?  People would not have to get off the feeders and get onto another system.  It would be much more cost effective and is much to be preferred.  Under the proposals for the Dublin Transport Authority that sort of rational assessment of the options may not be possible because we are to have the rail proposals coming independently of the DTA, the latter being able only to make recommendations.  I fear that we might find ourselves not making the most cost effective decisions in the future.  CIE have always seen themselves more as a rail company than a bus company.  We have seen the bus service suffer over the years, starved of the resources which have been showered on the rail system. There is a need to redress that.</P>
    <P>Growing car numbers and increasing congestion will cause serious problems for the Dublin Transport Authority.  If public transport gets into the business of carrying peak hour passengers and if the DTA take effective means to restrain commuters coming into the city at peak hours, our bus services will become loss-making. It is important that there should be much more clarity as to what we are paying for.  If CIE opt for the peak hour carrying of passengers it means that during the rest of the day many of their buses will be idle and they will have difficult rostering systems for staff.  This will be a loss-making activity by CIE.  Nevertheless the problem will have to be met head on because otherwise there will be chronic congestion.  We do not know what we are paying for when we sanction £34 million for Dublin city transport.  We do not know whether the buses losing money are those which carry high volumes of passengers at peak hours and are idle for the rest of the day or whether it is the buses which are empty most of the day.  It is crucial that such information be obtained.  It is regrettable that the DTA have not been given the power to disburse the subsidy now going to CIE in that way. If the DTA had been given the right to <Col N="1189" /> disburse the money to CIE there would be several advantages.  It would become public knowledge which are the loss-making services of CIE.  This is the most tightly guarded secret and nobody knows precisely what services are losing money around the city.  Consequently we cannot possibly have a rational basis for subsidising services.  There should be clear reasons for subsidising a service which is loss-making.  If a route is to be subsidised it should be providing some desirable social service.</P>
    <P>I strongly suspect that the buses that have clear social value are profit making and that those serving the higher income areas are loss makers.  However, if you are trying to achieve a sort of social subsidy, it is not achieved by the present system and we will just have to get the information to enable us to make rational decisions.  The Dublin Transport Authority should have responsibility in this area instead of CIE, because CIE are getting this subvention and anybody will go for the quiet life and leave things as they are.</P>
    <P>The other advantage in the Dublin Transport Authority disbursing this subvention to CIE is that they would not be obliged to pay CIE solely and, if they saw that it would be viable to take off CIE bus services in some areas and provide an alternative, they could provide a subsidy to do so.  That could involve privately run buses, taxis, and so on, but the Dublin Transport Authority should have the ability to disburse money flexibily. They should not be locked into subsidising a loss making route run by CIE if there is a better alternative.  That is a missed chance in the present proposals. The whole relationship with CIE in these proposals is very vague.  The Bill says they can specify objectives for CIE and monitor their performance in meeting these objectives.</P>
    <P>However, it is not clear what the force of the objectives being set by the transport authority will be.  For example, it is not clear that the transport authority can insist on a route and frequency review by CIE and that is something that has not been done for years in the city.  CIE have <Col N="1190" /> muddled along with the same routes and frequencies, largely unchanged, over the years and Dublin Transport Authority should be an agency capable of forcing through these sort of changes.</P>
    <P>They should also be capable of setting objectives for the performance of the bus fleet in many ways and, not only should they be capable of monitoring those changes, they should have the power to impose effective sanctions when the targets set fail to be achieved.  The Bill is silent regarding the powers in this area given to the Dublin Transport Authority over CIE.  In practice, it will mean that the powers are very limited because, if the Dublin Transport Authority do not have the disbursing of money, I cannot see how they can specify objectives or targets to be met by CIE.  That will be a big problem; we will not get the central co-ordinating role from the authority that we expected.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount to be done by CIE in selling their services to passengers.  It is disappointing that CIE have been so weak in this regard and that they have not made innovations in regard to off-peak fares, changing their routes or allowing through-fares, enabling people to travel from one side of the city to the other, without having to pay two separate fares.  They have also not been very enterprising in attracting passengers to the buses.  I would like to have seen the Dublin Transport Authority with a clear brief to set targets for CIE in relation to getting passengers back on the buses and also in regard to marketing activities which CIE have done for example in relation to sundry rail packages. Although they have put promotional activity into that, they have never once promoted their bus services which are far more desirable and worthy.  The relationship between the Dublin Transport Authority and local authorities is probably a sad comment on planning.  It is proposed that the Dublin Transport Authority should have the ability to express their views to the planning authority.  Planning seems to envisage drawing zones and lines on maps, but real planning is about providing transport services for a city.  It <Col N="1191" /> is ludicrous that all bodies like CIE and the Dublin Transport Authority are not involved in the planning process.  If planning is to be effective, these bodies should be hammering out plans together, not sending the odd missive about what they would like to see done by the planning authority.  Rather than criticising the precise proposals in the Bill, I am critical of the whole planning system because we have not got to grips with getting the various agencies who are supposed to provide services into the planning process. Indeed, they are almost entirely divorced from this process and this Bill will not greatly alter the situation.</P>
    <P>The other great weakness in our planning system is that there is no financial backing to the planning proposals and it looks as if this will be continued in this Bill.  Unfortunately, most of my comments on the Bill have been somewhat negative but we are missing an opportunity to put in an authority which would be a very effective executive in tackling the serious problem in Dublin city.  I acknowledge and welcome many of the powers given by the Bill to the Dublin Transport Authority, particularly regarding roadworks, providing car parks and other operations, but I am convinced that the Bill will have to go further if it is to be effective in tackling the problems in Dublin today.  The Dublin Transport Authority will have to hammer out an effective parking policy and also a policy to cover pedestrians.</P>
    <P>The authority do not have the power to work out an effective policy for public transport.  I hope that on Committee Stage we will go through the precise powers and perhaps tip the balance a bit more strongly in favour of the authority. I hope the Minister will strengthen some aspects by giving new powers to the authority. In the years to come the DTA will have to play a strong role in controlling traffic coming into the city.  That may mean introducing such things as licensing areas, selective taxes on those going to certain sections of the city or new types of parking penalties which would if not paid roll up so that we would not have <Col N="1192" /> the ludicrous position of an authority incurring huge expenses chasing a tiny sum.</P>
    <P>I can see a need for a very strong transport authority in Dublin in the future.  Such an authority will have to do things that will be unpopular at times such as telling people that they cannot use their cars as freely as they would like. I am concerned that even in that area the Bill will fall short in that the Authority will not have at their disposal the methods used in other European cities to tackle the problem of growing car usage and the strangulation that has been imposed on cities. I welcome the Bill.  In the course of my contribution I dwelt mainly on what I consider to be the weaknesses in it because I did not think there was any point in wasting time discussing its strengths, which are obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I welcome the Bill and anything that will help to improve the traffic problems in the city.  I have not had time to study the details of it because, as the House will be aware, with the election campaign in progress we have a lot of literature to read and other things to do.  As a member of the traffic committee of Dublin Corporation I am well aware of the traffic problems of the city.  We have discussed them on many occasions at our meetings. The Minister told us that he disagrees with the proposals put forward by Deputy Wilson in his Bill but I saw many good points in it.  For any system to work properly it must be operated by a competent authority.  Deputy Wilson proposed establishing an authority consisting of nine members who would be appointed by the Minister on the basis of their competence. He proposed to limit the term of office of members to five years, subject to specific conditions including remuneration, if any, and allowances for expenses, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is importance that the members of any authority are chosen for their expertise. In the past people appointed to State bodies were not always chosen for their experience and that may be the reason <Col N="1193" /> why many State and semi-State bodies are not working satisfactorily.  In fact, many of those appointed to the board of CIE were figureheads and were not put there for their experience.  When their term of office ceased many of them were fortunate enough to be made directors of a number of companies.  Deputy Wilson's idea was the correct one.  He wanted to appoint people who had the necessary experience, as operates in the UK.  Members of the board are appointed on the basis of their ability.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is not adopting those proposals.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister proposes to give permission to the Authority to construct ramps on certain roads in an effort to curtail the activities of the so-called joyriders.  Dublin Corporation embarked on a pilot scheme for the construction of ramps in the city and have plans to extend it, but unfortunately, those plans are hampered by a lack of finance.  Last Monday the principal officer in the traffic department pointed out to members that the roads suggested by them for ramps would have to be listed in the order of priority because he would not be able to do anything until money was provided. The Minister should approach the Minister for Finance and request an allocation for such works.</P>
    <P>I hope it is the Minister's intention to provide proper car parking areas in Dublin.  At present any site that becomes vacant is taken over and used for car parking.  I do not know the people involved. I noticed that within a few days of the demolition of six houses in Parnell Square a gentleman was sitting in a little hut taking money from people anxious to park their cars on the site.  I do not know who gave that individual authority to do that.  Most of the sites around the city have been purchased by Irish Life for the purpose of erecting office blocks and it appears that they use the sites as car parks until they raise the finance to proceed with their work.  I understand that these sites are being let to English companies who are said to be expert in that area. The sites are covered with tarmacadam and fenced off and car owners are charged <Col N="1194" /> an exhorbitant fee, in some cases 60p per hour or part of an hour, to park their cars.  I hope the Minister looks into that matter.</P>
    <P>Many people who come to Dublin at weekends are approached by individuals who do not have authority from the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation or anybody, and encouraged to park their cars in certain areas.  In some cases people are directed to park their cars on double yellow lines.  The men involved in giving those directions are there for the purpose of collecting money.  When I brought these activities to the attention of the Garda I was told that there was nothing they could do about it.  On three occasions I wrote to the commissioner but only received an acknowledgment.  It appears that he is prepared to tolerate this.  It is part and parcel of the breakdown of law and order here.  Those men are openly committing an offence.  Any charitable organisation anxious to take up a collection in the city must apply to the court or the Garda Síochána for authorisation but the men I am referring to dress up in a uniform and collect money wherever they like.  I am aware of an unfortunate man who travelled from the country to see his wife in hospital and gave money to a gentleman to look after his car but after spending an hour or so with his wife, he returned and discovered that his car and the gentlemen had gone. I hope the Minister under the Bill will not permit anybody to direct traffic on our streets other than gardaí.  I have not seen such an operation taking place in any other city.  In other countries police would not permit that to take place.  The Minister should ask the Garda to control this problem.</P>
    <P>It is very costly to travel by public transport at present although we are all aware that private coaches charge fares that are half those of CIE.  At weekends private coaches transport young people from the city to rural areas at half the fare charged by CIE.  If they can do it, why cannot CIE?  The problem here seems to be that there is a monopoly.  The public transport authority do not have to compete for business but in other countries <Col N="1195" /> where private transport operators compete, there is a more satisfactory transport system.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I worked in the suburbs of Manchester where there were public and private transport operators. And people did not have to wait an hour for a bus.  I welcome the day a Minister brings in such a system here.  I am concerned about the unfortunate people who wait for more than an hour for a bus that never comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> In the past we saw unfortunate people waiting for buses which never came because of lightning strikes.  I remember a case where an employee had left CIE under the impression that he had not got a fair deal.  He picketed Clontarf garage and brought the transport system in Dublin city to a standstill for a few days.  If there were private transport operating CIE workers could go on strike for as long and as often as they liked because the people who pay their taxes would still be able to get transport to and from work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The freight service provided by CIE seems to be almost non-existent.  I remember a time when CIE carried almost all the freight in this country, thus creating employment.  Now it is very difficult to travel by car anywhere in Ireland because of the juggernauts and lorries travelling the roads.  Some of these lorries are using very narrow roads in the city and this is causing havoc.  They are damaging the roads and the drivers of private cars cannot use the roads because of this heavy traffic.  I would like the Minister to limit the number of roads which could be used by heavy transport, and perhaps when people are going to and from work heavy transport could be discouraged from coming through the centre of the city.  Drivers of heavy transport vehicles <Col N="1196" /> should be encouraged to by-pass the centre city where traffic is at a standstill during rush hours.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was trying to discourage private individuals from driving their cars into the city.  I believe everybody has the right to drive his car into Dublin.  It is very costly to buy a car, pay high tax and insurance and then leave it at home.  I am sure there are many people who would not drive their cars into the city if there was a proper transport system.  The only reason they use their cars is that there is a bad bus service, or maybe they are on shift work.  We all know that if a person brings his car into the city and parks it, there is no guarantee it will be there when he comes back.  The remedy seems to be to improve our public transport.  If we did that, fewer people would drive their cars into the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposed that the Authority would take full control of transport in the city and he said this would mean eliminating Garda involved.  I do not know how he proposes to do that, but it would be a welcome move if he could ensure that a garda's time was more effectively spent dealing with crime.  I hope the Minister will take note of the points I have made.</P>

      <P>Over the years I have come to look with horror at those big envelopes I get in the morning to see will there tumble out of them yet another Bill proposing another authority, board or commission. We have enough boards, commissions and authorities to sink a battleship and we do not need any new ones.  If there were a case to be made for a new board, it would be a board with the specific draconian remit to close other boards down.  It could be called An Bord um Threascairt Bord or An tÚdarás um Dhunadh síos Udarás, but we need that more than anything else.  Any board being given birth to by a Minister accouched in this Chamber is entering the world on the defensive, required at every moment to justify its existence and by reference to standards more compelling than merely that it would provide posts for a certain number of public sector people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a general observation about new boards.  In recent years I am afraid I have detected a tendency to create boards and authorities with the purpose of relieving persons who have held themselves out as being anxious to exercise public authority of that responsibility.  A couple of years ago &mdash; and it was not the first time it was mooted &mdash; our colleague, Deputy Noonan, Minister for Justice, floated the idea of a police authority.  We do not need a police authority because the whole point of having a Minister for <Col N="1198" /> Justice, a Government and a Dáil to which he is responsible is that he must carry the wind.  He must stand up to the whirlwind of criticism and take responsibility for the correct functioning of the police force and its proper command.  He must make certain that the only thing a policeman has to fear is not doing his duty &mdash; if he does his duty he has nothing to fear, but has everything to fear if he abuses it.  That is what a Minister is there for, not an authority.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, heard me say this at a meeting.  He has gone off the theme and we have heard no more about the police authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to put the thing in some kind of perspective so that I shall not be thought unreasonable or selective in picking this authority for this kind of critique.  Deputy Wilson and I were both in the Dáil at the time &mdash; and we are not by any means the senior Members &mdash; but it is not so long ago that it was felt that a Minister for Local Government no longer could be trusted to do the job which, presumably, once upon a time he held himself as able to do, namely decide planning appeals.  The suspicion &mdash; and, indeed, in many cases the certainty &mdash; of <Col N="1199" /> political interference was so strong that he could not any longer be trusted to do that job in a clean way.  So in a Bill which came into force in 1977 we got An Bord Pleanála, the Planning Board.  That was to be a board to decide planning appeals. It was a new authority because the existing authority, the Minister, could no longer be trusted to do this.  I do not mean any particular Minister, but the Minister as an institution, a body, a corporate soul with perpetual succession.  It was not that he was thought to be overburdened in terms of work, but simply that people had no confidence in his ability to withstand political pressure.</P>
      <P>We have now gone a stage further.  In between the Government and An Bord Pleanála we inserted last year another board because the Minister &mdash; and I do not mean the present Minister, I mean any Minister &mdash; now cannot be trusted even to be clean in his appointments to An Bord Pleanála.  We have now an interpolated commission who make the appointments to that board.  The thing is becoming byzantine, ludicrous in its elaborateness and in the degree to which it represents a vote of no confidence by democratic politicians in themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see anything quite so sinister in the Dublin Transport Authority but what I do see is authorities already in place which have the function and finance, and to some extent will still retain these, for doing a certain range of jobs.  I am afraid that this is my cynicism about it.  What I see is the Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána and CIE heaving sighs of relief at the proposed enactment of this Bill because it will, to some extent, take the heat off all three: off the Garda in regard to traffic control; off the planning authority in regard to their being able to wash their hands and say that the authority recommended <Col N="1200" /> something else, and off CIE in regard to their saying that they are constrained by this or that and did not get this or that suggestion from the Dublin Transport Authority.  I do not like that.</P>
      <P>It would be far better to approach the whole question of not just transport but Government generally in a quite different spirit.  I know the Minister for 15 years and, as he knows, have always admired him.  It is one of his qualities that he has a skin thick enough to withstand criticism of this kind, even when it comes from behind him.  Our attitude towards Government in this country is going in the wrong direction.  We keep making generalised appeals to the people to accept more responsibility in between elections.  At election time we are anxious to relieve them of these things.  When it comes down to it, we ourselves are guilty of trying to shed authority as fast as we can.  That goes from the Government right down to the local representatives who are now standing for election.  A thousand gentlemen and ladies elected to all local authority districts will have the spending of public money but are unwilling to have the odium of raising it.  I do not notice any party clamouring for the restitution of a locally raised tax.  They want lots of money to be left to them by central Government, so that they can spend it, but do not want to raise it.</P>

      <P>This is worth drawing attention to.  It is not the local authorities or the Minister for Justice, or the Minister for the Environment &mdash; it is the whole tendency of Government here to shed authority, to create something else, to get the crow off their shoulders.  The local authorities do not want to solve the itinerant problem.  They are supposed to have the local knowledge, but that is to be managerialised or centralised.  Above all, do not ask a local councillor who has sought election on the grounds that he knows his area enough to serve it to solve an ugly, odious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the question of this latest proposal of the Government in regard to Dublin.  I am not trying to flatter the Minister.  I know that in his heart he will be as conscious of this as I am.  Although the Bill necessarily has to concentrate on one theme only, namely transport.  I have to say this about the casting of the Bill and the drafting of the explanatory memorandum and, indeed, the Minister's speech, that none of these seemed to reflect a consciousness of any dimensions of what I might call the life of a capital city.  You cannot look at transport, particularly that in a capital city, in an isolated way.  We are not now dealing with all urban transport in this Bill, but <Col N="1202" /> with the transport situation in the capital city of our Republic.</P>
      <P>A capital city is in a special category, a special position.  It is, or should be, a showpiece and a source of pride, not merely to those who by accident, choice or whatever reason become, or have been always, its inhabitants, but to everybody in the country.  There were a couple of Deputies from the country in the House this morning and I am hoping that they will contribute on this Bill, because the conditions of the capital city should be as close to their hearts as they are to those of Deputies like ourselves on this side who happen to live here.  A man from Letterkenny, or Gortahork, or Belmullet or Two-Mile-Borris ought to be as interested and as proud of the capital city of his Republic as those who live here.  Most of us are &ldquo;Cuid-a Dós&rdquo; one or two generations back.  I was born here, but neither of my parents was.  The same is probably true of many Deputies who represent Dublin constituencies.  There are some representing Dublin constituencies who were born in Cork and some do not seem to have arrived from Cork too long ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all be interested in the capital city and a piecemeal treatment of it as though it were just some other town is wrong.  During Deputy Richard Bruton's very factual contribution, the Chair did not have to pull him in the whole of his excellent speech.  That Deputy thought that there was more to planning than simply drawing a red line on a map or designating a zone and hoping that all would then go well.  One had to make sure that something happened. One had to make provision for the necessities which arise from people living in the place, as citizens of a capital city and also as the human front of the national showpiece.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be making needless jibes at this Bill.  One does not expect to find too much in a Bill like this about anything except what it sets out or purports <Col N="1203" /> to do.  I would have wished, at least, some passing reference to expressly environmental considerations.  However, one does not expect to find that.  This Bill seems to envisage the city as potentially an easily moving spaghetti of roads in the inter-slices of which ordinary people, businesses and public administration, must exist as best they can, no doubt a dimension of their lives facilitated by freer moving transport but not necessarily any other dimension of their lives enhanced and the general picture of the city not necessarily improved.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that a city that is a world by-word for traffic jams &mdash; perhaps like Lagos or some other place &mdash; should be indifferent if we head in that direction. Of course we should not.  The overall planning and government of a capital city is something that requires a united treatment that does not simply co-ordinate or go some distance towards co-ordinating the police, the nationalised transport company and the planning authorities, but which absorbs the other dimensions of government.</P>
    <P>I am not of the opinion that merely to call somebody a Minister will make any serious difference to what he is supposed to administer but I have always thought that in a country like this, because of our peculiar history and the fact that for so long Dublin was merely a provincial or colonial outpost capital, we should have a Minister for the capital.  We should have a Department for the capital with the budget covering all dimensions of government. They should not merely make recommendations and give advice but should have the spending of money for hospitals, schools, roads and for the policing we need.  I do not see it as necessarily essential to have a national police force.  I can see the political reasons for it and I support it in a general sense.  However, the policing of a capital city of this size, particularly when it is so far out of scale with other towns, is a problem all of its own.  There would be a case for a centralised governmental authority here with a budget to do everything so far as this city was concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> We want Dublin to be a city of which all of us can be proud.  Although traffic congestion is bad enough in my opinion it is one of the least of our problems.  At the moment this city can only make one weep.  Yesterday my colleague, Deputy Coveney, got coverage for some hard truths he spoke about Cork.  He was right to speak his mind because in the long run we do not do ourselves any good by deceiving ourselves about the things around us.  For what my opinion is worth, Cork is about the only good looking city in Ireland and I say that with apologies to people in Limerick and Galway.  Cork presents an infinitely more smiling, more interesting and more human face than does Dublin, even if it is on a smaller scale.  Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not notice it as he goes hurriedly with his bag to the station on a Thursday evening, but Dublin has become an absolute dog's breakfast.  If I were a member of the Dublin Corporation I would hang my head in shame &mdash; if I did not hang myself &mdash; at the shame of being part of the alleged or supposed government of a city like this which can decline so far and so fast.  When I was a student in the fifties there was still some faint charm about the admittedly ramshackle quays, the old bookshops and so on.  Perhaps they would have fallen by now anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was an excellent article in that paper by the local government correspondent.  The starting point was the proposal to have a boulevard through the middle of the Liberties.  Perhaps he was a little personal on where the chief city planners hailed from: very few of them seemed to be jackeens.  The implication, perhaps it was unfair, which lurked not too far beneath the surface of the article was that since they did not come from here they had no instinctive feeling for the place.  I hope the correspondent did not mean that and I hope they will not be offended if that is the sense they take from the article.  However, his point was a valid one, namely, that there is more to a city than simply facilitating traffic flow and that if you facilitate traffic flow you may destroy several of the reasons that led to the city being there in the first place.  It may be turned into a wilderness from which people want to escape.  That has been the experience of cities that have got an overdose of fly-overs, double junctions and so on, where people want to get away from the 24 hours a day noise, filth and dust.  Such cities are no longer places where people want to live or to do business. The history of inner city decay in American cities is a problem so great for them as to have serious political dimensions. It has a history of fly-overs freeways, 16-lane highways of all kinds and the traffic flow facilitated but the people <Col N="1206" /> are no longer able to lead a decent existence.</P>
      <P>The Irish title of this Bill is An Bille um Iompras Bhaile Átha Cliath.  That is a good one.  I often think of the weary heroes in Rannóg an Aistriúcháin in this House slaving for a lifetime &mdash; I have to say with amazing skill and perseverance &mdash; to turn the inventions of politicians into plausible Irish.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching it in the best way I can.  I am not accusing Iompras Átha Cliath of having any intention of destroying the quality of life but I am entitled to point to the frame of mind that can suppose that a Bill concentrating on the transport dimension of a city and which does not appear to reflect any understanding of other dimensions, is likely to produce bad results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have missed it but in the section dealing with pedestrian control I have not seen any suggestion that this Authority will have the power to pedestrianise.  If I am wrong in what I say I will withdraw it at once, because I do not want to waste the time of the Minister or of the House by making an assertion that is untrue. I do not see anything that entitles the Authority to pedestranise zones of the city.  Two things are notable.  The pedestrianisation of large zones of an inner city, particularly of an ancient city with <Col N="1207" /> narrow streets that do not lend themselves to be turned into freeways and fly-overs, is common on the Continent and in the older cities of Britain.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to concentrate too much on the British because they are not anything to write home about in so far as much of their town planning is concerned but the pedestrianising of large zones of inner cities is common in Europe.  It has been tried in a half hearted way with Grafton Street, with mixed results.  It ought to be tried in a much wider area of the city, perhaps in an area connecting the north side with the south side though such a move would not appear to be within the power of the authority.  However, many people would ask whether we should be thinking in terms of a traffic flow through the centre of the city but that problem does not seem to be addressed in the Bill.  In addition it seems to be outside the remit of the Authority the Bill proposes to set up.  One would have thought it was a matter that would have figured large in the Bill.  I do not mean that the Authority should be compelled to close areas of the city to motor traffic, or to restrict them to public service vehicles as happens on the Continent, but it should have been included explicitly in the remit of the Authority.</P>
    <P>Lest I am told that such detail cannot be set out in the Bill, I wish to draw attention to the amazing feature whereby the Authority are to be allowed specifically to direct their attention towards the erection of bollards and ramps.  Where have we arrived in this ancient city when the only idea in the Bill that has any teeth would seem to be the erection of bollards and ramps?  It is surprising that Rannóg an Aistriúcháin did not think to call the Authority Bórd na gCuaillí Concréide. Are the board or Bord an nIomairí Concréide to concentrate on the provision of concrete bollards and ramps which are not used by any civilised city in the world except perhaps, Belfast whch has its own problem to deal with.  Are we to admit that the place has become ungovernable and unlivable in to that extent and, if so, why can we not produce in the Bill some <Col N="1208" /> provision that would give some hope to the people that they might finish up with a city of which they could all be proud instead of having a situation in which visitors have to be brought from the airport at night or by some circuitous route in order to avoid their seeing what is going on?</P>
    <P>Though there are dimensions to this Bill that are not fully explored or which, as Deputy Bruton said, are not explored at all, I would have wished some indication of a direction to be given to the Authority to take an interest in the development of the rapid rail option.  Many may say that I am on the wrong side in regard to the rapid rail transit system. This system involves an exceedingly high level of capital investment.  I have heard the Minister say that the cost of running the service, too, will be enormous, that it will be a loss maker unless the public use it at double the existing volume.</P>
    <P>The investment is colossal when one takes into consideration the fact that the system is being provided on an existing railway, that very little land had to be acquired and that very little by way of bridge building and not much by way of work on embankments was involved. Despite these figures I cannot be persuaded that there is not a future here for rail transport.  If the new system has not provided the justification for itself so far that we might have expected, this may be partly due to the causes the Minister has hinted at, but it is due partly also to the fact that we failed in the past to plan the city with an eye to transport.  A moment ago I may have seemed to have been decrying the role of transport but, far from that, I am saying that it cannot be looked at in isolation, and neither can town planning be considered in isolation.</P>
    <P>It was ludicrous, for instance, to have built a city like Tallaght where, apart from the lack of other amenities which the inhabitants are struggling gallantly to overcome, there are no rail lines by which the people might be transported to the city centre.  The extension of this city into the surrounding countryside should have proceeded on the basis that the fastest and most trouble free mode of transport <Col N="1209" /> is rail transport.  If managed properly, rail transport can be the most economical also.  Therefore, building of as high a density as people were willing to tolerate should have been provided around rail transport.</P>
    <P>I played no part in the decision to provide the DART system but now that it is in existence I have unstinted admiration for it.  If there is anybody living within usable distance of the service who has not availed of it so far, I urge them strongly to begin using it immediately.  The system is one from which we can all learn.  The service is respected by the people who use it.  Smoking is not allowed on the trains and that rule is well observed. Occasionally someone lights a cigarette but obviously there are some very clever sniffers around because one then hears the driver calling out in the most frightening tones, all the more frightening because nobody knows how he can see the smoker, that the cigarette is to be extinguished.  There is almost never any litter in the trains and neither are there any graffiti or any signs of dirt anywhere.</P>
    <P>The trains are a pleasure to travel on and from what I can see, and I travel at times other than rush hours, the service is well patronised.  The total traffic could be doubled but then the number of trains would have to be increased.  The system has become so popular that I notice in advertisements for houses on either the north or the south side of the city, that proximity to the DART service is mentioned. The cost of inserting that bit of information in any such advertisement is an extra £3 or £4 per day but obviously people consider it a selling point.  This means that people wish to live near a <Col N="1210" /> service of that kind and that in turn carries the implication that future building policy, either in the public or private sector, should be concentrated on the rail lines which still exist in the city but which are not used nearly sufficiently.</P>

    <P>* The &ldquo;civilian working population&rdquo; is the total labour force excluding members of the armed forces.

      <P>In addition to the normal consular services that would be available to citizens in distress, an officer from the Department of Labour is attached to the Irish Embassy in London.  He maintains contact with Irish bodies which provide welfare services for emigrants in Britain.  In addition to his general contacts he is also chairman of an advisory group (called DÍON).</P>
      <P>The group is to advise the Minister for Labour on questions relating to the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain.  The Minister for Labour disposes of a fund to help the Irish welfare groups in their work.  In 1984 this fund was increased from IR£38,000 to IR£68,000 and was distributed to eleven welfare bodies as a grant.  The amounts are particularly intended to help the groups concerned to provide welfare or counselling services. Nine of the bodies are in Britain.  Two are based in Dublin but are directly involved in advising prospective emigrants.  I attach considerable importance to this fund and the Government agreed that the amount allocated in 1985 be increased to IR£104,000.</P>

I would agree with the Deputy that it is important that anybody who is tempted to go to the United Kingdom should make themselves fully aware of the situation and should not, as it were, go on the blind. That is one of the reasons some of the funding we provide is directed towards two bodies based in Dublin which are available to advise prospective emigrants.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the situation to which he referred and which existed a couple of years ago is totally different from the one that obtains now in that we no longer have voluntary emigration.  We now have young people in their thousands being forced to seek employment opportunities elsewhere.  Can the Minister tell us what information he has available to him or his Department with regard to the numbers of young people who are at present unemployed in London and the other larger cities in the United Kingdom?  Would the Minister go further and comment on a figure I have heard publicly from people involved in counselling services, that there are up to 30,000 to 40,000 young Irish boys and girls homeless, jobless and moneyless at present in the United Kingdom?</P>

I mentioned that we do not have official statistics. While there are certainly indications of young people going to the United Kingdom our response has been to ensure that, as far as we can, we make available to the welfare bodies funding which, as I mentioned, has been increased in the order of 175 per cent over two years and which shows the commitment of this Government to having this problem properly dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's Official Development Assistance, which consists of three main elements: contributions to international organisations active in development, bilateral aid and disaster relief, will grow during the period of the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, from £34 million to £50 million, an increase of 47 per cent. As contributions to international organisations, usually described as multilateral aid, are not expected to increase at the same pace, it is expected that bilateral aid will almost double during the same period.  This will permit an increase in the number of projects undertaken in longerterm development and the sending of an increased number of volunteers abroad through APSO, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> As the Deputy will be aware, our bilateral aid programme is concentrated on Africa where all four of our priority countries &mdash; Sudan, Lesotho, Zambia and Tanzania &mdash; are located.  Taking the various elements together it is estimated that roughly two-thirds of our total ODA &mdash; which in 1985 will amount to £38.36 million goes to the African Continent.</P>
    <P>The situation in Africa resulting from food shortages continues to be a matter of great concern.  It is clear on the basis of information becoming available since the question was tabled that millions of people are at risk because of inadequate food supplies and that the crisis is set to persist for some time yet.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured, however, that significant efforts are underway both by the Governments of the countries concerned and by the international community with a view to averting further catastrophe.  International co-operation in this regard was comprehensively reviewed at a United Nations conference in Geneva on 11-12 March 1985.  Ireland has played an active part in these efforts both as a member of the European Communities and on its own account.</P>
    <P>The Community is an important source of assistance, including food and other emergency aid to developing countries. Following an initiative of the Irish Presidency, the European Council, meeting in Dublin on 3 and 4 December 1984, decided that assistance to the countries affected by food shortages should be significantly further increased by the provision of 1.2 million tonnes of cereals in the period leading up to the next harvest in the countries concerned, later this year.  At a recent review of commitments under the Dublin plan it emerged that this target will, in fact, be exceeded.</P>
    <P>Ireland also contributes to the relief efforts of other international agencies. For example, a shipment of 2,413 tonnes of wheat flour was sent to the Sudan recently to be used in a project of the World Food Programme in support of refugees in Ethiopia.  At a donors meeting convened by the Office for Emergency Operations in Africa on 31 May, <Col N="1221" /> Ireland pledged £100,000 towards projects being carried out in the Sudan by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
    <P>Contributions to alleviate the present famine emergency in Africa and the natural disasters elsewhere in the world, such as the cyclone which recently ravaged Bangladesh, are met from the Disaster Relief Fund.  The provision this year is £629,000.  In addition to the pledge of £100,000 mentioned above, some £350,000 has been used to meet the cost of transporting 2,000 tonnes of grain, milk powder and seed potatoes to Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>A second shipment, comprising skim milk powder and anhydrous milk fat, was recently sent to the Sudan for distribution to famine victims through the Gezira dairy co-operative project, a long term project developed with our bilateral aid funds.</P>
    <P>In addition to these official efforts, the public have responded particularly generously to the appeals of the Irish non-Government organisations involved in providing assistance to famine victims in Africa, as the House will be aware.  The House can also be assured that there is extensive co-ordination and co-operation, between the Government's efforts and those of the non-Governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with our response.  There are, of course, no grounds for complacency regarding the prospects of the countries concerned in the short or even the medium term.  It is certain that a crisis of exceptional proportions will continue to exist for some time.  It is therefore necessary that the international community should continue to seek ways of increasing the volume and effectiveness of their assistance.  The House can be assured that Ireland will continue to play an active part in this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Would the Minister agree that it is not just a matter of money and of signing cheques and that Ireland being fairly pivotal in this area is ideally situated to take new initiatives <Col N="1222" /> and that Ireland should be in the forefront at the EC councils demanding new initiatives and coming up with new initiatives and mobilising resources of the EC behind these new initiatives?  Will the Minister see to it that Ireland takes some new initiative in this area apart from the funds, with which we are all reasonably pleased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there are things other than money involved.  There is the question of the quality of the aid and making sure that it reaches the right people and is being utilised for the right purpose.  New initiatives are part of our policy to make our voice heard in the international fora, in particular in the European Community.  Last September I raised the question of the situation in Ethiopia about which I had received reports and asked for action.  That was before the information hit the world media.  Thereafter I visited Ethiopia and followed that visit up with a further report to the Council of Foreign Ministers.  This led into the European Summit in Dublin and the Dublin plan was agreed by our Community partners.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Sudan in March I was struck by the obvious evidence of impending famine not just among the refugees but among the native population. On my return I made a further report on this at the following meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council and asked for action at that point.  At the Budget Council which I attended on behalf of Ireland I took an initiative seeking extra funding for food aid from the Community and at the last council meeting at the end of May we were successful in securing a further £80 million in the Community budget for that purpose.  Therefore, the Deputy can be assured that every opportunity will be used on our part to highlight the problem and not alone to use our own efforts nationally but to try to mobilise the greatest international effort possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that the acute famine conditions in parts of Africa have now created a new situation which requires the complete <Col N="1223" /> rethinking of our whole policy on development aid?  Will he not agree with me that it is about time that instead of giving fish to those who are hungry we gave them fishing rods and showed them how to fish?  Would he agree further that as far as the EC and our involvement in it are concerned, not enough is being done to come to grips with the problem? Whereas from the Minister of State's reply it is obvious that he has been extremely busy in this area, the situation has not improved one whit in regard to the starving millions there.  Is he prepared to tell us here and now what action, if any, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken with his colleagues in the other EC countries to deal with the situation that we know exists at present in which millions of tonnes, worth many £s, of essential foodstuffs are rotting in ports in the starvation affected parts of this continent and in which the food that has been sent out there is not getting through to the people who need it?  Would the Minister of State comment on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues arise here.  In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, of course I accept that long term development is the answer and that these countries must be helped to become self-sufficient, but I take issue with the Deputy on the formulation of his question.  It is not an either/or situation. There must be concentration on development, but at the same time one cannot ignore the immediate needs of those who are dying of hunger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, therefore, we are <i>ad idem.</i> There must be, as it were, a twin track approach, a fire brigade operation dealing with the immediate short term situation but under no circumstances forgetting the medium and long term development needs.  In regard to the question of the EC, the aspect of the effective delivery of aid, ensuring that <Col N="1224" /> it reaches the people for whom it is intended, is very important and was one of the major items under discussion at the last Council of Development Ministers. Measures are being taken at EC level, in so far as it is possible taking into account the different logistics of some of these countries, to ensure very effective delivery of aid.  I suggested at that Council that more use should be made by the EC institutions of the non-governmental organisations, the voluntary bodies, particularly those who had people on the ground and whom I found so reliable in relation to national aid efforts.</P>
      <P>As to whether the situation is improving, recent indications suggest that, particularly in some countries, it is not improving but deteriorating.  I have mentioned the Sudan.  The latest information I have on that is that a very alarming problem has been developing there and that the numbers now affected by famine have increased enormously.  These figures are difficult to estimate accurately, but there is continuing effort on the part of the EC, the UN and other bodies to ensure that the most accurate information is available and that the most effective response is made by the international bodies to the situation as it develops.</P>

Our approach, which is also that of the ten member states of the European Community, is that the problems of the region can only be solved by a political agreement coming from within the region itself.  For this reason Ireland fully supports Security Council Resolution 562 of 10 May 1985.  That resolution which was adopted at the conclusion of an urgent meeting of the Security Council requested by Nicaragua, sets out four key <Col N="1227" /> points.  First, it reaffirmed the sovereignty and inalienable right of Nicaragua to freely decide on its own political, economic and social systems.  Secondly, it reaffirmed support for the Contadora process.  Thirdly, it called on all states to refrain from carrying out, supporting or promoting economic or military actions of any kind against any state in the region which might impede the Contadora process. Fourthly, it called on the Governments of the US and Nicaragua to resume the dialogue they had been holding in Manzanillo, Mexico, towards reaching agreement on normalising their relations.</P>
    <P>Together with our partners in the European Community we will continue to do whatever we can to help those directly involved to achieve enduring peace and stability in the region.  As the Deputy knows, the San Jose Conference in September 1984 saw the initiation of a process of political and economic dialogue between the two regions.  This dialogue has helped underpin the Contadora process. Since the San Jose Conference a number of successful meetings have been held between the Commission of the European Community and representatives of Central America.  The Commission has now submitted to the EC Council of Ministers a draft negotiating mandate for the conclusion of an Economic Co-operation Agreement between the two regions.  It is proposed that a substantial increase in aid to Central America will follow the conclusion of the agreement.  I hope that a second conference of Foreign Ministers to discuss both economic and political issues and to conclude the Economic Co-operation Agreement will take place in Luxembourg before the end of the the year.</P>

      <P>In view of the close relationship between this country and the United States, does the Minister not consider it appropriate that our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Government should indicate our dissatisfaction with the direction in which the United States is moving <Col N="1228" /> in regard to Nicaragua?  While it is laudable that our position should be put forward as part of the policy of the EC, our membership of the Community does not mean that we must lose our individuality. We can still put forward our views as an individual country which has relations with the United States in regard to their moves to overthrow a democratically elected government in Nicaragua.</P>

      <P>Our general approach to the position in Central America is that the problems of the region can only be solved by political agreement within the region itself.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the steps now being taken by the United States administration threaten the very existence of the Nicaraguan administration and state?  Would he not agree that the situation being brought about by the US sanctions is similar to the situation in which we found ourselves during the twenties and thirties when we were threatened by a far stronger neighbour? Would he consider that it would be an appropriate sign of support for the administration there if we set up some form of diplomatic relations with Nicaragua? We might consider development aid.  All these things would be a sign of support by a small country in Europe for a similar small country in Central America.</P>

      <P>There is a difference between diplomatic and consular functions.  The consular function is to deal with consular problems, mainly related to Irish citizens in a particular country. My understanding is that the number of Irish citizens in Nicaragua is almost nil. A consular function also has something to do with trade but the trade between our two countries is very small.  Regarding the diplomatic situation, the Deputy will be aware that cost factors are a major consideration.  I recently had an opportunity of meeting the Vice-President of Nicaragua and I indicated to him that we had supported co-finance on projects in Nicaragua and that I would be open to further proposals in this area.</P>

      <P>On the evening of Friday 31 May, the Department of foreign Affairs were informed by the Garda authorities that an incursion by five British soldiers took place earlier that day near Hackballscross, County Louth.  My Department protested the incursion immediately to the British authorities.  At that time it was also indicated that if initial concern that the leakage of fuel had been brought about by the activity of the British soldiers was confirmed, a yet more serious view of the incident would be taken.</P>
      <P>We have learned from subsequent Garda investigations that ten British soldiers were in fact involved in the incursion.</P>
      <P>During the course of the weekend following the incident, the British authorities were further requested, on the instructions of the Taoiseach, to give their full co-operation so that a thorough investigation of the incident involving the oil spillage could be made.  The Government were given an assurance to this effect from the British authorities.  The British authorities have since indicated in statements to the press, which were confirmed to my Department, that having made inquiries into the matter they have found nothing to suggest that British soldiers were responsible for the leaking of the fuel.  Investigations are continuing and we will await the conclusion before we take any further action on the matter.  In so far as the incursion itself is concerned, the British authorities have admitted that this indeed took place. They state that it was a result of a map reading error by the troops involved.  The British authorities have expressed regret for the incursion.</P>

In the meantime, Deputies can rest assured that the Government take an extremely grave view of this incursion and that this view has been forcefully conveyed to the British authorities.</P>

On the question of the map reading error, the British authorities stated that it was as a result of a map reading error that this incursion took place.  They followed that with an expression of regret in regard to the number of such incursions.  The figures indicate that the number of incursions has fallen considerably in recent years but any such incursion has been the subject of a protest by the Government and I will be happy only when there are no incursions at all.</P>

      <P>May I first of all ask the Minister &mdash; I am adverting now to the fact that in his reply he seemed to me to speak exclusively of British explanations of the matter &mdash; if any investigation of this incident was carried out by our own authorities, Army or Garda?  In particular, has the question of the release of diesel oil into the water supply to the town of Dundalk been fully and thoroughly investigated by the Garda and or the Army?  May I ask the Minister if he seriously accepts this hoary old chestnut of errors of map reading?  Will he not agree with me that in that sort of situation there are so many other indicators available to any body of soldiers as to exactly where they are that the excuse of a map reading error does not wash?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the investigation I should like to say, yes, the matter was and continues to be investigated by the Garda Síochána.  The figures I quoted in my reply to Deputy McGahon were based on a report from the Garda Síochána and their investigations <Col N="1238" /> are continuing.  They are also investigating the fact that the oil spillage took place and the various allegations made in respect of it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the map reading remarks made by Deputy Haughey, I should like to say that, as I mentioned in my reply, this was the excuse given by the British authorities.  As to whether one accepts map reading excuse or not I should like to point out that our approach has been that we are a sovereign State and that any incursion for any reason whatever is not acceptable to us.  On that basis, referring to a map reading problem may provide an explanation but does not provide an excuse.  I do not believe there should be any incursions whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, I should like to know if the Minister has made it clear, as he is now saying to the House, to the British authorities that incursions are not acceptable and that the alleged excuse of a map reading error is not acceptable either.  On the basis of those two principles has the Minister asked for some apology from the British authorities or some categoric assurance as to the future behaviour of their troops? Will the Minister, in dealing with this matter, point out to the British Government, and ask them to convey it to their military commanders, that the post boxes on this side of the Border are painted green and the ones on the far side of the Border are painted red and if they cannot find any other clear indication as to their whereabouts they, perhaps, might be of some guidance to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the investigation the Minister mentioned, I should like to say that surely at this stage gardaí on this side of this artificial boundary should be in a position to say whether this pollution of the water supply can be attributable to the British soldiers or, if not, who is to be held responsible for it?  I know well that if it was some youngster in my constituency in Coolock who was accused of some incident of this kind the Garda would quickly be able to decide who was responsible.  Will the Minister tell us exactly what is the status of the investigation <Col N="1239" /> on our side?  Have any reports been received by him and, if so, what is the content of those reports?  When do the Garda propose to give from their point of view, never mind the British point of view, an assessment as to exactly who was responsible for this criminal act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the general question about incursions, I should like to state that the Government take an extremely grave view of all incursions. Deputies may be aware that the standing instructions of the British authorities forbid the Northern security forces to operate south of the Border. Our Government are determined to ensure that these instructions are complied with.  Any time any incursion is reported, and confirmed, my Department lodge an official protest with the British Government with a request that an explanation be given.  The British Government at a high political level are aware of the views of the Irish Government on this incident.  They are aware that incursions are regarded here as gravely injurious to our joint co-operation on security and other matters and that they are counter-productive in that they provide propaganda to subversive organisations.</P>
      <P>In this instance a protest was made and the British authorities expressed regret for the incursion.  In regard to the oil spillage, I should like to state that the Garda investigations have not yet been completed.  The Garda have confirmed that there was a spillage at Conway's Quarry but so far they are unable to say who was responsible for that spillage.  The latest indication I have from the Garda is that their investigations are continuing in that regard.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Border is clearly identifiable in this area where this, the most serious of all incursions, took place, by the Court-bane river?  There was no question of post boxes because the soldiers did not come up the road.  The incident occurred at 11 a.m. a few fields across from the barracks <Col N="1240" /> in Crossmaglen.  I agree with Deputy Haughey who said that not enough diplomatic push was used in this case.  I request the Minister to demand that no further incursions of this nature take place.  Will the Minister agree that had the incursion not taken place in the first instance there would not be a claim for £25,000 against the ratepayers of County Louth?  Will the Minister agree that because of this, and the position of the Border in this area, that the British Government should pay this claim?</P>

      <P>I have already indicated the grave view the Government take of any incursion.  I should, however, point out that the number of incursions has gone down in recent years.  Records in my Department show that from 1973 to the end of 1982 there were an average of 64 incursions annually.  In 1982 there <Col N="1241" /> were 49, in 1983 there were 22, a reduction of more than a half, in 1984 there were 27 and in 1985 to date there were 17.  I believe these figures indicate that the protests made by successive Irish Governments in this regard have been having some effect, but I reiterate that I will not be happy until there are no incursions whatever.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned protests.  Could I ask him to be a little more specific about that?  In what way are protests made about these incursions, and in particular what way was the protest made on this occasion?  Would the Minister agree that there is a suspicion around that when incidents of this kind take place officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs ring their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Office and in an apologetic manner say: &ldquo;I am sorry old chap, but I have been asked to bring to your notice that your troops were across our Border again&rdquo;.</P>

I think the Minister would agree that that is the position. Would the Minister of State or the Minister for Foreign Affairs personally pursue this matter to a satisfactory conclusion from the point of view of Deputies?  May I ask the Minister if, in his own mind, he would not regard this particular incident as being in the same context as the impertinent attempt by the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland to summon the Garda Commissioner to attend on him?

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>UNIFIL's mandate was established by the United Nations Security Council under resolution 435 of 19 March 1978.  This resolution established UNIFIL in the light of the request <Col N="1246" /> of the Government of Lebanon &ldquo;for the purpose of confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, UNIFIL have never been allowed to implement fully their mandate and, since the second invasion of Lebanon by Israel in June 1982, all contingents of UNIFIL, including the Irish contingent, have been forced to operate under severe constraints. However, UNIFIL remain an important and recognised factor for stability in Southern Lebanon.  It affords a measure of protection to the local population and in its absence local militias would be in a position to further, without hindrance, their own aims.  In addition, UNIFIL provides important humanitarian assistance to the local population.  The UN Secretary General has indicated that he views the presence of UNIFIL as essential.  The UN Security Council, reflecting the will of the international community, agreed to renew UNIFIL's mandate in April 1985 for an additional six month period. The Government agreed at that time to continue Ireland's participation in the force.</P>
      <P>In the context of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, it is my hope that UNIFIL will be in a position to implement fully their mandate.  Every effort is being made by the United Nations Secretary General to ensure a more effective role for UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon with a view to the establishment of peace and security in the area in accordance with the will of the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, incidents involving the abduction of UNIFIL personnel, including an Irish soldier, and threats to the safety and well-being of members of the force by Israeli-backed militias, hinder UNIFIL in the implementation of the tasks they have been set by the international community.  These dangerous actions do not assist in the maintenance of peace and security in Southern Lebanon.  The concern of the Government over these recent incidents has been <Col N="1247" /> conveyed to the Israeli authorities and we have made it known to Israel that we will hold them ultimately responsible for actions taken by militias that they finance and support.</P>

      <P>This section, as I understand it, extends the right to vote in Irish general elections to British citizens resident in Ireland.  It gives the Minister power, by order, to extend voting rights in those elections to members of other nationalities whose countries are members of the EC, where those countries offer reciprocal voting arrangements to Irish citizens residing in their countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> Could the Minister explain how this section can be brought into operation, in relation to the extension of the voting rights in Ireland to citizens of EC countries other than Britain?  Does it imply that they must act first and extend the voting right to Irish citizens?  If Germany offers the right to an Irish citizen residing there to vote in their general elections, then it seems that we are prepared to offer the same right here.  Which country will act first?  We have put this on our Statute Book and who will take the initiative?</P>

      <P>We have given the lead in the sense that we have enshrined in our legislation the right of members of the European Community to vote in this country, subject to reciprocal arrangements.  We would await a response, an approach in the normal way of reciprocation.  By agreement, both parties would then come together.  We would not take the position of not doing anything until the other partner did it. We have correctly enshrined that right in our legislation.  Other countries have not done that.  Members of EC countries resident here can vote in EC elections and local elections.  I sincerely hope, in the interests of good relations with our European colleagues, that this dialogue will start from here.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has said we have done this but, with due respect to him, we have done nothing. All we have done is to give the Minister power to do something but we have not actually done anything.  This Bill does not state that a German citizen residing here will have the right to vote here as soon as an Irish citizen gets the right to vote in Germany.  All it states is that the Minister is empowered to make an order extending the right to vote to a German citizen living in Ireland.  In what circumstances will that order be made?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A point that frequently arises is the force or significance in legislation of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Deputy Molloy <Col N="1301" /> knows that I am not trying to come the heavy in so describing him but lay people often think that &ldquo;may&rdquo; means it is at the discretion of the Minister not to do something if he should so choose.  The layman often thinks that the word used should be &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  I suppose what is in Deputy Molloy's mind is that the requirement should explicitly compel the Minister to make the order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should make his own points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant to something I want to deal with myself.  I did not come here just to track Deputy Molloy: I came here to make a few points of my own but I will use him as a launching pad now that he is here.  This section does not leave the Minister free to make up his own mind whether he will hand out the vote to German citizens once Irish people are allowed to vote in Germany.  The purpose of subsection (1B) is to compel the Minister to activate this provision once he has made up his mind that the voting requirements in, for instance, Germany are of a kind analogous to those which an Irish person would have here.  I do not think the subsection could possibly be interpreted as letting the Minister put the matter on the long finger.  Were it so, a German citizen resident here could compel the Minister by an order in the High Court to make this order or declaration. Paragraph (b) of the subsection states:</P>
      <P>the provisions of that law enabling citizens of Ireland who are so resident so to vote are the same, or are substantially the same, as those enabling nationals of that Member State so to vote,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows what this provision is aiming at but in order to avoid getting into a tangle later the Minister might consider inserting after the word &ldquo;law&rdquo; a parenthesis saying &ldquo;other than those <Col N="1302" /> relating to citizenship&rdquo;.  Obviously the ordinary law of Germany relating to the right to vote there provides that it is restricted to citizens and clearly an Irish citizen cannot conform to that part of the law and it is an absurdity to require the Minister to satisfy himself that that part of the law is the same as it would be for Irish people here.  In order to avoid doubt it should say specifically that the provisions of that law which are supposed to be in the Minister's mind must be those provisions that are analogous but not literally the same because, by definition, they cannot be the same since an Irishman living in Germany does not satisfy the requirement of German citizenship.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an omission in the section, namely, that it is not sufficiently explicit what will happen if the situation in the foreign country changes.  Subsection (1E) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may revoke or amend an order under this section (including an order under this subsection).</P>
    <P>I presume the Dáil would intend &mdash; and if so perhaps it should say so &mdash; that he may revoke or amend an order only where his opinion as to the voting law of the other country has changed.  If the Minister is of the opinion, as he must if it is brought to his attention, that the law of the other State has been made more rigorous and has excluded Irish citizens, then he should revoke the order, as is the intention of the Dáil.  I take it that the reciprocity which the Dáil seems agreed on is to be strictly one of mutual conditionality: in other words, there is to be a reciprocal voting arrangement but only so long as it remains reciprocal.  If the other side opts out, that should bring into operation the Minister's right to suspend or revoke his order.  It should be made explicit that he may revoke or amend that order only where his opinion as to the quality of the voting law in the other country has changed.</P>
    <P>Another matter that should be spelled out relates to where a member state of the EC ceases to be a member state.  What is the position then?  For example, if Denmark, Holland or Britain were to leave <Col N="1303" /> the EC &mdash; I cannot foresee what motives might lead them to do so &mdash; and if we had a reciprocal voting arrangement with them as we will have automatically in the case of Britain because of the existing situation and as we may hereafter in the case of other EC member states, what will happen?  Presumably the intention of the Dáil is that the reciprocal voting arrangement should automatically lapse. But since it does not appear to be a necessary implication of the Bill and in order to avoid doubt, perhaps the Minister would consider taking Report Stage another day and including a short clause making clear that where a State ceases to be a member state his order becomes automatically voided.</P>
    <P>I have made the point that where voting laws in other countries change, the Minister's power under subsection (1) (e) opinion of the voting laws in any other country has changed.  However, that sub-country has changed.  However, that subsection refers only to countries, other than Britain, which are EC members. Unless I have misread the Bill, the Minister would not appear to have the same discretion in regard to Britain.  I would be totally against any discrimination, favourable or otherwise, <i>vis-à-vis</i> British subjects and the citizens of other EC States.  I would have prefered if no individual nationality had been referred to in the Bill.  It could have been put in more general terms to the effect that the conditions outlined would apply automatically where there are reciprocal voting rights and that otherwise the Minister shall form an opinion thereafter as to whether these rights are provided in any other States.  That right of the Minister to revoke or amend the order does not seem to have anything corresponding to it in the case of the British.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the reaction of the House would be if the Irish living in Britain were disenfranchised so far as voting in that country was concerned and Britain is the only country where there is even <Col N="1304" /> the shadow of a likelihood of that happening. It is not likely to happen in Holland or Denmark where the numbers of Irish are negligible.  The presence of Irish voters in large numbers can have significant effects in individual constituencies in Britain as the Tory Party have complained repeatedly.  They have always believed that the constituencies which are marginal in the Labour direction tended to be kept marginal by the inclination of Irish people to vote Labour.</P>
    <P>My impression is that Irish people living in Britain no longer vote <i>en bloc</i> for the Labour Party.  Many of them probably vote either of the other ways. However, the question of whether the Irish ought to have a vote in England has been fairly contentious there and that is why I say it is the only country in which Irish people might be disenfranchised. There appears to be no provision for the Minister to retaliate in such an event.  I use the word, &ldquo;retaliate&rdquo; merely to save time.  I have no wish to imply any note of vindictiveness.  It would be unfortunate if what we are trying to do as a gesture of neighbourliness were to incorporate anything which seemed retaliatory but we should not leave ourselves without any way to indicate displeasure if Irish people living in Britain were, by reason of some political necessity, to be deprived of their voting rights there.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (f) proposes that the Minister ought to regard as a British citizen someone who, under the Act entitled the British Nationality Act, 1981, is a British citizen.  I do not wish to be considered to be making a legal niggle though, as I have said here before often, those who complain loudest about legal technicalities and niggling technical points are the fastest to shelter behind such points when in difficulty and are the fastest to spell out those points if a lawyer should miss them.  It would be a pity if a Minister who is simply an administrative officer of the State while wearing that hat were to be asked to interpret a British Act because a British Act is part of a foreign legal system.</P>
    <P>In the Irish courts judicial notice will be taken of a British Act which antedates <Col N="1305" /> the emergence of this State so that one would not have to expound the meaning of an English Act that was pre-1922, but if one were trying to prove to an Irish court for some reason relevant to the court's proceedings that someone was or was not a British citizen, one would have to quote expert evidence.  The kind of evidence the court would require in such circumstances would be the evidence of a member of the English Bar.  A number of Irish barristers got English qualifications simulteneously with their Irish qualification but there would be the nuisance of bringing in one of those people to interpret the English Act.  An Irish Minister is not necessarily supposed to have any official understanding of what the English Act means.  It is not part of his duty to be well instructed in English case law which may have grown up around the Act and which may be there in accretions in the words of the Statute.</P>
    <P>In 99 cases out of 100 I would envisage no problem arising and nobody being disposed to trying to create a problem but it would be regrettable that in applying criterion to an Irish Statute an Irish Minister would have to come to the conclusion that someone qualified as anything in particular under a British Act.  It would be better if the clause were redrawn or if a further clause were included empowering the Minister to determine entitlement to franchise. Obviously, if there was a contrary view put by someone who had an interest in preventing someone from voting, legal questions would arise but, barring a dispute, the Minister should be empowered to decide for himself in the matter of authorising entry on  of the nationality of some more flexible and simple  the criterion of whether he qualified under the British Act.</P>
    <P>There may be reasons why the holding of a UK passport is not a workable criterion. I expect that all of the some hundreds of British people who reside in my constituency, for example, have British passports and if they are British citizens to the point that they have not sought Irish <Col N="1306" /> nationality, they will be getting the benefit of this Act.  The Minister would be wise either to delete paragraph (a) and to use some wider criterion which would not involve his interpreting British law, or otherwise to add another clause empowering him to reach a conclusion in any case by reference to some easily available piece of evidence such as the holding of a passport purported to be a UK passport and purported to be in the name of the person applying for registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is that, once the Minister is satisfied that Irish citizen living in another EC country are entitled to vote, he will make an order that that is not being done in a sit and wait type of situation.  We are enshrining in legislation the provision that the Minister only has to make an order.  We meet with our counterparts from time to time at ministerial meetings and I am confident that, as a group of countries interested in moving closer together, we have a common bond.</P>
      <P>We are making the running here by giving the Minister the right under our legislation to make this order allowing citizens of EC countries to vote on a reciprocal basis.  I should not like to think we would sit around and wait until somebody else makes the running or until, say, Germany or France does A B or C, but rather that we would meet and discuss this.  As people in a common European movement we should find common ground.  If people want to move from country to country &mdash; because of their common bond within the EC they should have the right to do so.  We have taken the initiative.  We should like to see other countries moving in the same direction by way of consultation and whatever legislation is seemed necessary for them. Hopefully that will be the common position within a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Kelly's point about the revocation of an order, the position is that the Minister will be able to make or revoke an order, subject to the approval of both House of the Oireachtas. In that respect there should not be any <Col N="1307" /> restriction whatsoever.  Deputy Kelly pointed out that the Minister's right to revoke or amend the law does not apply to Britain.  The position is that, as the right to vote in Dáil elections is extended under the provisions of this Bill, further legislation would be required to withdraw that right.  If the United Kingdom withdrew that right, for whatever reason, one would question the wisdom of our rushing to do the same thing.</P>
    <P>Certainly I would want to think about that because that is not the spirit in which this Bill has been introduced &mdash; a tit for tat situation.  The Irish in England have the vote.  It has taken us quite a while to come round to this way of thinking.  I do not think we should be anticipating our directions on what they might do in the future.  If there was a need to do so, if we felt compelled, then new legislation would be required.  I do not think there is anything serious here.  If we look at this, wondering what the United Kingdom may do, if they will do likewise, that amounts to jumping the gun.  If the United Kingdom were to take such action then we would review the situation in the light of that action and take whatever decision was deemed necessary at that point.  But we should not be pre-empting the situation now given the historic fact that for so many years that voting right of the Irish has obtained in the United Kingdom.  We should be somewhat more magnaminous in our attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly questioned the reference to the British Act and saw this presenting a problem for Irish Ministers and courts. First, this is not a matter for decision by Irish Ministers.  As regards the courts the position is &mdash; whether spelled out in the Bill or not &mdash; that any question of the eligibility of a person to be registered by virtue of being a British citizen will have to be decided ultimately in any event by British law.  The inclusion in the Bill of the reference to a particular British Act should render the job of the courts easier by spelling out precisely which British law has been considered.  I should also point out that the task of interpreting the <Col N="1308" /> law, not just in Britain but in various other countries, is one which arises frequently in our courts and does not give rise to any great difficulty.  There is a law for determining who is a British citizen. We are merely quoting an Act passed in 1981 &mdash; the British Nationality Act &mdash; which is the one recognised as determining the eligibility of particular persons to be British citizens.  If the courts must define the law they will have to revert to that Act.  Defining the specific law encompassed in a particular Act makes it easier.  As a layman, I am open to persuasion, but it makes reasonable sense to adopt this attitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply briefly to two of the points the Minister made and start with the latter one.  Of course it is the case that Irish courts occasionally &mdash; not by any means frequently &mdash; are obliged to try to construe, to make sense of, some provision of a foreign law.  As I tried to explain they require, perhaps not literally always but very commonly, the expert evidence of somebody who is able to swear that he knows something about foreign law.  It is a rather cumbersome business.  All I am saying is that it is regrettable that we should be so stipulating. For instance, this could happen in the interpretation of commercial contracts or something of that kind, in other words, where a jurisdiction is invoked which does not depend immediately on an Act of this Oireachtas.  It is a pity that we are writing into a Bill a criterion which cannot be made sense of except by reference to a foreign law.  That is something which is exceedingly rare in our law.  I cannot remember any other instance of it.  If one were to comb the Statutes no doubt one might find a couple of other instances but I cannot offhand recall one.  It is an exceedingly rare procedure for a Minister to set up an operating standard for himself which requires the interpretation of a foreign law to activate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with the spirit of the Minister's other point.  Indeed I said that I did not think this was the moment &mdash; when we are trying to pass a Bill inspired by the spirit of neighbourliness and of increasing <Col N="1309" /> union with the people with whom we share this continent &mdash; to include anything in a spirit of retaliation and I repeat that.  That is perfectly consistent with the other point.  I was making, which is that we are drawing here a distinction between the British and other member states.  In the case of the other member states there is machinery whereby the Minister can revoke their voting rights if the same thing were to happen to Irish people there.  But he has not given himself that power in the case of the British. If he wished to leave himself that power we would have the whole panoply of a new Bill, new recourse to this House and all the rest of it.  I honestly cannot see the reason for it.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that most British people here &mdash; and among the qualities of most English people is their reasonableness &mdash; will see the reason in what I am saying.  They would not wish to have a privilege of this sort extended to them which rendered our Minister impotent to apply the same measure here in the event of their Government at home disenfranchising Irish citizens which I am sure none of them resident here would ever wish to see happen.  Naturally he could come and ask the Dáil to do so.  I absolutely accept that there could be strong, political, human and every other kind of reasons for going easy.  I quite accept that there could be reasons for not applying the heavy hand, for not retaliating, for not trying to do to the British people living here that which had been done to Irish people living in Britain.  I accept that unreservedly.  It is a point that would be uppermost in my mind if I were in the Minister's position.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to deprive himself of that discretion.  I am simply asking him to give himself the same discretion in the case of British people as he has given himself in the case of other continentals.  British people here would see the sense of it and would not ask to be treated differently.  British people living here who keep the law, pay taxes and are good neighbours and who are glad to have the right to vote to determine the laws under which they have to live, <Col N="1310" /> will be our strongest allies in making sure that no such thing is done to Irish people living in Britain.</P>
    <P>There are widely varying estimates of the numbers of British people living here. The figure ranges from 8,000 to 12,000. I made a rough count from the electoral register, taking English and foreign sounding names and there appear to be about 400 British people resident in my own constituency.  Most Dublin constituencies would have the same.  The number may get thinner in the country and I would not like to guess the numbers there.  However, even if one were to take the lower estimate, there are about 20,000 British people of voting age living here.  I am not taking account of their dependants or children who may or may not be British subjects.  Those people will be the guarantors for the integrity of the Irish privilege of voting in Britain.  They will see the sense in the Minister giving himself an option to exercise, in the way he proposes to exercise his right in the case of the Belgians, the Danes, the French and the Germans, the right to exclude the franchise if that were to happen to Irish people living in Britain. I will not push the point.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister's heart is in the right place and I share his anxiety that we should not approach this in a military or admonitory way but in a conciliatory and neighbourly way.  I hope we will all do that, but I am not happy about a distinction being drawn between national groups.  I accept that the British are a special case to the extent that Irish people in Britain have always been allowed to vote in Britain.  I accept also that they are special because of their relatively much larger numbers but, apart from these distinctions.  I would wish to see all our European neighbours treated on the same footing.</P>

      <P>I did not get an answer from the Minister to the point I was making before Deputy Kelly rose.  We are putting the onus on the Government of the other States to introduce a law extending the right to vote to Irish citizens living there before we do it.  We are <Col N="1311" /> not making a law which extends the right to vote to the British or other member state citizens residing here.  We are merely extending the right to the Minister to make an order.  I do not accept Depputy Kelly's interjection that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in fact means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was intended to mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should have been written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister know that in principle we accept the Bill and that we are not quibbling over the contents of the Bill.  I query the mechanism being employed.  Why, if we are taking the initiative, are we putting the onus on the other member states to do something before us?  That is the way the Bill is drafted.  It is the intention of the House to allow citizens of member states to vote in our elections if their Governments extend voting rights to Irish citizens.  Who takes the initiative?  Both Parliaments will not pass a law simultaneously or the Minister will not make an order when the German Parliament for instance is passing law extending voting rights to <Col N="1312" /> Irish citizens.  These things can slip through and we have to come back with amending legislation.  I just want to know the mechanism of this.  The Minister should give a clear, precise answer to that question.</P>
      <P>On the question of the power of the Minister to revoke these orders, will the Minister elaborate on in what circumstances he envisages that these orders may be revoked?  Will the Minister say whether the right to revoke the order extends to the case of British citizens?  If it does not, then the Bill is lacking and the Minister should consider introducing an amendment to extend the right to revoke not just in the case of nationals of EC countries but also in the case of British citizens.  British citizens have been distinguished here in subsection (2) where we have made separate reference to British citizens and to nationals of member states of the EC.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would give us some enlightenment on those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered Deputy Molloy's query on the question of EC national voting here and I will take the matter up again.  Deputy Kelly referred to the British Act and why we mentioned it. If we are to give voting rights to British citizens we cannot avoid taking account of British law.  Not every British citizen holds a passport and in such cases the question of entitlement would have to be decided ultimately by reference to British law.</P>
      <P>In relation to the right to revoke the order the position is that the voting right is given by statute and it would be totally incongruous to withdraw it other than by statute.  We are introducing this legislation to give voting rights to UK citizens. That is reasonable.  If we want to withdraw that right it would not be a tremendous thing to introduce further legislation.  With regard to EC nationals, they have not given us voting rights over the years.  We are now putting something in so that if we want to revoke their right to vote we can do so.  That would be done if some country opted out of the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill refers to nationals of member <Col N="1313" /> states of the EC so if a member opted out of the EC we would have to consider revoking the rights of citizens of that country to vote here.  I see nothing extraordinary about that.  Deputy Molloy asked the question, and I think I answered it but I will answer it again, are we going to wait around for some country to make the move?  I indicated in my last reply that we have made a move, we have enshrined in our legislation that EC countries can vote subject to reciprocation, and an order can be made by the Minister.  One can say, &ldquo;Right, does the member state first have to make the move before we move?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We live in a reasonably civilised EC and I say to the Deputy that in any kind of ministerial or national discussions on that one could come to the conclusion that at some time, some day, in some year member countries could bring into their laws on a reciprocal basis the right to vote.  We are not saying that we are waiting for Germany or France or that France are waiting for us.  We will have meaningful, positive discussions on this and in that way an arrangement, an agreement, could be reached, just as we bring in regulations on a regular basis within the EC across common frontiers on matter of commerce, environment and other areas.  There is no reason why the same thing could not be done for voting by a common agreement.  We are putting into legislation a provision that if that day arrives when member states want reciprocation it will be easy for us. We will not have to draw up a very big regalia of legislation; we will just have to make an order subject to agreement by member states.  It is a reasonable approach to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Deputy Molloy's concern that we could be making gestures and sitting on fences wondering who is going to do what next, but I hope that that is not the extent of what the EC countries are about, that we are not looking over fences at one another but sitting down and making real progress in European <Col N="1314" /> unity.  We are taking an initiative on this and I hope that Deputy Molloy understands that we are not just making a gesture and then we will sit down and do nothing.  I believe we are enshrining within our legislation a mechanism which will enable us to participate on a reciprocal basis in discussions in the future and that we can get this reciprocal basis across all member states.  We are giving a lead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are well aware of what the Bill is doing.  The Minister forgets that he is responding to the suggestion which I made during the course of the debate here on the Electoral Bill which was brought before the House in October 1983 and which we told them was unconstitutional and did not go far enough.  We were proven right.  It was unconstitutional. The referendum was held and the issue decided by the people.  The Bill that the Minister has brought back is, I am glad to say broader than the one he brought in originally in which we had asked him to extend the voting rights not just to British citizens but to the nationals of members states.  We are pleased that the Minister has responded to that request from our side.  I accept his explanation that it will be done on a mutual basis at the appropriate time, that the right to vote will be extended simultaneously by each member state that agrees to do so in consultation with the Government here.</P>
      <P>I am not too sure whether we should give a special statutory definition to the term &ldquo;British citizen&rdquo; by reference to a British statute.   What will the position be if the British change that statute or annul it?  Will it mean that this Act will become annulled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, we are talking about that Act as passed, not any amendments that may be made to it.  In other words, if the British Parliament make amendments to that Act they will not affect the purpose of what we are about here in the Bill.  We use it only as guidance and a reference.  If problems arise about British citizens who might or might not have a right to vote in this <Col N="1315" /> country we will refer the matter to that Act as passed in 1981, not as it may have been amended in 1982 or 1983.  That is the only reason it is enshined in the Bill. It is tidy.  It makes it easy for people outside this House &mdash; lawyers are the people who will be involved &mdash; to make decisions or to advise on this.  Any change in that Act will not affect what we are doing here.  What is indicated clearly is the Act as passed in 1981.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that the Labour Party or the Liberal Party in England had in their election manifesto for the last general election there that they wished to have the British Nationality Act changed, I am glad the Minister has cleared that up, that his opinion is that if it is changed in Britain it will not effect the extension of the right to vote to British citizens living here which would then be extended under an Act which had become obsolete.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If that becomes obsolete, if there is a change or whatever, one would have to look at that, but the Deputy is aware as a parliamentarian that Acts are not normally scrapped or made obsolete; they can be incorporated, amended or changed.  We used this terminology to tie it down to the Act that was passed in 1981 so that if there is any reference back to who might be entitled, this would be done only with regard to that Act that was passed.  If the Liberal and Labour Parties are returned to power and amend the Act or change it substantially we will still refer back to the Act that <Col N="1316" /> was passed in 1981.  As far as we are concerned that Act will be within the Bill we are talking about.  We are using it only as a reference.  That is all.  That is the best way to describe this.  If we did not do that then we would have the problem if Acts were being changed on a regular basis of trying to follow up which Act we are talking about and whether we are talking about this amendment or that amendment. We are sewing this up tightly and solidly and saying that it was passed in 1981 regarding the British citizen and nothing else, and what the UK Government have done after that does not affect our attitude towards this legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister will accept that in dealing with Britain which considers itself a member of a commonwealth of nations, the question of British citizenship could cover a wide variety of nationalities and persons from different countries of the globe.

Perhaps he would also give the House the departmental estimate of the number of citizens over the age of 18 years from each of the members states of the EC so that we would know, roughly speaking, the number of non-citizens to whom we were intending to extend voting rights in general elections.</P>

      <P>The position with regard to UK nationals living here is complex. Much confusion arises from attempting to compare figures.  The labour force survey covers British nationals without defining that term and it is probably reasonable to assume that many people might regard themselves as Brittish national by reason of having been born in Britain, even though as children of Irish parents they qualify for Irish citizenship. The census figure is an authorative figure for the number of people born in Britain but it does not suggest that these people are British citizens.  Having regard to the fact that almost 105,000 of these recorded in 1981 as having been born in Britain were under the age of 19, it can be safely assumed that the vast majority of them are the children of Irish parents who came back to this country and who would normally be entitled to vote.  I stress that this is an estimate but it is reasonably authoritative, based on the numbers entered in the European Assembly electorate and making allowance for non-Britons.  We are talking about approximately 12,000 British citizens becoming entitled to vote, though there might be references to much higher figures.  It is quite reasonable to assume that some of these people who were born in Britain would be of Irish parentage and would be entitled to vote in their own <Col N="1318" /> right.  We are talking about an additional figure in the order of 12,000.</P>

      <P>I am not saying the Deputy's information is wrong.  Based on the register of electors for the European elections, the figure is 14,000.  We estimate that of that 14,000, 12,000 are UK citizens and the other 2,000 belong to member states.  That is the best estimate we can give.  We are talking about people who would want to vote and they had the right to register as electors for the European elections.  They were not deprived of the right to vote in those elections and the number of people who chose to register amounts to 14,000.  No doubt a number of people did not register but we are talking about people who want to <Col N="1319" /> vote and who had the opportunity to do so as citizens of member states.  That was made clear at the European elections.</P>

      <P>It is important that we know what we are doing when we are possibly extending the vote to people from other countries.  I do not accept that this is the most accurate way to assess the numbers.  The Minister will agree that there would be a much greater interest in a general elections here as compared with a European election.  The reply to my parliamentary question gave the number of aliens over the age of 16 years registered here and the figures were as follows: Belgium, 179; Denmark, 172; France, 1,209; the Federal Republic of Germany, 2,027; Greece, 37; Italy, 1,187; Luxembourg, 5; Netherlands, 1,166; Portugal, 72; and Spain, 1,323. There is quite a big population from Spain residing here.  It is quite a significant figure and could form the basis for a quota for election to this House if they were all residing in the one area.</P>

      <P>This section simply enables the District Court clerk to issue a summons for the examination of a debtor's means.  It does nothing to update District Court procedures or to strengthen the law on debt collection.

    <P>Subsection 1 (a) refers to a &ldquo;competent&rdquo; court.  I understand what the reference means but it is a further example of the legal jargon used in the preparation of legislation which makes it difficult to understand.  The ordinary individual should be able to understand the Bill.  I know it is a small point but why use the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo;?  When is a court not competent?  If the court was not competent in the first instance it would not have granted a judgement or decree.  I know that &ldquo;competent&rdquo; in this case relates to the jurisdiction of the court but no court would give judgement in relation to a decree or any other order unless it was qualified and competent to do so.  This section seems to put the onus on the court clerk to interpret within the meaning of the Act of competency of the court.  I suggest that the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; should be removed from the Bill because it creates confusion.  I should like the Minister to accept that it is unnecessary to have it included.  I agree that the point <Col N="1322" /> I have raised is a small and technical one but it is no harm to have it clarified.</P>

Section 1 replaces section 15 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, to the extent that it is considered necessary to implement the recommendations of the District Court Rules Committee whose view it is that the procedure under section 15 as it stands takes up a large amount of court time and that a simplified procedure of the kind now being proposed is warranted. The change proposed by Deputy Hyland does not have anything to do with the main purpose of the section which is to implement the recommendations of the rules committee.  The need for the change is not appearent and I do not think the need has been clearly demonstrated by the Deputy.  The better course is not to make what appear to be unnecessary changes, bearing in mind that the word in question has survived in the law for the past 60 years and has not to my knowledge presented any difficulty.</P>
      <P>Section 21 (1) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, provides a registering authority which shall obey the order of a court of competent jurisdiction in relation to land.  To remove &ldquo;competent&rdquo; here could bring into question its use in other provisions.  What we are saying here is that we are making a particular change and that we should continue with the phraseology that has been in the law since the 1926 Act.  In section 15 (2) and (6) of the 1926 Act the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; appears in relation to a court.  We are continuing with the phrase that has always been in use and within that framework we are making the changes recommended by the District Court Rules Committee.</P>

      <P>While I accept what the Minister has said, I hold the view that the fact that the word has existed in law over a long number of years does not take from our right to question its relevance in regard to legislation.  I do not think any court would become involved in the administration of law if it did not have <Col N="1323" /> the competency to do so.  To use the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; seems to imply that some courts are not competent.  In what type of situation would a court not be competent? As a newcomer to dealing with legislation I want to understand the implications of all provisions.  The use of the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; needs clarification.  It almost automatically implies that there were circumstances where courts would not be competent.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to parliamentary draftsmen that it is this type of confusing phraseology used in almost every piece of legislation which is difficult for a lay person to understand.  The law is supposed to be drafted in such a way that it can be understood by ordinary individuals but I have not seen any evidence of that and if I had any influence I would like to change it.  I take it, following the Minister's reply, we will continue to use the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo;.  I hope that at some time in the future we will eliminate that phrase.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

Under the proposed new District Court Rules, civil proceedings will be instituted by issue of a civil summons and not, as at present, by a civil process. Upon service of the summons the debtor is being required to lodge a statement of means.  That is the new subsection (1) (c).  The statement of means shall be in a form required by rules of court &mdash; subsection (3) &mdash; and be lodged not less than one week before the sitting of the District Court at which the examination is to take place &mdash; subsection (4).  That is the same period of time as that within which the <Col N="1325" /> debtor must lodge the statement of means under section 15 (1) as it stands. The reference to summons, and the process of using a summons, is intentional in the drafting and will become the practice when the new court rules are implemented.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 18 to 25, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the judgement order or decree of the court which is to be enforced;</P>
      <P>(b) a statutory declaration setting out the amount outstanding at the date of examination if it is at variance with the amount in the order, decree, or judgement;</P>
      <P>(c) evidence that the debtor is ordinarily resident in the district court district in which the examination is taking place.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>Subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>The statement of means shall be in a form required by the rules of court and shall specify the assets and liabilities of the debtor, his income earned and unearned, the means by which it is earned or the source from which it is derived, and the persons for whose support he is legally and morally liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to explain the words &ldquo;legally or morally liable&rdquo;.  In an issue of enforcement should the court be asked to determine the morality of supporting a relative?  For example, a man of means may be morally liable to <Col N="1327" /> support an aged relative but my understanding is that at present the courts have no jurisdiction to enforce a moral duty to support that relative.  Why then give the debtor the right to claim he has the moral duty to support such a person in order to reduce the amount of money he will have to pay to the creditor?  A contrary argument is that a debtor may not be legally liable to support a son or daughter over the age of 21 years and attending university, although there may be a moral duty on him to do so.  We should amend the section to read &ldquo;for whose support he is legally liable and any other party actually supported by the debtor&rdquo;.  By accepting this amendment the Minister would strengthen the Bill and eliminate the legal weakness of the words &ldquo;morally liable&rdquo; because, as I have already pointed out, the court does not have jurisdiction to enforce moral liability.  A debtor could come into court and claim he was morally liable to support a relative and by getting away with this he could gain an unfair advantage over the creditor.  My amendment would protect the interests of the creditor who finds it very difficult to collect a debt, even through the courts.  I am endeavouring to close the loopholes which enable a debtor to find a way out so that he will not have to meet his debts. If a person is not legally bound and the court does not have the jurisdiction to impose a moral responsibility, I do not see why the debtor should be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Hyland's amendment.  I understood this Bill was being brought in as a reforming measure to cut down the delays on the payment of debts and debt collections. Under this legislation the District Court clerk would issue the examination order rather than the district justice.  If this terminology is used the delays which are supposed to be eliminated by this Bill will be created once again when a person is called to give evidence as to his means. It will have to be proved that the debtor is morally liable to support an illegitimate child or other dependant when an assessment is made so that he can pay off his <Col N="1328" /> debt.  This proof will have to be given so that the person involved will not get away with paying only a few pounds a week. Unless this amendment is accepted the aim of this Bill, which is to cut down on delays, will not be achieved.  If this amendment is accepted the person will have to state exactly what his outgoings and commitments are and give proof of his legal liability in relation to other debts.  In many cases a debtor may own many people and often has been in court six or eight times in one year, especially when his business has just gone bust.  If these changes are not made the practical result will be longer delays.  This amendment has merit.</P>
      <P>As a legal practitioner my main preoccupation is to ensure that whatever legislation we pass will eliminate any undue delays.  The present terminology will ensure that there will be even greater delays in ensuring that the creditor gets his money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the law as it stands, there are provisions for disclosure of a debtor's means and liabilities.  The consequences of non-disclosure are contained in sections 15, 16 and 17 of the Act of 1926.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of that Act provides for production by a creditor of <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the debt and of certain other matters and for lodgment by the debtor of a statement of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the examination of the debtor as to his means, including the adducing of evidence as to means <Col N="1332" /> over and above the statement of means, for the giving of evidence by the debtor and for his cross-examination and for the penalties for lodging a false statement of means.</P>
    <P>Section 17 sets out the consequences that may follow any failure on the part of the debtor to disclose his means.</P>
    <P>Only two changes of substance are being made in these provisions.  The first is the proposed new subsection (2) of section 15 which proposes that a creditor seeking the issue of an examination summons shall lodge with the District Court clerk concerned a statutory declaration as to the debt that is due and the place of residence of the debtor.  This new requirement of a statutory declaration is in lieu of the <i>prima facie</i> evidence of these matters that under section 15 of the 1926 Act as it stands is given at the preliminary court hearing.  We are dispensing with one court hearing.  A <i>prima facie</i> case was required previously at the preliminary court hearing before the order was obtained to move to the examination at the second court hearing.</P>
    <P>Now the function of the first court hearing is being transferred to the District Court clerk who is providing for a statutory declaration at that point of the proceedings.  Then the matter goes to the court, there being only one court hearing.  This is the advantage of the section, in effect.  One can see the advantages for example, where a District Court meets only once a month and there could be quite a delay between two court hearings. This is designed to ensure that only bona fide applications are made and that solid grounds exist for requiring an alleged debtor to lodge a statement of means and to attend for examination.</P>
    <P>The second change which is being made is in the proposed new subsection (6) of section 15.  This proposes that at the examination as to means the creditor, besides producing evidence that the debtor resides in the District Court area concerned, shall also produce, first of all, evidence of the original debt that is due in accordance with the relevant court decree and, secondly, a certificate as to the amount of the debt still outstanding. <Col N="1333" /> This certificate is to be the form required by the rules of court.  The change that is proposed is a clarifying provision.  In the first place, it makes it clear that the evidence of the debt that is due and that is already required under section 15, as it stands, of the 1926 Act has and may have two components; the amount of the original sum for which a decree was granted and the amount currently outstanding after taking account of any repayments already made by the debtor and interest due.</P>
    <P>In the second place it proposes to enable that net amount owing to be stated clearly and concisely by being set out in a certificate whose form will fall to be settled by the rules of court.  This is designed to simplify and to speed up matters for the parties concerned and the courts.  What we are talking about is evidence to satisfy the court that the debt exists.  Normally that would be the court order or a copy of it if the original was not available.  Deputy Hyland's amendment would not admit a copy.  The amendment is unnecessary and it could cause difficulty. It is not acceptable.  It is quite clear that the court would not proceed with the matter unless satisfactory evidence were adduced to prove the debt in the face of any denials that might be made by the debtor.</P>
    <P>The amendment would also replace the certificate I have mentioned by a statutory declaration and that change would be unnecessary and undesirable.  It would give evidence when the court is examining the debtor and if the creditor has made a misstatement that can be established quickly.  It would be undesirable in that the creditor is already required to lodge one statutory declaration under the proposed new subsection (2) of section 15.  The amendment would put him to unnecessary trouble and expense and he would have a second statutory declaration.</P>
    <P>Under the proposal in the Bill he simply completes a certificate in a settled form.  There is no reasonable ground for arguing that he could get away with a <Col N="1334" /> misstatement in that certificate.  Subsection (1) of section 1 proposes to substitute a new section for section 15 of the enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926.  It will have seven subsections.  All these proposed new subsections are in section 1 (1).</P>
    <P>We are trying to simplify the proceeding. My objection to the amendment is that it would make it more complex and would not achieve what we are trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of simplifying the procedures but I am somewhat unhappy about the section as it stands. An important element of the proof is the amount of debt outstanding at the date of examination.  I should have thought that would fall to be a matter requiring to be proved to the court by sworn evidence in one form or another.  As the section stands, all that is required is a certificate.  It does not say in the section who is to give the certificate: I suppose any bookkeeper in the creditor's office might give it.  As we know, a certificate is not evidence, it is not a sworn statement.</P>
      <P>The matter of having an instalment order made that could lead to the imprisonment of a debtor is a serious matter.  It should fall to a creditor to be in a position to give sworn testimony to the court as to what credits, if any, the debtor may have made between the date of the original judgement decree and the date of the examination hearing.  I do not think that a certificate as such is sufficient. The creditor should be sent to recheck his books very carefully, he should be able to swear by evidence in court that the net amount due is £X and that all credits or payments the debtor has made in the meantime have been fully credited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certificate is a much lighter statement. Why should there not be the proof of sworn testimony?  Merely to hand in a written certificate setting out the amount due does not make a person amenable to the perjury laws.  It might lead a creditor to be sloppy in his bookkeeping arrangements and not to check on matters.  He may take the attitude that all he has to <Col N="1335" /> do is to give a signed certificate, that he will not have to give sworn testimony.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland's amendment attempts to tackle that in some way by providing that the matter be dealt with by statutory declaration which is a sworn document. That would be some improvement.  However, I should have thought it might be better dealt with by the creditor's witness who has to be in court in any event because under subsection (6) (a) he has to give evidence of the original debt.  I assume that would be done by evidence in the witness box.  As the creditor's witness will be in the witness box giving evidence as to the original debt, why should he not at the same time proceed to give evidence of any credits that have been made in the meantime to show what is the net amount?  Why is he required only to give evidence of the original debt?  Why does he get away with giving evidence regarding credits made in the meantime simply by handing in a certificate that may be signed by a book-keeper in the creditor's office who may not even be in court at that time?  If the debtor who is in court wants to query that amount he will not have anyone to cross-examine regarding credits made.  An argument may develop regarding credits the debtor may have made but no witness will be available to cross-examine in connection with the matter.  Normally all these things have to be proved.  I find it difficult to understand why he is let away with handing in a certificate.  It is not often that matters of evidence are dealt with by way of certificate.  They are dealt with by sworn testimony preferably or perhaps by statutory declaration.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are implementing the recommendations of the District Court Rules Committee.  The second change proposed in the new subsection (6) of section 15 is the one we are talking about now.  It proposes that at the examination as to means the creditor besides producing evidence that the debtor resides in the District Court area concerned shall also produce two things. First, he shall produce evidence of the <Col N="1336" /> original debt due in accordance with the relevant court decree and also a certificate as to the amount of debt still outstanding. This certificate is to be in a form required by the rules of court.  Both sides can do what Deputy Taylor has suggested. Both the debtor and the creditor can, if they wish, give evidence against one another and the court will find in the matter.  That is under section 16 of the 1926 Act.  That process of giving evidence under oath in cross-examination is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to cross-examine someone who has not given evidence. The proof that is required here of credits that have been made by the debtor is not dealt with by way of evidence or witness but by handing in a certificate. One cannot cross-examine a certificate.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the creditor is required to give sworn testimony of the amount of the original debt on the decree.  One would have thought that was something that would have proved itself because one just hands in the actual judgment or the court order and that states the amount. If anything did not need to be proved perhaps that was it.  I should have thought it was far more important for evidence to be given in open court as to the payments made by the debtor subsequent to the date of the court decree up to the time of the examination order hearing.  If things were the other way around it would have made more sense because the court order has on it, the amount of the decree.  It speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But a more nebulous and doubtful feature is the question of what payment the debtor has made subsequently.  This is very important because as a result of the hearing the court will make an instalment order directing that the debtor pay so much per week or per month or that in the event of his failure to comply with the order he will be liable to be sent to prison.  Therefore, it is very important that the provision in this regard is correct. I would have thought that sworn testimony should be required to enable the debtor, if he disputes the order, to cross-examine but in that situation there would <Col N="1337" /> be no one for him to cross-examine because all the person in the witness box is there for is to produce evidence of the original debt.  He simply hands in the court order and that order may have been made two years earlier.  He would not have evidence of any payment made in the intervening period so there would be no point in examining him in that regard.</P>
    <P>In some cases such a witness may know coincidentally of any such payment that that is a different level because when subsequently we go on to deal with the question of credit we find that it is dealt with by way of certificate.  The answer of the witness would be in relation to the question of credit.  He will be there only to offer proof by way of a certificate and that certificate may have been prepared by a bookkeeper in head office. Obviously, a certificate cannot be cross-examined so how, then, would the matter be dealt with?  I am not satisfied that the person in the witness box or someone acting on his behalf, the bookkeeper perhaps, giving evidence of the original debt should not also give evidence of any credit made subsequently rather than to proceed to reply instead on a certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>That part of my amendment which requires a statutory declaration would at least be an improvement on the existing situation.  The Deputy has pointed out the reasons for that being an improvement and I am asking the Minister to consider seriously accepting the amendment.  I do not see how it can be at variance in any way with what he is trying to do in this section.</P>
      <P>The requirement of a statutory declaration would be a progression in that regard.  I do not understand the argument the Minister is making against the amendment. It is an argument that does not stand up to any kind of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor talks about oral evidence but the problem with a statutory declaration is that if one were to state in court in that manner what payments are up to the date of the court there would be the requirement that the statutory declaration would have to be on <Col N="1338" /> that date.  One can visualise the practical problems involved in that requirement. One would have to find a peace commissioner to witness the statutory declaration and there would be no point in having the declaration made the previous day because the defending solicitor could say that the debtor had paid a certain sum of money on the morning of the court. The safeguard in so far as oral evidence is concerned is that the debtor would make it his business to be in court and if a defendant had paid contributions since the making of the order he should have proof to that effect.  Therefore, oral evidence is not the problem.  There should be provision for oral evidence at all times. The Minister has said that there will be oral evidence in the new set-up but, as has been pointed out, the certificate will show the up to date amount and there will be no means of cross-examining in that respect unless the creditor could be called.</P>
      <P>The problem in this whole area of debt collection relates to the collecting of money.  It is not a problem of oral evidence or of preventing delays by providing that instead of a person having to go to court and give evidence a couple of minutes could be saved by the procedure of handing in a certificate.  Oral evidence is essential to have matters right.  The certificate would cause problems on a practical level but neither do I consider the statutory declaration to be a solution because it will have to be made on the date of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The District Court Rules Committee are reasonably competent people who understand the difficulties of the District Court and who make certain recommendations accordingly.  The argument here is based on a misunderstanding because there is nothing to prevent a court from looking behind a certificate.  The court does not have to accept the certificate as the final statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider this amendment to be necessary because both parties can give evidence in court.  The court will be examining the debtor and can establish <Col N="1339" /> very quickly whether a creditor has made a misstatement.  Inasmuch as the creditor is being required already to launch one statutory declaration in accordance with subsection (2) of section 50, the amendment would be undesirable.  It would give rise to unnecessary trouble and expense. There is the practical point also referred to by Deputy Cowen, that the declaration would probably have to be made on the day of the sitting because otherwise the court could not deal with evidence as to a further payment having been made between the time of the signing of the declaration and the court sitting.</P>
    <P>We yet have to settle in final form the certificate that would be required by the rules of court.  We must think in terms of making statutory changes which would enable the new rules of court to be promulgated. In the book containing the rules of court there will be many facsimile forms which will be reproduced subsequently. One can anticipate that the form will provide for itemisation of payments made against the original sum decreed but there is nothing to say that the certificate is final whereas section 16 of the 1926 Act provides for examination and cross-examination and the giving of further evidence.</P>
    <P>I consider the situation to be met by the initial statutory declaration as to the amount of the debt together with the certificate system, the power of the court under the 1926 Act to look behind the certificate, to hear oral evidence and to cross-examine.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Cowen.  One of the major difficulties in this general area is the matter of the collection of the debt.  That aspect must be considered but the purpose of what we are doing here is to meet the statutory changes recommended by the Rules of Court Committee which are necessary before the new District Court rules can be promulgated.  The District Court rules are what are significant rather than what we have here, which is a series of minor changes to make it statutorily possible to promulgate the new rules.  There is no big deal involved in this instance.  It will <Col N="1340" /> mean one sitting of the District Court on the issue rather than two, but the provisions of the 1926 Act remain the same.  There will be provision for oral evidence and for cross-examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has had the advantage of reading the new District Court rules but I presume no other Member of the House has had that advantage.  Can the Minister tell me whether the District Court rules provide for the eventualities that have been outlined in regard to this aspect of the amendment?  Can he assure the House that the new District Court rules provide adequately for what I am endeavouring to bring about by way of this amendment? If the Minister can give that assurance I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment but I consider the inclusion of the statutory declaration to be necessary.  It would strengthen the section.  The Minister referred at length to the new District Court rules.  It may well be that whatever is contained in those rules adequately caters for what I am endeavouring to do by way of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see anything in the new draft District Court rules that could possibly cover this point; it just could not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refers to the District Court Rules Committee and says they made certain recommendations.  That is no doubt true.  Obviously this House must look at any recommendations made by them.  I do not want to say a word about that committee.  I am sure they are a fine body of men and women.  But, if one were to look at who they represent in courts &mdash; as between whether they represent creditors or debtors &mdash; I would have no hesitation in putting forward the suggestion, if it was looked at &mdash; in so far as they represent either at all, that is &mdash; that they represent creditors and not debtors.  The simple reason is that debtors are not represented in these courts except on a very rare occasion when they are so low down on the finance scale that they find themselves in that court, and the last thing they can afford to do is to find any <Col N="1341" /> lawyer to represent them.  Therefore, it is the creditors who are represented, the creditors and their legal representatives who are on the District Court Rules Committee. Understandably enough, they seek to streamline the procedure, quicken it up and expedite it.  That is a worth-while excercise and I would support it provided the necessary safeguards are there from the debtor's point of view.</P>
    <P>That is perhaps where the position of this House may diverge just a bit from the position of the District Court Rules Committee.  When you come into a court of law and oral evidence is being given it is rare, if ever, that courts are prepared to accept, or are ever required by statute to accept, crucial and important matters of evidence otherwise than by sworn testimony of one form or another, either by sworn testimony in court or by a sworn statutory declaration.  I agree with Deputy Cowen.  He is absolutely right about the statutory declaration.  While certainly it would be an improvement on the position as is on the certificate, it would present certain practical difficulties to have the thing sworn on an up to date basis.  But for the life of me I cannot see why it is necessary to give a concession to a creditor who is coming into court to seek his money, to prove his case the same as any plaintiff does, why it should be necessary for the House to bend over backwards to say that, on a crucial matter of evidence, a creditor should not be required to give his evidence in the normal way by sworn testimony but that he should be given the very rate and unusual privilege of proving a matter simply by a certificate from his book-keeper.</P>
    <P>The reason witnesses coming into court are required to take the oath is that they should realise that this is an important and serious matter.  Obviously people will not devote the same care and attention to a mere signed certificate as they would to something on which they have to take the oath.  That is the whole purpose of the oath.  Creditors and their bookkeepers who deal with these things may be inclined to be much more casual, and not as careful to search for credits that a <Col N="1342" /> debtor may have made if all they are required to do is give a certificate.</P>
    <P>I do not see why they should have that concession.  It is not even as though it would place any extra or undue burden on the creditor.  He has to be in court. His oral testimony is required anyway.  It is not as though one is pulling him out of his office for this purpose.  He has got to be there because he has to give the evidence so far as the original order is concerned anyway.  Why then can he not deal with the two items of necessary evidence while he is in the witness box, the first being the amount of the original debt and the second as to whether or not he has received any payments from that debtor in the intervening period?  Why is he to be excused that normal liability? No doubt it would be a great convenience put forward by the District Court rules Committee but it is not good enough and I have reservations about it.</P>
    <P>Very often, in many of these hire purchase companies&mdash;and let us face it, the overwhelming bulk of cases involved in these enforcement procedures are hire purchase companies &mdash; the way they work is that there are massive small payments, credits, interest to be recorded.  It is quite complex for accounts, even in respect of things like television sets and the like.  Very often payments are sent in, are mislaid, are not entered and so on.  In all of these matters the debtor is at a grave disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the creditor.  He does not have a bookkeeper; he does not have computers.  It is a rate debtor who keeps an absolute record of what payment he sent in, when he was charged, and all the rest of it.  He relies entirely on the bookkeeping procedures of the creditor and the hire purchase companies. In the overwhelming majority of cases they are honest people; I have no doubt that they are.  But there are cases where, with the best will in the world, these things go astray.  I have come across cases of it myself.</P>
    <P>Why should the creditor be relieved of the obligation to go through his books with that higher degree of care that would warrant somebody taking a sworn statement that that was the correct net <Col N="1343" /> amount?  Letting them away with simply giving a casual, signed, certificate I fear would give rise to a much more casual situation.  It could well be in many cases that, as a result of that, a credit that a debtor would be entitled to may not be given to him and in effect he may end up paying the same amount twice.  Even under the existing procedure that happens. The existing procedure &mdash; and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &mdash; means that when these examination orders and this hearing comes on I do not think there is anything about a certificate; that is new.  The position is that the same creditor or his witness, normally his bookkeeper, proves the amount of the original debt and also gives sworn testimoney to the court of what credits, if any, have been paid by the debtor in the meantime.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with that?  Why is it necessary to relieve him of the burden of providing that normal sworn testimony and let him away with a privilege?  It is a privilege that is not accorded under any other circumstance I can think of.  I do not see why this should be singled out for that benefit here.  This creditor and debtor position is a very one-sided one. Debtors who appear in that court are in a very low position financially and otherwise; otherwise they would not be there. They do not have the benefit of legal advice and assistance.  The ins and outs and practicality of it are that a certificate given by some bookkeeper back in the office will just be handed in and that will be the amount that will go into the instalment order.  I must say that does concern me to some extent.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As far as the District Court rules are concerned, they are not yet in final form.  This Bill will enable them to be put into final form. Many of the appendices at the end give facsimiles of forms which will be used in different proceedings.  One of those forms will be the certificate about which we are talking here.  No decision on the final form of that has yet been made, but <Col N="1344" /> I would be surprised if it did not itemise the payments to be made.  The protection for everybody involved is not so much in the District Court rules or in the form of the certificate but in section 16 of the Act of 1926 which is not being changed; it will remain the same.  On the examination of the debtor, as to his means, pursuant to an examination order, the statement of means lodged by the debtor shall be received in evidence and there can be cross-examination.  Therefore, all parties can be cross-examined.</P>
      <P>There is no question of a certificate being presented, that being the end of the matter.  The certificate itemises certain situations but the court can look behind the certificate which is challengable in oral evidence.  It does not disadvantage anybody.  But if the certificate is agreed initially, obviously it helps in the proceedings because there is then a written statement and, if both sides agree, that is it, that is the amount paid.  They were the instalments.  One has taken another step down the road and then one proceeds to the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that one can go behind the certificate but the fact is as has been outlined by Deputy Taylor.  These people walk into court, stand at the back of the court until their name is called and they are not going to question anything because they do not know what is going on.  This will not make it more simple. The creditor will have his solicitor, his bookkeeper or whoever is going to give the evidence.  He will be able to put the accused in the box and cross-examine him about how much he is getting, how much his milk is costing and so on.  The creditor will go through the whole procedure and sit down, but the accused will not go through the procedures at all.  The defendant, while he technically and legally can go behind the certificate, will not do so, because he is in a totally disadvantaged position.  After his cross-examination he will only get out as quickly as he can.  That is the point being made.  What the Minister says is correct on paper, but <Col N="1345" /> this legislation does not take into account the fact that one person may be disadvantaged. If we had free civil legal aid so that people could be represented in these situations I would be prepared to let the issue go and work itself out, but the defendants in these cases are not legally represented so that it is not fair to both sides.  Only the statement of means lodged by the debtor will be thrashed out, but the certificate about what is owing will not be thrashed out.  Previously where the debtor has not been legally represented the debtor was safeguarded by reason of the essential proofs which the creditor had to give to satisfy the justice as to the amount paid.  It was part of the essential proofs that oral evidence was given under oath.  If the Minister can assure me that, regardless of the certificate being handed in, the essential proofs will still have to be given, I am prepared to accept that.</P>

      <P>This would require some adjustment surely because under this the certificate is all that is required to prove the credits.  That is what subsection (6) (a) says.  In this connection I would draw attention to the disparity between the treatment of the debtor and the creditor so far as the statements are concerned. The debtor is badly done by here when one compares his position with the position of the creditor.  The debtor in a statement of his means and of his position must file in court his liabilities, income and so on not less than one week before the sitting of the District Court, whereas the creditor need only submit a statement <Col N="1346" /> of the balance due on the day the court sits.  The creditor has an opportunity to check up on the debtor's statement before the court sitting, but the debtor does not have an opportunity to check the creditor's certificate.  The practicality is that the debtor would not even see the certificate in court.  The witness just passes it up to the judge who certifies that £X are due.</P>
      <P>If we are going to leave the Bill like this &mdash; although I am not happy with it and would ask the Minister to look at it on Report Stage &mdash; the least we should have is similarity of treatment for the creditor and the debtor.  The creditor should have to supply to the court his certificate of the credits not less than one week in advance and he should be required to show on it the original amount, every debit and credit and the final balance, so that at least the debtor would have an opportunity to get that in advance so as to verify if all his payments appear on it.  For the creditor to just show a certificate with a balance of the sum owed in the court on the day the court is sitting is of no help to the debtor.  Why should he be treated differently to the creditor, who after all is in the stronger position?  Would the Minister agree to consider that on Report Stage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened attentively to Deputy Taylor and Deputy Cowen, who both have vast experience in court. Deputy Taylor outlined the very classic and common example of the person brought before the court by a hire purchase company who simply appears in court because he has been summonsed. Because of his position he is very vulnerable and in a much weaker position in court than the creditor.  Legislation should be weighed in favour of the weaker and more vulnerable people.  We should endeavour to protect people who are less articulate and less qualified to represent their case in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the contributions of both Deputy Taylor and Deputy Cowen I am not satisfied with the legislation as it stands.  I do not want to press this amendment just for the sake of pressing <Col N="1347" /> an amendment, and I would be happy to concede the amendment if the Minister met Deputy Taylor's request to defer further consideration of the section until Report Stage so that in the final analysis the section would adequately cater for and protect the vulnerable individuals. While my amendment may not cover every aspect of the case made by both Deputy Taylor and Deputy Cowen, it is still an improvement and it strengthens the position of the debtor coming into court at least to the extent that it requires the more powerful creditor to make a statutory declaration in relation to the extent of the debt owed him.  So that we will end up with a Bill which comes as close as possible to achieving what the Minister wishes to achieve, I hope the Minister will agree to Deputy Taylor's request and defer further consideration of the section until Report Stage.</P>

Obviously a creditor who is not getting what is owed to him is the injured party. It is not necessarily the person from whom the creditor is trying to get the money owed to him.  Why should all the sympathy lie with the debtor?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make a couple of comments on the section generally.  I must say that I have long been of the opinion that the whole concept of imprisonment for civil debt really should be written out of our legal system altogether. It has been there for a very long time, going back to Victorian times when people were imprisoned indefinitely for civil debt.  It is widespread enough now, and I will be happier in this Bill if we see that whole imprisonement procedure for a completely non-criminal matter dispensed with entirely.  Our prisons are overcrowded and cannot accommodate even serious criminals, who are being turned out, yet we find many people serving terms of imprisonment for the simple reason that they cannot manage their financial affairs &mdash; a serious matter, no doubt, but certainly not a criminal one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sorts of remedies are open to creditors to enable them to get their money, <Col N="1350" /> apart from using this procedure.  As the Minister points out, while one can have some sympathy for a creditor who cannot get his money back, creditors who go into this line of business, hire purchase and so on, who are those mostly involved, know their business and whom they are taking on.  They know the risks they run, whom they lend their money to and how sound the people are, and they take their chances on that.  In this day and age other remedies should be sufficient for a creditor to get his money back without lodging in prison a person who has committed no crime.  The section talks about statements of means and lodging statements of means.  It is difficult to know exactly how to put this, but I will put it as follows. A very substantial proportion of those people in that court who get a summons setting out a good deal of verbiage, included in which is a requirement to lodge a statement of means, assets, liabiliies and so on, have not the remotest idea of what the whole thing is about. They have not got a clue.  Maybe they should have, and it is unfortunate that they have not; but I am talking about facts, and it is a fact.  We as TDs and public representatives meeting these people in their troubles on occasion know perfectly well that, if you were to ask them what is in this document that they got and what they are being called on to do, they have not an idea of what it is all about and the whole thing mystifies them utterly.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of it is that, very sensibly, a standard practice has developed in the District Court dealing with these enforcment proceedings that if any person comes into that court and explains to the justice that he or she is unemployed and in receipt of social welfare and produces his or her unemployment card, the justice will not make an order for weekly payments against that person that could lead to imprisonment.  However, the fact is that, although that is the established practice, people do not know that, and many unemployed people who get these examination orders do not know that if they go along to the court and explain to the justice that they are unemployed and <Col N="1351" /> on social welfare or assistance and produce their card, no order will be made against them.  In very many cases they do not go to the court at all, orders are made against them and they are arrested and put in prison.</P>
    <P>That is not imagination; it is fact.  I was consulted some time ago about one person in that situation who was in Mountjoy prison who should not have been there at all but who through sheer ignorance found himself there.  I had to go through quite a complicated procedure through the Minister's Department and to his officials, whom I must say I found most helpful in every possible way on that occasion.  It involved no small deal of negotiations and travel back and forth and out to Mountjoy prison before it was possible to get that person released.  It was not done easily.  The procedure was quite complex.</P>
    <P>In trying to be constructive on this point and to save unfortunate people in that situation from the fate of finding themselves in Mountjoy prison, I put forward the suggestion that when these forms are made up a note in large capitals should be put on them to the effect: &ldquo;Particularly note, if you are on social welfare or unemployed it is vital that you go to the court and explain this situation to the district justice and if you do so no order will be made against you&rdquo;.  That at least would have the merit of drawing to their attention what their rights are in this connection, and a valuable contribution would be made here to a situation which results in many unfortunate people, who just do not know their rights and find themselves on social assistance unable to meet orders which have been made by the court.  I ask the Minister to liaise with the rules committee to try to arrange for some statement to that effect to be put on the forms sent out to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been stated on Second Stage that there should be some method other than imprisonment for dealing with non-payment of debts.  The point was made by Deputy Shatter and others on Second Stage when talking <Col N="1352" /> about something akin to an attachment of earnings order in maintenance proceedings where payments are deducted at source.  Obviously, the cases that Deputy Taylor spoke about would not be included in that, but there should be some provision to deal with people who have money and are simply not paying their debts &mdash; in many cases because they know there is no room in prison for them to be sent there.  They know they will not go to prison.  A garda might call and see if he intended to pay but it is a very lackadaisical process.  A lot of paper work must be done in order to get the necessary proof. The collection of the debt is what concerns me.  Although it is not strictly relevant to this section, I would point out that the sanction is not only outdated but impracticable because people who are imprisoned cannot be kept there and must be let out in many instances.  There are many other criminals who should be put into prison apart from those who cannot pay a debt of £200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point about the certificate, I have checked the section again and I still fail to see its relevance.  I have been assured by the Minister that the essential proofs will still have to be given by the creditor in the event of there not being agreement between the creditor and the debtor as to the amount due.  It is stated that the creditor shall produce at the examination evidence of the original debt due and a certificate in a form required by rules of the court setting out the amount outstanding at the date of the certificate. A certificate acquired a week before the holding of the court case would be totally irrelevant as proof of debt and the amount due on the date of the hearing. The oral evidence which must be given by the creditor relates to proof of the original debt and proof of the up-to-date amount due, if there were payments subsequent to the issuing of the decree.  I fail to see the relevance of a certificate, particularly since the section states that the certificate refers only to the amount due at the date of the certificate.  I cannot see the relevance of producing such a document in court on the day of the hearing. Essential, proofs must be made <Col N="1353" /> before the instalment order will be issued.  Perhaps the Minister will convince me as to the necessity for this certificate, apart from the fact that the District Court Rules Committee recommended it.  That is the only reason I have heard for the provision.</P>

      <P>On section 2 (2), I would ask the Minister and the House to give some thought to the provision for distress in the case of the body corporate as referred to in this section.  We have seen far too many examples where the body corporate is no more than a front for one man, perhaps a sole trader, and in many cases the company is simply a shell.  That protection is being used against the enforcement of the provisions in this Bill. Should the courts be allowed under this legislation to lift the veil of incorporation? Perhaps some provision should be made whereby a more detailed examination? Perhaps some provision should be made whereby a more detailed examination could be made of people who are putting forward their case under this section.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will look at what the Deputy has said.  Subsection (2) confines the levying of distress in criminal cases to cases of non-payment of penalties imposed on the body corporate. The law as it stands in section 22 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851 provides for the levy of distress in every case of non-payment in the case of an offence within the scope of the section and links the levying of imprisonment for non-payment with the levy of distress.  These provisions relating to distress are being replaced by narrower proposals in subsection (2).  These narrower provisions originate in a proposal made by the District Court Rules Committee in connection with the proposed new rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> They commend themselves in as much as the levy of distress is an antiquated, wasteful and largely ineffective method of enforcing payment.  However, in the case of a body corporate it may be regarded as preferable to a provision for the imprisonment of a particular officer or officers of the body corporate.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`the Act of 1927' means the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927;&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is necessary because the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927 is now being referred to and the proposed amendments to subsection (5) and (11) of section 4.  Regarding amendments Nos. 15 and 18, section 4 (5) (d) and section 4(11)(c) of the Bill refer to cases where any changes are proposed in the nature of the licence including the insertion of a condition or in the conditions attaching to the licence.  Representations have been received from the Vintners' Federation of Ireland to the effect that this provision is too general in nature and that in view particularly of the penalty for the submission of false or misleading information to the commissioners provided in subsection (3) and associated possible forfeiture of the licence provided in subsection (4), the particular cases where there are changes in the nature and conditions of the licence should be spelled out.  It appears that the District Court has no general jurisdiction to insert conditions on the renewal of licences. This arises only in the circumstances <Col N="1355" /> referred to in section 8 and 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1957, which apply where the applicant for renewal desires to insert a Sunday closing condition or an early closing condition.  So far as changes in the nature of the licence are concerned what were in mind here were cases such as the following: A. Grant of new licence for adjoining premises (section 6 of the Licensing Act, 1902 as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, section 24); B. Grant a full licence for premises having a restricted licence provided for in section 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960; C. Grant of a new off-licence in lieu of an on-licence in a county borough (Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, section 62 as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1943, section 18).</P>
    <P>It appears that in all these cases what the applicant seeks is a new licence and not a renewal of an existing licence as referred to in section 4(2).  Accordingly it is appropriate to omit the reference to changes proposed in the nature of the licence since in all such cases a new licence is being sought.  Section 4 of the Bill which refers to the renewal of the licence will not apply.  On reconsideration, therefore, it is considered that a provision as in the amendment submitted referring only to the insertion of conditions in accordance with section 8 and 9 of the 1927 Act would suffice.  It is narrowing the scope of it on the submission of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and meeting a point raised by them.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 6, lines 8 to 12, to delete <Col N="1356" /> subsection (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Subject to subsection (5) of this section, where a renewal is required of a licence for premises which have been licensed in the immediately preceding year, it shall not be necessary to produce a certificate of the District Court to an officer of the Revenue Commissioners empowered to grant a renewal of such a licence.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate Deputy Hyland and Deputy Cowen objected to the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 4(2).  They advanced the view that the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; conferred a discretion on the Revenue Commissioners as to whether to renew a liquor licence.  I said that this subsection removes one of the conditions for the renewal of the liquor licence and that the provision does not give a new discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  Under existing law, they will be required to renew licences where the relevant conditions are fulfilled.  I indicated, however, that I would have another look at the wording in the Provision. An amendment in the name of Deputy Hyland has been received and it proposes that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in subsection (2) be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I am not accepting that amendment but I am moving to bring about the change by the amendment I am now proposing to clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>A depution from the Vintners' Federation of Ireland was received earlier in the month and they pressed very strongly for the replacement of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which, they feared, would give a discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  I should like to refer briefly to the legal background.  The governing statutory provision is section 1 of the Licensing (Ireland) Act, 1833, as amended in part in 1943.  It provides as follows:</P>
    <P>It shall and may be lawful for the proper officers of excise in Ireland to grant to the same persons at and for the same houses as shall have been licensed in the year immediately preceding &mdash; upon the production of a <Col N="1357" /> certificate signed by six householders of the parish &mdash; a licence or licences for the sale of beer, cider and spirits without requiring the production of any certificate or other authority from any justice or justices of the peace, magistrate or other person or persons whatever.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 11 of the Spirits (Ireland) Act, 1854, was that the certificate required by the officers of excise, before renewing the licence, is a certificate of the District Court.  The Bill &mdash; section 6 and the Second Schedule &mdash; proposes that section 11 of the 1854 Act be repealed.</P>
    <P>In the application of Doreen Reardon in the High Court in 1980, Mr. Justice Finlay in his judgment approved the statement of Holmes, J. in <i>Murphy v. Cork J.J (1895)</i> in which he stated that the issue of the licence is merely a ministerial act which the proper officer is obliged to do upon receiving the certificate of the justices and being tendered the amount of the duty.  This will remain the law when the proposal in the present Bill in section 4 is enacted.  As far as substituting the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is concerned, it will be noted that the effect of this would be to require an officer of the Revenue Commissioners to renew the licence on application, even if the requisite duty had not been paid.</P>
    <P>This matter was again discussed with the draftsman and an officer of the Attorney General's office.  It was suggested that some other form of drafting for subsection (2) could be adopted which would meet the point and allay the fears expressed by the Opposition and by the Vintners' Federation.  The revised form of subsection (2), which was agreed at this discussion, confines the subsection to a statement that a District Court certificate will not be required in connection with the renewal of a liquor licence by the Revenue Commissioners.  This form of wording will not be open to the interpretation that any new discretion is being given to the Revenue Commissioners. Therefore, I do not accept that replacing &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would <Col N="1358" /> improve the situation because it would put an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to issue a licence even if the requisite fee had not been paid.</P>
    <P>I accept that Members were genuinely afraid that a new discretion was being given to the Revenue Commissioners and that members of the Vintners' Federation had the same fear.  In this amendment, I am proposing that the subsection should be redrafted and, subject to subsection (5) of the section, where a renewal is required of a licence for a premises which had been licensed in the immediate preceding year, it shall not be necessary to produce a certificate of the District Court to an officer of the Revenue Commissioners empowered to grant a renewal of such a licence.  Under existing law, the Revenue Commissioners will issue the licence and we are removing the prerequisite that a certificate of the District Court should be advanced to the Revenue Commissioners.  That meets the point and clarifies the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment removes the fears which were expressed on this side of the House that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would give some kind of discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Licensed Vintners' Federation were also fearful in this regard and, to the extent that that anomaly has been removed, I am satisfied that my amendment is no longer relevant in that context.  However, subject to further clarification from the Minister, I am concerned about the almost automatic renewal of intoxicating liquor licences by the Revenue Commissioners without the production of a certificate because the opportunity provided to the public to raise objections in relation to the renewal of intoxicating liquor licences would no longer apply.  We all know that excessive use and abuse of alcohol is one of our major problems and we are aware that some licensed premises are not run in accordance with the standards laid down by law.  While I accept that the vast majority of public houses are run in a very excellent manner and in accordance with the law, there are isolated cases <Col N="1359" /> which do not comply.  I am afraid that the entitlement to automatic renewal of licences suggested by the Minister will take away the opportunity from the public to voice their disapproval, as they can do at present, at the annual licensing courts.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed new amendment, it will be possible for somebody who had a licence in 1985 automatically to renew it in 1986 without the production of a certificate.  That amendment will relate not only to the normal family run public house but to the many other social clubs and hotels in areas where extensions of licences are granted.  I have very serious reservations about any flexibility in the licensing laws which would lead to the automatic renewal of licences.  Many licence holders accepted the annual certificate granted to them as an endorsement of their character and ability to run a good house, as they say in the trade. More important, an automatic renewal takes from the legitimate right of interested parties to express a view in regard to a licensed premises or the proprietor.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the concern being expressed by community leaders, teachers, the clergy of various denominations and the Garda about the increased level of alcoholism among students.  The House should give serious thought to the degree of flexibility being given by the Minister to licensed vintners as a body in regard to the renewal of annual licences.  How will the public be made aware of the renewal date?  What opportunity will they be given to raise an objection?  Under the old system the date of the annual licensing court was published in local newspapers and those interested were afforded an opportunity of expressing a point of view in regard to renewals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, under the amendment the renewal of licences will not be publicised and, therefore, interested parties will not be afforded an opportunity to raise an objection.  This is not the time to take away from the public the right to raise an objection in regard to a licensed premises.  Many genuine licensees <Col N="1360" /> would be pleased to have to go to the court to obtain an annual certificate of credibility in regard to their ability to manage a licensed premises.  In some instances licensees might welcome an opportunity to object to the renewal of a licence if a premises was not being run in accordance with the law of the land.  I hope the Minister can satisfy me that the liberalising of the renewal procedure will not mean that the public will not be made aware when a renewal is taking place. That is an important consideration.  No matter how much we want to meet the wishes of licensed vintners &mdash; I would go as far down that road as possible &mdash; we should ensure that the procedure is such that premises will be run in accordance with the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment which meets our objection to the original wording.  In spite of the fact that it was being claimed that it was an enabling section it gave the impression that extra discretionary powers were being given to the Revenue Commissioners. That afforded us an opportunity to express the view that perhaps the Revenue Commissioners have more than enough power in many areas and that we should not be giving them more powers in an area where they had no reason to be involved.  The Bill takes away the necessity for a publican to get a certificate of competence from the District Court in that he can now automatically apply to the Revenue Commissioners for the renewal of his licence.  As far as allaying public concern about disreputable people getting involved in the licensing trade it must be pointed out that the Garda superintendent is the person who will raise an objection, if one is to be raised. I understand that such a written objection must be lodged ten days before the date of the court hearing.  If the superintendent overlooks it any member of the public can raise an oral objection at the annual licensing court which will then be adjourned so that the licence can answer charges made against him at a future court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that the public will have an <Col N="1361" /> opportunity to make an oral objection on the date of the court and that objections will not be restricted to written ones.</P>
    <P>In practice, there will not be much benefit from the change because it did not take a lot of time to deal with applications at the annual licensing court.  There was no objection to 99 per cent of applications. However, the fact that the public were aware that a certificate was being granted by a district justice at the annual licensing court helped to allay public concern that there was any chance that a person who was running a bad house would have his licence renewed.  I accept that there are reasons why district justices should not be required to go through the same number of applicants because in most cases there will not be any objection to the renewal but I suggest that there should be a requirement that a District Court clerk publish a notice in the local newspaper giving the date of the annual licensing court and inviting those with objections to annual renewals to attend the court or, alternatively, present a written objection within the prescribed time. If the District Court will no longer have to deal with a certificate of competence an effort should be made to ensure that the public know what is going on.  I do not believe that is a requirement at the moment, but perhaps the Minister would consider it and ensure that since these cases will not be heard in court in future, at least there will be the same level of public awareness of what is going on, and people will be afforded an opportunity to object to the renewal of the licence if they so wish.</P>

What is involved is the removal of some of the work done in the District Court which is considered to be unnecessary and simply wasting the time of the courts.  The certificate provided by the District Court is no longer required in cases where there is no objection but the right of objection will remain and a court certificate will still be required in the cases referred to in subsection (5).  I can give Deputy Hyland an assurance <Col N="1362" /> that there is no diminution or dilution of existing controls.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cowen said, the local superintendent is usually the watchdog of the community and he will be aware of the situation.  In practice what will happen is that an objection in court will be an objection to the granting of a certificate by the Revenue Commissioners and the gap will be bridged by court rules to allow for communication between the two.  Subsection (5) says: &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, a licence shall not be renewable on expiry without the production of a certificate of the District Court for the District Court area within which the premises concerned are situated&rdquo; and then there are four situations set down.  The first is where &ldquo;a notice of objection to such renewal has been lodged with the court within the time prescribed in rules of court&rdquo;.  Subsection (6) tells who can object and reads:</P>
      <P>An objection to the renewal of a licence may be made by any person who, but for the passing of this Act, would have been authorised to object to the grant of a certificate required for the renewal of a licence in respect of the premises; and any such objection shall be deemed to be an objection to the grant of the certificate required by subsection (5) of this section.</P>
      <P>There is no diminution of the controls. The objection can be made direct to the court as at present under subsection (6) an objection to the renewal of the licence will be equivalent to an objection to the court to the grant of a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision as to notices will be continued so that the public will have exactly the same opportunity to object as they have at present.  This matter has been discussed recently with the Vintners' Federation and the provision as to objections has been explained and clarified for them.  As to the publication of notices in the newspapers that the annual licensing court is to take place, this can be considered with the new rules of court.  I think it is a good idea that the public <Col N="1363" /> should be made aware of what is a suitable time of the year to lodge an objection. That is a valid point and the public should be made aware of it.</P>
    <P>The final point raised by Deputy Cowen is also valid.  He talked about a superintendent in court orally objecting on the day, even though there was no written objection prior to the court hearing. The provision allowing for that kind of objection without notice is not being continued because it seldom happened in practice and it was not satisfactory in operation.  It is unfair to the licensee to allow objections without notice on the day of the licensing court.</P>
    <P>Everything else remains.  There is no liberalisation of the licensing laws.  All we are talking about are changes in the arrangements so that court time can be used more effectively.  We can debate how much court time will be spared, and what advantage it is, but there is a general principle that things which it is not necessary to submit to a legal jurisdiction should not be submitted.  We should not clutter up the courts with matters which are not relevant to the courts.  In a majority of cases, there are no objections to the renewal of licences.  This can be done in one step through the Revenue Commissioners, provided all the rights of the citizens under existing law to object are maintained.  They are maintained and Deputies will notice the form of words used in subsection (6).  This says that any person who has the right to object before the Bill is passed into law will have the same rights subsequent to the enactment of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am still not very happy with the new arrangement.  While I fully accept that in bringing in this amendment the Minister met our concern about the discretion given to the Revenue Commissioners, I still hold the view that there is now a level of automatic renewal of intoxicating liquor licences which did not exist before the Minister brought in this amendment.  I hold the view that that is not a good thing either for the citizen or for the licensed trade.</P>

      <P>In the original Bill the application was made to the District Court Clerk who issued a certificate and if there was no objection the licence was renewed by the Revenue Commissioners. There was an in-built county control at local level because there was a forum where objections could be raised.</P>
      <P>This amendment was brought in to meet our request for the removal of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In my view our amendment to substitute the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would have been more acceptable nationally in terms of controlling licensing laws than what the Minister has done in a roundabout way to meet what we asked for.  There was no reason why the Minister could not have accepted our amendment which said that the Revenue Commissioners shall issue a licence on the production of a certificate from the District Court clerk.  That would have been the simple and credible way to do it.  Under the proposed amendment we are losing control &mdash; community leaders, clergy, teachers, and people interested in the welfare of young people are being sidetracked and the opportunity they had up to now of raising objections is being taken from them.</P>

      <P>After last night's debate I was reading through some of the notes and the Minister's speech.  I thought my colleague, Deputy Hyland, spokesman for the Opposition, had made a fair and constructive contribution.  For some reason the Minister took a very aggressive attitude and appeared almost to question the right of that Deputy to raise matters that we consider of fundamental importance.  If the Minister were not tied up in this House and were involved on the election campaign like many of his colleagues, he would find out that only the subject of unemployment would surpass in importance that of crime, lawlessness and vandalism, the state of our prisons, the difficulties of our Garda and some of the old, outmoded ways in which our legal system works.  This is an issue raised in almost every house across the city and equally, I am sure, in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We make no apology for highlighting the seriousness of the situation, because it is the concern of people who are being mugged, robbed, attacked and assaulted. This is not just of importance among the old and middle aged, but among the young people who are prisoners in their <Col N="1366" /> own homes.  The have worries about leaving their cars parked and about attacks on their property.  This leads to great difficulty in obtaining insurance cover. Property is being lost and damaged, including vehicles, factory or company premises and homes.  The Minister appeared to be coolly and calmly telling Deputy Hyland that there was something wrong with raising these issues.  Our attack, if such is the case, on this Minister is because of our belief that it is his policies which are creating these difficulties &mdash;in particular the cut-back in the capital programme for prisons.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons for our putting forward this motion and the first, most important in my view, is that criminals, vandals and thugs and those who contribute to lawlessness and major or minor criminal activity have been very happy in the last few years to take a chance in indulging in such activity because the chance of being put behind bars is very slight.  The facts and statistics to prove that are there.  In 1982, £11 million was spent on the capital programme for prisons.  In 1983, £17.5 million was to be spent, but under the present Minister's leadership only £10 million or slightly more, was spent.  In 1984, £5.5 million was spent.  Where £35 million plus should have been spent on building prisons, less than £16 million was actually spent.</P>
    <P>There is a clear indication that it is the policies pursued by this Minister that have led directly to the situation that in 1983 1,462 prisoners under category B were given full temporary release without probation or welfare officer supervision. That is according to the report issued in 1983, and goodness knows what the 1984 figures will bring.  That is why there is daily crime in this city committed by people who, in the view of the legal profession and Judiciary, should be still behind bars.  The Garda feel that they are in an impossible position and cannot win the battle against crime.  Yet the Minister is of the opinion that Fianna Fáil should not be raising this matter of such fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>The capital programme put forward by Fianna Fáil when they realised that crime <Col N="1367" /> was on the rampage and drug related crime had come to this city as to other western European cities, would have completed Portlaoise prison in 1985 or early 1986 and Clondalkin would have been open since 1983.  Every visiting committee highlighted the fact that there would be a crisis in numbers.  Mountjoy is a prison with accommodation for about 400 prisoners and the Minister of State and the officials of his Department would agree with the experts that that is the number for which it was built, but last night there were 552 prisoners there.  Ten were not sleeping in cells, but on mattresses in various parts of the prison, five more were sleeping in the workshop and a person transfered from Loughan House a week ago was sleeping in some-body's office.  Is that control of the prison system?  Does that not clearly indicate that the Minister and the prison authorities have totally lost control?  This is directly related to the fact that only £16 million instead of £35 million has been spent in the past few years.  Money has been spent on design fees and architect fees, but not on building prisons.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an appalling mess of the whole position.  I have spoken to some young people, the proportion of which is high in my constituency because of the high rate of unemployment and other difficulties, who say that it pays to be involved in crime.  The chances of being caught are very small because of lack of number, resources, vehicles and so on within the Garda and the cutback in overtime facilities.</P>
    <P>Even if these young people are caught and go through the legal system, their chances of being put behind bars are very slight.  There is nowhere to put them, so they are in and out like a shuttle service. There has been an on-going battle since 1982 between the Minister and the Prison Officers' Association, with which I do not want to become involved, with the Minister saying that there are no real problems or difficulties there.  The introduction and appendage to this report clearly set out the difficulties.  It is stated that: there are levels of work and educa <Col N="1368" /> tion for prisoners and these difficulties can at times contribute to heightened levels of tension which can lead to instances of indiscipline by prisoners.  Even those limited educational facilities have now been closed down.</P>
    <P>We can only listen to the people working in the prisons every day.  While senior officials of the Prison Officers' Association say that they will not allow a situation in Irish jails where physical conditions are brought down to a stage where disease could be rampant, where offenders can be the subject of sexual attacks by other inmates and prison officers work daily in the fear and knowledge that they can be seriously injured and maimed because of shortage of staff, this is the reality.  The Minister implied that Deputy Hyland had a cheek to raise these matters, when he, as Minister at the Cabinet table, failed to fight for the allocation which would have given adequate prison accommodation.  This has led to thugs and criminals rampaging about this city.  The Minister has failed badly and should now try to correct this failure before the breakdown in law and order has gone beyond repair.</P>

      <P>It is a good thing for us to debate the position in prisons.  It would be even better if we were to discuss it in committee and have the same input from the Opposition when we are considering these matters there.  With the exception of Deputy Wallace, there are very few ardent speeches made at the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism about the situation generally. The running is left to the chairman of the committee and others.  If we were to condemn anyone, we should condemn Dáil Éireann, not just the Government, because it becomes a very political issue on one side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deterioration did not happen suddenly when we came to power two years ago last November.  The issue is far too serious for people to make political capital out of it, particularly coming towards <Col N="1369" /> the local elections.  If we really want a parliamentary discussion or debate on this subject, we should have a very fruitful debate at the select committee.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of jails or prison facilities generally, we are up against the problem of communities who, in many cases quite rightly but in some cases I think for the wrong reasons, are resisting the provision of prison accommodation within their areas.  In James's Street in my constituency people did not want a custodial centre provided on their doorstep without all kinds of reassurances. I can understand that because in my view the facility was not suitable. However, I was quite prepared to give consideration to it provided adequate steps were taken to meet the fears of local people.  There was hysteria when we tried to provide a women's prison in Kilbarrack and there was further hysteria when that prison was built between Clondalkin and Ballyfermot.  I can understand the feelings of people but if we are to provide prison facilities there has to be an acceptance in the community that they have to be located somewhere.  I do not want to see all of them in the south inner city which has more than its share of problems. Every time a problem arises, whether it be itinerants or some other issue, we look at the same areas.  It is time we started to look at some of the nicer parts of the city and country.  I ask the House to remember the resistance that is put up when there is talk of taking over some old country house for use as an open prison.  It is time that the entire community took a share in providing these facilities.  It is not fair that what might be called anti-social facilities are put into one area.</P>
    <P>As vice-chairman of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, I led a deputation to Spike Island this month.  The impression given is that Spike Island is some kind of haven, a five star hotel, where people have knee deep carpets, colour television sets and videos. Spike Island is a very drab place.  The building has not been decorated, it has not been properly heated and is not properly habitable.  The prisoners are working <Col N="1370" /> to develop it, first, as a prison facility and, secondly, as a facility that can be used by the State when it is returned to the Department of Defence.  The existing facilities do not lend themselves to a top security arrangement.  It is an open prison, but when the Office of Public Works or someone else left two rafts lying around so that prisoners escaped, immediately the whole matter became a political row.  Questions were asked, where was the Minister and what happened on the night in question.  It is time we stopped all this nonsense.  Both the Government and the Opposition have been played along by the Prison Officers' Association, not by the prison officers. Generally, they are doing a good job but their association are making politicians, capital out of everything that happens. They are making fools of the politicians, they have us at one another's throats. We have provided plenty of money and facilities for the prison service, even if those facilities need to be developed.</P>
    <P>The motion, which condemns the Government for their failure to provide adequate and secure prison accommodation, is laughable coming from an Opposition who, in Government, provided 50 per cent less accommodation two years ago.  Let us have a rational and reasonable discussion on what needs to be provided. We need to provide secure prison facilities where people can be detained when the courts, having considered their case under the laws made by this House, so decide.  We do not want a prison system where there is a swinging door policy in operation.  Where a judge appointed by the Government under the Constitution decides that a person should serve a sentence that should be done. The case formerly was that such people could not be kept in prison because there was no accommodation for them.  That happened for many a day when the Opposition were in Government.  The Minister has made efforts to come to terms with the problem and he has provided a 50 per cent increase in the number of spaces available for direction.  Whereas none of us like to see that the figures of detainees have increased, we should be able to <Col N="1371" /> boast that as a State we are capable of containing any persons whom the courts decide should be contained.  We have made much progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>I regret that in making that progress the availability of certain educational facilities has been interfered with.  They have not been removed.  On our visit to Cork prison we found that some of the area used for educational purposes was not available because it was being used for prisoner occupation but we were told it would be replaced within a fortnight.  I hope that has been done.  I hope that the Minister when concluding can give an assurance that educational facilities have now been restored to prisoners.</P>
    <P>With regard to available space for real offenders, the State would benefit greatly if it ceased to act as a banker of last resort for all kinds of financial institutions. These bodies give money to individuals some of whom are not in a position to make repayments and then the financial institution asks the State to lock up these people until they make their repayments. That kind of contract between a financial institution and an individual is a private civil matter.  I see no reason why the State should lock up individuals because they fail to make repayments on their television sets.  The Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism visited Mountjoy, Cork prison and Spike Island&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In some cases hardened prisoners were sharing dormitory type accommodation with people who were in prison because they could not repay their loans.  There should be changes in legislation to enable these people to be dealt with in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the role of the vocational education committee in the prison service. They are doing a very good job in difficult circumstances.  Some people in the community who are under pressure and whose children are under pressure in school resent the provision of facilities for prisoners.  We must ask ourselves if <Col N="1372" /> we are happy with the level of recidivism in our prisons.  Are we happy to maintain the level of services provided in the prisons? People ask why their children should be less well off than are prisoners whom they claim are living in luxury, have five meals a day and are kept warm. That sort of emotional outcry is understandable at times especially when people are being offended against and are being attacked but as a Parliament we have a duty to consider calmly our objective in incarcerating people in the first place. That objective should be to rehabilitate them but we must agree that the prison service has failed as a rehabilitative process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the prison inquiry committee under the distinguished chairmanship of Dr. Whitaker. I trust that the committee will report soon and that their findings will be implemented.  Under successive Ministers and Governments the Department of Justice, perhaps because of their over concern with the matter of secrecy, have not been renowned for implementing reports as those who have read the O Briain Report and some others also will realise.  We must act on the recommendations of the Whitaker Report after those recommendations have been debated by the House because the only way we can serve the community properly is by making the prison service a rehabilitative service so that people leaving prison will be equipped properly to participate in society in a normal way.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that in the process of imprisoning people for crimes they commit against the community they are not only incarcerated but lose much of their individuality and their freedom.  A prisoner is locked in a cell on his own for about 12 hours at a time.  I do not consider that to be the best way to rehabilitate prisoners.  Some of these people may be in prison for up to five years or longer and having been through that ordeal it is difficult to expect them not to have a recidivist attitude after they have been released.  There is something appalling about an individual being locked up for a number of years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> On the question of the public's attitude in regard to prisoners being well looked after.  I would merely make the comment that anyone who visited a prison and who realised the loss to the individual in terms of freedom and of privacy in every sense would not wish to spend any time in prison.  I trust the House will discontinue this business of one side castigating the other in respect of such matters as prison reform so that we may have a reasonable debate on the prison service when the Whitaker Report has been published.</P>

      <P>I am happy to contribute to this debate and to echo the views of Deputy Harney who last night appealed for a non-party political approach to this question.  This all-party approach is necessary, first, because of the seriousness of the situation and, secondly, because as a society we have not addressed fully the question of how criminals should be dealt with.  Millions of pounds are spent every year on the prison service and given the difficulties in the prison service and the fact that there is such a high rate of recidivism we must examine our spending in this area and try to analyse whether there is a better way of detaining people who must be detained.</P>
      <P>It was with a certain degree of cynicism that I read the Opposition motion.  I regard it as being related to the comming local elections.  However, the electorate are not so stupid as to fall for any such tactics.  There is the general conception now that the measures being taken by the Government are having effect.  I cannot speak for the whole country in this matter but there is a very noticeable understanding and a lessening of tension among the public.  They realise that the Minister is taking the measures that are necessary. There is further reason for cynicism in regard to the motion when one considers the efforts made by the Department to purchase further detention centres.  The deputy leader of the Opposition was the first to express horror at this possibility.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Mitchell has said, prison is a grim and sad place.  I should like all Members of the House to spend some time in prison so that they might realise what it involves.  There is a good deal of misinformed comment and also prejudice among the public as to the lifestyle of prisoners.  Prison is not easy. It is a grim and sad reality that so many people have to be imprisoned.</P>
      <P>I am sure the majority of TDs and Senators have visited prisons at some stage.  As a former member of the visiting committee of Mountjoy prison I am familiar with the environment and with the lifestyle of prisoners.  Many years have passed since an ex-Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, said publicly that he was ashamed of conditions in the women's prisons.  At that time he was speaking about Mountjoy in that context. Up to almost recently conditions in that prison were almost as bad as he indicated then.  Only in the past 18 months has any serious work been done to improve these conditions.  I was there recently and I was very pleased and surprised to find that within the past year there has been set up there a new workshop that is bright, cheerful and functional.  The purpose of this project is to occupy women prisoners and the activity there is knitting.  Everybody concerned seemed to be very pleased with the venture and the prisoners found it very useful.  They were happy to participate because there was an end product in sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shares my concern that even when this kind of workshop is fully in operation more needs to be done.  The <Col N="1375" /> living conditions of women in Mountjoy need to be much improved.  There is a scheme in progress which will provide for better facilities for the women prisoners there.  At present the number of women prisoners in Mountjoy is high.  There are 52 women there but this is compared with the male prison population of 1,900. Perhaps that ratio tells us something about men and women.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister gave the reasons for considering the use of the newly built officers' quarters at Portlaoise as a women's prison, having regard to the high cost involved and to the lack of demand in that respect at present.  I have grave reservations about using this accommodation as a women's prison because most of the women prisoners in the Dublin area have difficulty already in regard to visits from husbands and families and particularly from their children. I know that, in an effort to relieve overcrowding in Mountjoy prison &mdash; which must be considerable with the numbers there now &mdash; some women are sent to other prisons like Limerick and to Portlaoise, with its improved living conditions, individual showers and so on which would represent an improvement on the present position.  Certainly I would have grave reservations and would not want that to happen except as a last resort.</P>
    <P>On the question of building a new women's prison at Clondalkin or Kilbarrack I, for one, am glad that no further progress on this building can be made at least until the report of the Committee of Inquiry under the chairmanship of Dr. Whitaker &mdash; to which other speakers have referred&mdash;is forthcoming.  I am particularly glad that the terms of reference of that committee specifically refer to women prisoners.  I and my Department have made a submission to him for his report.  I am particularly concerned about young girls, often addicted to drugs, being sent to prison in the absence of any alternative.  I hope that the Whitaker Committee will be able to suggest some more satisfactory method of copying with these girls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> I do not think that a proposal to build a women's prison at enormous cost, with accommodation for more than twice as many women offenders as we have at present in custody, constitutes a realistic approach to the problem.  I acknowledge that some women may deserve long terms of imprisonment for their activities in drug pushing and other forms of serious crime, that these women need to be kept in secure accommodation.  But most of the women committed to prison at present could be dealt with in some other way.  For that reason I particularly welcome the introduction by the Government of the scheme of community service orders as one alternative to imprisonment. However, I am disappointed that, as yet, the courts have not had recourse to the scheme for women.  I would urge judges and district justices to consider it in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the generally more open approach to prison matters adopted under the present Minister.  I hope that the co-operation apparent with researchers, in particular, will continue and be developed further in the future.  It is through such research only that we will reach a better understanding of crime and its effects on society and, I hope, devise methods more appropriate to the treatment of offenders.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the Seanad about the use of education units at Cork and Arbour Hill prisons to accommodate prisoners I expressed regret at the necessity to use the units for that purpose. Indeed many people felt similarly.  I am glad that arrangements to continue educational services at their previous levels have been made at Arbour Hill and at Cork, and that arrangements are being made to provide a larger unit which will enable education services there to be resumed at previous levels by next term. I understand that plans for the larger unit have been agreed with the city of Cork Vocational Education Committee and that tenders for the work will be sought within the next week or so.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the punishment and rehabilitative functions of imprisonment mentioned by the Minister and other <Col N="1377" /> speakers.  From my experience on the visiting committee I know of the changes that can take place in people while serving sentences.  The parole system, as it has operated under successive Ministers, with people serving long sentences, has been generally satisfactory.  While there can always be criticisms in individual cases I accept that prisoners will be released eventually.  It seems to me be only reasonably that efforts should be encouraged which are aimed at reducing the grudge which ex-prisoners frequently have against society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney last evening drew attention to the instances of men accused of rape being given early release.  One should say here that the suffering and punishment the rapist undergoes is greater than that of other prisoners.  It is a heinous crime and it is perfectly right that there should be severe sentences and that the rapist should be made serve his full time.  But one has to have a fair balance about this, that it should be recognised that he is suffering in prison in a far more severe way.  This is occasioned by the fact that he is isolated.  The crime of rape and child abuse carries a particularly low grade among criminals.  In Mountjoy prison I have seen how rapists at the time I was visiting there &mdash; when there were fewer than there are now; I think at present there are something like 58 serving sentences for rape &mdash; were isolated in the base camp and were not generally in association with other prisoners.  In fact they were at risk which is an undesirable and unhelpful situation.  We must have a compassionate and caring approach to men who obviously need help, rehabilitation and understanding in the same way as do other prisoners.  Even in cases involving the crime of rape there may be circumstances that would justify a programme incorporating release from prison prior to normal release date.  It is important to stress that, in cases such as this, any decision to grant early release is made only after careful review by all the agencies involved with the prisoner.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's amendment.  I would ask that the House realise that by <Col N="1378" /> and large we are talking about a socially disadvantaged group of society.  As the last speaker said, the men and women in our prisons do not come from the more privileged sections of our community.  By and large they are people &mdash; in many cases illiterate, unemployed &mdash; who have greater needs than those of detention and of constantly having the notion put about that if they are put into prison that will solve everything.  It will not.  Our whole approach to crime and vandalism must be broader and available resources must be spent in the future on having greater rehabilitation and undertaking of the difficulties and problems of prisoners.</P>

      <P>I must take issue with the Minister when she said that people will not be fooled by the Fianna Fáil Party putting down a motion on prison accommodation, it being a gimmick for the local elections.  I might inform the Minister of what is being said outside this House, which is that the Government will do anything, find anywhere to put people at present, to lock the whole lot up until after 20 June.  It should be remembered that, because of the unsuitability of the accommodation, many of them will be released again very quickly.  That is what is being said outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lack of prison accommodation now constitutes a major problem in this country, one which we foresaw but which the present Government have failed to appreciate.  Last year there were many disturbances within the prison system, including an attempt in September to take hostages during Mass in the church in Mountjoy prison.  It is only as a result of the publicity given to those incidents and to the general public reaction to the serious crime levels as, for example, in the case of stolen cars and the ramming of Garda vehicles, that the Minister has made any efforts to tackle the accommodation problems.  In my view even those efforts are feeble, pathetic and constitute a belated reaction to the very <Col N="1379" /> serious situation at present confronting society.</P>
    <P>Prisons are being forced to house ever-increasing numbers with deteriorating facilities and ever greater reliance on the use of early releases which, in turn, are said to contribute to the present high crime levels.  Yet the Minister has failed to take any decisive steps to plan for the provision of additional accommodation. All his actions indicate that he is fighting a rearguard action with no idea of his objectives.  The building programmes under way have had to be postponed because of lack of funds.  The prison building capital programme for the past few years clearly shows the attitude of this penny-pinching Government even on issues where the safety and security of our citizens are concerned.  It is incredible to think that this is the approach of a Government, the main party of which, Fine Gael, have long regarded themselves as the law and order party in this country.</P>
    <P>I might devote a few moments to outline the harsh realities of this Government's approach to the provision of urgently needed prison accommodation. In 1982 the actual expenditure thereon amounted to £15 million.  We on this side of the House provided £17.5 million in the 1983 Estimates.  The Coalition Government reduced this provision to £11.5 million and even ended up saving a further £1 million on actual expenditure. It was very clear to all who took even the slightest interest in what was going on that there was a serious problem with the lack of custodial accommodation. Even allowing for the inordinate and inexcusable delays in publishing the annual report on prisons and places of detention, the 1983 report was published only last month, 17 months after the end of the year to which it relates.  The 1982 report stated very clearly that &ldquo;the urgent need for new prison accommodation is clear&rdquo;.  In addition, that report states that &ldquo;it is unsatisfactory that resort must be had to the practice of shedding&rdquo; at a time when almost 1,300 prisoners were shed.  If the Minister suggests that <Col N="1380" /> this was carefully monitored and decided on by all the groups involved, I must disagree.</P>
    <P>Despite all of this, the Coalition provided only £11.5 million for 1984 and, to add insult to injury, proceeded to ensure savings of more than half of this sum.  I fail to understand the Minister's logic at a time when the pressures on accommodation are so obvious and his own Department are projecting a need for over 2,000 places for custodial accommodation by the end of the century.  The Minister is cutting back very severely on the level of expenditure.  Is the Minister aware of what is happening?  I think not.  He together with the rest of his Cabinet colleagues seems to be living in a cloud-cuckoo land which has been created for them by the national handlers.</P>
    <P>The 1985 Estimates include an estimate for £12.5 million for the prison building programme.  Is this going to go the same way as last year's Estimate? Is the Minister playing more to public relations rather than getting down and doing the job for which he is being paid? When are we going to see a real commitment to providing secure accommodation for prisoners in the prison system?</P>
    <P>The Minister makes great play, from time to time, of the number of additional places he has created for prisons since he came into office.  He seems to want to create the impression that these places have appeared as a result of consistent and conscious decisions on his part.  The reality is very different.</P>
    <P>The renovation of Cork prison was undertaken in two stages.  The first stage was completed in 1980 and work commenced on the second stage which was completed in mid 1983.  The new unit in Mountjoy was almost complete before the Minister took up office.  Loughan House which underwent major structural and ancillary work in the late 1970s for young offenders reverted back to the prison service.  None of this was as a result of any commitment by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The absence of planning by this Government is evidenced again in their haphazard approach to the implementation of the Criminal Justice Act.  That</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> Act provides for increased sentences and for consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>If the proposals in the Act are to have any effect in tackling the crime problem. the necessary resources must be provided. The Minister has not given an indication as to how he proposes to provide accommodation to meet this expected increased demand on prison accommodation.  How then are the provisions of that Act to be implemented?  Is this another con job on the public?  When, where or how is the Minister going to make arrangements to ensure that accommodation is available?  We have a crisis and, despite overcrowding and doubling up in prisons, we still have a system of early releases.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Minister realised that the prisons are only a part of the overall criminal justice system.  Any tinkering with one part, whether it be the legislation. Garda or the courts, will have an impact on the prisons.  While there is, legislative backing enabling the Minister to release prisoners before the expiration of their sentences, the widespread use of such a procedure results in a loss of confidence by the public in the whole system.  It also leads to a situation where criminals know they cannot be contained, and they are encouraged to further crime in the absence of adequate prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a notion, which is encouraged in certain quarters, that prisons are like grtade A hotels.  As a member of the Select Committee on Crime Lawlessness and Vandalism, I have visited Mountjoy and Cork Prisons and the new accommodation being provided on Spike Island.  I do not consider that the prisons should be of a grade A hotel standard.  What is required is accommodation which is humane and which respects the dignity of prisoners. While some of the accommodation was of a satisfactory standard, especially in Cork and a part of Mountjoy, other accommodation in Mountjoy, especially the women's prison, was in very poor condition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> Even in accommodation of an acceptable standard, the quality deteriorates rapidly as overcrowding occurs.  There is a serious problem caused by overcrowding where the facilities in the prisons cannot cope with the increased demands. This is particularly so in the case of educational and work opportunities available to prisoners.  In both Cork and Arbour Hill prisons the education units were closed down to provide additional accommodation. While I accept the Minister's statements that these were only short term measures, I am more concerned with the overall level of such services as are normally provided.  During my visits to the prisons one aspect stood out very clearly as demanding attention and that was the extent to which prisoners had nothing to do all day except sit around in the yards.  This is totally unacceptable. Education and work opportunities must be provided within the prison system.  Yet the Minister congratulates himself on a job well done.  Does he not realise the seriousness of the situation or the needs of the prison system?</P>
    <P>When we are talking about pressure on prison accommodation, we must consider the extent to which prison is used as a dumping ground for various categories in society for whom there are no alternatives. For example, the 1983 annual report on prisons and places of detention records 54 males as having been imprisoned for drunkenness.  These people, seven of whom were over sixty years of age, should be given proper medical attention for their problem.  Prison is certainly not the answer.  Could the Minister not look into this and consider pressing his colleagues in Government particularly the Minister for Health to provide alternatives for these people?</P>
    <P>The 1983 annual report also shows that 14 per cent of committals to prisons were in default of fine and a further 6 per cent in default of sureties, debtors and contempt of court cases.  There should be another means of dealing with persons who do not pay fines or who default on loan payments.  It tends to be persons on low incomes who end up in prison.  These people are unlikely to pose any real threat <Col N="1383" /> to society.  The Minister should investigate the possibility of extending the Community Services Act to cover these types of cases.  Using prison space, at costs of £447 per week per prisoner, is clearly a waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>It appears that the new Wheatfield complex, in addition to providing accommodation for juveniles, is also to provide accommodation for 144 women and that plans for this prison are at an advanced stage and tenders can be invited.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that there is a need for such a large women's prison? The daily average population in the women's prison was 40 in 1983.  Although this prison has been advanced as a women's prison I am sure that it is males who will end up being catered for there.</P>
    <P>There is little that can be said about Spike Island that has not already been stated in one form or another.  As it stands at present, it seems to be sufficient to say that it is easier to get out of it than it is to get in.  I agree that Spike Island should be developed as a secure prison.  The Minister has a responsibility to ensure that there is proper security for the prisoners on the island and for the families who live there.  They have lived there all their lives and they are entitled to live in comfort without having to live in fear of escaped prisoners.</P>
    <P>I note in the 1983 prisons report that 55 per cent of adults sentenced to imprisonment had previously served a prison sentence and that 146 prisoners had been in over 20 times.  This may have a number of connotations, but that is not clear from the report which gives no indication of the reasons for such previous imprisonment.  It seems that prison is not acting as a deterrent for a large proportion of the prison population.  If prisons were provided with education and work opportunities prisoners might be more likely to go straight on release.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I call on the Minister to proceed urgently with the provision of additional prison accommodation and places of detention for juveniles particularly in the Munster area.  It seems that <Col N="1384" /> The State spent about £12 million on various fees in connection with these projects. We want money spent on prison accommodation, not fees.  The Minister should examine the need to imprison certain categories of offenders, those I have mentioned.  Defaulters in payment of debts and so on are taking up prison space while serious criminals are still out on the streets.  The Minister would do a service to us all by looking at this area.</P>

      <P>On 15 March 1985 the Minister for Justice announced that the Naval Service at Spike Island were to vacate the island and hand it over to the Department of Justice to provide extra accommodation for offenders.  He said that no decision has been taken as to the number or type of prisoners who were to be detained on Spike Island, but it was planned that selected prisoners would be transferred there.  It is well known that Fort Mitchel, which is on Spike Island, is not suitable for the holding of prisoners, but the hype that was presented to the public gave the impression that Spike Island was Ireland's Alcatraz.  These press releases were for public consumption. On a number of previous occasions Spike Island had been inspected and considered as a prison but it was rejected on each occasion.  Not more than ten days before it was opened those who inspected it advised against its use as a prison.  One must ask then why the Minister went ahead with this project against all the advice that had been given to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for his action was that the Government were coming under severe pressure due to a breakdown in law and order throughout the country precipitated by the astronomical rise in unemployment as a result of the Government's total lack of ability to control or reduce the worsening economic situation.  In conjunction with other factors the worsening unemployment <Col N="1385" /> situation drove many people outside the bounds of the law and continues to do so. An out had to be found to take the heat off the Government, and presto, like the rabbit out of a magician's hat, some back-room public relations handler came up with a bright idea: &ldquo;Let us turn Spike Island into a prison&rdquo;.  The public relations boys got into full swing.  This was to be the solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service were told to move out and they were not too happy to do so.  In went the repair men, but what did they work on?  They did not work on fortifying Fort Mitchel to make it a secure detention centre.  No, they worked on the dormitories, Kitchens, and central heating. They worked to make the place habitable and, of coures, that raised the question of what kind of conditions our Navy were living in prior to this.  That question has not been answered but the country was shocked to hear that the Naval Service, our young men who are working on our behalf, were living in conditions that were not suitable for other people.  This downright disgrace should have been brought to light before.</P>
      <P>A number of families are living on the island, and despite their fears, no notice was taken of their protestations about the dangers that would lie in store for them. These are families of serving servicemen and they were treated shabbily.  The speed with which the whole operation was carried out left these families with no alternative but to continue living on the island, and no protection whatsoever was afforded to them.  They were left in total darkness about what was to happen and, up to the moment of the Naval Service moving out, they were not told what was happening on the island.  This rash decision took them utterly by surprise and left them in great fear.  They have been almost cut off from the mainland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previously a considerable number of crossings between the mainland and the island took place each day, but the number of crossings was reduced suddenly to four per day.  Previous to the change in conditions a telephone was available to the servicemen and through them to their families.  They could contact <Col N="1386" /> doctors and so on.  That was taken out of their reach.  Citizens whose husbands are servicemen were treated in a most despicable manner.  The families complained and expressed their fears that a breakout might occur, but they were consoled by the Minister who stated that they were in as much danger from the prisoners as they would be from shipwrecked sailors. This derisory attitude or remark was most unbecoming to a Minister of this State, revealing him as most insensitive to families comprised mainly of young married people with young children.  Of the 12 or 15 children of those families only one is of schoolgoing age.  Therefore, the worry of those parents can be understood readily.</P>
    <P>The fears of the inhabitants regarding the possibility of a breakout were confirmed at the end of April when three prisoners staged an ill-fated escape attempt which went unreported in the papers, but on 21 May an escape was made by six prisoners who got off the island successfully and, but for the vigilance of a member of the public who spotted them and informed the Garda, they would have got clear away.  A number of other attempts have been reported since then but none of them has been successful. Still the families living on the island are worried about the possibility that at any time some prisoner, selected I presume because he was of good repute and would not attempt to escape, would make such an attempt.  The selection process must have fallen down when many of these prisoners got away.</P>
    <P>The prison staff, not of their own making, were too thin on the ground to control the prison effectively.  This implies that the decision to open the island as a prison was a rushed decision taken rashly without proper planning, a decision designed to take the heat off the Government and to con the public into a false sense of security.  It was a deliberate public relations splash to create the impression that everything in the law and order field was sound and under control. If the Government wish to make Spike Island a really worth-while prison it will cost up to £50 million.  I wonder if the <Col N="1387" /> Minister has the guts or the willingness to go ahead with it.  Extra gardaí have to take up duty each night to protect citizens living on the island and during the longer winter nights more gardaí will be required there.  The cost will be greater than estimated. It can only be concluded that the whole episode relating to Spike Island was a shoddy affair, a downright disgrace. It was an insult to the inhabitants of the island and the surrounding mainland, as well as to the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>Whilst there are 1,936 prisoners accommodated in prisons throughout the country there are some criminals abroad who should be behind bars.  During the past year or so two elderly and defenceless neighbours of mine were brutally murdered in their homes.  The perpetrators of these crimes are known and cases have been prepared against them but they are still walking the streets.  If these cases are not quickly brought to court there is a danger that some of the main witnesses may be dead.  The Minister must look seriously at this aspect.  It is time that justice is served on the felons who killed these two defenceless old people.  The Minister would be better employed in pursuing those cases than having his handlers arrange public relations exercises. He must ensure that the prisons are safe and capable of keeping prisoners under control.</P>
    <P>Our motion calls on the Dáil to condemn the Government for their failure to provide adequate and secure prison accommodation to meet present needs. It is a factual statement of the situation on the ground.  Anyone who has even the flimsiest knowledge of the conditions prevailing in our jails cannot but support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L. T. Cosgrave Mr. L. T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved last night by the Minister for Justice and reject the simplistic motion put forward by the main Opposition party.  We are all aware of the serious crime situation and the accommodation difficulties which have <Col N="1388" /> grown up over a number of years.  I would emphatically state that recent Government decisions will ensure that some of the people who have been part of the serious crime wave will be kept in custody.  It was not necessarily deprivation which caused gangs of people to go around the west beating up and robbing old people.  Neither is deprivation the cause of housebreaking or the driving of cars by young and not so young people on the wrong side of dual carriageways. We cannot accept the simplistic solution that all this is due to deprivation.  We are all aware of our economic and social problems but we cannot accept that all the people who have committed these crimes have been deprived.  Often very wealthy people are behind some of these crimes.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made in relation to providing the necessary accommodation and taking off our streets people who have committed vicious crimes against the person and putting them behind bars where they belong.  There may have been a perception in the past that because of lack of adequate accommodation there was a shedding policy and people who had been convicted were not serving their sentences.  We can see clearly by the Minister's actions and Government decisions that great efforts are being made to provide adequate accommodation, using every square inch of ground to incarcerate people on Spike Island.  The Opposition, if I remember correctly, were fully supportive of this decision.  The building there will not be converted overnight but much work has been carried out.  I visited it about a month ago and I can state categorically that it will not be a holiday camp full of video machines.  Prisoners' rights should include certain basic educational facilities and I would hope that teachers who do so much good work will be given every facility which resources allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hope that the committee on prisons will report as quickly as possible. It is important that we do not make prisons into holiday camps.  There has to be a certain toughness about prison.  A prisoner loses his freedom and has to <Col N="1389" /> obey a code of discipline which will ensure that he will not readily want to go back.  During recent months people have been serving their sentences and in cases of particularly bad crimes I hope they will serve every day of their sentences.  We have seen lately very serious crimes against the person.  I hope we will be totally consistent in our attitude to crime and will not just react to specific situations. Political rhetoric with one eye on the polls is too simplistic an approach from an Opposition who at all times proclaim their sense of responsibility and portray themselves as a possible alternative Government.  They should not try to make political capital out of the provision of adequate prison accommodation.  This is a problem which has not suddenly surfaced; it has been an ongoing problem.</P>
    <P>I met quite a number of prison officers on my recent visit to Spike Island and I pay tribute to the great work they do in a tricky situation.  I hope that their more vocal spokesmen will be responsible for the men under them who at times are at risk.  It is too easy to make cheap political points.  I hope that prison officers and their spokesmen will be responsible. They can readily gain access to the Department of Justice, the Minister and other public representatives if they have various grievances.  They have a difficult job in relation to prisoners but it is better to have offenders behind bars rather than attacking the public and causing further mayhem by breaking into people's homes.  If the courts find them guilty and sentence them they must serve the vast bulk of their sentences, especially those who have committed serious crimes.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that there are delays and that some cases take an inordinate amount of time to be heard.  There are various reasons for this and it can be partly due to the fact that a defendant can often delay proceedings.  If Members know of individual cases which are taking a long time, the Minister will look into them.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the committee's report.  Prisons will always have to be provided for those who commit crimes against society.  Perhaps the community <Col N="1390" /> service scheme will enable those who have not committed serious crimes to further their education and to repay their debt to society by some other means. The Opposition have not made any valid points apart from calling for hundreds of millions of pounds to be spent on prisons and facilities without saying where the money is to come from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Cosgrave's comments and a comment from Deputy Mitchell on the personnel involved in running our prisons.  I also welcome the fact that they paid tribute to them for doing an exceptionally difficult job.  It shows that these Deputies are now trying to distance themselves from the official stance taken by the Minister a couple of months ago when he publicly described prison officers as drunkards, liars, untrustworthy and excitable.  These are the same people about whom Deputy Liam Cosgrave and Deputy Gay Mitchell were talking earlier.  I welcome the change of heart and I hope they will be able to convince the Minister that he should see these people in the same light.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied &mdash; I say this more in sorrow than in anger &mdash; that there is absolutely no doubt that the Minister for Justice is sitting on a time bomb, mostly of his own making, as far as the prison system is concerned.  It is with regret that I say it appears that the prison system is bursting at the seams, barely managing to operate.  It looks as if there will be major upheavals within the system in a very short time.  The Minister for Justice and his predecessor, Deputy Mitchell, failed to convince their colleagues that the prison expansion programme, which was most carefully planned during my time as Minister for Justice, should be financed and followed through.</P>
      <P>The prison development plan was soundly based on the expert advice available to me from senior officials of the Department of Justice.  There was positive proof available then of the urgency of providing additional prison accommodation and there was 100 per cent unanimity in the advice given to me by those most knowledgeable in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> In 1981, a total of 441 prisoners were released before their time because of a shortage of space.  That clearly indicated that a serious problem was developing and that additional prison accommodation would have to be made available. That proved to be true because, in 1983, 1,298 prisoners were released before their time and I understand that, although the figures for 1984 are not yet available, something like 1,500 prisoners were released before their time in 1984.</P>
    <P>The Government in which I served made moneys available for the development of the prison programme in an effort to head off the crisis which has now developed in the prison system and is threatening its continuity.  Lands were purchased for this development within the system at different centres in Cork, Limerick and Clondalkin.  Lands were partly available at Portlaoise at the time for the building of a maximum security prison which would cater for the more dangerous subversive prisoner.  I said &ldquo;partly available&rdquo; and I will come back to that later.</P>
    <P>The Cork development went ahead and new accommodation came on stream around June 1984.  We now have well over 200 prisoners in Cork in dormitory style accommodation.  The Minister has, on numerous occasions, gone out of his way, as have his handlers when briefing the newspapers behind the scene, to suggest that this development got under way since he came to office.  Indeed, the tone of the Minister's amendment clearly indicates that they now believe their own propaganda.  This suggestion is not true. It was under way in June 1982 before he was a Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the additional accommodation in Mountjoy was his brainchild.  Long before he was elected to this Parliament, I approved of the conversion of the old officers' quarters and mess into a small, maximum security unit within the complex to provide specifically for ordinary dangerous criminals who, up to then, had been held in military custody in the Curragh Army Camp, County Kildare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> When this special unit was completed, we were all happy to see the Curragh unit closed.  It served its purpose in the early seventies when Mountjoy was wrecked and when we had nowhere else to send prisoners.  I remember when members of the Minister's party vehemently opposed using the Curragh unit at the time for prisoners even though we had no prison accommodation available as a result of the emergency in Mountjoy.  This was sheer hypocrisy and I am sorry that some of those who contributed to this debate did not have the courtesy to stay to listen to the facts.  They might have learned something because the truth cannot be denied.</P>
    <P>It became apparent in 1978 that Portlaoise prison could not accommodate those sent there for subversive crimes. The Garda were most successful at that time in their efforts against subversives and accommodation was at a premium. We knew, even then, that we could ill afford to specifically designate another one of our prisons for subversives because of the need for accommodation to house ordinary prisoners.</P>
    <P>Eventually, Limerick prison had to be taken out of the ordinary prison system and used for subversive prisoners many of whom had been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment because of the type of crime for which they had been convicted.  Even then we had a crisis on our hands which could only be dealt with by proper long term planning.  It was my responsibility to convince the Government of the day that appropriate finances would have to be made available to pay for the prison expansion programme I got under way.  There has to be, and people must understand this, a lapse of a reasonably long period of time from the planning of a prison to having it available for use by prisoners.  We have made a valiant start on a programme that would now be on-stream if the Coalition Governments, the present one and the Coalition of 1982 which included Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Noonan as Ministers for Justice, had not backed away from financing it.</P>
    <P>I can recall Deputy Mitchell, before he was appointed Minister, as a Fine Gael <Col N="1393" /> member for party and personal reasons giving an assurance in public to his constituents in the Clondalkin-Wheatfield area, that he would kill the prison plan for that area if and when there was a change of Government.  I can recall the aggro that was stirred up in that area by members of the Minister's party for the purpose of gaining petty political advantage at that time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, may also have been guilty of a certain amount of stirring with her pen in the newspaper for which she worked in an effort to cause embarrassment to our Government, to promote herself and her political chances which did not look too good at that time.  Had I more time available I would produce in the House her statements at that time and I am sure she would not be proud of them, but then she is a differently motivated person tonight.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael at every opportunity knocked the prison system we tried to get under way.  I have videos of interviews given and programmes made, which I got from our national broadcasting station, at a time when senior members of Deputy Fennell's party were knocking what we were trying to do.  The propaganda efforts of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to cover up for his own lack of progress on the essential development of the new Portlaoise prison must surely be seen for what they are.  If one reads a report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> by Lorna Reid one will see that the Minister wants the public to learn from him that what happened by way of development in the Portlaoise prison complex has been a mistake.  It has not been a mistake and should not be regarded by anybody as such.  It should not be presented to the public by anybody on behalf of the Minister as a mistake.</P>
    <P>The position in Portlaoise &mdash; this is the truth &mdash; is that the development of the maximum security prison on that complex could only take place by the removal of the old ramshackle prison officers' accommodation.  Those houses had to be taken out of the way to make room for the new maximum security prison.  That was part of the overall plan which went ahead but the Ministers, Deputy Mitchell <Col N="1394" /> and Deputy Noonan, knocked the development of the maximum prison unit which would have been coming on-stream now not alone to relieve the pressure on Limerick prison so that it could be used to accommodate ordinary prisoners but also to permit Portlaoise to accommodate ordinary prisoners.  Up to 500 ordinary prisoners could be accommodated there.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister, or anybody else, to say that the money spent on the development of the site at Portlaoise was not well spent.  It was part of an overall plan.  Last night the Minister said that development could not have been stopped when he took office because it had already started.  What was he doing a few months before that?  Was it Government policy then to totally abandon a project on which public money had been spent by way of planning and designing an essential requirement in the interest of the security of our State, a maximum security prison?  That is what was at stake but short term bad planning and shortsightedness on the part of the Minister, Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Noonan, allowed it to go by default.  I would welcome an opportunity at another time to hear the views of other members of the Coalition parties on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to this has been totally dishonest.  Having read his speech made in the House last night I am amazed at the degree of intolerance he shows.  I am amazed at the arrogance he displayed, that anybody should dare question his decisions or his record.  He may get away with that approach within the confines of the Fine Gael Party rooms, but he will not get away with it here.</P>
    <P>The country is now paying a heavy price for the Government's grave neglect of the prison system since they came into office.  Failure to provide adequate prison accommodation to help cope with a growing crime problem, vandalism and lawlessness has brought the whole system of law and order to the verge of breakdown. The decision to reduce the amount produced for the prison building programme by the Coalition, at a time when a serious <Col N="1395" /> problem had already been identified, was an act of gross irresponsibility.  Not alone did the Minister for Justice fail to recruit the extra gardaí which Fianna Fáil had approved, but the allocation for prison building was drastically reduced in successive years.  Fianna Fáil's allocation for prison building in 1983 was £17.6 million. This was cut to £10.7 million.  Then in 1984 instead of the £11.8 million which the Fine Gael and Labour parties allocated only £5.8 million was spent.  They suggested that we should give them credit for providing additional accommodation but that is a damned untruth that should be put around their necks until such time as they face the facts and tell the truth.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, when spending on prison accommodation has been cut by 70 per cent over two years, that there is now a crisis of overcrowding, of discipline and of security in our prisons, a crisis that spills out into the streets as a result of escapes, early remissions, increased bail, and ineffective non-custodial sentencing in cases where custody is clearly required for the protection of the public?</P>
    <P>The Minister a year ago in his speech to the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on 3 April 1984 stated that what can reasonably be objected to is the early release of prisoners without preparation simply to make room for new committals. But the fact is that Fianna Fáil had set in motion a programme of building to deal with the problem.  In the light of the prison cutbacks which were taking place at the time the Minister's statement was seriously misleading and a cover-up of a grave neglect of his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The early release from Arbour Hill and Shelton Abbey prison after only four years of a group of people convicted of the crime of rape in the Minister's own constituency, while the victim continues to suffer from mental illness, is an indictment of the Minister's administration of the prison system.  There was, we thought, a general consensus two or three years ago that rape was one of the most serious offences and should carry a very heavy sentence.  If the Minister himself <Col N="1396" /> were not sensitive to the matter, then surely the Minister for Women's Affairs, could have drawn his attention to the seriousness of what he was doing.  Her lame duck excuse is totally unacceptable as far as I am concerned.  The Minister of State is great at showing public concern but it backfired on her at Granard, County Longford.  She got her photograph taken holding a little baby in her arms at St. Ita's Hospital.  The Minister missed a great opportunity to stand up for those she defended when it suited her that is, before she came into this House &mdash; rape victims.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister make a grave mistake in viewing the crime problem, like every other problem, as primarily a matter of public relations. If the survey shows that the heightened fears of the public have abated somewhat, then the Government think the problem is solved.  This is the most deplorable way to run a vital Department of State.</P>
    <P>Warnings about the state of the prisons should be heeded and the Minister should restore the funds taken from the prison building and modernisation programme before we find ourselves unable to cope effectively with the deteriorating law and order problem.  The Minister should remember that, as good as his handlers are, he and those who support him should not be taken in by their own propaganda, because that is all it is, a propaganda exercise which has backfired.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, does not recognise that crime is a major issue in the present elections, she is out of touch with reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my gratitude for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment? This debate relates to the threatened job loss of 40 people employed in the sawmilling industry in Mountrath.  Those jobs are being put at risk because of the policies being pursued by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in relation to the tendering system at present in operation under which sawmills purchase their raw materials.</P>
      <P>I do not have to remind the House of the importance of the sawmilling industry to the economy.  Many hundreds of workers are employed in this industry and there are thousands employed directly and indirectly in the forestry industry.  It is extremely important that this House and the Minister responsible for forestry immediately examine the situation in which this industry find itself.  This State industry is supplied with raw material from State forests.  Unless the Minister faces up to his responsibility, unless he reorganises the system in the Department which sell timber to the sawmills and make this industry competitive, thousands of jobs will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the only industry in Mountrath giving employment to approximately 40 workers.  If these workers lose their jobs <Col N="1398" /> there is no other industry to provide alternative employment.  These people have been on short time for six weeks and during that period the Minister had an opportunity to try to reorganise and rationalise the system for making timber available to our sawmills.  It would be better for the Minister to face this task immediately than for the Department of Social Welfare to have to pay social welfare to these 40 workers.</P>
    <P>As was explained at a public meeting last Friday night, these people want to work.  They do not want to go on the dole.  Mountrath sawmills have one of the finest industrial relations records in the country.  There was never a strike in that industry.  It is pathetic that that industry is being forced to close its doors because of the system operated by the Department. There is an immediate need for the Minister and the Government to face up to their obvious responsibilities in this area.  The time has come when we must recognise that there is a great potential for the development of forestry as a basic national industry not only from the point of view of job creation but to ensure that in the long term we make adequate provision for supplying our own timber needs.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems facing the sawmilling industry at present arises from the deteriorating and scaling down of the construction industry.  Fianna Fáil always recognised the value of that industry for the purpose of a job creation.  If you talk to any manager of a sawmill, he will tell you that over the past two years in particular the demand for timber products has seriously declined.  It is very easy to see why this happened, because the level of house building is at an all time low.</P>
    <P>It is sad to say that what is happening in Mountrath will happen in every sawmill in the country unless immediate action is taken.  Mountrath, one of the most efficient sawmills in the country, has been forced to take this action.  We were told that an opportunity would be provided for the people who manage the sale of timber from our forests to face up to their responsibilities.  All the people in <Col N="1399" /> this industry are asking is that they be given the same opportunities that sawmills in Northern Ireland and foreign industries are being given.  That is not an unreasonable request from an old established industry.  It is not an unfair request to ask this Government to recognise the difficulties in which this industry finds itself.</P>
    <P>The time has come to have another look at the situation in relation to forestry development.  For far too long the heavy hand of the Civil Service has inhibited and restricted the development of forestry. It has been governed at Civil Service level by people who are not aware of the problems on the ground.  The sooner we face up to that reality, the better for the country and for the industry generally.  There is no doubt that this most important industry can be developed as one of our greatest, because it is based on one of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>We have always claimed agriculture to be one of our greatest natural resources and there can be no arguing that forestry could also be.  There is no area in which more jobs could be productively created than in the general area of forestry.  Any man or boy employed in planting a tree or harvesting timber from our forests is engaged in gainful and productive employment.  It amazes me that this Government and this Minister have decided to reduce the Estimate for forestry development, to scale down the overall capacity of our forests for employment. They are doing so at a time of the highest unemployment levels ever recorded in the history of the State.  If the Government were even remotely interested in creating productive employment &mdash; and they tend to talk about productive job creation &mdash; surely this is the obvious area in which to engage more people in planting our wasteland and in harvesting, preserving and maintaining our forests.</P>
    <P>Foresters will tell you that at present our young forests are choked and overgrown because of insufficient manpower to keep them clean, yet the Department of Social Welfare on the one hand are <Col N="1400" /> handing out millions of pounds to keep people on the dole and at the same time there is a productive Government Department waiting with hands outstretched to take on additional workers. Why can two Government Departments not put their heads together realistically, with a view to transferring resources from an unproductive area, the Department of Social Welfare, into the productive job creation area, the Department of Forestry? It is a shame on the Department and the Minister for Forestry that this area is not being productively developed in the national interest at present.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up, the same Department are going to allow the sawmills throughout the length and breadth of the country to close down because they are making it impossible for these to purchase the trees planted as an investment by the people. These trees should now be made available at a competitive price to people who are giving employment and these are undoubtedly the people involved in sawmilling.</P>
    <P>I make a final appeal to the Minister to take immediate steps to keep Mountrath Sawmills open &mdash; just one example of the number of sawmills threatened with closure in the immediate months ahead, unless we face up to reality.  I promised Deputy Flanagan the opportunity of saying a few words in this debate because he was present with me at the recent meeting in Mountrath and I do not want to deny him that opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the honour for a long time of representing the county of Laois in this House.  We have had many meetings and discussions in the area of Mountrath, but never in my long experience have I felt such disappointment and anger as on Friday night last when one of the largest public meetings ever held in that district was held in connection with the proposed closure of Mountrath Sawmills.  In that town, 40 people are about to lose their employment and they have at least four dependants each so there are 160 people about to be seriously affected as a result of the proposed closing of one of our most <Col N="1401" /> outstanding and progressive sawmills.  I am told that the price to purchase logs from the Department of Forestry has increased by 40 per cent and the price of the sawn timber is down by 15 per cent to 20 per cent.  If that is the case, no business concern can function effectively, economically or efficiently in that industry.</P>
      <P>Is it a fact that other sawmills in which there are foreign interests obtain certain concessions which are not given to sawmills such as Mountrath?  If this is so, I should like to hear it from the Minister. As Deputy Hyland is aware, I have already made very strong representations within the past 48 hours to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry asking that a deputation of local interests be received as soon as possible, so that there can be a full and frank discussion on this very important matter.</P>
      <P>There is no other industry in the town of Mountrath.  This is a town with large numbers of unemployed.  There is a large young population and the town has made several efforts to direct the attention of the IDA to its industrial needs and requirements, without success.  How can we, as public representatives, stand idly by and remain silent when the only industry is faced with closure and the 40 workers who have been traditionally associated with sawmilling for many long years are thrown on to the unemployment queues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious matter for the town and for the families involved.  I want to make one request, that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism arrange as soon as possible to receive Deputy Hyland and myself who were present on the occasion of the meeting in order to have a very full and frank discussion on the matter.  One matter raised very forcefully by everyone who spoke at the meeting was the decline in the purchase of timber because of the stagnation of the building industry.  If that industry is thriving, there is greater demand for furniture, timber, roofing, flooring, windows and doors.  Because of <Col N="1402" /> the present state of the building industry, it was conveyed to us that the market for timber and timber products has steadily declined.  I respectfully say that if this be so the time has come for a complete review of the whole situation.</P>

      <P>Timber is one of our own natural, native products.

I would ask these two Ministers to get together, certainly within the next six weeks because that period of breathing space has been given to the sawmills.  If there are difficulties, let them remove them; if there are problems which prevent the Department of Forestry from supplying timber at an economic rate, it is more important to have people working and the sawmilling industry thriving than to have books and ledgers being written up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am glad that Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is present at this debate. I beg him to consult with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on this matter and also with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. We want this problem solved immediately.

        <b>(Mr. E. Collins):</b> I should not like to see the question raised by Deputy Hyland <Col N="1403" /> and Deputy Flanagan blown out of proportion. I understand that the mill at Mountrath is to close temporarily for six weeks.  This will mean a temporary lay-off for the 40 workers for that period. I understand and sympathise with the workers concerned but one should understand that of its nature the sawmilling industry is cyclical.  There is a tendency by the Opposition to point a finger at the Government but the company who own the sawmills at Mountrath, Irish Forest Products, have taken a decision to close. It is a private industry and this is one of a number of plants owned by a major business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am presenting the position as it is known to me.  I wish to state quite clearly that since the joint IDA-Forestry and Wildlife Service report in 1981 was published production capacity has expanded.  The supply of saw logs from State forests has increased from 443,000 cubic metres in 1981 to 550,000 cubic metres in 1984.  That is a considerable increase in supply in the industry.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties in the sawmilling industry.  There is a question of over-capacity which has to be dealt with within the industry itself.  I understand the reason for the temporary lay-off is market conditions for the finished products. It is a normal day-to-day decision that has to be taken by the company in the course of their normal management functions.  I am sure they are doing so to ensure the survival and continued prosperity of the company as a whole.  I hope this temporary lay-off will be seen in that light.</P>
      <P>Much publicity has been given to the problems of the sawmilling industry in recent times.  A new strategy for the sector was embarked upon after publication of the report to which I referred.  This involved the upgrading of the sector's ancillary equipment to enable it to produce higher value products aimed particularly at the construction timber market.  At that time Irish timber had only a 10 per cent share of the market which was then estimated at £80 million. I understand the share of the market is 30 per cent now which is a significant improvement and that should be recognised in the House.  It should also be recognised that the IDA have given grants and subsidies to the amount of £5 million to this sector since 1981.</P>

      <P>There is over-capacity in the industry.  Some years ago the Forestry and Wildlife Service introduced a <Col N="1406" /> large saw log qouta scheme whereby those mills best equipped to implement the new strategy would obtain a certain proportion of their timber requirements at a set price and within a specified catchment area.  Despite the new strategy and the quota scheme, there have been many complaints from the industry about price, location and amount of available raw materials.  The closure of a major sawmill in Fermoy, Homegrown Timbers, in late 1983 prompted the Government to set up an interdepartmental committee to examine the effects on the industry and generally of the FWS quota system.  This report indicated a number of areas that required attention and the matters will be discussed at a meeting which the Departments and the State agencies concerned will convene shortly.  It is here the Government will review overall strategy in relation to the industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are some weaknesses. I know there is still a need for tightening up on quality and on marketing and I cannot avoid making this comment in the House.  Much needs to be done by the industrialists themselves. Pointing a finger at the Government is not the answer to the problem.  This is an industry the same as any other in the State.  It has its strengths and its weaknesses and it can survive with good management. The factory we are talking about tonight is part of a very strong group that has a predominant place in our overall industrial strategy.  I am satisfied that group will address themselves to the problems of the company and that the lay-offs will be temporary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the continued killing of Palestinians in refugee camps in Beirut, the Government has made any representations on the matter to the Lebanese Government or any of the other parties involved in the Lebanese situation; if he will particularly appeal to all parties to allow the Red Cross full access to the camps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Lebanon presents a confused and uncertain picture at this time and the recent upsurge in violence throughout the country is a matter of concern.  I am particularly disturbed by the violent clashes in and around the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and by the indiscriminate killings of Palestinians there.  The internal <Col N="1250" /> situation is extremely complex, involving the interaction of the Christian, Moslem and Druze communities as well as confrontations between the militias associated with them.  The continuing presence in Lebanon of several hundred thousand Palestinian refugees and of a number of PLO guerillas is a further complication which is illustrative of the connection between the situation in Lebanon and the wider problems of the Middle East region.  The effect of external influences, notably Lebanon's neighbours Syria and Israel, on the evolution of the internal situation has also to be taken into the reckoning as has indeed the fact that the effective authority of the central government is minimal.</P>
      <P>The major violence in Beirut now arises from the attack by Amal on the Palestinian camps around Beirut. Various appeals for a ceasefire and for access by humanitarian agencies to the camps have been made, including a resolution of the United Nations Security Council, and the Government fully endorse these.  The Government's policy with regard to the evolution of the internal situation in Lebanon is to seek to promote reconciliation and national unity.  It is the view of the Government that this can be most effectively achieved through the co-ordinated efforts of the member states of the Community. Together with our partners in the Ten we have worked towards that end and had been encouraged by some signs of progress, particularly under the national unity government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the recent outbreaks of fighting between the communities can be ended and the search resumed for a just solution to the country's internal problems. Demarches on behalf of the Ten were made in Beirut, both to the Lebanese Government and to the leaders of the various factions involved, in Damascus and to the UN Secretary-General on 14 May urging action to put an end to the fighting.  Ministers of the Ten meeting on 20 May appealed to all parties concerned for a resumption of the dialogue between the various Lebanese groups and the holding of a true national <Col N="1251" /> reconciliation conference.  Demarches have been made by the Ten to follow this up.</P>
    <P>The situation in Lebanon, and especially the plight of the Palestinians, was discussed at the informal ministerial meeting of the Ten on 8-9 June at Stresa at which Ireland was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  At a press conference following that meeting the Presidency unreservedly condemned all acts of violence and particularly the arbitary executions of Palestinian refugees in camps in Beirut, and especially asked that humanitarian organisations be given the necessary means to assist the wounded and to bring help to those in need of it.</P>

      <P>The Government have consistently supported initiatives at the United Nations calling for negotiations on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.  The Government have welcomed the commencement of the negotiations at Geneva between the United States and the Soviet Union, the purpose of which is, as these parties have jointly indicated, &ldquo;to work out effective agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space and terminating it on earth, at limiting and reducing nuclear arms and at strengthening strategic stability&rdquo;.  We believe that a genuine commitment to these goals will require both superpowers to exercise restraint in regard to the further militarisation of outer space.  In particular, the Government consider it important that the provisions of the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty between the US and Soviet Union, which limits the testing and use of missile defences, should be upheld.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The House is well aware of the Government's abhorrence of the system of apartheid and of its opposition to the illegal occupation of Namibia by South Africa.  I have spoken on a number of occasions on the subject of apartheid and have made clear that Government policy is to urge continually the need for peaceful change in South Africa and to support international action to bring this about.  I have also made clear on several occasions the Government's view that South Africa should end its illegal occupation of Namibia and that the basis for a just and lasting settlement there is to be found in resolution 435 of the UN Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government consider that the imposition of effective mandatory sanctions against South Africa is a means of further increasing international pressure on South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies and to this end has supported the idea of the imposition by the UN Security Council of such <Col N="1253" /> sanctions.  In 1984 Ireland co-sponsored a resolution to this effect at the UN General Assembly and has previously co-sponsored resolutions urging the importance of an oil embargo and a ban on new investment in South Africa.  The Government believe that sanctions should be carefully chosen, graduated, properly imposed by the Security Council in accordance with the charter of the United Nations and fully implemented.</P>
    <P>Ireland strictly enforces its international legal obligations under the UN Mandatory Arms Embargo on South Africa, established under Security Council Resolution 418 (1977).  No arms or related material can be exported from Ireland to South Africa and the Government uses its licensing power to ensure that nothing is exported to South Africa which might be considered as suitable for military application.</P>
    <P>The Government are working to achieve the peaceful ending of the system of apartheid in a number of ways.  Internationally we regularly and thoroughly condemn apartheid in international for a such as the UN.  Within the European Community we work with our partners to co-ordinate Ten policy against apartheid. We support, for example, the EC code of conduct for the subsidiaries of EC companies operating in South Africa. This code seeks to alleviate some of the features of apartheid in the work place. Nationally, as a matter of policy, the Government do not encourage trade or economic relations with South Africa. There is no Irish diplomatic representation in South Africa, nor any trade promotion activity there.  No Irish semi-State body maintains offices in South Africa. The Government actively discourage sporting contact with South Africa.  The Government also provide assistance to victims of apartheid on a bilateral basis as well as through the UN.</P>
    <P>The Government will keep under review the various means of increasing pressure on South Africa to abandon the apartheid system and to grant independence to Namibia in accordance with the UN plan.  They do not consider that a unilateral ban on Ireland's trade with <Col N="1254" /> South Africa is appropriate at the present time.  The Government's view remains that, for such pressure to be effective, there should be international agreement on the measures to be taken such as the strengthening of the existing arms embargo, the introduction of an oil embargo and a ban on new investment in South Africa.  The Government will continue to seek international agreement on the adoption of such effective measures.</P>

      <P>The Government are at present formulating their attitude to the French proposals for European collaboration in the field of advanced technologies, the so called EUREKA proposal.  Our initial response has been that we regard the proposals as interesting and significant and as one which seeks to address the challenges presented by the present state of European co-operation and the place of Europe in the world.  We intend to participate in further discussion of it, both bilaterally with France and in the European Community context.</P>
      <P>The French proposals are as yet in general terms only and our assessment of EUREKA as a research co-operation project capable of solving Europe's high technology problems and Ireland's potential role therein is therefore at a preliminary stage.  Many aspects of the proposals need to be clarified and at present the other member states are likewise engaged in similar exercises of analysis and consultation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a question on 16 October 1984 Official Report of 16 October 1984, column 2404), published statistics on the foreign debt are available only on a quarterly basis.  The same applies to statistics on the national debt.  Accordingly the latest available data are in respect of <Col N="1264" /> 31 March 1985, rather than 31 May 1985. It is not possible to estimate the public debt as at 31 December 1985 as this will depend in part on the level of foreign borrowing undertaken in 1985 and on exchange rate movements between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The following is the information requested by the Deputy subject to the modifications I have indicated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The claimant has reported several <Col N="1274" /> losses of her order book.  In July 1984 she reported that she had lost her order book and it appears that orders from that book were cashed subsequent to her reporting its loss.  This matter is currently under investigation.  When inquiries are completed any arrears will be definitively calculated. Deductions will, however, have to be made for supplementary welfare allowance paid to her by the Eastern Health Board and also for the overpayment in respect of the children and it appears at present that there will not be any balance of arrears left for payment to her.  In fact, some adjustment in the rate of payment to her may have to be made in respect of a net overpayment. Full details of the gross arrears and of the offsetting payments will be given to her.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of a contributory old age pension requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 qualifying contributions from 5 January 1953 or year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reaches pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned has a total of only 393 contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 12.  He does not, therefore, qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the legislation a person who has been in receipt of unemployment benefit and who falls ill within three days thereof and claims disability benefit is entitled to payment of the latter benefit from the first day of his incapacity without undergoing any waiting period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is payable from the <Col N="1290" /> 19th day to the 393rd day in a period of sickness or unemployment to a person in addition to disability or unemployment benefit.  A first time claimant to disability benefit who had been previously in receipt of unemployment benefit must undergo an 18 day waiting period before he can become entitled to the payment of pay-related benefit with disability benefit but entitlement can continue up to the 393rd day of the claim irrespective of the period for which the pay-related benefit has been paid with the unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>A person in the situation outlined by the Deputy, who goes from unemployment benefit to disability benefit and then returns to unemployment benefit is entitled to resumed payment of this benefit and to pay-related benefit, if due, from the first day of unemployment as though there had been no break in his claim for unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances as outlined above, it is not considered that an anomaly exists in the operation of these schemes and there are no proposals to change the existing procedures which are laid down in the legislation governing the schemes. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind which does not appear to be in line with the foregoing arrangements it will be investigated if he supplies the details to the Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the urgent need to assist the aged and infirm of little means especially all those who live alone to secure a telephone service free of installation costs; if he is further aware of the marked reluctance on the part of the rest of the health boards to come to the aid of such persons even where it is known that they live in fear of recurring attacks on their lives and property and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme administered by the Department which covers the normal quarterly rental charges on a telephone, <Col N="1291" /> applies to persons aged 66 or over receiving social welfare type pensions and persons under that age receiving invalidity or blind pension or disabled persons maintenance allowance provided they live alone or only with children under 15 or other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to obtain aid in an emergency.  Extension of this scheme to cover telephone installation charges would give rise to substantial additional cost and there are no proposals for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which enables a health board, where it considers it reasonable, to pay an allowance by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need.  It would be open to a health board to meet all or part of the cost of installing a telephone under this provision, where it is established that an exceptional need exists.  There is no evidence <Col N="1292" /> that health boards are reluctant to provide assistance of this kind where need is established.</P>

      <P>A total allocation of £1 million was made available in 1985 under my Department's capital grant scheme towards the provision of community-recreational facilities. However, assistance sought under the scheme was far in excess of this figure.</P>
      <P>In view of the limitations on available funds, it was decided that priority should be given to eligible projects which were in a position to commence work in 1985 and could produce evidence of the availability of a substantial local contribution.</P>
      <P>I understand that work has commenced on the Knockbridge Community Centre.  However, it was clear from the completed application that there was a problem about the availability of adequate local funds.  It is regretted that in the circumstances the application from the community council did not meet the criteria for grant approval.  Consequently, the question of an inspection of the site did not arise.</P>
