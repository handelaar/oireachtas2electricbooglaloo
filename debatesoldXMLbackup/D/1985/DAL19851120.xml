    <Title>Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985: Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Taoiseach on 19 November 1985:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, 1985, between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom which was signed at Hillsborough, Co. Down, on 15th November, 1985 and copies of which have been laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;having regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland;</P>
    <P>recalling the unanimous Declaration of Dáil Éireann adopted on the joint proposition of An Taoiseach, John A. Costello and the Leader of the Opposition, Eamon de Valera, on 10 May 1949 solemnly reasserting the indefeasible right of the Irish Nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory;</P>
    <P>recalling that all the parties in the New Ireland Forum were convinced that a united Ireland in the form of a sovereign independent state would offer the best and most durable basis for peace and stability;</P>
    <P>re-affirming the unanimous conclusion of the Report of the New Ireland Forum that the particular structure of political unity which the Forum would wish to see established is a unitary state achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the <Col N="2705" /> protection and preservation of both the unionist and nationalist identities;</P>
    <P>while recognising the urgent need that exists for substantial improvement in the situation and circumstances of the nationalist section of the community in the North of Ireland and approving any effective measures which may be undertaken for that purpose, refuses to accept any recognition of British sovereignty over any part of the national territory;</P>
    <P>and requests the Government to call upon the British Government to join in convening under the joint auspices of both governments a constitutional conference representative of all the traditions in Ireland to formulate new constitutional arrangements which would lead to uniting all the people of Ireland in peace and harmony&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Aréir nuair a thosnaigh mé anseo bhí mé ag cur síos ar an chomhaontú seo Angla-Éireannach agus ag rá nach féidir linn na cúrsaí seo a scrúdú gan dul siar ar stair ár dtíre ar feadh na mblianta ó tugadh isteach Acht na hAontachta.  Ins an Acht sin rinneadh cinnte go mbeadh cosaint faoi leith ag na hAontachtóirí i gcónaí agus sin an chaoi ar sheas na Sasanaigh leo ariamh ó tugadh isteach Acht na hAondachta.  Tharla sé nuair a d'féach Rialtas Shasana Home Rule a thabhairt isteach agus tharla sé aris 1921 nuair a síníodh an Conradh idir an tír seo agus Sasana.  Tugadh cearta do na hAontachtóirí.  Sheas na Sasanaigh leis na hAontachtóirí agus fiú amháin ins an lá atá inniu ann tá an scéal céanna fíor. Tá cearta na nAontachtóirí á gcosaint ag Sasanaigh agus an fhad is a mhairfidh sé sin ní fheicfimid aon toradh buan ná ní <Col N="2706" /> fheicfimid aon suaimhneas i dTuaisceart Éireann.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin libh uilig an rud a tharla nuair a b'eigean do na Náisiúnaithe sa Tuaisceart na sráideanna a thabhairt orthu féin i 1969 lena gcearta a fháil agus le insint don saol mór cén éagóir a bhí á déanamh orthu ag Rialtas Stormont.  Tá a fhios againn céard a tharla.  Ba iad na hAontachtóirí a chuir tús leis an achrann; b'iad na hAontachtóirí a chuir cos ar bolg ar na Náisiúnaithe nuair a d'fhéach siad a gcearta a chur os comhair an tsaoil agus níl sé ró-shásúil a fheiceáil san réiteach atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas seo agus Rialtas Shasana go mbeidh cosaint ar leith á fháil ag na hAontachtóirí céanna arís.  Ins an socrú a bheas sínithe nó atá sínithe agus a bheidh ann nuair a chuirfidh an dá Rialtas i bhfeidhm é, tá siad ag súil go mbeidh an lá ann a mbeidh Rialtas arís sa Tuaisceart.  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur, an mbeidh aon toradh buan ar a leithéid sin.  Má bhíonn Rialtas arís, Rialtas sa taobh ó Thuaidh, Rialtas a mbeidh smacht ag na hAontachtóirí air, céard a tharlós?  Feicfimid an sean Stormont ar ais arís; feicfimid, mar adúirt mé, cos ar bolg curtha ar na Náisiúnaithe agus feicfimid an t-achrann arís sa Tuaisceart. Ní bheidh aon suaimhneas buan; ní bheidh aon rud a rachas chun tairbhe do na Náisiúnaithe sa Tuaisceart go bhfeicfimid dul chun cinn éigin á dhéanamh len ár dtír a aontú agus le Rialtas a bheidh i gceannas ar na 32 Chontae a fháil.</P>
      <P>Níl mé sásta go bhfuil tada san Chomhaontú seo a dtiocfaidh tada buan as.  Tá a fhios againn ar fad go raibh brú ar Shasana rud éigin a dhéanamh maidir leis an gceist seo a réiteach, maidir le socrú polaitiúil a thabhairt isteach a rachadh chun tairbhe don tír ar fad agus don síocháin sa chuid seo den tír.  Thuig an Rialtas anseo an tábhacht a bhí le réiteach polaitiúil ach ba chuma le Sasana.  Ní raibh aon aird á thabhairt acu ar chúrsaí sa Tuaisceart agus níor mhór ceist na tíre nó ceist na Teorann nó ceist na dtrioblóidí sa Tuaisceart; ni raibh céim ró-ard acu ar chúrsaí gnó i Sasana ó thosnaigh na trioblóidí ansin i 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois fuair siad deis an dallamullóg a chur ar Rialtas na tíre agus ar an domhan <Col N="2707" /> mór le cur ina luí orthu go bhfuil rud éigin iontach á dhéanamh acu maidir le cúrsaí sa taobh ó Thuaidh.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil córas poiblíochta acu. Tá teilifís, na páipéir, agus bhí siad in ann an scéal seo a chur os comhair an domhain mhóir agus go mór-mhór os comhair phobal na hÉireann agus rinne siad iarracht a chur ina luí orthu ar fad go raibh buntáistí le teacht as an gcomhaontú seo agus go mbeadh an chéad céim curtha ar aghaidh acu le suaimhneas agus síocháin a fháil sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis sin, ní aontaím go mbeidh an dul chun cinn sin ann agus sílim nach bhfuil ann ach sop in áit na scuaibe.  Ni fheicfimid tada buan nó ní fheicfimid suaimhneas ar bith go gcuirfear deireadh leis an Teorainn, an Teorainn a chuir Sasanaigh ansin iad féin don chéad uair, an Teorainn a chuir siad ansin ar mhaithe le Aontachtóirí, an Teorainn atá á cosaint acu ar feadh na mblianta i gcaoi go mbeidh an cumhacht ag na hAontachtóirí, agus an Teorainn a chuirfidh ar Éireannaigh, faraor, a dhul amach le saoirse a fháil ar bhealaí nach bhfuil síochánta.  Níl duine ar bith sásta leis an gcineál achrainn atá sa Tuaisceart ach caithfimid a admháil dé réir ár staire an fhad is atá cuid ar bith den tír seo faoi shrian nó faoi smacht Shasana go mbeidh daoine a thuigeann nach bhfuil bealach ar bith eile le deireadh a chur le réim Shasana ach le dul chun troda.  Sin cuid dár stair, tá sé ó dhúchas againn agus ní féidir é a shéanadh.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil daoine eile a thagann isteach agus a bhaineann buntáiste as na cúrsaí sin, cúrsaí arma agus cúrsaí troda agus go mbíonn, b'fhéidir, tuairimí nó rudaí eile in a meoin nó ina n-aigne.  Tá daoine ann nach mbeidh sásta géilleadh ariamh don srian atá ag Sasana sa tír seo agus mar adúirt mé aontaím go dteastaíonn uainn an tír seo a fháil aontaithe.</P>

      <P>D'iompair tú neart gunnaí.  An fhad is atá an Teorainn ansin beidh daoine ann a bheas sásta an gunna a thógáil le deireadh a chur le arm Shasana sa tír seo agus sin cuid dár stair agus ní féidir linn é sin a shéanadh.  Níor dhúirt mé gur aontaigh mé leo agus níl mé ag aontú leo ach sin cuid dár stair agus beidh sé ann an fhad is atá an Teorainn ansin agus aon socrú a dhéanfar idir Sasana agus an tír seo ní bheidh aon tairbhe ann ná ní bheidh aon bhonn aige le síocháin a fháil don tír an fhad is nach bhfuil sé i gceist nó nach bhfuil sé intuigthe gurb é athaontú na tíre an deireadh a bhéas leis.</P>
      <P>Smaoinimís ar an am i 1921 nuair a síníodh an Conradh &mdash; agus níl mise ag fáil lochta ar na daoine a shínigh an Conradh: bhí brú mór orthu; bhí brú orthu ó Rialtas Shasana ag an am agus dúradh go gcaithfeadh siad é a shíniú nó go mbeadh cogadh marbhtha ann.  Do shínigh siad é faoi bhrú agus rinne siad é mar gur shíl siad ag an am gurb é an rud ab fhearr é do mhuintir na tíre.  Bhí daoine eile nár aontaigh leo faraor.  Dúradh linn ag an am sin gurb é an chéad chéim le síocháin agus le aontú na tíre a fháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níor tháinig na céimeanna sin; níor tharla tada ó shin agus tá an Teorainn ann.  Ní raibh a fhios acu ag an am fiú amháin cén áit a mbeadh an Teorainn &mdash; ach shínigh siad an Conradh sin agus táimid fágtha anois le Teorainn a chuir muintir Shasana iad féin ansin agus Teorainn ata á cosaint acu agus tá sé socraithe i gcaoi go mbeidh an tromlach i gcónaí ag na hAontachtóirí agus ní féidir dul thairis sin.  Ní shílim go bhfuil aon dáiríreacht ag baint le Rialtas Shasana ná leis an cumhdhaitheoir í féin, an Príomh Aire, maidir leis an méid ata á dhéanamh acu i láthair na huaire, ach tá siad ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar an saol mór agus ar Rialtas Mheiriceá agus ar ár gcairde i bPairlimint na hEorpa go bhfuil obair mhór déanta acu agus go mbeidh feasta bunchloch leagtha acu le síocháin agus suaimhneas a fháil i dTuaisceart na tíre. <Col N="2709" /> I bParlaimint Shasana an Luan seo caite nuair a bhí an rud á phlé dúirt an Priomh Aire í féin faoin chomhaontú agus í ag caint ar dtús faoi Airteagail san chomhaontú agus á mhiniú don Pharlaimint: &ldquo;This is the most formal commitment to the principle of consent made by any Irish Government&rdquo;, agus ansin bhí sí ag caint faoin Teorainn agus faoin aitheantas a bhí á thabhairt ag an Rialtas seo don Teorainn agus do chúrsaí sa Tuaisceart. Cé go ndeireann an Rialtas ar láimh amháin gur céim í le cois a fháil isteach, go mbeidh deis ag an Rialtas feasta láimh a bheith acu i gcúrsaí sa Tuaisceart, ar an láimh eile deireann Príomh Aire Shasana gur beo-dearbhú é go bhfuil an Rialtas seo ag glacadh leis an socrú atá déanta maidir leis an Tuaisceart agus go mbeidh an Teorainn ansin ar feadh i bhfad agus go mbeidh sé sin deimhnithe ag na Náisiúin Aontaithe.</P>
    <P>Arís deireann sí: &ldquo;The two Governments may have agreed to make determined efforts to resolve any differences that may arise but the Conference will not be a decision-making body.  Full responsibility for the decisions and administration of Government will remain with the United Kingdom Government north of the Border and with the Irish Government south of the Border.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní fheicimse anseo ach sórt cleas nó bualadh bas.  Tiocfaidh Aire ó Rialtas Shasana agus tiocfaidh Aire ón Rialtas seo le chéile agus státseirbhísigh agus pléifidh siad cúrsaí maidir leis an Tuaisceart b'fhéidir, ach ní bheidh aon chumhacht acu; ní bheidh siad in ann tada a dhéanamh maidir le cúrsaí i dTuaisceart Éireann.  Tá sé sin ráite ag Príomh Aire Shasana; tá sé ráite aici go dearfa: &ldquo;The conference will not be a decision making body&rdquo;.  Ní thuigimse cén fáth nó cén chaoi a dtig le Rialtas Shasana nó leis an Rialtas seo teacht isteach anseo agus a rá agus a iarraidh a chur ina luí orainne go bhfuil <Col N="2710" /> aon rud a bheas buan no tairbheach don tír seo sa chomhaontú seo.</P>
    <P>Má thógaimid cúrsaí i dTuaisceart Éireann i láthair na huaire tá na trioblóidí a tharla ansin ag cur isteach ar gach gné de shaol na tíre: saol eacnamaíochta na tíre, turasóireacht, agus le cúpla bliain anuas tig linn a rá i dtaobh go leor den robáil atá á dhéanamh ag daoine áirithe go bhfuil baint aige le cúrsaí sa taobh ó Thuaidh.  Tá daoine ag teacht isteach anseo le gunnaí ag robáil banc agus a leithéid sin agus sin de bharr cleachtadh a bheith acu ar iompar agus úsáid gunnaí sna Sé Contaetha.  Tig linn a rá mar sin nuair atáimid ag caint ar na cúrsaí seo go bhfuilimid ag caint ar an tír ar fad, nach bhfuilimid ag caint ar Thuaisceart Éireann amháin agus níl maith ar bith dúinn a bheith ag ligean orainn féin go bhfuilimid ag déanamh dul chun cinn.  Ba mhaith liomsa a bheith in ann teacht isteach anseo agus a rá go raibh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh.  Caithfimid a admháil go bhfuilimid sásta go raibh iarracht á déanamh le dul chun cinn a chur ar bun. I ndáiríre ní fheicimse go bhfuil an dul chun cinn ar mhaith linn a fheiceáil déanta againn.  Tá a fhios againn uilig go bhfuil an cleachtadh agus an taithí ag baint le Rialtais i Sasana agus go n-éiríonn leo an scéal a chur ar fud an domhain ar mhaithe leo féin agus sílim go ndeachaigh sé sin i bhfeidhm ar dhaoine anseo chomh maith agus go síleann siad go bhfuil buntáistí ag teacht de bharr an chomhaontaithe seo.</P>
    <P>Tá focal amháin sa réamhrá &mdash; tógfaidh mé an ceann i mBéarla &mdash; agus cuireann sé ionadh orm.  Deir sé &ldquo;wishing further to develop the unique relationship between their peoples&rdquo;.  Má táimid ag caint ar chúrsaí mar a fheicimse iad idir Sasana agus an tír seo, tháinig siad isteach anseo; chuir siad chuile chineál leatrom orainn; rinne siad eagóir ar mhuintir na hÉireann i gcaitheamh na gcéadta bliain.  Is beag cearta a bhí againn, cearta de chineál ar bith.  Mar sin &ldquo;unique relationship&rdquo;, níl a fhios agam céard ba cheart dom a smaoineamh faoi sin.  Má thógaimid an taobh eile den scéal, b'fhéidir go bhfuil an Rialtas ag caint ar na hÉireannaigh a thóg na bóithre móra i Sasana; iad a thóg <Col N="2711" /> na tithe tar éis an chogaidh, fiú amháin na stáisiúin adamhacha atá i Sasana anois, gur Éireannaigh a thóg iad.  Má chuireann tú an dá cheann le chéile b'fhéidir go dtiocfadh leat a rá gur &ldquo;unique relationship&rdquo; atá ann ach sílimse gur beag aird ná suim a bhí ariamh ag Rialtas ar bith i Sasana i gcúrsaí a bhaineann le dul chun cinn na tíre seo agus nach n-athraíonn sé sin tada.  Tá sé le feiceáil ins an EC fiú amháin, rud ar bith a théann chun tairbhe don tír seo, is iad na Sasanaigh, is cuma cén chuid a bhfuilimid ag caint futhu, is luaithe a éireos le cos a chur orainn.  B'fhéidir go síleann daoine go bhfuil mise seanaimseartha nuair atá mé caint faoi na cúrsaí seo ach sin í an fhírinne.  Ni fheicimse bealach ar bith eile ach an chaoi a bhfuil siad ag caitheamh anuas orainn an t-am ar fad. Ni shílim go bhfuil tada sa chomhaontú seo.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuireadh é seo os comhair an phobail i gcaoi gur shíl gach duine go raibh buntáistí faoi leith ann agus má táimid ag fáil rud ar bith as ní fheicimse é.  Níor cuireadh ina luí ormsa go fóill san méid a chuala mé ó na cainteoirí anseo sa Dáil &mdash; ón Taoiseach é féin &mdash; go bhfuil aon dul chun cinn anseo.  Más é an rud go bhfuilimid ag díriú ar n-aghaithe san aontacht &mdash; duirt me i dtús ama &mdash; go mbeidh Rialtas dár gcuid féin ins an Tuaisceart, tá a fhios againn go dearfa cén deireadh a bheas air sin agus céard a tharlós arís i gceann cúpla scór bliain nó b'fhéidir níos luaithe ná sin.  Má bhíonn Parlaimint dá gcuid féin ag na hAontachtóirí ní bheidh siad sásta a gcearta a thabhairt do na Caitlicigh agus sin an chaoi a mbeidh cúrsaí agus níl aon rud anseo a chuirfidh <Col N="2712" /> tús len ár dtír a aontú, le Rialtas amháin Éireannach a thabharfaidh aire do chúrsaí ar fud na tíre ar fad.  Sin an trua.</P>
    <P>Ba bhreá an rud dá mbeadh céim ar bith dá tabhairt don rud sin a thabhairt chun tosaigh, ach sílim go bhfuilimid níos fuide ó sin ná mar a bhíomar riamh. Sin mar atá an scéal.  Tá aitheantas dá thabhairt ní hé amháin anseo ach idirnáisiúnta go mbeidh an Teorainn ansin agus go bhfuilimid ag glacadh go mbeidh sé ansin.  Beidh Éireannaigh i gcónaí ann nach mbeidh sásta leis sin, agus a thógfaidh modhanna len a gcearta a bhaint amach, mar ní fheiceann siad aon bhealach eile as.  I gceann bliana, nuair a fheiceann muintir an Tuaiscirt céard tá faighte acu, beidh siad mí-shásta, go mór mhór an SDLP agus na daoine atá ag cuidiú leo. Molaim an iarracht atá á déanamh acu sna cúrsaí seo ach nuair a fheiceann na Náisiúnaí nach bhfuil tada dá fháil acu, beidh an-droch thionchar ag téarmaí an chomhaontaithe seo maidir le aontú ar bith a fáil a rachaidh chun táirbhe do shuaimhneas agus siocháin agus dul chun cinn eacnamaíochta do mhuintir an Tuaiscirt agus don tír seo uile.  Is cuma cén socrú atá déanta, muna gcuidíonn sé leis an Tuaisceart ní chuideoidh sé linne. Caithfimid fanacht píosa maith eile ama sula mbeidh an suaimhneas agus an síocháin a theastaíonn uainn faighte againn.</P>

      <P>This agreement is a major step towards the bringing together of opposing traditions and the healing of ancient wounds.  It meets the requirements of Labour Party policy on Northern Ireland.  It recognises the aspiration to the unity of the people and territory of this island through reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An essential element in the search for that reconciliation is the formal assurance given in the agreement that only if the people of the North consent to unity, would unity come about.  But it does more than this: in article 4 (b) the agreement states that it is the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government that responsibility in respect of certain matters within the powers of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should be <Col N="2713" /> devolved within Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure widespread acceptance throughout that community and the Irish Government support this policy.  The agreement provides a stimulus to efforts within the North to find effective structures for devolution which will have widespread acceptance.  As we have made clear, our involvement in devolved matters will cease when those structures are agreed by both communities.</P>
    <P>This agreement seeks reconciliation through North-South co-operation on security, economic, social and cultural matters.  It proclaims unremitting opposition to violence from whatever source. By stating frankly that the two Governments are determined to work together to ensure that those who promote political objectives by violence do not succeed, it ends any question of equivocation about the role of violence in this country.</P>
    <P>This agreement commits the two Governments in accordance with the policy of our party to promote the economic and social development of those areas of both parts of Ireland which have suffered most severely from the consequences of the instability of recent years. In furtherance of this endeavour we will be seeking international support, particularly from the Socialist group in Europe from whom I received a telegram of support on Monday last.  I believe that this agreement demonstrates the result of that realistic, honest and positive dialogue with the British Government for which the Labour Party have called in the past and which we have been pursuing in Government since the adoption of the Forum report.</P>
    <P>We accept that Deputies have the right to scrutinise this agreement which has been prepared painstakingly and with difficulty since the conclusion of the Forum.  We want this House to examine its implications and to debate it thoroughly.</P>
    <P>It is a major agreement.  But let us also remember our obligations as constitutional Nationalists to each other and especially to our fellow members of this Forum in the SDLP.  Let us remember <Col N="2714" /> also the sensitivities of the Unionist community, the validity of whose identity and sense of Britishness we accepted in the Forum report as a major reality &mdash; FR. 5.1 (9) and 5.2 (4).</P>
    <P>I plead, therefore, today for understanding and restraint.  I plead for understanding of this agreement for what it is, and I plead for restraint in its interpretation. This is a time to lower the political temperature, not to raise it.  It is a time for cool heads, not hot heads.  We have been through too much suffering on this island and there is so much at stake.  I believe the great majority of Deputies in this House are conscious that the eyes of the world are upon Dáil Éireann today. This debate will be a test of our political maturity as a nation.</P>
    <P>In the Forum report we recognised the immense cost of violence on this island. We all joined to reject and condemn paramilitary organisations and to reject and condemn all who resort to terror and murder to achieve their ends.  We strongly urged people in Ireland of all traditions and all those who were concerned about Ireland elsewhere in the world to refuse any support or sympathy to these paramilitary bodies and associated organisations.</P>
    <P>We said that the acts of murder and violence of these organisations and their denial of the legitimate rights of others have the effect of undermining all efforts to secure peace and political progress. As constitutional Nationalists we said we were determined to secure justice for all traditions.  We called in the Forum for the strongest possible support for political progress through the democratic process &mdash; Chapter 4.11.</P>
    <P>By this agreement we are setting our face resolutely against the path of violence and we are following instead the path of political progress.  We have sought in this agreement the acceptance of the validity of both the Nationalist and Unionist identities in Ireland and the democratic rights of every citizen on this island &mdash; Forum Report 5.2 (4).  I believe that we have taken a great step along that road.  This agreement has the aim of promoting peace and stability in Northern <Col N="2715" /> Ireland, of helping to reconcile the two major traditions in Ireland and of creating a new climate of friendship and co-operation between the peoples of Britain and Ireland.  The agreement commits us to improve co-operation in combating terrorism.  We will implement this element of the agreement, and every other element in it, wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>The constitutional Nationalist party of the North, the SDLP, have accepted this agreement.  I should like to pay a tribute to the unremitting efforts of that party and their leaders whose political efforts down through the years have been an example to all of us, particularly in the South who do not have to work in the same trying conditions as they do in the North.  This House should pay a special tribute to John Hume, Séamus Mallon, Austin Currie, Joe Hendron, Brid Rogers, Eddie Magready and others in the SDLP who for a long time have pursued the politics of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland.  They did so while retaining a dignity that we expected from them.  We are all indebted to them.  They are realists.  They have to be realists. Their party was born of the agony of the last 16 years and they are the Nationalists who must face in every minute of their day the continuing problems of Northern Ireland, the lack of peace and stability, the deep unemployment among workers, the lack of acceptance of the Nationalist identity, and the murderous violence of the IRA.  These are the people in the field.  They have said they are satisfied with this agreement.  They do not see it as impeding their right to work for unity. On the contrary, they see the agreement as recognising the legitimacy of the Nationalist position.  We warmly welcome their support as we embark on this further stage of the Anglo-Irish process.</P>
    <P>There are two major questions in this debate.  The first is the question of the status of Northern Ireland and the second is the question of undertaking action now to make the political progress which is required to bring peace and reconciliation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>First, the question of status: as the <Col N="2716" /> Taoiseach said in his opening remarks to the press conference at Hillsborough on Friday last, he and the British Prime Minister came to the negotiations with different historical perspectives, and as it were, the different title deeds.  The British constitutional position on Northern Ireland remains the same.  Our constitutional position on Northern Ireland also remains unchanged.  Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution remain.  In answer to those who have suggested that Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution should have been amended, I need only point to the hysteria whipped up in the last few days to show that both Governments were wise to maintain the constitutional positions as they now are and to concentrate on the facts of the situation.  Those facts of the situation include the fact that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  In this House on 10 November 1981, the Leader of the Opposition gave it as his view that those words merely recognised the practicalities of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition opposes this agreement now on the basis that the Government would be acting unconstitutionally in proceeding with it.  His arguments in support of this contention seem to me to be thin, to say the least.  He has put forward diffuse and non-specific points and makes his case by making general assertions to the effect that the Government are acting in a manner repugnant to the Constitution of Ireland by fully accepting British sovereignty over a part of the national territory and by purporting to give legitimacy to a British administration in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In making these assertions the Leader of the Opposition assures us he is not indulging in rhetoric.  How can he sustain this when he has made no more specific arguments against the Government's position then those made in his speech yesterday?  If the Leader of the Opposition can advance specific comprehensible arguments on this issue he has a duty to this House, to the Constituation and to the people to enumerate them <Col N="2717" /> before this debate concludes so that the House and the people may make a reasoned judgment.  For my part I cannot see any formal surrender of <i>de jure</i> Irish sovereignty over Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has made the point also that no future Government need be bound by the provisions of an international agreement such as this if it were incompatible with the Constitution.  His point appears to be that the Government do not have the competence to make this agreement and that therefore it is and will be void and inoperative <i>ex tunc</i>.  I believe this is entirely unsustainable.  Deputy Haughey has not demonstrated any specific or general want of legal or constitutional competence on the part of the Government in the signing of this agreement.  More important, as Deputy Haughey has raised this point, the House is entitled to know what his intention might be in relation to the agreement.  Does he intend to denounce it or to treat it as void?  We should be allowed to know, to be let in on the secret.  Certainly, the constitutional Nationalists of Northern Ireland will want to know his attitude on this.  It is too important for them for there to be any doubt about his position.</P>
    <P>It is a practicality of the situation that the only unity which constitutional Nationalists would want is a unity achieved without violence and by consent.  Can any one of us here seriously imagine a unity brought about by force?  Can anyone here imagine what it would be like to live in a united Ireland with one million people in rebellion?  No Leader of our State has envisaged such a prospect.  I will simply quote Mr. de Valera in this House on 24 June 1947.  He said: &ldquo;I believe that it [the problem of Northern Ireland] cannot be solved, in any circumstances that we can now see, by force and that if it were solved by force, it would leave a situation behind it which would mean that this State would be in an unstable position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe passionately that the abjuring of the use of force is not only a practicality, that it must also be a principle in politics.  It must be a principle that we <Col N="2718" /> will have nothing to do with those who seek to shoot and bomb our fellow Irishmen until they acquiesce in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>What kind of love of Ireland is that? James Connolly said it best:</P>
    <P>Ireland, without her people is nothing to me; and the man who is bubbling over with love and enthusiasm for &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and can yet pass unmoved through our streets and witness all the wrong and the suffering, the shame and the degradation wrought upon the people of Ireland &mdash; aye, wrought by Irish men upon Irish men and women &mdash; without burning to end it, is, in my opinion, a fraud and a liar in his heart no matter how he loves that combination of chemical elements he is pleased to call &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of political progress and this is what we should keep to the forefront of this debate and to the forefront of the development of Irish politics.  Connolly recognised another practicality &mdash; the practicality of human suffering and human deprivation.  We must ask ourselves honestly: do we want to do something to end this problem?  Or do we want to do nothing?  Do we want to postpone forever the day of action? Or do we want to start now?  I stated in my speech to the last Labour Party conference held earlier this year in Cork that we were prepared to take a risk for peace.  Do we want to take that risk?  Or do we want to take no risk at all?  I need hardly say that it seems to me that the path of taking no risk at all, is the path of greatest risk.  For if we leave the business of ending the Northern Ireland problem to the gunmen we can only push back the possibility of unity; and we can only promote the danger to our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Twelve years ago, my respected predecessor as Leader of the Labour Party, Brendan Corish, said in the debate on Sunningdale, as reported at columns 2029-30 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The events of the past five years have shown us that there is no magic way by <Col N="2719" /> which the Border could be ended.  If it has done that &mdash; it is difficult to say &mdash; it has done some good.  At least it may prevent further loss of life.</P>
    <P>Brendan Corish was right to introduce that note of caution.  Twelve years on, there are still some among us who believe there is a magic way.  Of course, there is no magic way by which the Unionist community of Northern Ireland will agree to a united Ireland.  Their agreement will have to come in time, as we act towards them with patience, with honesty and sincerity, with transparency of motive and with hard application to the solving of immediate problems.  The creation of conditions in which the Nationalist community in the North can more readily identify with structures of government will help peace and stability to emerge in this island.  For Unionists who have suffered the rejection of the most precious human right &mdash; the right to life &mdash; in the past 16 years, this agreement with the British Government provides a practical and careful plan not only to ease their present suffering, but to help towards the re-establishment of devolution on a basis of widespread acceptance, and to help towards the creation of better and more prosperous times for all.</P>
    <P>It is important to be clear both about the nature of the role of the Irish Government within the Conference and about the background to that role.  First the background: it is not right to suggest that the British Government before Hillsborough always accepted that the Irish Government had a right to put forward views and proposals in relation to the North.  Such a right was never before formally accorded to the Irish Government. What is more, Deputies will remember that British ministers, and indeed the present Prime Minister, have denied categorically in the past that such a right was recognised by the British Government.  For example, in the House of Commons on 29 July 1982, following discussion between a Minister of State at <Col N="2720" /> the Foreign Office and an Irish Ambassador which had taken place on 26 July, Mrs. Thatcher said the following:</P>
    <P>My right hon.  Friend the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, made it perfectly clear to the Irish Ambassador that no commitment exists for Her Majesty's Government to consult the Irish Government on matters affecting Northern Ireland.  That has always been our position.  We reiterate and emphasise it, so that everyone is clear about it.</P>
    <P>Of course, Irish Governments have always believed that we have a right and a duty to ensure that the British Government are aware of our views on the North.  All parties here are agreed on that.  It is a fact, however, that that was never accepted as a right on our part by the British Government and, what is more, it is a fact that it was formally denied on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>Second, the Agreement: article 2 (b) of the Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985 states: &ldquo;The United Kingdom Government accept that the Irish Government will put forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland within the field of activity of the Conference...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also important that we should understand that the right now for the first time formally given to the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland goes beyond that; it goes beyond a right to consult or to be consulted.  The agreement, again in article 2 (b), in a provision which governs the entire working of the Conference on matters relating to Northern Ireland states that, &ldquo;in the interest of promoting peace and stability, determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thus on the central question of the role and nature of the Conference itself, the position of the Irish Government has changed in two fundamental respects: first, the British Government have for the first time formally accepted the right of the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals on Northern Ireland, <Col N="2721" /> having previously rejected that position; and, secondly, the two Governments for the first time commit themselves, as a matter of obligation under an international agreement, to the effect that &ldquo;determined efforts shall be made to resolve any differences&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I cannot claim ties of kinship with anyone in the North.  I do claim many friendships, both among members of my own profession and among sportsmen who live in the North.  In every single case, these are friendships that I value deeply, and friends from whom I have learned a lot.  They are Catholics and Protestants, Unionists and Nationalists, and I cannot honestly say that I feel closer to one or the other.</P>
    <P>I hope and believe that these many friends will know of me that I have no interest in forcing my aspirations down their throats.  I would be dismayed to discover &mdash; although I do not think I shall &mdash; that any one of them believed that I had abandoned either my Republican aspiration on the one hand, or my commitment to dialogue, persuasion and above all, consent, on the other.</P>
    <P>I must and do respect the views of those who have lived closer to violence than I have.  I have had many opportunities to discuss the stagnation of ordinary life with them, and I believe as a result that many of them &mdash; many who are Unionist among them &mdash; believe increasingly that the only way forward is to talk across the divide; to break down barriers of distrust that years of ascendancy have built up.</P>
    <P>Many of these people represent the middle ground.  I appeal particularly to them to suspend judgment &mdash; to wait and see.  I believe they will discover that the Irish Government are operating in good faith.  And I believe that that good faith will be translated into action to promote dialogue, dialogue aimed at bridging the sectarian gap and building trust between two communities who, in the final analysis, will be dependent on each other for economic and social progress. <Col N="2722" /> I cannot help but reflect that my political perspective owes nothing to the divisiveness of the twenties.  Like the rest of my generation, I have no link with that tragic period, like the rest of my generation, I want to look to the future and not agonise over the past.  While I recognise fully that our history is part of what we are, I prefer to believe that the generation of which I am part will make its own history.</P>
    <P>How is that history likely to be read? Is it to be a story of continuing violence and strife; a history of chronic unemployment for young people in the North; a history of sectarian division; a history of a continuing period of no opportunities and no hope?  Or is it possible that this generation can write a history of reconstruction, of new opportunities, of peace and respect for one another?  I believe it is.  Around the world, it is this generation that has led the move towards greater democracy in many authoritarian régimes.  It is this generation that has alerted the world to the insanity of nuclear arms.  It is this generation that has inspired the worldwide response to hunger and tragedy in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland, North and South, it is this generation ultimately that will confront the economic and social challenges of the end of this century and the beginning of the next.  It is this generation that will write the history from now on.  I hope and believe that there are in this generation the seeds of new opportunities and new awareness, coupled with a growing rejection of the nihilistic violence of those who have no interest in building anything.</P>
    <P>The Government have dealt with the practicalities of the situation as we see them, not with dreams and fantasies.  We have calculated what we can do now, not what could be done sometime.  We have judged our own capacity to act, not our capacity to wish.  We will not be hypnotised by prejudice or propaganda.  The Government will act with tenacity in implementing this agreement because we believe it to be in the interest of all the people of these islands, but especially of the people of Ireland, North and South, <Col N="2723" /> Nationalist and Unionist, Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that this point is not being made in my time.  Before giving its approval to the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement as proposed by the Government, Dáil Éireann must examine its terms and consider its implications in an objective and detailed manner.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that the length of the negotiations and the level at which they were conducted &ldquo;reflect the extreme complexity of the issues being tackled and the delicacy of the issues at stake&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Each Member who contributes here has but half an hour to seek clarification on these complex and delicate issues and the Government who have spent 18 months in negotiations must respond fairly and fully to the queries we raise.  If this agreement is to bind us, we must understand what it means before endorsing its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach expressed his gratitude to the various Governments and associations for their &ldquo;extraordinary and unanimous support for this agreement&rdquo;. In many cases this support was <Col N="2724" /> expressed simultaneously with the signing of the agreement.  The extraordinary unanimity and the coincidence of response might suggest that we might offend those friends by being critical here.  Despite the complex and delicate issues involved the media generally were quite spontaneous in their approval and commendation.  It may be that the instant commendation was confined to the intention as communicated by the two Governments but our role in this Parliament, in this Opposition, has to be more critical.  Approval from this Dáil is not just an instant and passing commendation. It involves a binding obligation under the terms of our Constitution.  We must not dishonour our role and ignore that Constitution by superficial analysis and vague generalisation.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the alleged conflict between Fianna Fáil and the SDLP in our responses to this agreement. The SDLP's support is not unconditional. While offering full co-operation with the proposed Conference, party Leader, John Hume, has indicated that much will depend on the implementation of the agreement and on the policies particularly in the field of justice.  The SDLP, he said, will monitor that implementation very carefully.  Mr. Séamus Mallon, Deputy Leader has indicated that it was an agreement &ldquo;which I would be prepared to give every opportunity to work&rdquo;. In effect, and quite prudently the SDLP are adopting a wait and see attitude.</P>
    <P>I have been privileged to know them as contemporaries and to work with them in international fields.  I have experienced in their homes, their courage in the face of threats and intimidation which aroused in me an abiding respect for their courage, integrity and dedication.  In their unremitting search for justice and permanent peace through political action they have won the right to be heard at home and abroad.  Their Ireland is not one of domination or hatred but of equal rights and mutual respect.  We share those views and respect their intentions but our role in this issue is different from theirs.  We are being asked to give our support and approval to the terms of an agreement in <Col N="2725" /> accordance with our constitutional obligation to Dáil Éireann.  We cannot wait and see the actual effects of the implementation.  We are called upon now to state our position and we cannot be criticised for raising the issues that are fundamental to this State and the Constitution under which we operate.</P>
    <P>While it is the clearly expressed intention of the Government to register this agreement at the UN, it must be said that the agreement in its form and terms is very vague and capable of different interpretations which in the end can raise the most fundamental issues for this State.  Apart from the limitation in the Irish Government's role to putting forward views and proposals, there is no precise indication as to the legal obligations which attach to the British Government in this agreement.  Phrases such as &ldquo;determined efforts to resolve any differences&rdquo; in Article 2 (b) and generalisations such as the &ldquo;the business of the Conference will thus receive attention at the highest level&rdquo; and the procedures for small and flexible groups in Article 3 are totally inappropriate to a binding international agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government should explain what precisely is meant by &ldquo;proposals for major legislation and on major policy issues&rdquo; in respect of which they may put forward proposals or views on political issues in Article 5 of the agreement.  A similar explanation must be forthcoming before this debate ends in respect of &ldquo;an opportunity to address policy issues, serious incidents and forthcoming events&rdquo;. Who is to be the arbiter of what is major in these clauses or what will be understood as serious incidents?  If this Dáil is to approve the terms in the agreement it should be clear where the responsibility will lie for interpreting the terms of that agreement.  If it is the prerogative of the British Government to exclude matters from the Conference which do not conform to their interpretation and their intentions, the role of the Conference, limited though it already may be, can be totally undermined unilaterally by the British Government.</P>
    <P>In any assessment of this agreement <Col N="2726" /> we must look at what it means for the whole country.  Over the years we have won international recognition of the sovereignty of this State.  This must be protected. On it depends our right to take decisions on internal affairs and express our position on foreign policy.  The protection of our right to be neutral and independent in times of conflict such as a world war is a cherished objective of our foreign policy.  Our security is our affair.  This agreement makes this and other matters the affair of an Anglo-Irish Conference.  The Conference has not got to deal with the affairs of Northern Ireland alone, but Article 5 of the agreement records as coming within the authority of the Conference, matters relating to electoral arrangements, economic and social issues including unemployment, cultural and so on and then makes it clear that &ldquo;the possible application of any measures pursuant to this Article by the Irish Government in their jurisdiction shall not be excluded&rdquo;.  This is more specifically stated in Article 8 which says:</P>
    <P>The Conference shall deal with issues of concern to both countries relating to the enforcement of criminal law.  In particular it shall consider whether there are areas of the criminal law applying in the North and in the South respectively which might benefit be harmonised.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that this Conference is to have a say, to what limited extent that may be, in the internal affairs of this State.  The agreement is, therefore, an erosion of the right to control our own security by this sovereign Parliament which was won under the 1938 agreement by Eamon de Valera.  The significant thing is that there is no reciprocal right enshrined in the agreement for matters of internal security in Britain to come within the range of the Conference discussion and consideration of recommendations to be made in respect of anxieties we might have on security policy in Britian, and we have many such anxieties.</P>
    <P>When one considers the implications of the Birmingham Six Trial and the application of the Prevention of Terrorism <Col N="2727" /> Act and the tensions they caused in Britain and between our two Governments, it is quite extraordinary that the right to make recommendations in respect of our internal affairs is not reciprocated by a similar right in respect of the internal affairs of Britain.  Ireland and Britain will meet in the Conference which will deal not only with the North but with the whole of Ireland.  The Conference will not deal with internal British issues which are of considerable importance to this State.</P>
    <P>There is at least a grave risk that this agreement will erode our State sovereignty and the total effect of this in the areas of security can have tremendous consequences for us and our neutrality in any future world conflict or war.  I acknowledge that it is not the intention of the Government to give rise to any such possibility, but when we consent formally to an agreement in this House, discharging our role under the Constitution, we consent to it on the terms of the agreement and not just on the hopes, expectations or intentions of our own Government if they are not clearly expressed in that agreement.  Of course, it can be said that the role of the Conference is purely consultative but the Taoiseach stressed that it is as near executive authority as makes no difference.  In claiming great achievements on behalf of his Government within Northern Ireland when he laid emphasis on the extent of the power of the Anglo-Irish Conference, the Government must explain how such powers within the Six County area are also proposed to be extended to the Republic.  The Government cannot have it both ways and suggest that the Conference has a significant role within the internal affairs of the North but none down here.  Furthermore, while matters in regard to the internal administration in the North will be withdrawn according as they are handed over to a devolved government in the North, no such time limit is placed in the agreement on the Conference's right in regard to the Republic's internal affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2728" /> Let no one suggest in this that I am raising unreal possibilities.  In this I am discharging, as I believe our role in this House is to discharge, a duty to examine an agreement for what it says and not to rely on vague expressions, intentions or statements of intent by the Taoiseach or anyone else.  In referring to statements from the Taoiseach, let me add a matter which is not included in my text as issued but which I want to address now very briefly.  The Taoiseach in the course of his statement after the summit agreement referred particularly to the fact that the Supreme Court decision in the McGlinchey case particularly &ldquo;had got rid of the constitutional impediment to extradition&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What understanding does that show of what the Constitution represents?  The Constitution is not an impediment; it is a protection.  The decision in that case was a decision made in respect of the issues in that case based on the facts brought forward in that case.  It must be said that in no sense could it be suggested as getting rid of the constitutional impediment as the Taoiseach proposed to the world in his press conference.  Indeed, many of us in this House and outside were very much concerned with the rushed manner in which that case was presented to the Supreme Court.  The consequence is that we have now, here in our jurisdiction, someone for trial who has been returned from the statelet to which he was extradited in respect of whom we can press only charges that are in accordance with the return from the North.  So much for the Taoiseach's understanding of extradition or what he calls a constitutional impediment in relation to extradition. While I am at it, let me say that we will have another opportunity of addressing this when any proposal to accede to the European Convention on Terriorism comes before the House.  I just want to record as fact that many countries which accede to that convention have reservations expressed in their accession on two fundamental points, (1) many of them do not extradite their own citizens under any circumstances (2) many of them exclude political offences from their <Col N="2729" /> accession to the convention.  When we come to address the issue in terms of decision by this Parliament on that occasion we will go into these in much greater detail.</P>
    <P>As to the contribution which this surrender of our autonomy will make to an improvement of affairs within Northern Ireland, nobody can make any concrete claims.  We all hope for peace.  We will all make considerable sacrifices to that end.  We are obliged to make sacrifices, particularly in the light of the constant suffering and tragedy that have fallen on those people in this island.  We are prepared to acknowledge the good intentions and <i>bona fides</i> of the Government in their efforts, but we should not delude ourselves or allow ourselves to be deluded.  In the final analysis we must ask what is the whole aim of the document which the Taoiseach proposes for approval to the Dáil.  Is it the restoration of internal devolved Government as so clearly indicated many times by the British Prime Minister since this agreement was signed?  If Britain once again wishes to get away from the public gaze and international scrutiny, this must not be allowed to be sanctioned by this Dáil. We must not allow our members in the Conference to act as a screen to cover British actions.  Our public servants, who will be constantly involved in this, must not be seen to be involved in any even unwitting attempt to conceal from the gaze of the world any complaints, criticisms or proposals we have to make in respect of British failures and injustices in the North.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government may make proposals in the Conference &ldquo;in so far as they relate to the interests of the minority community&rdquo; but not on the wider issues which are at the base of this tragic problem. Once devolution is achieved the Irish Government in this Conference will be allowed no input on the matters which are devolved.  This agreement suggest an intention on the part of Britain to use the Irish representation on the Conference as a shelter before the world if devolution fails to come about, but the input is to be minimal.  The Conference may be used <Col N="2730" /> to put forward the views of the Irish Government &mdash; yesterday the British Prime Minister said &ldquo;make the representations&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Where the interests of the minority community are significantly or especially affected&rdquo;.  Despite the difficulty of defining the word &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; it is quite clear that the role of the Irish delegates will be minimal.</P>
    <P>The British Government have had to face public opinion throughout the world since 1974 without a devolved administration to hide behind.  The response from our partners throughout the world to this, spontaneous though it may have been, may not have been the consequence of detailed consideration.  Nonetheless, that response may be an expression and a consequence of the constant international attention which Irish Governments in recent years &mdash; I was involved in this like others &mdash; have succeeded in promoting.  Are we to limit our right to raise these issues internationally?  Will we provide cover for the basic injustices that are at the root of the problem in Northern Ireland in a charade of a Conference the agenda and proceedings of which will be secret?  Our Government will be presented as being partly responsible for policy in the North without having any real authority to affect it.  Criticism will be kept down and we may be forced into a position of giving a new lease of life to the very cause of the problem, the partition of this country.  In fact, the reference constantly throughout the agreement to the minority community suggests &mdash; I am not saying deliberately &mdash; a partitionist approach.</P>
    <P>Are the Nationalists of the North henceforth to be seen as a minority not just by us but in the eyes of the world before which this agreement is now to be registered?  If there is a minority there must be a majority.  Are we now to concede that the consequence of a partition which we have always opposed confers a democratic right to the majority in a condition that defies democracy?  It seems clear that as far as the Nationalist community in the North are concerned, this secret Conference will offer far less protection than the open diplomacy <Col N="2731" /> between sovereign Governments which has been a very healthy feature of recent years.  No longer will the Minister for Foreign Affairs be addressing his protests to the British Government openly, he will be confined to putting forward proposals privately in a conference the members of which will have a special interest in making it work.  Their task will be to dampen down Nationalists' grievances.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government and their representatives must not be silenced by this agreement and the Nationalists must not become as alienated from them as they were from Stormont.  The great risk of this Conference is that the Irish Government have accepted responsibility without power and without getting anything in return to formalise the relationship of constitutional Nationalists, for instance, with our Houses of the Oireachtas.  No Nationalist from the North may sit in either Dáil or Seanad without being disbarred from the principal elected body of Northern Ireland if and when devolution comes about.  We cannot allow a situation to emerge where Nationalists will have no parliamentary way of presenting their point of view to a Government who take responsibility for representing them.</P>
    <P>If the machinery of the Conference fails, or if the good faith of the British Government is not forthcoming, this Conference could be a recipe for further tragedy not only in the North of Ireland but in our jurisdiction also.  As long as the Republic is sovereign and independent its voice cannot be silenced.  Its voice may not be as effective as we might wish, but at least it can be used with credibility and standing.  We cannot cede the right to criticise the administration of affairs in the North in our open bilateral negotiations with the British Government and before the family of nations in the organisations to which we have acceded.</P>
    <P>I should like to make specific reference to the financial package and the support internationally in that respect.  I know a little about financial packages.  I was Minister for Foreign Affairs when the Carter initiative came through after detailed negotiations with us in Government. <Col N="2732" /> The condition there was not just a Conference of this kind but an acceptable agreement and total devolution and support from both Governments within the North of Ireland.  We achieved that at that time.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs I managed to introduce the European Community to their obligation.  I should like to recall that the role of the European Community &mdash; we note and welcome their interest in this connection &mdash; has long since been raised.  I should like to refer specifically to 1977 when I, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, for the first time &mdash; I must stress that &mdash; raised and got support from the Foreign Ministers of the Community for cross-Border projects to relieve the economic pressures in those areas.  Since that time &mdash; the Leader of the SDLP, John Hume will acknowledge this &mdash; in the relatively short period I spent in the Commission I managed to get Commission support for major proposals for the North of Ireland in respect of integrated programmes right across Northern Ireland.  Let no one suggest that what we are hearing now is being heard for the first time.  The record is there to prove that in recent years support was already on the way.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one reserve. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, indicated that we were going to get a package of the order of £500 million, but the State Department is quoted in yesterday's <i>Daily Telegraph</i> as saying clearly that there was no commitment to any specific package.  One has to ask: is this another indication of the vague hopes and intentions? Is it not quite extraordinary that we are told that had the agreement been signed a day earlier it could have given rise to an agreement on financial support? That has to be either a terrible mistake in timing or, quite frankly, a deliberate decision in view of the fact that no such commitment has been given.  I hope, believe and expect it will but let us not express vague hopes until such time as the matter has been finalised and we have seen the effect of it here and in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As late as yesterday in the House of Commmons, the British Prime Minister <Col N="2733" /> indicated that, &ldquo;representations made by the Irish Republic to the proposed Inter-governmental Conference will not normally be made public.&rdquo; Surely the effect of this agreement cannot be to confine us to making representations in private where previously we had won the right not only to make representations but to express strong and trenchant criticisms in public.</P>
    <P>With regard to the impact of this agreement on Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution it must be restated again that these Articles do not represent a claim by the South on the North &mdash; they never could and never should &mdash; but a statement of the territorial integrity of the whole nation.  In that nation to which we aspire and which is enshrined in our Constitution, there is no place for domination by a majority over a minority.  The very existence of Partition has spawned these terms and the nation that has so consistently argued in favour of equal rights for all in every area of conflict throughout the world cannot now reverse our policy and acknowledge the existence of permanent majorities or minorities within our own country.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the provision in Article 1 which declares that: &ldquo;if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, they the Governments will introduce and support in the respective Parliaments, legislation to give effect to that wish.&rdquo; Who is to determine how this wish is to be expressed or how clearly it is to be expressed?  Who is to initiate the machinery for expressing the formal consent referred to in the article?  If the British Government refuse to propose a referendum or to launch the necessary procedure, this article will have no effect.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis an agreement which is stated, and on the part of our Government genuinely intended, to promote reconciliation &mdash; let me acknowledge that &mdash; may have the unforeseen consequence of maintaining division and dissension.  Already the reaction of the Unionist population, and their representatives, demonstrates very clearly their <Col N="2734" /> distrust of the British Government and their motives in this connection.</P>
    <P>The time has now arrived for us in the spirit of the Forum report to acknowledge the role and contribution of the Unionist population on this island.  The Taoiseach has many times referred to his own Protestant background which is undoubtedly a matter of respect.  I can make no such claim in family ties of blood beyond the fact that since boyhood I remember with great pride and affection, the visits of many Protestant Orangemen to our home in Tipperary, people who had befriended my father in the years he spent in Belfast after his release from Belfast jail during the War of Independence.  I have been privileged to know and respect their independence and integrity and to appreciate even more fully the unlimited role which they can play in a new Ireland where a future based on co-operation and understanding will offer new promise and new hope for all the people of this island.</P>
    <P>The Republic to which Thomas McDonagh, a son of Cloughjordan in the constituency I am proud to represent which is a happily integrated Protestant and Catholic community, was committed was one based not on domination by one tradition over another but on the recognition that stability and peace in Ireland could only come through arrangements which accommodate both of the main Irish traditions, the Republican tradition and the Unionist tradition, no majorities, no minority.  Let us not forget it.  Both are Irish traditions and if we are to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation, both will have to come together in agreement and harmony.</P>
    <P>We in the Republican tradition are proud of our past.  We remember 1916 and Thomas McDonagh with pride and satisfaction.  Those in the Unionist tradition take pride, and rightly, in their past, in Derry, Enniskillen and the Boyne.  We understand and respect their feeling of pride.  The debates of the past are matters for historians, not for politicians. Our obligation is to the present and our aim is to build for the future political structures.</P>
    <P>I hope that if the agreement goes <Col N="2735" /> through it will not create further divisions between minorities and majorities but that rather it will be the beginning of something much richer.  It is for those reasons that our reservations are genuinely expressed.  All of us welcome the fact that the debate in the House has been conducted in a calm and reasoned manner and I hope nothing will be said to misunderstand or misrepresent our role in Opposition.  We have an obligation as an Opposition to question and seek answers.  I hope the answers to some of the questions I have raised will be forthcoming before the debate concludes or otherwise it will not have served its purpose.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to re-echo what our leader said yesterday.  All of us, particularly members of our party, are conscious of the fact that, as constitutional politicians we cannot and must not ever cede the ground to those who have shamed the very meaning of republicanism. If the risk of that cession is there, all of us will be guilty at least of an oversight or something much more serious. For that reason I plead with the House, and the Government speakers who will be responding, not just to engage in general vague commendations and hopes of reconciliation.  We all share those hopes but I appeal to them to answer our reservations and explain to us in particular if the terms of the agreement will give effect to the intentions and cannot be used to give effect to the intentions that all of us will totally and utterly oppose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a little over 20 years in this House and in all that time, in all the issues that have come before the House, I have never felt the same sense of responsibility as I do in contributing to this debate.  That is because the issue before the House is one that can have very far reaching effects indeed on the whole future development of this island.  It can have those effects either for good or for evil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to make one thing perfectly clear.  As far as I am concerned, the people who have engaged <Col N="2736" /> in these negotiations have been motivated at all times by one over-riding consideration, the preservation of human life on this island and reconciliation between the two traditions in Northern Ireland. They have worked unceasingly, not only through their political careers and for that effort that they have made and I know will continue to make, I salute them.</P>
    <P>Rules have been laid down for this debate and I think, very sensible self-imposed restraints.  In order to ensure that I do not cross over these, I must say this about the Fianna Fáil position, I do not agree with it &mdash; full stop.  As far as rules go and apart from the one that I have mentioned, I have made a personal decision that I am going to dispense with rules that one normally imposes on oneself speaking on major political issues. Long time serving Members of the Dáil, used to political life, usually consider their political careers &mdash; and I have done it over the years; every politician who is neither very foolish nor very naive does it.  I am suspending that consideration.  I am making no attempt whatsoever, in my contribution to this debate, to cover my political backside.  I feel and have always felt with regard to the tragedy of Northern Ireland that one is not entitled to have any other allegiance that would supersede the preservation of human life and one must make any and every contribution possible to bring some form of peace and normality to our fellow Irish men and women of all traditions.  I intend to use that as my only criterion in my comments here.</P>
    <P>I have fears about the possible outcome of this agreement.  I wish it well; I think most people of goodwill wish it well. However, wishing it well would not make it work.  All the goodwill and good faith of people on either side &mdash; British or Irish Governments &mdash; will not make it work. As is clearly established in the agreement itself, it can only work if it has the co-operation and participation of both communities within Northern Ireland.  I must say that I am less than optimistic about <Col N="2737" /> the participation or co-operation of any Unionist in Northern Ireland to this agreement.  As the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have rightly said, this agreement, if it were to work, would help to defeat the men of violence in Northern Ireland, it would draw away support from them.  I accept that and I know what is motivating our negotiators in this &mdash; to defeat the men of violence and to stop the killing.  But the other side of that coin is that if the agreement does not work, if they can be the losers in one situation, they can be the winners in the other.  If anyone were taking bets at this moment looking at the reaction right across the whole spectrum of Unionism, the odds would not be on this agreement working.</P>
    <P>Dealing still with the North, and I see this agreement in two parts &mdash; its effect on Northern Ireland and its possible effect on this part of the island &mdash; we had a Sunningdale experience that lasted for five months, of an Executive shared by both communities.  There is a considerable difference between that arrangement and the present one.  First of all, Sunningdale had the backing of all parties in this House; this one quite clearly has not, so we are starting off, tragically in my opinion, with a division within Dáil Éireann on this agreement and a division which can widen and deepen as things possibly may develop over the next few weeks or few months.  We also had the active participation and the support of the majority, in my opinion, of Unionists within Northern Ireland for the Sunningdale arrangement and, in fact, some of their leading men &mdash; Brian Faulkner, for instance, a Unionist, and a hard Unionist all his life, and a very astute politician to boot &mdash; was not only supporting it, he was presiding over that Executive.  That is not the situation today.</P>
    <P>We have reaction from the wild men on the Unionist side &mdash; and God knows they have them, just as the Nationalist side have them &mdash; right down to where we see the moderator of the Presbyterian Church now going to No.  10 Downing Street to register their fears on the agreement. That would lead me to believe that the possibility of this agreement as now <Col N="2738" /> presented working is very slim indeed.  I say that and I hope that everyone listening to me believes that I say that with very deep regret indeed.  There was a genuine effort made in this to achieve a very desirable end.  However, wishing for something, hoping for something, wanting something does not make that something become a reality.</P>
    <P>I believe that there are very big dangers in the present situation.  They are not dangers confined, in my opinion, to the northern part of this country.  Again, I am saying things here and I am taking no account of political cover for my back because one has to say them when one thinks of the over 2,000 people who have been killed on this island over the past 15 or 16 years.  Please God there will be no more, but the possibility exists of more joining that number.  There is therefore deep obligation on us to speak out truthfully and honestly on this.</P>
    <P>In this agreement there is an arrangement for an Irish Minister and Irish civil servants to be involved with the British Secretary of State and British civil servants in the administration of Northern Ireland.  There have been different presentations of this: how consultative is &ldquo;consultative&rdquo;?  On our side, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other people, have piped up that this is more than consultative. It is not merely a consultative role; it is somewhat more than consultative. It falls somewhere between being consultative and being joint authority.  It is clearly being conveyed that if it is more than consultative there is a degree of responsibility for the administration of the North and for the security forces operating in the North.  Certainly I would not accept responsibility for all the security forces in Northern Ireland at present. To me the possibility of the repercussions of that arrangement on this part of the island raises grave fears indeed.</P>
    <P>We have had the difficulties in Northern Ireland over the past 15 or 16 years &mdash; terrible sufferings, killings and atrocities. We have had some down here too but nothing of the same degree.  Does any sane, responsible person think that the happenings on this island over the last 16 <Col N="2739" /> years have not, to some extent, destabilised our democratic institutions?  If one looks at our democratic institutions at present one will see that there are many things assailing them.  We have very large unemployment figures.  We have a population who, to say the least, are sick to the teeth with a taxation system acknowledged by all, Government and Opposition to be unjust and which places an almost intolerable burden on one sector. We have had an escalation of violent crime, a very considerable escalation. Over a period of 15 or 16 years all of these things tend to destablise and, let us acknowledge it openly, lead to widespread disillusionment with this House and a questioning of its relevance.  All of these ingredients are very dangerous in any democracy.  Let us not under-estimate that.</P>
    <P>I intend to speak up.  I have said we have had wild men on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland.  Of course, we have seen the atrocities and the cold blooded murder perpetrated by the IRA over that period.  Let us not just look at them and say: we will have none of that.  We all know, if we want to openly acknowledge it that things could develop in Northern Ireland in the foreseeable future &mdash; and the possibility of their developing under this agreement &mdash; for which we could be perceived by our own people as being responsible and which could have very serious effects on this part of the island. I am going to ask openly: What was the mood in this part of the island when, not the UDR or the B Specials, but a British para-regiment cut loose and killed 13 people on Bloody Sunday?  What was the mood, the reaction here?  It was very widespread and we all know that to be the case.  If, and God forbid, an atrocity of that type were to recur with our people sitting in Belfast accepting a degree of responsibility for it, I shudder to think what that might do and what a destabilising effect that might have on this part of the island.  We must face up to these matters.  We must put them out on the floor and at least address ourselves to that possibility. <Col N="2740" /> I believe, and I have always believed, that a start in trying to solve the situation in Northern Ireland can be made only within Northern Ireland.  The main thrust of this agreement is to try to get the Unionist people, the SDLP and constitutional Nationalists, to sit down and arrive at an arrangement that would allow them, as fellow Ulstermen, to have a power-sharing arrangement at executive level and there is an inbuilt incentive in this agreement for just such an endeavour. In this agreement there is a mechanism whereby, if the Unionists and constitutional Nationalist parties can sit down and arrive at an agreement for devolved Government, certain aspects of the administration of Northern Ireland would be taken from the Inter-governmental Conference and handed over to them.  That provision was inserted, very wisely, as one of the most appealing aspects of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the situation from the Unionist side.  Unionists would not concede power sharing at executive level since the fall of Sunningdale.  As the Taoiseach said in his introductory remarks, many of us here still believed that power sharing offered the only real chance of a beginning to the solution of the Northern Ireland tragic situation.  The Taoiseach said in his remarks &mdash; I do not necessarily have to quote him directly &mdash; that he had held that view even after 1980, that some time after 1980 he sought a solution in a wider context.  I still hold the view that that offers the only chance of a beginning to the solution.</P>
    <P>One could readily see from the television interview last night with the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church how deep a shock the whole Unionist community has received through the emergence of this agreement.  What may not have been acceptable and would have been dismissed out of hand last month might seem much more realistic now. That is also implicit in this agreement.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Unionists will not in any circumstances co-operate or participate in anything that involves the Inter-governmental Conference to be established under the agreement.  That is an <Col N="2741" /> arrangement which the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland have sought over the years.  I am fully aware of that. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, John Hume and Séamus Mallon have all said one thing &mdash; the agreement is fine if we can implement it.  That is where we are now.  It is not a matter of who did what in 1916 or 1974 or 1980.  We must address ourselves to the problem of where we go from here. How do we get some normality into the political life of Northern Ireland?  That is the only priority.</P>
    <P>In another context as a trade union official I have seen workers in a factory demanding an increase of, perhaps, 30 per cent and being advised by those responsible for carrying on the negotiations that their demand might have certain consequences if it were conceded, yet being pushed into demanding the 30 per cent increase and having no alternative but to pursue that aim.  They were in full agreement with the aspirations of the people they were representing; they could see the logic and justice of their claim and totally identify with them; but they could also see that the successful pursuing of the claim could have the effect of closing the factory.  There are no winners if a factory closes.</P>
    <P>This agreement is not worth the paper it is written on if it cannot be implemented and I do not believe it can be implemented if we exercise our full rights under its terms.  We and the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland have achieved in a solemn agreement, signed and published, the right of an Irish Government to have direct input into the affairs of Northern Ireland.  We all have rights in certain situations and certain aspects of our lives but many times we may choose for various reasons not to exercise those rights.  I am not suggesting that this major achievement on behalf of the Nationalist community should be put aside and dismantled.  I am suggesting that if it would allow serious discussions to commence between the two communities in Northern Ireland for an executive power-sharing arrangement, it might be extremely beneficial if <Col N="2742" /> we were to say that, in the event of such a power-sharing executive being established and maintained, we would seriously consider not actively exercising our rights for the continuance of the arrangement at Conference level.</P>
    <P>We may disagree profoundly with the Unionist viewpoint, but let us recognise the reality that once they see us actively participating in governing they will not operate at any level within Northern Ireland.  If that happens let nobody be under any illusion.  I greatly fear that what we have seen in that part of the island up to now would count as very little compared to what we might see in the future.  I also emphasise my fear that these developments would affect the whole island.</P>
    <P>I set out the rules for what I would say in my opening remarks.  I am not seeking to score political points.  I have been a member of the Labour Party since the age of 16 years.  I have always adhered to the party and always tried to further their views.  Nothing, including the Labour party or any other considerations, personal or political, supersedes the overriding consideration I have always had in relation to Northern Ireland &mdash; the preservation of human life.  It is in that spirit that I have contributed to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendment in the name of Deputy Vincent Brady, the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, which was clearly enunciated in the House yesterday by the Leader of our party.  I would support any effective measures which might be taken to improve the position of the people in the Six Counties, particularly the Nationalists. Having listened to the Taoiseach's opening statement, I am convinced that we in Fianna Fáil made the right decision in submitting our amendment which, I believe, is more in keeping with the wishes of the Irish people and a truer representation of the findings of the Forum report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 1 of the agreement gives no commitment to a united Ireland.  I would like to have seen a declaration by the <Col N="2743" /> British that they believe it would be in the best interests of all sections of the communities on both islands if Ireland were to be united on terms acceptable to all the people of Northern Ireland.  That has been the position of the Nationalist parties here through the years.  They would have wished the British Government to make such a declaration.  The SDLP have also suggested that the British Government should make such a declaration.  Indeed, the British Government, following the partition of this country, recognised that eventually the country would have to be united. Had such a declaration been included in Article 1 it would have been a positive step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the agreement contains a declaration that if in future the majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, they will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish.  That is not entirely new because section (1) of the British (Northern Ireland) Constitution Act, 1973, says something similar.  It declares that Northern Ireland remains part of Her Majesty's dominions and of the United Kingdom and &ldquo;it is hereby affirmed that in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it cease to be part of Her Majesty's dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of the people in Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for the purposes of this section in accordance with section 1 of this Act.&rdquo;  In other words, in the last official recognition by law in the British Parliament it was recognised that if a majority in the Six Counties decided as a result of a poll that they wanted a united Ireland, the British Government would not stand in their way.  Therefore, there is nothing new in that section and while it has been stated on numerous occasions by successive British Prime Ministers over the last 15 years it is not the first occasion on which that was written into law by Parliament in Britain.</P>
    <P>This part of the declaration was never accepted previously by an Irish Government. <Col N="2744" /> It is now incorporated in the Anglo-Irish agreement.  Article 1 (a) affirms that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  This is legitimising the prop to the Unionists and writing it into an international treaty which will be registered at the United Nations.  This guarantee has always been opposed by all Nationalists, including the four parties to the Forum.  It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach should have moved so far from the position taken by one of his predecessors, John A. Costello, who with the then Leader of the Opposition, Eamon de Valera, proposed a declaration which was adopted unanimously by Dáil Éireann asserting the indefeasible right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory.  That has been the position of all the parties in this State since then.</P>
    <P>In the same declaration in May 1949, they also condemned the British legislation which first introduced the guarantee to the Unionists in 1949 in the Ireland Act following the declaration of a republic. The Forum represented at least 90 per cent of the constitutional Nationalists on this island and chapter 4, paragraph 1, stated that this fails to take account of the origin of the problem, namely the imposed division of Ireland which created an artificial political majority in the North that has resulted in political deadlock in which decisions have been based on sectarian loyalties.  Chapter 5, paragraph 1, states that the guarantee has in its practical application had the effect of inhibiting dialogue necessary for political progress. It has had the additional effect of removing the incentive which would otherwise exist on all sides to seek a political solution. It is quite clear that the Forum were totally opposed to the guarantee and saw it as a major stumbling block to any progress in a solution to the tragic situation which exists.</P>
    <P>Following the Sunningdale Agreement, Jack Lynch said that we wanted to maintain the substance and principle of the original motion passed in 1949.  That <Col N="2745" /> was a reference to the unanimous declaration of this House to which I referred earlier.  Despite the Forum's condemnation of the guarantee, it has been included in the present Anglo-Irish Agreement and for the first time in a legal document, an international treaty, which will be registered at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister has no commitment to Irish unity in the future and she made that very clear on Monday in the House of Commons when, in reply to Adam Butler who asked her to confirm that a united Ireland was not the aim of her Government, she said &ldquo;Most certainly not, I confirm that&rdquo;.  She also stated in the House of Commons and on television that the agreement contained the most formal commitment ever given by an Irish Government about the status of Northern Ireland.  In negotiating this agreement, the Irish Government started from a weak position because of the Taoiseach's attitude to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  On numerous occasions he has given his views on these Articles and this week he stated in Cork that he regretted their inclusion in the Constitution. Some years ago he started a constitutional crusade to have them removed from the Constitution.  This was a weakness in the negotiations because our negotiators were opposed to Article 2 of the Constitution.  Article 1 of the agreement is a contradiction of Article 2 of the Constitution.  Article 2 of the agreement provides for the establishment of a Conference at which the Irish Government will have the power to put forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland, for example, political matters, security and related matters, legal matters and the promotion of cross-Border co-operation.  The Irish Government will only have the power to put forward views.  The word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; does not appear in the agreement.  The British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have made it clear that decision-making will be retained for Northern Ireland by the United Kingdom.  This puts our Government in an impossible position as they will only be able to put forward views.  They will be assuming a certain <Col N="2746" /> responsibility for actions but there is no indication that their views will even be listened to.  Listening to the Taoiseach yesterday in the House, I failed to understand how he could say that this provision goes beyond a consultative role.  I believe that the power to put forward views falls very far short of a consultative role. While our Government can put forward views there is no indication anywhere in the agreement or indeed from anything that has been said since that the British Government would consult the Irish Government about any matter.</P>
    <P>In a leading article on 10 November in <i>The Sunday Times</i> it is stated:</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald's Government would have responsibilities to the Nationalist majority without the power to exercise them.</P>
    <P>That puts the Government in a very difficult position because they will just have the power to put forward views, to make proposals, but there is no indication that any of these will be accepted.  The Government do not have any authority other than to put forward views.</P>
    <P>Article 3 provides for a secretariat to be established by the two Governments to service the Conference.  There seems to be some doubt as to where the secretariat will be based.  The Taoiseach informed us yesterday that it would be based in Belfast, but the British Prime Minister made it very clear in a television interview last Friday that the decision to place the secretariat would depend on the advice of security chiefs.  In other words, she did not state that the secretariat would be in Belfast or indeed in the Six Counties.  The agreement provides for devolved government in the Six Counties. In his opening address the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>If devolved government in Northern Ireland can be agreed upon the Inter-governmental Conference now being established shall no longer have any competence in those areas affected by devolution.</P>
    <P>This means that in the event of a fully devolved administration in the Six Counties <Col N="2747" /> the Irish dimension would go into voluntary liquidation.  In other words, as each department would be devolved the Irish Government no longer would have a role to play, and in the event of a return to a Stormont administration the Irish Government would no longer be involved.  In my view, this means we would have a return to the Stormont type Government, with the added disadvantage of an internationally binding agreement accepting the guarantee.  This would be totally unacceptable not only to the people of the Six Counties but to those in the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>All the democratic rules which apply throughout Europe and which we all cherish never existed in the Six Counties. There can be only two forms of administration there, power sharing between the various parties, which is not the democratic way in other European countries, and the alternative, majority rule, through which the artifically contrived majority, as they did for 60 years, would have total control.  The only settlement which can bring lasting peace and stability must transcend the present Six Counties boundary, and this can best be done by a constitutional Conference involving the British and Irish Governments and both communities in the Six Counties, who could then formulate a new constitution for the whole nation.  That is what we should have been looking for, but we have missed the opportunity.  The opposition given in the Forum report pointed in that direction.  It was the Forum's wish that there would be a permanent settlement to the tragic situation that exists today.</P>
    <P>As a representative here for two of the Ulster counties, I resent the application of the name Ulster to the Six Counties. If the people who use this terminology, members of the British Parliament and the British Press, studied the geography of Ireland they would have a better understanding of the artificial nature of the Six Counties boundary and of the reason why it was set up as a State &mdash; to ensure the permanent majority of one <Col N="2748" /> community over the other.  If the suggested constitutional Conference were set up, the Taoiseach said yesterday, the Unionists would boycott such a Conference. As long as the guarantee is there, there is no need for the Unionists to interest themselves in such a Conference. It is in the interests of the Unionists, as it is in the interest of all the people on this island, to have a permanent settlement which would bring peace and harmony. The only way that can come about is through the unity of the country.  I believe the Unionists should have and would have a say in the formulation of a Constitution for the whole island.  That is what the Taoiseach should have been looking for.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the agreement states that the subjects for consideration will include measures to foster the cultural heritage of both traditions, changes in electoral arrangements, the use of flags and emblems and the avoidance of social and economic discrimination.  Article 5 (b) states:</P>
    <P>The discussion of these matters shall be mainly concerned with Northern Ireland, but the possible application of any measures pursuant to this Article by the Irish Government in their jurisdiction shall not be excluded.</P>
    <P>I hope that whoever is replying to the debate will explain that part of that Article and tell us the implications it has for the Republic.  For example, are there implications in it for a change in the electoral arrangements?  The Article states that the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the role and composition of the police authorities. The joint communique issued after the Summit states that the conference at its first meeting will consider:</P>
    <P>(a) the application of the principle that the armed forces (which include the Ulster Defence Regiment), operate only in support of the civil power, with the particular objective of ensuring as rapidly as possible that, save in the most exceptional circumstances, <Col N="2749" /> there is a police presence in all operations which involve direct contact with the communities.</P>
    <P>I attended the conference of the SDLP before this agreement was signed and I listened to the unanimous call for the disarmament of the UDR.  It was stated at the conference that a former Chief Constable of the RUC had said that the regiment should be disbanded.  That has been the view of the minority community in the North and indeed of our people in the South &mdash; that the UDR should be disbanded, that they are a sectarian force which succeeded the B Specials which were disbanded.  The only commitment we got in the agreement is that they will still be there, still operational, but that they will have an RUC man with them. It is reasonable to say that no Nationalist in the Six Counties will be happy with that.  The behaviour of the UDR is well enough known to all of us.</P>
    <P>Our Garda and our Army are doing an excellent job in Border areas and I am concerned that as a result of this agreement there will be the danger of our security forces being drawn into much closer liaison with a security force who are discredited as is evident from the numerous reports of senior British legal personnel down through the years, apart from what we know about these forces.</P>
    <P>In an article headed, Fixing Ulster, in the current issue of <i>The Economist</i>, there is the comment that Mrs. Thatcher has won, but by no concession of principle, a new sword for fighting terrorism and a new ploughshare for uprooting the Irish soil in which it grows.  If that is a reference to this side of the Border it is a reference that I would resent.  Everybody here knows that 99 per cent of the violence in Northern Ireland originated in that part of the country.  I abhor violence either in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  Human life is sacred and should be respected. There is no need for this massive uprooting of the Irish soil as <i>The Economist</i> puts it.</P>
    <P>In today's issue of the <i>Financial Times</i><Col N="2750" /> in an article written by A. H. Hermann and Raymond Hughes it is stated that the agreement provides for British proposals to be made for certain aspects of Government within the Republic as well as the other way around, mostly in matters of security, and that a tough British stance on extradition and on cross-Border joint patrols would demonstrate that the Republic has agreed also to a degree of informal joint authority on its own territory. I would be very concerned at the possibility of our security forces becoming involved in closer liaison with what are a discredited security force.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also because the British Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons on Monday that the proposals and the views of the Irish Government would not be made public.  Regardless of who might be in power here and putting forward proposals or views or accepting any liaison with the security forces on the other side of the Border particularly where that might involve joint patrols, as is suggested in the <i>Financial Times</i> this morning, the Government of the day would have a duty to inform this House of their proposals and thereby give to the House an opportunity to make a decision in that regard.</P>
    <P>A much more radical change than that outlined in the communiqué would be necessary to make the security forces acceptable to the Nationalist community. There are many aspects of the administration of justice which need radically and urgently to be altered.  For example, the use of plastic bullets which has been the cause of so much death and injury should cease, while the supergrass trials which were the subject of a motion in this House last year should be abolished.  It is interesting to note that the Government's response to that motion was not to condemn the supergrass system but merely to note it.  Although the agreement was signed only on Friday last, the British Prime Minister has said already that she does not see how mixed courts could work.  One may ask if she is standing back now from the spirit of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said it was the intention of his Government to accede as soon as <Col N="2751" /> possible to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  It is a matter for concern that persons charged with political offences should be handed over to a jurisdiction in which there is so little confidence.  Persons alleged to have committed such offences should be tried under our judicial system.</P>
    <P>The only way in which the Northern Ireland problem can be settled is through peaceful means.  Though I am disappointed with the outcome of the agreement I consider the Taoiseach to have been right to continue the negotiations at intergovernmental level, something which he criticised the leader of our party for in 1980.  The then Deputy FitzGerald believes that the route to progress is through the Unionist community.  I am pleased the Taoiseach has now accepted the route initiated by Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>Article 9 of the agreement deals with cross-Border co-operation on security, economic, social and cultural matters.  It relates to the conference setting out a programme of work to be undertaken by the Commissioner of the Garda and the Chief Constable of the RUC and, where appropriate, groups of officials.</P>
    <P>Section (b) of that article provides that the conference shall have no operational responsibilities.  The main thrust of the agreement is based on security.  Our Government are placing themselves in an impossible position by accepting responsibility for security without having executive powers.  I should like them to elaborate more on the matter of cross-Border economic co-operation.  Will that co-operation benefit both sides of the Border?  It has been recognised for many years that as a result of Partition the Border region of the Twenty-six Counties has been deprived.  One need only consider the towns along the Border for evidence of this.  Clones which is surrounded on three sides by the Border is an example of that deprivation.  There is no indication in the agreement that there will be any special economic assistance for those counties on both sides of the Border.  There has been EC aid by way of various cross-Border economic funds, <Col N="2752" /> but is there to be any special aid now from that quarter as a result of this agreement?</P>
    <P>For a number of years there have been in operation cross-Border development committees consisting of elected and executive members of local authorities. Do the Government intend to support efforts of this kind?  They have not done so in the past.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Taoiseach referred to the implementation in the agreement of Forum principles.  I had the honour to be a member of the Forum, a body which represented 90 per cent of constitutional Nationalists on the island. The Forum in their report were very clear regarding the structure they would like to see emerge.  That is outlined in Chapter 5.7.  The principal recommendations of the Forum were rejected totally by the British Prime Minister in her now famous out, out, out speech.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, too, at the legitimising of the guarantee in an international agreement of no commitment to work for a united Ireland.  I am concerned also at the implications for our security forces and the lack of any positive commitment to a radical change in the administration of justice in the Six Counties.  A great opportunity has been missed to progress towards a settlement which would bring lasting peace and harmony to all the people, Nationalists and Unionists, in the whole island.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Seo í an dara huair a dearnadh tréaniarracht <Col N="2753" /> toradh maith a bhaint amach don tír ar fad, agus a thaispeáint do na fir ghunnai &mdash; cibé as a dtagann siad &mdash; gur féidir, trí chóras daonlathach, fadhb polaitíochta a réiteach ar deireadh ionas go mbeidh seans ag gnáthmhuintir na tíre saol mar ba chóir a chur ar bun dóibh féin agus dá gclann.  Ba iad an Comhrialtas a rinne na hiarrachtaí seo, Comhrialtas 1973, faoi chinnireacht Liam Mac Coscair ag Sunningdale, agus faoi láthair ag Hillsborough faoi chinnireacht an Teachta FitzGerald mar Thaoiseach.</P>
    <P>Bíonn neart le rá i gcónaí ag lucht an Fhreasúra faoi Náisiúnachas agus eile ach fíor-bheagán a rinne siad faoi nuair a bhí an seans agus an cumhacht acu.

    <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh chuile rud atá déanta ag an Rialtas i rith na laethanta deiridh agus guím rath Dé ar an obair atá le déanamh as seo amach.</P>
    <P>I was not around in 1921 in the historic days of the setting up of this State and the winning of our national freedom.  I can only look at those events through the window of history.  If one could draw the blind of history down, one would realise that what has been achieved in recent days is as good a starting point as could have been achieved at any time in our past from which we can progress and develop our country.</P>
    <P>I had the honour to serve as a Fine Gael Member on the New Ireland Forum.  I was privileged to be a part of that historic political momentum.  While its perferred recommendations were not acceptable in any of the three forms to the British <Col N="2754" /> Government, breaching as they did that Government's definition of sovereignty, it did bring before the peoples of this trouble-ridden island the realities of political life and the difficulties of today. While the recommendations were naturally nationally biased, they played an important role in bringing to the attention of all Irish people at home and abroad the degree of determination which democratic, nationally-minded and constitutional politicians in this part of the country, and some from the North, were prepared to display and implement in order that this sad saga might be brought to a new plane with more positive and beneficial results for all.  The achievement of the historic Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 focuses on the reality of political life in Ireland today.  The measure of the old and oftentimes misdirected republicanism has been laid to rest.</P>
    <P>The rules covering this debate are logical and have a common sense approach. It would be very easy to resurrect the ghosts of the past which have wandered through this House at various times.  This agreement has bred a new understanding, a realistic and enlightened form of nationalism in its truest sense.  The old ideas belong to a different era.  We can justly take a sense of pride from what I consider to be turning the country towards moderation and peace.  Let there be no hysterical screaming or emotional elation at the new direction in which Irish nationalism is pointing.  There will not be any promises of unity within ten years, as was promised by some Fianna Fáil speakers in earlier times.  Instant unity, unlike instant coffee, is not readily available.</P>
    <P>This agreement must work.  To do nothing is to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and this means the continuation of murder, mayhem and carnage; it also means countinuing fear, trepidation and human suffering on all sides to an intense degree. It makes one wonder what kind of mentality, from whatever tradition, brings young people or their elders into a position where they shoot and maim people. The perpetrators of violence and murder must be shown that democracy can, and <Col N="2755" /> will, prevail and all moderate and reasonable opinion must be led to understand this without fear to their rights, dignity, values or ethos.</P>
    <P>This agreement falls short of executive functions and goes beyond a mere consultative role.  It is the best that could have been achieved at this time, and it must work.  It is a sophisticated, intelligent agreement; it is also very fragile and delicate.  For 700 years people have been speaking about the problem of Northern Ireland and the domination of this country by British rule.  The distinguished journalist and editor of <i>The Spectator</i>, Paul Johnson, outlined what had been attempted by various British administrations during the centuries.  At the start of the last decade he wrote:</P>
    <P>In Ireland over the centuries we have tried possible formula &mdash; direct rule, indirect rule, genocide, apartheid, puppet parliaments, real parliaments, martial law, civil law, colonisation, land reform and partition.  Nothing has worked.  The only solution we have not tried is absolute and unconditional withdrawal.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted by politicians in this part of the country over the years that to attempt to unite Ireland by force would undoubtedly lead to carnage and civil war.  Therefore a determined effort had to be made, and has been made, to do something in the meantime.  There is no point in talking about this unless we do something about it.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this agreement is of crucial importance.  The difficult work has been done and great credit is due to the teams concerned.  The drafting of the agreement entailed many hours of detailed discussion over 18 months.  Can we now convince the Unionists of the validity of our case?  Do we really care about Northern Ireland?  Its importance in our list of priorities in the Twenty Six Counties must be considered.  Have we tried over the last number of years to build this country into one that would be attractive to the people in the North and elsewhere that would encourage them to <Col N="2756" /> join us, to live in harmony with us, to prosper and develop?  Have we really tried that?  I have heard rabid Republicans shout about the fourth green field and in many cases their friends, relatives and spouses will have spent the day shopping in Northern Ireland to the detriment of our economy.  It is a twisted version of Nationalism that has emerged over the years.</P>
    <P>We can validly point to what has happened to people of different religious persuasions in the Twenty-Six Counties.  In this administration we have elected people of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion. We appointed Jewish Lords Mayor in various cities and the late President Childers was a Protestant who carried out his duties in an exemplary fashion.  Can we not convince people in the North by talking to them that this is not an assumption of power by a Dublin Government or an attempt to overrun by force or devious means the people of the Six Counties?</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community can feel genuinely secure in that they will have as the Permanent Representative at the Conference, Deputy Peter Barry, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who in his capacity as Minister has been accepted across the divide in Northern Ireland as a reasonable, logical and determined individual.  We could not find a better person to take up the first appointment as Permanent Representative to the Conference. It is important that Catholics and Nationalists can have their grievances and difficulties aired at the Conference by a person of the stature of Deputy Peter Barry.  The British Prime Minister stated that the right of sovereignty over Northern Ireland is not breached so far as the British Government are concerned.  I am sure that the discussions between the civil servants, the Ministers, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister went into detail about the definition of &ldquo;determined efforts&rdquo; in the agreement.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that after the initial meetings of the Conference positive progress comes from the discussions, otherwise people will say <Col N="2757" /> that this is merely a propaganda exercise and a talking shop.  I do not accept that it will be such but, as Deputy Cluskey said this morning, we remember the deep tribal feelings that were unleashed in this part of the country after the events of 1969-70.  There are people on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland who are bad minded enough to attempt to provoke similar happenings.  In that context that courage and determination of the delegation from the Twenty-Six Counties must be admired.</P>
    <P>The Unionist position is shocking at this time.  The comparison has already been made that if tomorrow the British Prime Minister in conjunction with the President of Argentina were to announce the appointment of a Minister or Commissioner to look at the Falkland Islands, objective opinion might say that the writing was on the wall, that the British intended to pull out.  I am sure some Unionist opinion tends that way.  The reverse would happen here were we to have involvement by the RUC or Ministers of the Crown.  The agreement is delicate and fragile but it contains the seeds of progress which must be acted upon.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil attitude towards this agreement is somewhat unclear.  The initial remarks of the party leader implied total rejection.  They seem to have mellowed somewhat.  I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition, having got due recognition from the Taoiseach for his part in initiating these Anglo-Irish discussions, would have accepted this agreement for what it is worth although it might not go as far as he would wish, while hoping to get back into power. Deputy Haughey may have felt that the person to whom credit will go for sorting out the Northern Ireland question will achieve a place in history of monumental proportions.  Perhaps such a feeling spurred Deputy Haughey to initally reject this historic agreement.  I am sure moderate opinion in Fianna Fáil wants to accept this agreement and give it a chance to work.</P>
    <P>I have spent ten years here as an elected representative and have seen the <Col N="2758" /> Office of the Taoiseach occupied on six occasions.  Since the foundation of the State we have had a small number of Taoisigh.  I am sure Fianna Fáil opinion in a general commonsense approach agree that this agreement should be given a chance to work.  There has been a general feeling of relief rather than surprise and opposition from other sides towards the agreement.  The agreement has the approval of world opinion and local opinion.  There is no point in people here saying they want unity.  Everybody aspires to unity.  That aspiration has been recognised in the Forum and it has been recognised in this agreement.  It is the duty of politicians to legislate and lead and we must say how we want to achieve unity.  This agreement is a start.  The average Nationalist opinion in Northern Ireland in the context of unity would mean &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; but that cannot happen for obvious reasons.  The process started here is distinct from the evolution of political ideas.  It is important to spell out the steps to unity.  This agreement is the start of that process.  It starts on the path towards reconciliation and equality and makes an eventual approach towards achieving the legitimate aspirations of all nationally minded people.  It is important that the momentum inherent in this agreement be maintained and highlighted in a positive and beneficial way.</P>
    <P>Unionists must understand that the three important items in Unionist feeling are accommodated.  They are their Protestantism, their Britishness and, to a degree, the context of power which has been extremely important to them over generations.  The British Prime Minister said after the last Anglo-Irish agreement: &ldquo;We must not close our eyes to new ideas.&rdquo;  I am glad that after the Chequers Summit, which was not received well in this country for many reasons, the Government here and the Taoiseach in particular have been able to convince the British Prime Minister of the necessity for and the validity of the case for attempting to do something about this very long standing and bitter problem.</P>
    <P>Through emigration and so on a very high percentage of people from my <Col N="2759" /> county live in Britain and from speaking to them I realise that they feel that, if this agreement can be implemented and seen to work for the benefit of Nationalists and all the people of the North, the attitude of Irish people living in Britain towards the British Prime Minister in the next election could be very different from what it was on the last occasion.  It would be ironic if, instead of seeing her as the devil in disguise, because her conviction and strength held out and the agreement was implemented beneficially they supported her and her party to a degree never experienced in the past.</P>
    <P>It is important that the British Prime Minister should be seen as having the capacity and strength of leadership to withstand Unionist reaction.  I hope and trust that vigilance abroad will protect everybody in the best way possible.  All agreements have ripples and difficulties and in that context this one is no different from any others signed over the years. Probably people expect that there will be a reaction of one sort or another from extremists in the context of violence and people must understand that that is possible, but unity is preferable to and more acceptable and desirable than disunity, and to maintain the <i>status quo</i> is not sufficient.  We must point the way forward and indicate the steps towards where we want to go for the achievement of everybody's legitimate national aspiration.</P>
    <P>Anglo-Irish relations will never be the same again.  The lodging of this signed agreement internationally with the UN changes for ever the status of Anglo-Irish relations.  The common perception in the streets of Ireland is that at this time world opinion &mdash; Fine Gael, Labour, the SDLP, the US Government, the Speaker of the House of Congress, the British Government and others across the globe &mdash; supports this agreement.  On the other hand, albeit for different reasons.  Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Unionist opinion and the DUP oppose it.  Everybody with common sense can understand the economic benefit of achieving better progress.  North and <Col N="2760" /> South, than we have had to date.  I understand that this morning Congressman Biaggi mentioned $400 million for the economic benefit of the North if this agreement is accepted by both Houses here.  That will have to be debated in the Houses in America.  At present the IDA compete with the IDB for the attraction of manufacturing industry into our country. That is a waste of effort and of money in many cases and we have lost out as a country.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that, having been in the front line of Nationalist politics in the North through all these troubled years, the SDLP would have received unanimous Nationalist support from this part of the country.  If the SDLP did not back this agreement it would not be worth the paper it is written on.  Through the years the SDLP leaders, for whom I have the greatest admiration, have been burdened with the pressures of Nationalist politics in Northern Ireland and have performed exceptionally well.  The hope expressed in some Fianna Fáil quarters that the Deputy Leader of the SDLP, Séamus Mallon, would reject this agreement is a monstrosity.  He has been under tremendous pressure.  I have great admiration for him.  He has a very keen understanding of the complex problems of the North and has never been afraid to stand up and speak his mind on behalf of those whom he represents.  To attempt to pressurise him into not accepting this agreement could have disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the agreement is now our problem and I trust that in that area the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his team will not be afraid to spell out to their counterparts in Belfast the difficulties as we see them and as pointed out to them by Nationalist opinion in the North.  What happens when the delegation from this side raise a problem which is not acceptable to the other side, when the Secretary of State says that they do not accept our views on this matter? At the end of the day will the Taoiseach have to telephone the British Prime Minister <Col N="2761" /> and say: &ldquo;Let us get this sorted out if we can&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If support for the men of violence falls off, as it did during the power sharing executive of 1974 when Catholics and Nationalists could see that their representatives were in a position to do something, that would be very beneficial.  I would prefer to see a devolved power structure in the North sooner rather than later.  I would like to see the agreement leading to that as rapidly as possible.  The Inter-governmental Conference could then withdraw from both areas that were not covered by their common brief.</P>
    <P>We stand at a crossroads in our history. I trust that the effect of the agreement will be to bring about a devolved power structure as soon as possible and that all traditions in the North can be accommodated. There will be no all-party constitutional conference.  We had the Airlie House experiment in Washington with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, The Workers' Party, the SDLP, the DUP, the OUP, Alliance, Conservatives and the British Labour Party represented around the one table.  There were divergences of opinion, extreme in some senses, and there were some areas of common ground.  An emotional debate at that conference centred on security, and this will be of paramount importance in the context of this agreement.  I am impressed by Robert Kennedy's words: &ldquo;Few men have the greatness to bend history itself but each of us has the opportunity to change events in our daily lives, and in the sum total of these changes shall be written the history of the present generation.&rdquo; I trust that this agreement will write a new chapter in Irish history.</P>
    <P>I conclude by quoting the words of Dr. Paisley when he said recently, &ldquo;We are going to show people that Ulster people have grit, courage and determination&rdquo;.  I ask him and his followers to use that grit, courage and determination not for the destruction of Ulster or of the island but for its future development, prosperity and happiness.  This agreement must work.  A line from Yeats is going through my head: &ldquo;Who knows what is yet to come&rdquo;?  I put my faith in this agreement. <Col N="2762" /> I put my trust in the Government who have brought it about, and I hope and pray that the delegation led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs will achieve positive, beneficial results for everybody on the island as a result of this agreement.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I agree with Deputy Kenny's final words expressing the hope that this agreement must work, and we all hope it will work.  Nevertheless, I must give the agreement a somewhat guarded welcome.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach, his officials and the Ministers concerned acted in all sincerity in drafting and accepting this agreement, or that all concerned believed and felt that they were working towards peace and stability in the North.  That is a noble and worthy objective.  Unfortunately, that is as far as it goes.  There is nothing in the agreement which could not have been obtained without reneging on a far more noble and worthy objective, that of national unity.  No matter how the Taoiseach tries to crawl away from that reality, I am afraid he cannot escape it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the deplorable condition of the surgical wing of Wexford General Hospital; the proposals, if any, he has for commencing work on the new surgical wing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 18 and 44 together.  I am aware of the fact that the standard of accommodation in the surgical unit at Wexford General Hospital is unsatisfactory.  The provision of a new surgical unit together with ancillary facilities such as X-ray, out patients and accident and emergency departments, are at an advanced stage of planning. This project will proceed to construction stage as soon as capital resources can be made available for this purpose.  I cannot yet say when it will be possible to do this and, in the circumstances, it is not yet possible to be precise about the starting date for the project.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of a paediatrician at this hospital, the estimated cost of this appointment together with the necessary support staff is of the order of £230,000 a year.  The capital cost of providing and equipping accommodation must be added to this.  In the present difficult budgetary situation, I am not in a position to make extra funds of this order available to the South-Eastern Health Board.  However, I have indicated to the board that I am willing to consider any proposals which they may have for the redeployment of resources within their allocation to provide a paediatric service in Wexford.</P>
      <P>At present, paediatric services for Wexford are provided from the regional paediatric unit at Ardkeen in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister fully aware of the position at the surgical hospital in Wexford and that, it has been claimed, the theatre there resembles something from the stone age?  Is the Minister aware that the orderlies still carry patients to and from the theatre up two flights of stairs on a stretcher made from canvas and two poles?  In view of those outdated facilities does the Minister agree that the new hospital should be built immediately, as proposed in 1982 when money was provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a need to reconstruct the hospital.  I gave the go-ahead for the site development and the contract was awarded in July 1983.  That work is now complete but the total work involved will cost £9 million. <Col N="2765" /> I am currently examining the 1986-87 capital programme of the Department to see how we may facilitate the development but at this stage no final decision has been taken in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that with over 1,500 deliveries per year in Wexford Hospital it is deplorable that a paediatrician has not been appointed? Will he agree that it is a short-sighted policy not to provide the money having regard to the need for a paediatrician bearing in mind what such a person could do to ensure healthy infants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 400 people employed in Wexford Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no paediatrician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure applies to the beginning of 1984.  The proposal now for the paediatric unit, which I have some doubts about, is to appoint an additional 12 staff nurses and three senior house officers at a cost of £250,000 per year.  That proposal was put forward by the health board.  There will also be some capital cost involved because the female ward will have to be adapted to paediatric use.  I have suggested to the health board that they should come forward with a proposal to redeploy resources and, possibly, a lesser requirement than 12 staff nurses for the unit.  I am not certain that they require three senior house officers for such a unit.  Paediatric services are being provided at the Ardkeen paediatric unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the capital requirements for the paediatric unit could be incorporated in the capital requirements for the extension to the operating theatre and the surgical unit? Is the Minister aware that for the last five years in the surgical theatre in Wexford two temporary anaesthetists have operated because no permanent Irish staff member is prepared to work under such atrocious conditions?  As a result of that <Col N="2766" /> we have to employ foreign anaesthetists who are not registered to provide the facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three consultant anaesthetists in that hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole time equivalent is two and for a hospital with 66 surgical beds that is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  I will put my question slowly because it is obvious the Minister has difficulty in understanding me. Is it a fact that since 1979 the operating theatre in Wexford has functioned with two foreign temporary anaesthetists for the simple reason that no qualified Irish person is prepared to work under the atrocious conditions that exist there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure about that.  I readily concede that the general conditions in the theatre are not satisfactory and that has been the position for a long time.  I am endeavouring to deal with it but I must point out that there are three anaesthetists &mdash; two whole time equivalents &mdash; and two surgeons in the hospital together with a consultant radiologist, two consultant physicians and two obstetrician gynaecologists.  In fact, there is an orthopaedic surgeon in the hospital. I would not downgrade the hospital that much if that is what the Deputy is preoccupied about.  There are 12 house officers in the hospital, including two locums.  I am satisfied that the priority in the hospital now is to go ahead with the construction of the hospital as quickly as possible.  I can assure Deputies Byrne and Ormonde that I regard it as a major priority.  Wexford and Ardkeen are the two major priorities, now that Castlebar is under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the present stage in the negotiations with the IMO on payment to doctors in the GMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for a new contract for doctors participating in the GMS were put to the Irish Medical <Col N="2768" /> Organisation by my Department.  Following the organisation's recent AGM, a meeting which had been scheduled with my Department was postponed by the organisation.  A new date has yet to be set by the organisation.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the proposals were not acceptable to the members of the IMO at their AGM.  If this is so I would regard it as a matter of deep regret, since the proposals represented a means of strengthening general practice by diverting some of the money currently spent on drugs into investment in support staff and continuing education.  The new style of practice envisaged in the proposals would emphasise prevention and patient education within a pattern of fewer but more meaningful consultations.  If this opportunity is lost patients, doctors themselves and the taxpayer will have lost out.  It will also be necessary then for me to consider what action I must take to remedy some of the defects of the present system which cannot be allowed to continue to operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that he regretted that the doctors had not accepted a scheme whereby if they saved on the cost of the drugs which they prescribed for their patients it would improve their conditions of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the attitude of the IMO at the annual general meeting.  I am not sure how many attended that meeting, but the decision is that they did not accept my proposals, or at least that there was hostility towards them.  That is unfortunate, but the IMO and I will have another meeting, I gather, in December, following which they will be coming to me with their further decision.  I am prepared to wait until then, but certainly not much longer because the Estimates for 1986 and the work which must be done in this area cannot be delayed in that fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question.  In the earlier part of his reply I understood him to say &mdash;<Col N="2769" /> and I understood that this was one of the proposals from his Department &mdash; that if the medical profession curtailed the cost of drugs which they prescribe for patients, their conditions of service would be improved with the money so saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That was so.  That is the proposal which has been rejected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not in the interests of the public that there should be an incentive of that nature to doctors, that they curtail the prescribing of drugs for patients?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In brief, the proposals I am putting to the IMO, which were approved by the Government prior to my putting them because of the substantial sums involved, meant a reduction in drug costs of about £15 million.  Of that sum, about £8 million would go to the doctors by way of higher fees, grants for the employment of support staff in their practices and payment for participation in continuing education, which is very necessary in GP practice.  The other £7 million would go to meeting the other contingencies.  For example, in the GMS this year there is already a £5 million overrun.  Frankly, after patient negotiation for two years, the end of the road is coming and if these efforts are not successful we will introduce other measures. We have no option but to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the last comment of the Minister, has he ever taken the opportunity of visiting a surgery of any doctor within the GMS and observing <Col N="2770" /> the number of patients there?  Has he devised some method whereby he can tell patients to go home on that day because they are over-visiting their doctors?  If so, will he tell them that on a particular day at a particular stage they have now exhausted their visiting rate for the year? That is what he has been trying to say.</P>

The bureau will continue their promotion of an alcohol education pack named &ldquo;Living and Choosing&rdquo; for use in post-primary schools and they will co-operate with the Irish National Council on Alcoholism in promoting responsible drinking habits amongst the general public.  It is also intended that the bureau will continue their programme of providing information to the general population on alcohol-related issues through a lecture service made available through a joint arrangement with health boards.</P>
      <P>In relation to drug abuse, the Deputy will be aware that the special governmental task force on drug abuse underlined the potential of education as a means of prevention.  The task force believed that the provision of suitable education services would ensure the maintenance of a high level of public awareness of the drug problem in the community.  Arising from the task force's recommendations many activities have been undertaken in the education area, in particular teacher training and programme development focused on at-risk urban areas.  I have funded a diploma course in addiction studies in Trinity College for the past few years.  This course provides specialised training for workers in direct contact with drug abusers and their families.  Such workers include social workers, nurses, gardaí and teachers.</P>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau have designed programmes aimed specifically at heightening public awareness of the real and immediate dangers of drug abuse.  The bureau have been involved with health boards and other agencies in training doctors, pharmacists and teachers as drug educators.  The Health Education Bureau have also co-operated with the curriculum development unit of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and Trinity College in producing an information booklet called &ldquo;Understanding Drugs&rdquo; written at a suitable reading level for adults who are not particularly good readers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2772" /> The Council of Europe's European Health Committee are sponsoring a pilot project in the Dún Laoghaire area which involves detailed education at a number of different levels&mdash;at school level, at the level of parents and of the community.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that I have made money available to the Community Action on Drugs, National Federation, to enable them to expand and develop their current activities in the area of drugs education.  It will be seen from this that considerable progress has been achieved in implementing the task force's recommendations in the area of prevention.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that in the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown it is stated that it is widely felt that alcoholism is a major contributory factor to the breakdown of marriage in Ireland, does the Minister feel that the work of the bureau, in encouraging moderation, is making any progress, particularly as the bureau has been in operation for quite some time?</P>

The pressure on me from the Deputy's constituency in relation to tobacco advertising, from his own area, has been enormous, incessant, not to do what we are doing.  But when I see so many young people in our psychiatric hospitals, so many of our young people suffering from occupational absenteeism; when I see the Department of Social Welfare paying out tens of millions of pounds in disability benefit, where it is clearly related to alcoholism, or alcoholic-related claims, then I think we should take action on it. <Col N="2774" /> But I shall conclude by saying there is great opposition to that in the country.</P>

      <P>When I was considering the selection of members for appointment to Comhairle na nOspidéal I had to take a number of factors into account.  I decided that, in principle, a number of places should be filled by new appointees as I believe that a policy of rotating membership is a correct one.  I also tried to achieve an even spread of members from around the country and to have a representative balance between the various specialities.  Furthermore, I received quite a number of nominations for membership from many bodies and it simply was not possible to appoint all of them.</P>

      <P>I did receive a number of nominations from the North-Western Health Board, five in all.  Within the statutory requirements of Comhairle na nOspidéal, I had to try to balance the number of specialities throughout the country.  I had to ensure also that a number of chief executive officers were represented on Comhairle na nOspidéal and, in the North-Western Health Board, I was pleased to ask the chief executive officer to continue on as an outgoing member.  That is the reason.  The hospital services in Sligo and Letterkenny are, generally speaking, extremely good.</P>

In that connection the Minister referred earlier to various submissions having been made to him.

Brennan about comhairle representation for the North-Western Health Board, in the Minister's reply he talked about the specialities and the qualifications of the personnel he has chosen, notwithstanding the fact that there is no medical representative in the north-west.  Is the Minister now saying that there were not suitably qualified personnel in the two acute general hospitals in the North-Western Health Board area &mdash; Sligo and Letterkenny &mdash; for membership of Comhairle na nOspidéal?

It is the national body and I have not met in any of the medical faculties or any of the other faculties relating to community care the slightest criticism regarding the 27 appointments. Politicians who come into this House with parochial preoccupations are, with respect, going down a <i>cul-de-sac</i>.  The published list comprises specialists from all over the country.  It is not confined to Sligo, Letterkenny or any other part of the north-west.  I would submit that the CEO of that area, who is responsible for the administration of two major public hospitals, is more than capable of representing that area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 16 together.  Free immunisation against measles was introduced at the beginning of October.  It is too early to assess the overall response. While in a number of areas an up-take of 50 per cent and more has already been achieved, other areas have been slower to respond.</P>
      <P>My Department are in regular contact with each health board about the progress of the scheme and arrangements will be made as indicated by local circumstances, for example by supplementation of general practitioner coverage by public clinics, if it is considered that this will be more productive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>For the very simple reason that successive Ministers for Health over a decade had planned to introduce it.  Most of them were not long enough in office to do anything about it.  I convinced the Government that we should spend £1 million on immunisation this year and I am sure that in ten years' time, when there will be a drop in mental and physical handicap as these children reach child-bearing age, it will be regarded as having been worth while expenditure in relation to public health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister extend the two-month period which is due to expire at the end of this month in regard to the measles vaccinations?  I endorse what he said about my support for that scheme.  Is he satisfied that the community care departments have proper statistics of the children who should be immunised?  Will it ever be possible to find out exactly what percentage of the children who should be immunised are actually immunised, having regard to the fact that children who have had measles in the past do not need immunisation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider the question of an extension but it will have to be in consultation with the general practitioners and their representative organisation.  The returns have <Col N="2779" /> been patchy.  For example, in Clare there is an 83 per cent take-up but in one area in Dublin is it 11 per cent.  It varies considerably through the country.  The returns we have are accurate but whether we have all the returns is another question. I will take considerable care in checking the data.  The results in some areas have been very heartening &mdash; Kerry, 51 per cent; Clare, 83 per cent; Longford-Westmeath, 74 per cent; Waterford, 23 per cent.</P>

The HEB will be reporting to me on the response to the television advertisements and the other publicity material issued.  We are dependent to a considerable extent on the GPs because they are the people in direct contact with the public.

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the incidence of acquired immune deficiency disease in Ireland; the steps which have been taken to ensure the accurate diagnosis and surveillance of suspected cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome; and if he is satisfied that our arrangements for epidemiological surveillance of AIDS is in conformity with the highest international standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.  Eight cases of AIDS have been diagnosed in Ireland to date, seven among homesexual or bi-sexual men and one haemophiliac. Five have died, one has gone abroad and two are under care.  The groups most at risk of developing the disease are bi-sexual or homosexual men, intravenous drug abusers, people who have received transfusions or blood products from an infected source and sexual partners of AIDS patients or AIDS suspects.  There is no evidence to date that casual or social contact with others presents a risk of infection.</P>
      <P>Measures taken for the control of the disease in this country include the following:</P>
      <P>1.  Detailed instructions have been given to health boards about arrangements for reporting and surveillance of cases and suspected cases of AIDS. These instructions are updated periodically to take account of new information about the disease as it becomes available.  The surveillance system is working satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2783" /> 2.  In accordance with World Health Organisation recommendations, the Blood Transfusion Service Board have been using heat treated blood products only since 1 January 1985.  In addition, the board have made arrangements to provide our total requirements for these products from domestic blood. These are important measures for the protection of our haemophiliac population. Persons in the at risk groups are asked not to donate blood.  All blood donations are tested for the presence of AIDS virus anti-bodies.</P>
    <P>3.  Arrangements have been made for routine anti-body testing of intravenous drug-abusers.  Other persons who suspect that they may have the disease should make arrangements for AIDS anti-body testing through their general practitioner or at an STD clinic.  Confirmatory testing as required is arranged at the virus reference laboratory, UCD, Belfield.</P>
    <P>4.  In addition to the information already circulated to health boards, a general informatiion booklet on AIDS for all doctors is in course of preparation. An information leaflet for the general public is also being prepared. In the normal way, counselling and education are matters for the family doctor.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that our arrangements for monitoring developments in Ireland and internationally relative to the disease are adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to cause alarm but, in view of the rapid spread of this disease in other western countries and the fact that there is no treatment for it, is the Minister satisfied that the measures he has in mind, particularly for the information of the public, are sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to give as much detailed information as possible.  For example, I have encouraged direct contact between the Deputy Chief <Col N="2784" /> Medical Officer of the Department of Health and the media.  I have asked him to speak to various groups and to the media in a professional capacity about the various aspects of this disease and he has done so very competently.  We are deficient in terms of written information, but that is being remedied.  This matter has been the subject of considerable public misconceptions and fears.  Nevertheless, eight cases have been diagnosed so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is growing public concern about this condition.  I questioned one of the Minister's predecessors in this House about four years ago and he did not know very much about it.  At the time the press and the public thought I had gone mad.  However, that is beside the point.  Is the Minister satisfied that our methods of surveillance comply with the conditions laid down by the international centre for the control of that disease in Atlanta in the United States? Does the Minister have any statistics on the incidence of seriologically positive cases of the HTLV3 virus which exist in this country since a certain percentage of those seriological positive cases may develop the overt disease?  Has the Minister any statistics in relation to the AIDS related complex which is now causing considerable concern internationally since it is more likely to be transmitted by a hetrosexual contact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Our dependence in terms of reporting arrangements has been for the most part the WHO questionnaire which, as the Deputy knows, is very complex.  I am reasonably satisfied from the discussions I have had in the Department that the directors of community care have made satisfactory reporting arrangements.  I am satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of alertness and that we do not need to be too preoccupied with the Atlanta report.  I will write to the Deputy to give him the seriological data and other relevant matters. I made a public statement about the incidence of positive reports, and I do <Col N="2785" /> not want to cause undue public alarm about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify the position regarding blood given by donors for transfusion to others?  What type of testing is carried out on such blood to ascertain the presence of AIDS? Does the Minister regard the testing being done as satisfactory?  Would he specify if testing is done for seriological analysis and is he aware that it takes three months to ascertain if anti-bodies are developing?  He referred to deep freezing of blood.  Would he agree that this destroys the essential red cells and therefore is not suitable for transfusion except in limited cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of critical importance that suspects in any circumstances should not present themselves to the National Blood Transfusion Service and try to avail themselves of the automatic testing which the service now carries out on donors.  The other tests can be done separately.  I have made substantial additional cash resources available to the transfusion service and major precautions are being taken in this matter. The board have been using heat treatment to blood products since 1 January and I am assured that the deficiencies referred to by the Deputy are being looked at in the process.  We are not now importing any blood because there was a substantial risk of infection from certain imported blood.  All our blood requirements are now being filled by domestic suppliers.  Great precautions have been taken in the last four or five months under new chairmanship: an excellent board member has been appointed chairman of the transfusion service and our service is now a match for any transfusion service in the world, including the UK and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>All blood donors are <Col N="2786" /> tested for the AIDS virus.  A number of representations have been made by individuals who wish to give blood to their relatives.  That is not acceptable. The precautions now in force are very extensive.  We spent money in 1985 in this and the Government have made more money available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 22 together.  I am aware that considerable reductions could be made in the cost of the drugs supplied to medical card patients without any reduction in the standard of patient care. In particular, the prescribing of generic drugs and the limiting of the number and quantity of drugs prescribed to what is strictly necessary would produce very substantial savings.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a new contract for doctors in the general medical service which would encourage economies in the drugs bill by promoting a style of general practice which is less dependent on the prescribing of drugs has been under negotiation between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation for some time.  The views of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board have been fully reflected in my Department's position during these negotiations.  In the interim I have supported fully the efforts of the payments board to encourage more economical supply of drugs, in particular the supply of low cost generic drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have determined limits for expenditure by each health board in 1985 in pursuance of section 31(1) of the Health Act, 1970.  A copy of the relevant document specifying the approved limits has been sent to each health board.</P>
      <P>The limits are subject to adjustment in respect of expenditure arising from certain approved pay increases which are not covered in the limits already specified, and in respect of the expenses of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>Compliance with the approved limits is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's intentions regarding the way in which these section 31 orders will be implemented?  In other words, will the health boards be in a position to fulfil their statutory obligation to provide services if they do not have the money to provide them and will staff be paid at the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The health boards were told during the year that all of their expenditure would have to be in accordance with section 31.  The Deputy knows the consequences of failure to adhere to that, consequences that could include the removal from office of members of a health board right down the line.  The same applies to a CEO.  If he acts outside the bounds of the section he can be suspended or removed from office under section 31 of the Health Act, 1970.  That is one of the main reasons for our not having had any supplementary budget for health during the past three years.  We are all living within our budgets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to avoid a supplementary estimate for health if the service is not provided.  Does the Minister expect the health boards not to provide their statutory services and will he accept <Col N="2790" /> that those health boards who do not have the moneys they require are not in a position to borrow because of the section 31 order?  Does the Minister expect them to refuse to pay their staff at the end of this year or does he intend to remove members of the boards from office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any health boards who are not providing a statutory service that they are required to provide.  Early this year the health boards told me that, if they did not get between £25 million and £30 million, they would not be able to provide the services they are obliged to provide but, in the event, they have provided these services. The Southern Health Board said they would be short to the tune of £9 million but it transpires that they may be short by £500,000.  The health board in the Deputy's area, for instance, will practically break even.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme and the sight testing scheme have been suspended by health boards in a number of community care areas.  However, in those areas where the schemes are suspended dental and optical services for eligible adults are still provided through the health boards' own dental and community ophthalmic services. Due to increased demands on these services arising from the suspension of the <i>ad hoc</i> schemes waiting lists have developed and the health boards have found it necessary to give priority to certain categories of patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those normally afforded priority are &mdash;in the case of dental services &mdash; persons requiring treatment for the relief of pain, the handicapped, the elderly and nursing and expectant mothers and &mdash; in the case of optical services &mdash; those with a medical <Col N="2791" /> condition and the handicapped and the elderly.  The health boards will review the position in relation to the operation of the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme in the light of their financial allocations for 1985.  The allocation of funds between the different services they provide is a matter for the individual health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My question referred to the dental services.  The Minister says that the <i>ad hoc</i> dental service is not being provided in community care areas but he must accept that there is no dental service for any adult in a number of community care areas, including the one I work in, except in respect of the occasional patient who is awaiting operation.  The poorest people are paying the equivalent of two to three weeks supplementary welfare in order to provide a dental service for themselves.  The Minister must be aware of that.  Is this not one area where the health boards have a statutory obligation but an obligation they are not fulfilling because they do not have the funds to do so?</P>

      <P>The equipping of Beaumont Hospital has not been completed. The most expensive items of equipment such as x-ray, laboratory and electrical equipment will be ordered nearer the commissioning date as the warranty begins to run from the date of delivery.  As the Deputy is well aware, the delay in opening Beaumont Hospital is due to certain difficulties which arose with the consultants in relation to the provision of facilities for private practice at the hospital.  I have been making every effort to resolve these difficulties.  Discussions have been taking place with the Irish Medical Organisation on the issue and I am very hopeful that the matter can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, one which will allow Beaumont Hospital to be opened as soon as possible.  It is my intention to arrange for full negotiations with representatives of all the other categories of staff involved as soon as the situation with the consultants has been satisfactorily resolved.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very serious concern in the north Dublin area about the insufficient number of acute hospital beds?  Would he accept that ideology has prevented the opening of Beaumont Hospital?  He wanted the consultants to have their private rooms across the city, anywhere they liked, but not on the campus of Beaumont. This can be justified only on the grounds of ideology.  Would he not at this stage enter into negotiations with the other interested parties in Beaumont to ensure that that hospital will be opened at the earliest possible date?</P>

      <P>As long as I am fortunate enough to hold this position, there will be no private hospital built on the grounds of that hospital and the consultants know that.  I do not have the money for it.  If the people of north Dublin are deprived of health services, it is because of the attitude of a very small group, probably no more than a dozen, who are determined that they will have the &ldquo;give away&rdquo; which the Fianna Fáil Leader gave them a few years ago and which was a disgraceful waste of public money.  This has everything to do with ideology.  Wasting money, duplicating facilities, having a two tier health system is something we cannot stand over and the Deputy knows it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the consultants were prepared to lease the land to build the hospital? Would he not accept that it is in the interests of the patients that the consultants should be on the campus as long as possible every day?  Would he not accept that there is no logic in his perception where he has no objection to the consultants being in Dún Laoghaire, Mount Carmel or anywhere else when they have finished their mornings work in Beaumont. The Minister will agree, I hope, that the correct place for the consultants to be is on the campus and, as long as it does not cost the Exchequer anything he should allow them to build their private hospital and consulting rooms.</P>

I also told the consultants that I would lease them a small piece of land for private consulting rooms so that they would not feel so deprived.  The reality is that <Col N="2795" /> with the Mater private hospital due to open &mdash; 120 beds &mdash; and the private hospital in Blackrock, there are now so many private beds in Dublin that, even if these consultants wanted to build such a hospital, they would have to examine the cost benefit involved.  If they do not take this step, the VHI could finish up like the PMPA.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As the leader of our party stated yesterday, there are some aspects of this agreement which are good.  I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and his officials acted in all sincerity in accepting this agreement and that all concerned believed they were working towards peace and stability in the North.  That is a worthy and noble objective but, unfortunately, that is as far as it goes.  There is nothing in the agreement which could not have been obtained without reneging on a more worthy and noble objective, that is, national unity.  There is no way the Taoiseach can escape from that reality.  It galls me and every member of the Fianna Fáil Party, as well as everyone who aspires to the objective of national unity, to see the leader of this country fooled into a formal acceptance of Britain's claim to sovereignty over the northern portion of our country.  It is no wonder the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, was preening herself when she proclaimed at the press conference that she is both a Loyalist and a Unionist.  One could also say that she did proud by her own kind and her own people.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for our Taoiseach.  All the Taoiseach got is a room with a view, a room in Stormont Castle which is the seat of British rule in Ireland.  The Taoiseach will have a view that might not always be considered by the British Government. It was made quite clear by the British Government and the Prime Minister that any decisions north of the Border would be made by the British Government and decisions south of the Border by the Irish Government.  The Taoiseach has <Col N="2846" /> responsibility without authority and has legitimised the regime that has been responsible for the strife and bloodshed he is trying to stop.</P>
      <P>As the leader of our party said yesterday when replying to the Taoiseach, the whole basis of this document is an acceptance of British sovereignty over Northern Ireland as an integral part of the UK and that what must be done is to smooth out the difficulties which the British Government encounters in ruling this part of its kingdom.  Deputy Haughey also said:</P>
      <P>The new Conference is designed to achieve this smoothing out; to help in particular to reconcile the Nationalist community with a British administration which they have always seen as alien and oppressive.  Our opposition to this agreement is that its thrust is in the wrong direction, the whole trend of these developments is toward seeking to bolster up the existing political structure which in itself is the cause of the trouble, the source of violence and instability, and which always will be as long as it remains.</P>
      <P>That says it far more effectively than I could hope to say it.  Deputy Haughey highlighted the problems that will affect us as a result of aspects of this agreement. Perhaps worse than that is that the Taoiseach has acquiesed in a massive PR campaign to sell this agreement.  The Taoiseach has worked overtime to obtain the support of our international friends for the terms of the agreement.  In doing so the Taoiseach was further nailing home the British Government's claim to sovereignty over the North, something that our Constitution expressly denies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might also be forgiven for saying that several years ago the present Taoiseach amidst great pomp and ceremony, launched his so-called constitutional crusade.  One is tempted to ask at this stage, is this his ultimate aim in setting out on that constitutional crusade? How in future years can Governments, probably Fianna Fáil Governments, claim the right to jurisdiction over the severed part of our island when this agreement is lodged in the UN <Col N="2847" /> as an official international treaty?  Deputy Haughey referred to this agreement yesterday as a very insubstantial document which was given status beyond its worth. Any agreement that confines itself to legal and security matters and refers to cross-Border co-operation without a reference to the largest single industry on both sides of the Border is indeed an insubstantial thing.  It is ironic that the only real cross-Border co-operation this year came in the wake of the disastrous weather conditions this summer which affected farmers North and South of the Border.  The British Government representative in the North, having failed to have their case taken up at EC level by their own Government, joined with Northern MEPs, including Mr. Ian Paisley and joined with our MEPs to demand and get concessions on grain for fodder. The Northern farmer suffers under British rule because British agriculture policies apply across the board.  These policies are the same for the rich pasture-lands of East Anglia and for the small farmers in the North.</P>
    <P>The agriculture post in Dundonald House in Belfast has traditionally been aware of those policies and has been the preserve of dukes and earls who merely administer the policies set down by the London Government without offering any local input.  An example of this is in relation to the super-levy milk quotas part of which were transferred from the North for the benefit of the British farmer.  Another example was the insistence by the Northern Minister, Lord Lyle from the east coast of Britain, which had not been affected by the weather to any great extent, that British agriculture be treated as a single unit in seeking EC aid. The Minister could not see the need for special measures for the North.  Significantly, Lord Lyle refused to contemplate an all-Ireland approach to the EC.</P>
    <P>The lack of an all-Ireland agricultural policy is one of the tragedies of Partition. It does not make sense that farmers straddling the Border should be subject to different regulations.  It has always been our contention in Fianna Fáil that a <Col N="2848" /> united Ireland would lead to progress, socially and economically.  This is manifestly true in relation to the agricultural industry.  Therefore, in the absence of a joint political approach perhaps the main farming organisations, the IFA, the ICMSA, the Ulster Farmers' Union and the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers' Association, could initiate such a move towards this end.  For example, at present nobody represents the Northern farmers in agricultural negotiations in Brussels.  Their case is Britain's case. What is good for Britain's farmers is not necessarily good for the North of Ireland farmer.  Certainly, there is far more common ground between the Irish farmers North and South of the Border than between the British and the Irish farmers. Imagine if we in the South were to accept whatever deals Britain negotiated for her farmers at the Brussels negotiating table. The suggestion is just as ridiculous for the Northern farmers in the context I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There would be problems, of course, in achieving an all-Ireland agriculture policy.  We all know that the larger Northern farmers are generally staunch Unionists of planter stock and I suppose in a sense they would cringe at any suggestion of unity with the South.  Ian Paisley is their champion and, while he might work for their benefit in an all-Ireland context, he would insist that it was merely co-operation with a friendly neighbouring state, nothing more.  The SDLP have long advocated a joint agriculture policy with the South or at least a policy based on the needs of the Northern farmer rather than those of his British counterpart.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the agreement before the House will not advance that aspiration any further.  It will become enmeshed in a gruelling, no win controversy over policing and security, subjects that have dominated the minds of the British and their agents in the North to the exclusion of anything else.  Britain has always felt that the problem of the North could be solved by military and security measures, but world opinion prevented the firm application of those measures.  Now that <Col N="2849" /> the Irish Government have committed themselves to supporting the British regime they have given their <i>imprimatur</i> to their security policies and have guaranteed Britain against international criticism. Surely it would have been far better for Irishmen, North and South, if our Government had spent their energies in promoting genuine cross-Border co-operation in areas such as agriculture without regard to Britain's diplomatic embarrassments.  I regret to say that these embarrassments will become ours when this agreement is signed.  In conclusion, as my party Leader said yesterday, I urge the House to reject this agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> When this Government set out with the British Government on the difficult path of negotiating an agreement between our two countries following the meeting at Chequers between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in December 1984, we had before us the basic objective of trying to find ways of enhancing the prospects for peace and reconciliation on this island.  We believed that, if we were to have any realistic hope of attaining this objective, it would be necessary to find ways of lessening the alienation of the Nationalist community in the North which the Forum in paragraph 5.1 of their report so clearly identified while, at the same time, providing concrete and visible evidence to the Unionist people that their position was not under threat.</P>
      <P>I believe that anyone who studies the text of this agreement carefully will see that it reflects fairly these two fundamental principles.  For the first time since the establishment of the state of Northern Ireland a formal structure, the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference, is to be established within Northern Ireland which will be given the specific remit of concerning itself with measures to recognise and accommodate the rights and identities of both traditions in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This represents significant progress because it means that the Nationalist population of the North now have formal recognition in a binding international <Col N="2850" /> agreement that their traditions and rights are to be placed on a footing equal to that of the majority population.  Nobody should underestimate the importance of this historic development for the Nationalist people of the North.  It represents not only formal acknowledgement by the British Government of the legitimacy within the State of those who seek to work by peaceful means for the re-unification of Ireland, but also provides machinery through which matters of major concern to them can be discussed and differences between the two communities reconciled.</P>
    <P>When this agreement was being signed, I was already on my way to the United States of America to provide briefings on the contents and implications of the agreement.  I believe that some account of my visit there is appropriate and that the reaction of people whom I met there may be of interest to Deputies in the context of their own attitude to the agreement.</P>
    <P>I went there mainly to meet two groups.  First, I met people in the general news media, with special reference to those based in New York.  After that I met various people with Irish-American interests including both people in Irish-American news media and other people active in Irish-American organisations.</P>
    <P>In the event, the agreement received very wide coverage.  The <i>New York Times</i> went to the extent of printing the text of the agreement in full, as well as giving it editorial support.  I believe it can fairly be said that the editorial and other press reaction in the main American news media ranged from favourable to very favourable.  Newspapers with a special Irish-American interest, not being dailies, had not appeared before I had left but, in general, the personal reaction I got from those whom I met from the Irish-American area, both in organisations and in news media, seemed to me to be at least as favourable as that shown by the national news media.  All in all, I was more than happy.</P>
    <P>I suppose it might be suggested that, as far as the Irish-American groups are concerned, I took care to ensure that <Col N="2851" /> those whom I met were people I could depend on to give a favourable reaction. That was not, in fact, the case.  Where Irish-American groups were concerned, I exercised some selectivity, simply because I did not think it would be helpful at this stage to extend invitations to people whose attitudes in the past have caused serious concern to a succession of Irish Governments.  However, I certainly did not set out to speak only to the converted, and to have done so would not have been consistent with one of the main objectives of my journey.</P>
    <P>It might be said &mdash; on the face of it, not unreasonably &mdash; that such a reaction as I have described, emerging in the immediate aftermath of my visit, is of little long term significance.  If all I could claim was that the immediate response was good, I would not myself see very much significance in it.  I would not be dismissive about it either, because the published reaction of major organs of opinion in the United States is important to us, as is the immediate reaction of Irish-American groups, but we in the Government are concerned with more than the immediate reaction and I am sure the House is also.  That is particularly so because, as we all know, for some years there has been a serious problem about misguided financial support for paramilitaries here and it is very likely that the level of that support can be affected one way or the other by the general reaction of Irish-Americans to the agreement. So the question arises: will the immediately favourable US reaction to which I have referred last?  I believe it will last.</P>
    <P>I believe this, first of all, for a reason I need hardly mention at all, namely, that I am convinced that the agreement is a good one that will be increasingly accepted as being so in the weeks, months and years ahead.  However, that is not a reason that will carry conviction to anybody who has a different view of the agreement, so I will pass on to other reasons.  And, of them, the central reason I am confident that the American reaction was no flash-in-the-pan, is that it <Col N="2852" /> was not the result of any public relations exercise by me because I did not engage in any such exercise.  I did not go to the United States to do a &ldquo;public relations&rdquo; job.  I am sure it would have been very easy for me to do that kind of job if I had set out to do so and to have ensured, in the short term, an even better reaction than has actually emerged.</P>
    <P>I could have done that for the very simple reason that the agreement is a carefully balanced document that recognises different and at times conflicting interests, and it would have been easy, though I believe very irresponsible, for me to have given a distorting emphasis to some parts of the agreement rather than others, tailoring my remarks and my responses to the special interests of particular groups.  I went out of my way to avoid doing so.  In fact I believe I can fairly say that, although my contacts amongst Irish-Americans were virtually entirely with those in the Nationalist tradition, I would not have had to change a word of what I said if my audience were made up exclusively of staunch Unionists and if my only remit were to persuade them to support the agreement.  No doubt I would have got some different supplementary questions from such an audience, but that is all.</P>
    <P>It says much for the agreement that I can say without hesitation that the case I made to encourage Irish-Americans of the Nationalist tradition to support the agreement is a case that I believe would encourage all but the most die-hard of Unionists to do likewise.</P>
    <P>On several occasions &mdash; and I am referring now to what I said to Irish-American groups and not only to the general newsmedia &mdash; I stressed that, at the heart of the agreement and the factor that I believed offered a new level of hope for peace and reconciliation, was the fact that for the first time there was a recognition of the legitimacy of the identity and aspirations of those in the Nationalist tradition and that this major advance was achieved without diminution whatsoever of the recognition of the legitimacy of the Unionist identity.</P>
    <P>Likewise, when issues were raised <Col N="2853" /> about the UDR and when some very rough things were said by one or two of my questioners about the role of the UDR and indeed the security forces in general, I took care, even in such circumstances &mdash; actually, I would say, especially in such circumstances &mdash; to give a balanced answer.  By a balanced answer I mean an answer that reflected in full the many grounds that Nationalists have had for serious complaint against the security forces and especially the UDR, but an answer that also recognised the fact that the UDR were genuinely regarded by many members of the majority community as providing an essential measure of protection against a ruthless murder campaign.  I repeatedly made the point that, in recent times, evidence of even-handed enforcement of law and order had been given by the RUC in some situations that were difficult for them.</P>
    <P>I explained that, in the circumstances that now exist where members of both communities have valid points to maintain, the best compromise currently available in relation to the UDR, and one that would recognise the legitimate interests of both communities, was the compromise that was being announced, namely, that both sides in the new Conference would be urgently discussing further ways of ensuring that as quickly as possible the stages would be reached where, except in very exceptional circumstances, a member of the RUC would accompany the UDR in situations where they would otherwise be in contact with the public.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that I can confidently claim that in my meetings in the US I presented the agreement as it is, not as some people on one side or the other might wish it to be.  That is why I have been able to say with assurance that I did not engage in a public relations exercise. What I supplied to my US audiences was, essentially, factual information.  Inevitably, and quite properly, I was of course asked for interpretation and assessment and indeed I offered some on my own initiative; but, as I said earlier, my answers were such that I could and would have given them in the same terms to a <Col N="2854" /> Unionist audience.  And it is because that is so that I feel confident that the initial response that the agreement has produced in the US will be maintained and that the American response will be reflected in a reduction of funds for paramilitary activity.</P>
    <P>I might say, in passing, that my experience in the US has reinforced my own confidence in the merits and the value of the agreement, for it has meant that people have come forward to support something that has been presented to them without any sales-talk in a balanced and even-handed way.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a related point.  I understand that, in a radio interview yesterday, a member of the Alliance Party, Mr. Glendinning, said something to the effect that I had made statements in the United States that suggested that behind the agreement there were secret deals detrimental to Unionists.  I think it is important that I should deal with this.</P>
    <P>I am glad to assure this House, and indirectly Mr. Glendinning and any others who may share his fears, that I did not make any statements that carried any such suggestions of that kind in any form whatsoever, as I think should be clear enough from what I have already said.  I did not do so and I could not have done so for the very good reason that there are no secret deals, whether detrimental to Unionists or otherwise.  While I did not hear the interview myself, I understand that what Mr. Glendinning was referring to was, or at least probably was, a newspaper report saying that I said in a television interview in the United States that the agreement was substantial and not merely advisory so, in effect, the Irish Government had been given a substantial role in the day to day running of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps say at some point &mdash; and this is as good as any other &mdash; that, while I tried to be careful in everything I said, I was not reading from a prepared text.  I spoke at length, in question and answer sessions and otherwise; and if, as inevitably happens occasionally, I felt that some particular statement or even some phrase of mine was perhaps not <Col N="2855" /> happily expressed, I tried to introduce a suitable clarification or balance subsequently.</P>
    <P>The particular newspaper report which I have mentioned and which I think Mr. Glendinning was referring to, was an edited account of what I had said.  In fact, in the interview itself, my reference to the Government's being given a substantial role came after and was directly linked with a statement that the new agreement provides that determined efforts will be made to secure agreement in the interests of peace and stability.  That being so, my comment was, and was clearly recognisable by viewers as being, my own assessment of the fact that both sides were committed to reaching agreement in the interests of peace and stability.  That explains the words, &ldquo;so in effect&rdquo;, which are actually quoted in the newspaper report.  Nobody who heard my remarks in full could possibly misunderstand them in the way in which Mr. Glendinning apparently did.  And I might add that, in that very same interview, and at a very early stage in it, I also made the point which I have already said I made on several occasions, namely, that the recognition of the Nationalist identity and of the legitimacy of the Nationalist aspirations, which the agreement has provided for the first time, is achieved without any loss to the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the House may be interested to hear a brief word about the fact that on that same programme, and at the same time, Congressman Biaggi was interviewed &mdash; in other words it was a joint interview.  As the House will be aware, Congressman Biaggi has for a long time shown a special interest in Irish affairs.  I do not think I would be introducing any note of contention if I said that his views have on occasion in the past diverged from those of Governments here, Governments of different political complexion, of whom indeed he has been critical.</P>
    <P>I would like of course to be able to say that he expressed himself as being enthusiastically in support of the agreement, but I cannot honestly go that far. <Col N="2856" /> However, I think it can fairly be said, without risk of exaggeration, that he was moderately supportive of it.  He had, earlier that day, on the basis of what I assume was a first look at the agreement, issued a more sceptical &mdash; though not a condemnatory &mdash; statement.  However, on further consideration, he moved to the position I have described.  As I have indicated, I would not want to overstate the position.  He certainly emphasised, indeed rightly I think, that the real test of the agreement will be how it will be implemented.  But, at the end of the day, he left viewers in no doubt that he believed that the agreement should be given a chance to work.  I was happy with the assessment from him and grateful for the trouble he had taken, in the interests of this country, to appear on the programme.</P>
    <P>I think it right to add that I was also glad to have had the opportunity to meet him.  His knowledge of and interest in Irish affairs were indeed very impressive; and if I hope that I was of some help to him in assessing the agreement, I for my part benefited from what he had to say to me on various points that arose in our conversation.  With that report, if I may so describe it, I now return to home ground.</P>
    <P>As I am a member of the Government and a member also of the party of which the Taoiseach is leader, I know it can seem to be just a sycophantic exercise if I say anything in praise of the speech with which he opened the debate.  But, having listened to him last evening, I cannot refrain from saying that few of his listeners can have been unmoved by the ringing sincerity of what he had to say and few can have been unimpressed by the strength of his determination to build bridges where bridges are so desperately needed.</P>
    <P>I also listened with great attention to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, and I propose to make a few comments on some of his remarks, especially some that impinge on matters in which, as Minister for Justice, I have a special interest.</P>
    <P>It will hardly come as a surprise that <Col N="2857" /> I disagree with much of what Deputy Haughey said and specifically with his conclusions.  But, as the Minister with special responsibility in the area of law and order, I think it is right to begin with an acknowledgment.  Although I regretted the tone of his remarks at certain points and felt they were a cause of some concern as to the effects they could have, yet I am glad to place on record my feeling that, in his speech generally, Deputy Haughey was careful about the way in which he put forward his criticisms of the agreement, careful in the sense that he was conscious of the possible effects of statements that might be inflamatory.  As I have said, that is a matter in which, as Minister for Justice, I have a special concern and I would now add an appeal that the tone that Deputy Haughey set will be maintained on that side of the house.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey's criticisms could be grouped under two or three heads and since one of them was security I think it right to respond to what he said on that score.  The heart of that particular criticism was, I think, contained in one short paragraph of his script, which was as follows:</P>
    <P>In this area also [here he was referring to security] the position will continue to be, that the decisions will be taken by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the British Government. This creates a situation where the Irish Government will be locked into a position where it will have to accept responsibility for the undesirable, an unsatisfactory and an unpalatable security apparatus and its operations without having any real control over them.</P>
    <P>That paragraph was followed by one which began:</P>
    <P>Is anyone prepared to make the claim that what is proposed in this agreement will provide lasting peace and stability to Northern Ireland even in the longer term...?</P>
    <P>To that I would reply that it is perfectly true that the agreement carries risks for <Col N="2858" /> us in the area to which Deputy Haughey's remarks relate.  What he actually says is, I believe, an exaggeration, for it ignores the fact that we will have a role and a substantial role and that there is commitment, which I am confident was given on the basis that it will be honoured, that determined efforts will be made to secure agreement.  But, that being said, agreement will at times not be forthcoming without concessions on both sides, and there will be risks.  I am certain that the Government would not wish to deny that or to blur it in any way.  Rather would we wish to underline it.  We recognise that there are risks, and in particular risks of political damage to us.  It is a measure of our commitment to the cause of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland that we are prepared to take those risks. No Irish Government can hope to achieve anything, either on behalf of the Nationalist population or on behalf of the population of Northern Ireland as a whole, unless they are willing to take risks and to commit themselves to doing so.</P>
    <P>Why are we prepared to take those risks?  I suggest that nobody who has read the Forum report would feel it necessary to look beyond it for an answer.  The answer leaps from its pages at various points, but if I were asked to single out one paragraph that sums it up, I would suggest paragraph 3.21, which refers to deaths of over 2,300 people, to injury or maiming of over 24,000, to over 43,000 recorded separate incidents of shootings, bombings and arson, to an increase in prison population from 686 in 1967 to 2,500 in 1983.  But over and above what is directly represented by those statistics, the paragraph draws attention also to the fact that thousands are suffering from psychological stress because of fear, intimidation and the impact of security measures.  I rather think that that reference to thousands is an understatement &mdash; I would suggest it must be tens of thousands.  And the paragraph makes the chilling point that the effect on society has been shattering &mdash; that there is hardly a family that has not been touched by <Col N="2859" /> death, injury or intimidation.</P>
    <P>Yes, there are risks for us in this agreement, and that is why I believe we should and must be prepared to take risks.  And that, too, is the reason why I suggest that when Deputy Haughey asks if there is anybody who is prepared to make the claim that what is proposed in the agreement will provide lasting peace and stability he is not asking the right question. Nobody with any sense of the complexity of the Northern problem could possibly make a claim that any agreement that might conceivably be made at this stage, or indeed for quite some time to come, would provide lasting peace and stability; nor should anybody claim that this one will do so.  What we claim and urge is that it offers a serious prospect, and by far the best prospect available, that it will do so. The horror of what has been taking place in Northern Ireland, to which I have just now alluded in my reference to the Forum report, is such that it is nothing less then our clear duty to take that option, with its risks and with its uncertainties, quite simply because it offers real progress &mdash; surely major progress &mdash; and that the available alternatives ought to be unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has suggested that we have abandoned our claim to unity and the rights of the Nationalist majority on this island.  Of course, we have done nothing of the kind.  The British Government know that; the Unionist community know it; and no prospect of temporary advantage in our dealings with either has tempted us to do so.</P>
    <P>When I was in the US I quoted more than once from a speech made by a former Taoiseach and Leader of Deputy Haughey's Party, Mr. Seán Lemass, during one of his own visits to the United States.  It was a speech in Washington in 1963, so, as I emphasised, it was not today or yesterday.  I made the point that, as well as being Taoiseach, he was himself a 1916 man and was also, as a political leader, like our Taoiseach, widely respected across party political boundaries. The following is the quotation, which I gave in full:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2860" /> We have always based our case for the reunification of our country on the assertion of Irish rights in the matter &mdash; our right to sovereignty over all the national territory, our right to reject the claim of a minority to vote itself out of the nation, and our right to have our national destiny decided by the democratic process of majority decision.  We have come to realise that the reiteration of rights is not enough and that we also need to have regard to the causes of the divisions amongst our people which were used as a justification for Partition.  We see our task now as reuniting the Irish people as well as reuniting Irish territory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey devoted much of his speech to a criticism of the agreement in the constitutional context.  His central theme is that we have acted in breach of Articles 2 and 3 and that we have thereby abandoned the claim to Irish unity, leaving a political vacuum to be filled by men of violence if it is not filled by Fianna Fáil.  I do not propose to embark on an argument about constitutional law.  If I were to attempt to do so, I should have to seek legal guidance from constitutional experts about what I might say and I see no reason why I should embark on such a course for the purposes of my present contribution.  But I would like to make just a few comments from a layman's standpoint and from what I believe is a standpoint of reason and commonsense on some of Deputy Haughey's remarks about the implication of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if we had abandoned our aspiration to unity, or even left its existence in some doubt, Deputy Haughey would, I think, have an arguable case in what he says about the dangers of a political vacuum.  The answer to him is that, as I have said earlier, that has not happened.  Frankly, I do not understand what he is saying about his position in the 1980 communique being misunderstood despite his explanations.  If he commits himself to saying that a change in the status of Northern Ireland &mdash; and, by the way, his communique, unlike the agreement, <Col N="2861" /> actually uses the word constitutional status, though I do not suggest that that adds any problem for him &mdash; if, as I say, he commits himself to saying that a change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority in the North, I personally accept without question his proposition that he was referring to what is its constitutional status as a matter of practical reality.  What I cannot accept is a suggestion, echoing an interpretation that he placed in a statement in the Forum report, that he was accepting the principle of the consent of a Northern majority in relation to the form of unity but not to unity itself.</P>
    <P>At the best of times, it seems to me to be stretching credibility to say that we can differentiate between the principle of consent in relation to any particular form of unity and consent in relation to unity itself.  But there is more to it than that. Deputy Haughey did not just say that a change in status would only come about with consent.  He said that he agreed with the British Prime Minister that it would only come about in that way.  He could not possibly have been in agreement with the British Prime Minister on this matter unless what he actually said was to be given its ordinary meaning.</P>
    <P>I have said that I am not making any legal or legalistic analysis and I would repeat that point now.  If Deputy Haughey suggests that there is a significant constitutional difference between including a particular affirmation in a communique and including it in an agreement, I will leave it to other people on another day to argue the point. But I will offer a comment from a point of view of political reality on this suggestion that we have abandoned the principle of Irish unity by repeating Deputy Haughey's own language.  I strongly suggest that the men of violence, to whom Deputy Haughey suggests we are in danger of abandoning the high ground of Irish Nationalist aspirations, are unlikely to be influenced by arguments that are as elusive as those about the number of angels that could dance on the head of a <Col N="2862" /> pin.  To them, an affirmation that something would only come about in a certain way is an affirmation that it would only come about in a certain way.  On that particular issue, I would be disposed to agree with them.</P>
    <P>We have not in fact abandoned anything. We have not asked the Unionists to abandon anything either.  That is the strength and the special value of this agreement.  I add my voice to the support for it that has already been expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First one must note the peaceful course this debate has taken. Regardless of our differences on some important aspects of this agreement, for once in this House, we have succeeded in having a debate where there are fundamental differences of opinion but the debate is still being conducted in an orderly fashion.</P>
      <P>I might take up one or two points in the remarks of the Minister for Justice without taking any great issue with him. The battle we have fought from these benches since the Summit has been to explain our position, to illustrate the threat, as we understand it, to sovereignty, the threat to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.  That is not to say there are not some aspects of this agreement that may be approved.  If it transpires that the agreement is approved we would hope it would be useful in the short or long term.  Our leader is continuously quoted on some things he has said.  He has also made other matters very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my understanding &mdash; and our Leader stated it yesterday &mdash; that there is no wish on the part of Fianna Fáil to impede or inhibit those who wish to make this agreement successful.  If it helps the Nationalist population in the short or long term, so much the better.  We have no reason to fight this matter in the courts.  We have clearly set down our position as a party and I know nobody on the other side of the House would attempt to take that right from us.  That is not to say there is not a fundamental difference of opinion between myself and other Members of the House on a position <Col N="2863" /> that has obtained for decades in this country.  It is a matter in respect of which, in a cool and calm way, we can agree to disagree and await what happens in the course of time.</P>
    <P>The penultimate paragraph of our amendment cannot be over-emphasised and I might quote it here again:</P>
    <P>while recognising the urgent need that exists for substantial improvement in the situation and circumstances of the nationalist section of the community in the North of Ireland and approving any effective measures which may be undertaken for that purpose, refuses to accept any recognition of British sovereignty over any part of the national territory;</P>
    <P>That paragraph clearly states that Fianna Fáil are not against any effective measures which may be undertaken under the terms of this agreement.  The Minister for Justice has spelled out what he believes to be wrong with our position because of what happened at the May 1980 Summit. There was a paragraph in the May 1980 Summit communique which stated that, while agreeing with the British Prime Minister that any change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland could only come about with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, the Taoiseach reaffirmed that it is the wish of the Irish Government to secure the unity of Ireland by agreement and in peace.  That statement was conditional and non-binding.</P>
    <P>When reporting on that Summit to this House, our Leader, Deputy Haughey, had this to say on 29 May, 1980, as reported in the Official Report, column 1057, Volume 321:</P>
    <P>We seek an arrangement whereby all Irishmen, no matter what their traditions, would manage the affairs of this island without British participation but with active British interest and goodwill....  Ideally, we would like to see the British Government express an interest in the ultimate achievement of unity....  I would like, therefore, to <Col N="2864" /> see the British Government modifying the present guarantee by adding a positive element, a new departure that would open the door to progress... The words of the communique acknowledge our basic position.  These words &ldquo;come about&rdquo; place the emphasis on the practical realities of the situation. This is entirely compatible with our view that while no part of the Irish nation has the right to opt out of the nation, we recognise that unity cannot be imposed by force, and can only come about by negotiation and agreement.</P>
    <P>That was what Deputy Haughey had to say in 1980 with regard to the Fianna Fáil position.</P>
    <P>What presents great difficulty to Fianna Fáil is Article 1 of this agreement. Had this agreement excluded Article 1, sections (a), (b) and (c) perhaps the attitude of Fianna Fáil could have been entirely different.  We are advised&mdash;perhaps our advice is wrong but as a major political party in the country we are entitled to hold that view &mdash; that Article 1 is contrary to what our Constitution states and the reason Fianna Fáil were formed as a political party in the first place.  I am sure nobody would take away our right to oppose something so fundamental. If it is misinterpreted, so be it, but we shall continue to uphold our right on that matter.</P>
    <P>At the very end of his press communique the Taoiseach asked Nationalists and Unionists to look at this agreement for what it is.  That is precisely what I intend to do &mdash; to look at this Anglo-Irish Agreement for what it is, while not being exactly the same as the Taoiseach may believe it to be, or what many of the less observant national scribes have presumed it to be.</P>
    <P>I have no satisfaction in saying here today that the Government have wantonly squandered our deepest aspirations. That is not something I would say too lightly.  They rushed into an agreement, as they did on a number of other issues, telling us how much time and effort had been put into this, which I <Col N="2865" /> accept.  My esteem for those loyal civil servants of the nation who struggled to effect the Government's wishes is unbounded.  They have proved themselves worthy of the great esteem in which they are held by both sides of this House and by the nation at large.  It is, therefore, most unfortunate that on this occasion &mdash; and I must say most disagreeable &mdash; to have to come into the House and berate this Government again for gross dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult for me to believe that the Taoiseach, even in his wildest flights of fantasy, could possibly think that we in Fianna Fáil would agree mutely to the removal of Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution by sleight of hand. That is what this Anglo-Irish Agreement does.  At the stroke of two pens the indefeasible right of the Irish people to the unity and integrity of the national territory has been eliminated.  Was the Taoiseach unaware of the implications of Article 1 of the agreement?  Or could it be that he and his Government decided to disregard those Articles of our Constitution that symbolise our most dearly held national dreams?  Parnell's great dictum that no man can put a stop to the march of a nation has met a sad and untimely end at the hands of this Government. Without any due authority, except the misconceived notions of their woolly thinking, this Government have put a full stop to the aspirations and the <i>de jure</i> rights of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and members of his Government have been Members of this House long enough to understand well that the desire to achieve national unity by peaceful means lies at the heart of Fianna Fáil as a political party.  Though I am of a different generation from those who first differed fundamentally over this issue, I can assure the House that I feel just as strongly and intensely as did the founders of Fianna Fáil regarding the partition of our country.  By accepting British sovereignty over part of our constitutional territory, this Government have greatly underestimated the long term damage they have done and may do to bi-partisanship in this House.  Hopefully <Col N="2866" /> that can be corrected, because it has added enormously to progress made in this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>One has heard in the media and in the British House of Commons the loud complaints of the Unionists, that they played no part whatever in the formulation of this agreement, that they were not consulted at all.  I find it incredible that this Government did not make the leadership of the largest party in this State and, indeed in the whole island, aware of the nature of the negotiations and the direction in which they were heading. Much damage could have been avoided and much benefit accrued from such consultation. Now that the media hullabaloo has died down somewhat, I only hope and pray that those who inform the nation on these events of great importance will find time to examine closely the precise benefits each party gets from this agreement. I would dearly wish to find in this agreement a sentence that would assure me that the lot of the Nationalist population or the effects on security or the movements towards reconciliation would be enhanced by this agreement.</P>
    <P>No sensible Member of this House would allow himself to be made responsible for something that he did not to a great degree control.  Is it not obvious even to the most fuzzy-minded that by accepting responsibility for security in the North we are condemning ourselves to supporting the insupportable, to legitimising the illegitimate and to excusing the inexcusable?  Too many tragic incidents have blotted the Northern landscape for one to have anything but the firmest conviction that it is the very structure itself that is rotten.  Are we now to shore up the rotting edifice of a statelet, condoned by British duplicity, and then be made blameworthy for the unworkability of a system whose birth we resisted from the start?</P>
    <P>Even though the agreement legitimises the partition of this country and endorses by its nature future British military and political policies; even though this Government made a major concession of principle and formally surrendered <i>de jure</i> Irish sovereignty; even though the <Col N="2867" /> Taoiseach would have us believe that Nationalists can now hold up their heads and that in all of this process there have been no losers, I find it impossible to detect any positive aspects for either the Nationalist population, the Irish Government or the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We already had the right to express our views and represent them to the British Government and, while we always maintained and exercised those rights it was latterly, in 1980, that the British Government publicly accepted them.  So there is nothing new in that.  There is no additional validity in anything this agreement can propose.</P>
    <P>It was already accepted by all consitutional parties in this State that change could only come about through democratic means and according to the wishes of a majority of the people of the Northern Irish State.  There is nothing new in that, unless it be the amazing new position pointed out by Deputy Haughey yesterday when he referred to the Taoiseach's statement in the communique that &ldquo;constitutional Nationalists could only accept unity with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I am sure that is not what the Taoiseach meant to say because it would be absolutely preposterous if unity offered by the British could not be accepted as long as some section of the Unionists objected.</P>
    <P>There is no undertaking to consult; there is no necessity for differences to be resolved and it will not be a decision-making body.  There is no certainty or even mechanism to ensure that our legitimate concerns are taken into account, so we may huff and puff all we like but the British Government will make the decisions in the North, exactly as heretofore. So where is the benefit to us?  There is none.  The tragedy is that we can now become bogged down in the Northern quagmire, without any certainty that the lot of the Nationalist minority will be bettered in any way.</P>
    <P>The stakes are high in this foolish gamble.  Whereas before the international community was quite aware of our historic and constitutional claim of <Col N="2868" /> sovereignty, they can now be convinced by PR into believing that we are quite content with British administration in the North.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that it is not from any petty feeling of partisan loyalty that I bring these points to the notice of this House.  I would gladly have welcomed an agreement that concretely and positively improved the position of the minority. Let no one think that Fianna Fáil would for any reason deny the Nationalist community short-term improvements in their situation so as to satisfy the long-term aim of national unity: no, not at all.  But we cannot pretend to see benefits where none are apparent.  We cannot pretend that this agreement will improve things, when patently it will not.  We cannot pretend it is wonderful when we know it is a disaster, yet another in a long list of Coalition disasters.</P>
    <P>In his speech, yesterday, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party pointed out the international legal implications of this agreement.  I hope his reasoned and lucid arguments were heeded by the Government and that this is the end of all that United Nations business.  The lodging of such an insubstantial document that could so easily cause major embarrassment to the Government in the future should be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>The saddest aspect of this agreement is that the very best it can hold out before the people of Northern Ireland is a devolved Government of some sort at some future date, with a gradual withering away of Irish governmental function as the Unionists come to their senses.  So the hope of the future is the failure of the past.  Devolved government had its day and was swept aside by the dominant factor that has been constant in the North: the Unionist veto and the British guarantee.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government had not the strength of character to impress this more vigorously on the British Prime Minister.  A unitary state achieved by agreement and consent is indeed the only solution that offers the hope of lasting <Col N="2869" /> peace and stability.  A gradually increasing intergration is the solution, not a diminution of our role.  We invested much time, energy and enthusiasm into the report of the New Ireland Forum, which unanimously reached that conclusion. What a tragedy that the lessons of the Forum were so quickly forgotten by this Government and by a Taoiseach whose main obsession seems to be the removal of Articles from the Constitution, either overtly or covertly.  In his press communique, the Taoiseach stated that both he and Maggie Thatcher went to the negotiations with different title deeds. Maybe so.  But Deputy Garret FitzGerald meekly handed over the title deeds to our national sovereignty, while Maggie Thatcher was extremely happy to return to London with the Government's undertaking to underwrite the political future of a state that has totally failed.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with some points raised by Deputy Ahern.  Any logic there might be in the Fianna Fáil position continues to elude me.  I cannot see any logic, even if I delve through all the verbal somersaults, since there are so many changes throughout the Fianna Fáil speeches.  These speeches seem to be made without any feeling of conviction. Deputy Ahern has stated that Fianna Fáil are opposing the agreement because they are against the principle of consent being expressed in an international agreement. On the other hand, he objects to the fact that Unionists were not invited to discussions, although anything they would have said would have been opposed by Fianna Fáil anyway.</P>

      <P>I am glad of that clarification. It was made very clear in the Taoiseach's analytical speech yesterday that there was a faithful following of the Forum report, paragraph by paragraph, in this agreement, it defies logic to state that the Forum report has been thrown <Col N="2870" /> out the window.  There is a concrete alignment of each part of the Forum report with the agreement.</P>
      <P>The agreement concluded last Friday represents for me the modern aspirations of a modern Ireland for peace and reconciliation. I believe at last this country is dominated by progressive Irish people, men and women, young and old, who do not find a place for looking backwards or beating old drums.  The country has at this very momentous time the good fortune to be led by a man who is generally accepted to be extremely quick to think but slow to attack.  A year ago after Chequers there were very many people in the country who expressed in one way or another the sentiment that this time we should fight back.  There was an unfortunate combination of words and actions which appeared to give unforgiveable offence to what the country felt was an overmild Taoiseach and Government.  It is, of course, the mark of a very good politician to be able to look further ahead than short term advantage.  That is what the Taoiseach did on that occasion, despite enormous pressures and, one even might say, provocation to do otherwise.  Last Friday at Hillsborough we saw the result of that kind of sensitivity and of that dedication to something other than his own political advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned his own generation as being somewhat removed from the generation involved in the civil war era.  I also am a politician of that later era.  I am not what is sometimes described as a politician of the old school.  A great many people came into politics in the seventies, as I did, whose impelling force had nothing whatsoever to do with the history of the civil war in this country but with the hope of a breakthrough to a new, social, economic and political scenario for Ireland.  In that decade, many new people came in also because they were attracted by a new kind of idealism which was expressed so clearly by the Taoiseach and expanded in that seminal document <i>Towards a Just Society</i>.  A great many people also entered politics who felt the need to work for peace in the face of the strife and suffering in <Col N="2871" /> Northern Ireland.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement has all the elements of a modern Ireland which realistic political parties wish to see.  Its very strong dedication to legitimising Nationalist aspirations is tempered by its practical acceptance of present attitudes of Northern Unionists.  On the one hand it invites the Nationalist community to raise their heads, to turn to peace and constitutional expression for once and for all, to relate to the Irish and British Governments working together for the good of Northern Ireland.  On the other hand, it says to Northern Unionists &ldquo;Work with us.  Co-operation and friendship can no longer be seen as threatening your identity because we have undertaken not to threaten you and never to ask you for more than you freely consent to give.  Now you can safely give an inch&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are all acutely aware of the work of rebuilding Northern Ireland, and rebuilding stability and peace on the whole island begins now.  The signing of the agreement last Friday ended one long period of adjustment and persuasion and of identifying in the Forum where modern Ireland stood in relation to the historical division of this country.  The signing marked the end of one phase which was necessary to reach where we are today.  Now, as so many Deputies have warned, the real work begins.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, has been given the crucial job of co-chairing the new Inter-governmental Conference.  He will have the task of balancing the desirable against the possible; of pushing so far and yet not too far; of demonstrating to every kind of Nationalist opinion that their alienation is over and that they are very much part of the community and country in which they live.  I am sure he has our confidence and unstinting good wishes because the Irish Government will undoubtedly face negotiations as difficult and as daunting as any which preceded the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>The British Government face no less a task and must carry it out in the face of Unionist opinion which will be ready to <Col N="2872" /> condemn at the slightest opportunity. The good faith of both Governments will be severely tested and I believe they will pass that test honourably.  The Irish Government have grappled with a multiplicity of problems which no previous Government have ever had to do.  Faced with the prospect of rebuilding Ireland's economic confidence in itself, and international confidence in us too, we have had to take unpopular measures.  We have had to control spending but not to cut it drastically and to convince the population that our future lies only in responsible management.  Despite our successes in those areas we have undoubtedly incurred the wrath of many large and vocal sectors of the community but that is the penalty which responsible Governments face.</P>
    <P>Side by side with undertaking this massive task, the Government have also undertaken the slow, delicate and difficult job of addressing our overwhelming political problem, Northern Ireland.  That problem, apart from entailing human misery, has taken a heavy toll on economic progress and has greatly contributed to our economic difficulties. It has been inspiring to watch the courage, expertise and idealism of the Taoiseach and his team as they brought not only the British Government but our own Government also through delicate, word by word construction of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  At this, which might be described as the Taoiseach's finest hour, it is typical of him not to seek credit for a breakthrough or to look for praise.  He continues to press for peace and to ask our Unionist colleagues to trust him and Mrs. Thatcher.  He and we ask that Unionists believe in our desire for peace and for prosperity for them as much as for the Nationalist community.  That demeanour of restraint and resolute conviction appears to be the key note of the vast majority of people speaking in this debate.  Indeed, lives depend on it.</P>
    <P>We are grateful for the positive support of so many people on this island as well as abroad.  We must remain hopeful that the moderate voices in Fianna Fáil will assert themselves sufficiently to soften <Col N="2873" /> what appears at present to be implacable opposition.  We can look with confidence to the warmhearted Irish-American leadership and to those other huge Irish communities in the western world as well as to our European colleagues to help us in our rebuilding efforts.  The statesmanlike vision of the Taoiseach in nurturing for many years, especially in the last few years, such close and friendly contacts all over the world is now bearing fruit for the benefit of peace in Ireland.  In this country, which is Europe's youngest, the Anglo-Irish agreement stands out for its faith in and anxiety to see a peaceful future.</P>
    <P>Two sovereign leaders have acknowledged their different backgrounds and their differing historical perspectives but have stepped outside those boundaries to accommodate each other.  Young people do that all the time and I find it inspiring that the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister were able to shake off those mythical shackles of history in order to give peace a chance.  This is a reflection of the way young people think.  They have never started wars but have always been the main victims.  We do not want any more young victims on this island, Catholic or Protestant, Unionist or Nationalist.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be part of a Government who have not only the courage to dare but the courage to succeed.  Success has not yet come.  It will come slowly and with careful encouragement.  By success I mean understanding, friendship, peace and prosperity, not the removal of boundaries or borders achieved through hatred or bloodshed.  A great deal can be done by the ordinary citizen to achieve this success and by taking every opportunity to reach out a hand to our Unionist co-habitants on this island.  Undoubtedly one of the strongest fertilisers of hate is ignorance.  There is no excuse for us to remain ignorant of the way of life, convictions and the vritues and qualities of the Unionists.  Part of the solid work of peace building should be the reaching out by everyone of goodwill towards our Northern friends.  We need to know what they think about us just as they need to know <Col N="2874" /> what we think about them.</P>
    <P>In the field of education, a very important area of co-operation, we have many instances of outstanding mutual work between North and South.  Recently we had a conference in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, organised jointly by the National Economic and Social Council and the Northern Ireland Economic Council on Higher Education and co-operation in that field.  We have many instances of that co-operation.  Colleges North and South have established warm and friendly contacts which, in some cases, are flowering to full formal commitments. Arrangements are in train between the NIHE, Dublin, and the University of Ulster for a joint course leading to a master's degree in education management. Engineering students of the Bolton Street College of Technology are pursuing their studies in Queens University, Belfast and NIHE Limerick and the University of Ulster have forged special links in the area of peace and conflict studies.  A new undergraduate course in peace studies is commencing on the Magee campus of the University of Ulster.  I hope this will prove a focal point for the recruitment of students in the Republic.  We have co-operation in regard to the in training of teachers and, of course, we have had magnificent efforts by Co-operation North in regard to student exchange schemes.</P>
    <P>They are not all, but they are some of the educational co-operation efforts which have been pursued in peace and friendliness between North and South and which we hope will continue to grow and strengthen, bringing together young people who need positive leadership from politicians who will recognise their modern aspirations.</P>
    <P>All efforts to get Unionists to discuss Ireland's future at official level have failed, but that is no reason why they cannot succeed in the future.  They will never succeed without a great deal of bridge building and without the establishment of a great peaceful period.  That is the purpose and the goal of all the hard work by the Irish and British Governments <Col N="2875" />&mdash; the establishment of normality, peace and calm.  This debate and the tone in which it has been conducted seem to me to pay a tribute to the work of the Government, particularly the Taoiseach and his team, in the past 12 months.  I share the pride of many in the House and throughout the country at what has been achieved.  I am sure there will be continuing widespread massive support as we put this agreement into operation while we keep our eyes firmly fixed on the goal of peace on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil amendment to the motion for the acceptance of agreement.  Any agreement that sets out to deal with the national question must satisfy and answer two questions: One, can it bring peace and stability to the Six Counties and, two, does it lead to unity?  This agreement fails on both counts and exacerbates an already difficult problem.</P>
      <P>The agreement fails to recognise the real causes for disharmony on this island and challenges the constitutional rights and aspirations of the majority of the citizens living in the whole island to seek a united Ireland.</P>
      <P>Article 1 confirms our worst fears about this agreement when it recognises for the first time in history the Partition of Ireland in a binding international agreement, an agreement that will bind all successive Irish Governments to maintain the Union of the Six Counties to the United Kingdom, irrespective of what the majority wish is of all the people living on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British guarantee as understood by the Forum report has been the major stumbling block to progress in achieving a settlement of the national question.  Is it now to be given full Irish support.  This change of stance runs contrary to the stated positions of every Nationalist leader since the foundation of the State. No justification has been put forward to support the new attitude of the Government to the British guarantee, and obviously none exists.  Guaranteeing the majority in the Six Counties that their <Col N="2876" /> status and Britishness are recognised and can never be changed is one thing, but what guarantee has been given to the Nationalists who want a united Ireland? None, and I suggest that they are one set of losers in this deal.  We see nothing in this agreement except a hardening of the position that gives the Unionists a clearly defined veto over any change in the status of the Six Counies.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to suggest that the Republic and its Ministers had no means open to them in the past to make their views known on Northern affairs.  Statements dealing with every aspect of life in the Six Counties by Irish leaders are well documented.  The Irish Government always had adequate opportunity for conferring and consulting and offering advice to the British Government.  This agreement regularises an already well established situation and does not warrant or justify the signing and registering with the UN of an Anglo-Irish accord which will be represented abroad as an acceptance by the Republic of the validity of Partition.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the Agreement that the people of the Six Counties will gradually be brought to a position of governing themselves in a devolved Government. This has been confirmed by both Governments. What this simply means is a return of the Stormont regime with Northern Ireland continuing as an intergral part of the United Kingdom.  This kind of thinking shows that the United Kingdom has learned nothing in 60 years and refuses to recognise that the problems of the Six Counties stem from the creation of the Border and cannot be resolved until the Border is finally dismantled.  To start that process the Unionist veto, the British guarantee, must be withdrawn.  This agreement does the opposite and perpetuates the situation on the ground, which has caused violence and distress for over half a century.</P>
    <P>It is also obvious from this agreement that the British Government will have the right to make demands on our Government to fall in line on security and other matters.  This dimension of the agreement will mean that there will be <Col N="2877" /> considerable influence exerted on a continuing basis by the British Government in so far as the operations of the Garda and our security forces are concerned.</P>
    <P>This fear has to be expressed.  We reject a situation where the Garda might be sucked in to be the accomplices and collaborators of the RUC and the UDR in policing Britain's Border and be jointly responsible for acts of harassment of the Nationalist population.  We cannot be seen to be giving support in backing up the elements of the security forces operating in the Six Counties which are internationally recognised as notorious and repressive.  Demands made by the British Government on the Irish security forces will have to be acted on or refusals for no action defended.  This must have a debilitating effect on our Garda and Army.</P>
    <P>Refusals to comply with British requests will no doubt be responded to by British intransigence on matters of urgency raised by the Irish side.  The British Prime Minister has left us in no doubt where we stand in this matter.  She stated in the Commons, as reported in <i>The Times</i> of London on 19 November 1985 in her response to Mr. James Molyneaux, that the Government of the United Kingdom may raise matters of security under the agreement with the Irish Government concerning certain matters South of the Border.</P>
    <P>The consequences of such an intrusion into Irish affairs can only be guessed at. It is interesting to note that in that reply Mrs. Thatcher also paid tribute to the bravery and courage of the men and women of the UDR.  It is difficult to understand how the Irish Government can accept such a position when it is generally recognised by all Nationalist leaders that the UDR and their activities have led to a significant escalation of violence in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate aspects of this agreement is that now every security practice in the Six Counties is legitimised and these include the UDR, the courts, the use of plastic bullets, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, strip searches, British army patrols in sensitive areas, <Col N="2878" /> the taking over of the GAA ground in Crossmaglen and every other action that was found repulsive to the Nationalist minority.  When we give our assent to the legitimacy of status of the Six Counties as a part of the United Kingdom we recognise all these things as legitimate and, worse still, we will now be perceived as supporting these activities.  British Government agreement is necessary for everything and anything.  The final decision on everything and anything remains with the British and so the Coalition Government will have the worst of all worlds.  They will have to take shared responsibility for every evil deed and evil action of the most disgraced judicial and legal system in the western world.</P>
    <P>The inherent danger in responsibility without authority is the transfer of justified criticism from Nationalist hands to extremists.  The alienation process that has driven the minority to seek political accommodation outside the SDLP can now operate unchallenged except behind closed doors where argument can supersede condemnation.  Britain can now claim that the Republic approves of the details of its security policy on the ground while making it impossible for Dublin to criticise that policy openly when Britain does things which are unacceptable to Nationalists.  Internal criticism can only take place after the offensive acts have taken place and arguments as to their propriety will be slow, cumbersome and ineffective in giving an immediate response to the justifiable grievences of the minority.  There is no more vunerable position for any Government to find themselves in than having responsibility for actions over which they have no control. To end up in this type of situation shows a failed negotiating strategy on behalf of the Government or a willingness of the Government to take on board anything offered for the sake of concluding the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The magnificant obsession of Fine Gael to do something, anything, that was saleable electorally was overpowering and has resulted in an arrangement that talks of potential and short term expectations, <Col N="2879" /> but which ignores the root cause of the violence that is the cancer in our Northern society.  The root cause is the existence of the Border and the failed political entity known as Northern Ireland which was contrived at more than a half a century ago to maintain a British presence in Ireland for its own purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement the Government have responsibilities to the Nationalist minority without the powers to exercise them.  This was confirmed by Peter Jenkins in <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 10 November of this year when he stated that the Republic, by taking on a responsible role across the Border effectively endorses the union of Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>World support was predictable following a determined public relations campaign by the Irish and British Governments but this support should not be misjudged as guaranteeing any success for the agreement.</P>
    <P>International leaders will always be happy to support other sovereign states especially if the sovereign states involved are closely associated with them in the ethnic, commercial and security areas. To withhold support especially when pressed to do so would be tantamount to an international unfriendly act.  The extent to which verbal support can be transformed into hard cash from both sides of the Atlantic has yet to be tested.  Supporting further private investment in the US for Irish development is welcome, but it is also commonplace.  It can be expected that any support coming from that quarter will be conditional on the agreement working and being seen to work.  The possibility of this is remote.  One has to question the validity and expectation of large sums of money in the immediate future from the American source.  A much more significant financial response would have been a large sum of money committed by the United Kingdom Govgernment to help the depressed and disadvantaged Nationalist areas in the Six Counties.  Money, if and when it appears, <Col N="2880" /> will of course be welcome, but it is presumptuous at this stage to be quantifying promises which have no base in hard fact.</P>
    <P>One can only wonder at the level of trust the Taoiseach feels exists between the British and Irish Governments.  History of relations between the two Governments would hardly be a consolation to those depending on that trust. Understanding of the Irish question has come lately, if at all, to the British Government representatives and to convince the Irish Nationalists on both sides of the Border that Britain can be trusted to do the honourable thing in all its dealings in the Irish question on their behalf is a development about which one can be forgiven for being sceptical.  The conversion to sympathy for the minority in the Six Counties by the British Government has not taken place.  What has occurred is that the British Government have found a vehicle which internationally enables them to claim that the Irish problem has been solved, that Dublin is effectively underwriting the details of Britain's administration in the Six Counties and that political legitimacy for continued British sovereignty on this island has been made permanent.  That is the way it is being pursued by the public relations people this very day.  The cruel Border, the basic reason and cause of all violence on this island is being given permanence and while the continued and contrived partition of this island is given that recognition the conditions for a continuance of violence and the progress of subversives will exist.  We are in effect helpless and at the mercy of superior British bureaucratic diplomatic and public relations forces.</P>
    <P>Even if devolved Government arrived and power-sharing was in place the germ for continuing violence persists.  There are substantial numbers in the Six Counties who want the Border removed and no amount of initiatives and power-sharing will dispose of their desire.  They will continue to exert pressure and that pressure will cause violent tensions for whatever system of devolution exists.  The agreement guarantees the conditions necessary for prolonged and continuing <Col N="2881" /> distress for the Nationalist minority.  It is a mistaken notion that peace and stability can be restored by this security agreement without recognising that the Nationalists want more and that is a framework for the dismantling of the Border and the withdrawal of British forces from this island.</P>
    <P>Can anybody state that the examples of goodwill by the British Government to the Irish position in the past have been happy ones?  Had it been intended to show a genuine response from the British Government towards the Irish question several matters might have been included in this agreement as a show of good faith by the British Government.  It was widely expected that a decision would have been incorporated dealing with the flags and emblems problem but not even this simple tangible example was indicated to underpin the agreement.  It was expected also that reference would be made to the dismantling of the UDR, a sectarian force, formed and staffed by hardline Loyalists, committed to anti-Nationalist attitudes.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Forum all-party co-operation on the Nationalist question has been sacrificed by the Coalition.  It is difficult to understand why the goodwill of Fianna Fáil was never sought during the negotiations bringing about this agreement.  But now that the agreement has seen the light of day it is easy to understand the thinking behind the Government's attitude to the largest political party in the country.  The reason is that the Coalition knew that the constitutional position was been undermined in this agreement.  They knew that Fianna Fáil would not abandon the Constitution, and Fine Gael, rather than expose themselves to the charge of a sell out of our Constitution, decided to carry on and seek support for their agreement worldwide rather than seeking it first at home and with Fianna Fáil.  Our basic position is that the Government are in breach of the letter and the spirit of the Constitution as well as of the conclusions of the constitutional Nationalist parties in the New Ireland Forum report.  To continue <Col N="2882" /> to negotiate and finalise an agreement which has such fundamental consequences for the Constitution and Nationalists generally without consulting the largest political party in the island is disturbing and shows a lack of sincerity on the Taoiseach's part in pursuance of a bi-partisan approach.</P>
    <P>What has the Taoiseach to fear if what he was engaged in was in accordance with the Forum report?  It is obvious that he recognised that the word and spirit of the report has been sacrificed in this agreement and the result is a weakening of Irish Constitutional Nationalism and a dividing of Nationalist opinions, the very thing the Forum sought to avoid.  The Taoiseach and the Government have done a disservice to Irish Nationalism and have thrown away the bi-partisan approach on the national question by rejecting the Forum report and the unanimous wish of all Nationalists in this island, namely, the reunification of our country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's stated position on several matters connected with this agreement must, of course, be challenged.  He himself has indicated that Belfast will be the location for the new secretariat, but this has not been confirmed by the British Prime Minister and in fact, it was quite obvious in her response to the question on this matter at the press conference following the signing of the agreement that she believes that it can only be established in Belfast if security permits it.  It is strange that this central matter of the agreement could not have had a clear and finalised response from both sides on the day.  If the British side question the security of the secretariat for location in the Six Counties, and if they give a qualified reassurance to all concerned on security matters, will that also apply to the security of the officials operating in the secretariat? If the guarantee of security for these people cannot be given by the British Government, will the Coalition Government press the point and put at risk citizens of this State or indeed will the Government be allowed to press this point?</P>
    <P>The whole attitude of the Taoiseach <Col N="2883" /> has to be questioned following his outburst in Cork this week on his attitude towards Article 2 and Article 3 of our Constitution.  When he took office as Taoiseach his allegiance to the Constitution and its provisions was clearly understood and taken for granted by everybody in this country.  This allegiance is the universal requirement of all who hold a seal of office under the Constitution. That allegiance must now be in question.  It is the natural follow-up and understanding that when a person would prefer to see something removed from the Constitution, he has ceased to give it his allegiance.  The question has now to be asked: is there a concerted attempt by individuals in the Government to subvert the Constitution, to minimise its importance in official standing, to weaken its importance in the home environment and to convey a cavalier attitude to its provision in international negotiations?</P>
    <P>To uphold the provisions of the Constitution must be the predominant motivation of the legislator and particularly of office holders.  One may question the continued wisdom of a particular Article and seek to alter it through the recognised process, but to seek to circumvent the Constitution and to challenge its relevance without recourse to the people is to run in the face of democracy.  The Taoiseach and the Government do both in this Anglo-Irish agreement and, regrettably, the Taoiseach has displayed a subversive attitude to the Constitution which is, until altered by the people sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is another phase of the Taoiseach's constitutional crusade.  He seems to be preoccupied with the determination to alter the thrust of our fundamental claims of Article 2 and Article 3, and the device of an international agreement to circumvent the sacredness of Article 2 and Article 3 can only be seen as constitutionally incorrect in the absence of a willingness to test those opinions electorally.</P>
    <P>Does anybody really believe that the Irish people would reject Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution if they were asked <Col N="2884" /> to do so?  Whether Articles 2 and 3 are actively pursued or not from one generation to another is irrelevant to the argument today &mdash; the lack of interest by political parties is another matter which does not concern us today &mdash; the real point is that the Irish people never lost interest and thankfully their interest is enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>However, the question now is; what dilution of the Constitution has taken place because of this agreement when we talk about registering it internationally? It is our understanding that internationally recognised agreements take precedence over our constitutional Articles and if this is the case then the wishes of the Irish people have been submerged in the ambiguity and confusion of Hillsborough.  This must be unacceptable to constitutional Nationalists everywhere on this island.</P>
    <P>The full significance of the Brussels remarks of the Taoiseach recently is now evident.  Unity is no longer to be pursued as our national objective.  The sovereignty question must take second place in his thinking.  The back burner has certainly been lit by this agreement and will continue to burn until the national aim of unity and unanimous agreement of the Forum report is restored to national prominence and promoted nationally and internationally as the agreed constitutional Nationalist position of the majority of the people living on this island.</P>
    <P>There has been an attempt to subordinate the Fianna Fáil Party traditional stance on unity to accommodate a Fine Gael agreement which is objectionable to the fundamental on which the Fianna Fáil Party was founded.  We regard this agreement as an affront to responsible republicanism which seeks to bolster up a régime in the Six Counties which has failed politically, economically and socially. To turn our backs on the constitutional Nationalists we represent and to take the soft option of giving acceptance to an agreement we know to be basically and constitutionally flawed would be an unforgivable act of betrayal to our Constitution, our tradition and our supporters. <Col N="2885" /> Our principle in the matter of constitutional republicanism cannot be compromised.</P>
    <P>The New Ireland Forum report has quite clearly been abandoned.  Britain rejected it at publication and obviously has now convinced the Taoiseach and the Coalition Government that it was falsely based and not to be accommodated in the foreseeable future.  The Fianna Fáil Party cannot support this agreement because it flies in the face of our constitutional position and does not offer hope for the attainment of unity in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>We believe that there is a better way forward, a way that would finally address the root causes of the problems in the Six Counties, one which would remove the guarantee which all Nationalist leaders agree is fundamental to the final solution of the Irish question.  This could take place at a constitutional conference which would be attended by the two sovereign Governments and representatives of all communities living on this Island. It would be for the Government of Great Britain to declare finally that it has no further interest in maintaining its position in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A new Constitution for an All-Ireland Constitution would set out to give the necessary guarantees needed to protect all interests on the island.  Once completed it could be registered internationally and all interested parties would then have a vested interest in working towards making it a reality. There would be no back doors for any group, political party or Government. Eventually and inevitably, everybody recognises that the agreed wish of the New Ireland Forum was that a unitary state is the only final solution that will work on this island.  We should be concentrating on seeking that solution, not giving support to agreements which can only prolong the agony of the Six Counties and frustrate the aspirations of those who seek a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is a carefully worded statement of our position and represents the view of the majority of Nationalists in this country; it agrees with the Forum <Col N="2886" /> report; it recognises the great urgency to achieve improvement for the Nationalist minority population; it refuses to recognise British sovereignty over any part of the national territory and it offers the way forward through a constitutional conference.  Nobody can deny that the thrust of our amendment is well placed. It deserves your support and I ask you for it.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak in this debate as a Democratic Socialist; I do not speak as a Nationalist, constitutional or otherwise. Deputy Flynn spoke about final solutions. Nationalism has a record of some grizzly final solutions.  Nationalism has caused world wars.  Nationalism has caused civil war here setting family against family.  I speak as one who does not suffer from the paranoia of Anglophobia which is so endemic in our society. I do not profess any hatred towards Unionists and in 17 years in this House time and time again I have opposed sectarian bigotry from whatever quarter it came.  As a democrat and socialist the homes, the people, the money they have to buy bread for their children, the jobs they have to go to on Monday morning, their recreation and the Churches to which they wish to go for spiritual renewal are far more important to me than arguments about transient political boundaries and the pub republicanism which passes for politics in this country. It is in that spirit that I approach this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party were the first Opposition in this House since the foundation of the State.  Since then the Labour Party in Government and Opposition played a constructive healing role in bringing about peace and reconciliation in this island.  I do not propose to shirk that responsibility on this occasion.  The major attraction for me in this agreement is the acceptance by my party &mdash; the long acceptance that did not start in 1969 but went back to the days of Tom Johnston when he was the first leader of the Opposition in this House, when we held that any question of land reunification or any <Col N="2887" /> question of people joining together here in a political framework could only be achieved after the Treaty was ratified in this House &mdash; that change can only be achieved when there is free consent to such a change by the majority of the people in Northern Ireland.  The agreement we are now asked to ratify here is irrevocably and solidly based on that premise.</P>
    <P>Apart from Provisional Sinn Fein &mdash; and I begin to wonder about the Opposition on listening to their speeches; but I will give them the benefit of the doubt &mdash; with their murderous determination to bomb, murder and torture people into reunification, for what it is worth, political parties in the Republic describe themselves as being in favour of that fundamental principal.  Tonight our thoughts must go above all else to those families &mdash; many of whom I know after a lifetime in the trade union movement going up to Northern Ireland and working with many Northern Ireland trade union members who came South and worked with me &mdash; who have lived in Northern Ireland for centuries and who for the past 65 years have lived in a particular entity in Northern Ireland &mdash; the post Treaty definition &mdash; and who have given their allegiance whether rightly or wrongly to their country.  Until such time as we can, in a democratic framework, by human conviction and nothing else, convince such fellow Irishmen and women that we wish to join with them in perhaps a better framework, in perhaps a more democratic framework, we must adjure the pressure of human misery created by political violence.  It is important that this be repeated time and time again in this debate.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the framework of this agreement was set up by the leader of the Opposition when he was Taoiseach because the agreement decided on between Deputy Haughey and Mrs. Thatcher in 1980-81 was given formal recognition in the Anglo-Irish Governmental Council which was set up at the end of 1981 and it is based on that 1981 framework that this agreement is now <Col N="2888" /> before the House.  On 29 May 1980 when he was in Government &mdash; and people in Government became enormously more sensible and responsible than when they are in Opposition &mdash; Deputy Haughey said that the decision at that time was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>...to develop new and closer political co-operation between our two Governments is a new and significant development in the tangled web of relationships between the people of these islands.  I believe that it is in this context of closer political co-operation that a permanent and lasting solution to the problem of Northern Ireland can be found...An immediate solution to such a longstanding and difficult issue is not of course possible, but steps can now be taken to establish a new framework for a solution.  This would take full account of all that has changed in the relations between the two islands and in Western Europe since Northern Ireland was first established.</P>
    <P>The contribution made by Deputy Flynn does not reflect that sentiment this evening, but then Deputy Flynn is in Opposition.  Deputy Haughey at that time, made it clear that the 1980-81 initiative was firmly in the Fianna Fáil tradition and philosophy.  The Deputy quoted with approval Eamon de Valera in 1940 stating that &ldquo;we want friendly relations with the people of Britain&rdquo; and led on to his own conclusion that &ldquo;the philosophy of Fianna Fáil in this particular area is unchanged and unchanging&rdquo;. It has had a very big change since the Taoiseach signed this agreement.</P>
    <P>I am proud that my party have been a member of the Coalition Government. Whatever Coalition Governments have done, they have produced the three most substantive and important contributions in many ways to the solution of the Northern Ireland problem since 1921.  As a Member of Dáil Éireann since 1969, I have supported these developments consistently. First of all, the Sunningdale Agreement gave promise for positive and peaceful development in Northern Ireland although it was later destroyed, as we know, by intransigence.  Indeed, it <Col N="2889" /> was destroyed in this House as well when it was given a complexion, an emphasis, which terrified the life out of people, understandably, that Sunningdale meant a great deal more than it was meant to mean at the time.  I was in the House then and I was ashamed that that happened because progress in that activity was brought to a sudden stop.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there were discussions leading to the New Ireland Forum of 1984, and these discussions were of great value in clarifying the precise views and preconditions for support of all the democratic constitutional parties outside the Unionist framework which, we regret, did not become involved in those discussions.  I must point out that the 13 members of Fianna Fáil also agreed fully with the conclusions of that Forum, notwithstanding the fact that no sooner was one signature dry on the paper than Deputy Haughey decided to take a narrow political advantage out of that Forum report. There was no magnanimity and towards Northern Ireland and this Government there is no magnanimity.  I regret to record that in this debate.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that these all happened under Coalition Governments. The Taoiseach stated in his speech at Hillsborough last Friday that the present agreement was in accord with the general principles agreed by all the Forum participants as &ldquo;necessary elements of a framework within which a new Ireland could emerge.&rdquo;  Therefore, we have the third major initiative here.  I want to point out that throughout the Forum report the emphasis has been on constitutional Nationalist parties.  I have a reserve about that phrase because in a new Ireland we will not have just constitutional Nationalist parties; we will have parties of very different complexions in a democratic structure in the future political parliamentary framework of this island.  That is the background to the agreement, and I feel I should make that observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have criticised the British <Col N="2890" /> and Irish Governments for taking 15 months to produce a relatively short document and for the opportunity which it has given to extremists on both sides to whip up hysteria and fear.  We should not apologise for the length of time taken or for the thousands of hours of dedicated work by many civil servants in both countries, legal experts, Ministers and many others.  Those of us in both Governments know the intensity of effort which has gone into every aspect of this agreement. Many Deputies have rightly congratulated the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In particular I want to thank my own party leader, Deputy Dick Spring, and the entire Irish negotiating team for the long and hard work which they undertook to bring this agreement before Dáil Éireann on this occasion.  It is clear from comments made by many people that there are difficulties of interpretation in terms of the agreement.  I would like to enlarge three aspects of that: sovereignty and the constitutional position, the gradualist, evolutionary nature of the agreement and the structural possibilities for improvement in Northern Ireland which it creates.  First there is the question of sovereignty and the constitutional position.  So bereft have Fianna Fáil been of any real opposition, they have tried to evoke constitutional questions which simply do not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been argued from both sides of the divide that the agreement diminishes the sovereignty and the constitutional position of both Britain and Ireland.  Thus, the Unionists contend that, by specifying a role for the Republic in the future administration of Northern Ireland the agreement to that extent diminishes the current authority of the British Government.  Similarly, some Republican opinion seems to imply that, first, by merely accepting closer working <Col N="2891" /> co-operation between Britain and Ireland and, secondly, by the firm statements in Articles 1 (a) and (b) of the agreement that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, this Government have copperfastened Partition.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see how both of these views could be simultaneously true.  I reassure both traditions in all Ireland, and especially in Northern Ireland, that a sizeable portion of the time spent in discussing and revising the draft agreement was concerned with considering the best legal advice from both countries on the legal and constitutional implications of the wording of the agreement.  The constitutional cases brought by some Republicans at the time of the Sunningdale Agreement were reviewed as well as the British legal position, and the consensus from both countries' legal experts was that the agreement was sound and could not be invalidated on legal grounds.  Let me quote what one legal expert said since the signing of the agreement.  Dr. Kevin Boyle, Professor of Law at UCG stated it quite succinctly in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 17 November 1985 when he said:</P>
      <P>Irish Governments have always behaved internationally on the basis that our supposed claim to Northern Ireland was in reality an aspiration of the <i>nation</i> to be united and not an assertion that this <i>State</i> claimed Northern Ireland as part of its territory which in some way was illegally occupied by a foreign State.  Articles 2 and 3 concern the political theory that the Irish nation should be united some day.</P>
      <P>They do not represent a claim to the territory of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Boyle went on to say, rightly, that the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; with Deputy Haughey somewhat in a political limbo &mdash; in signing the Treaty of Accession to the EC in 1973 accepted that Britain was signing on behalf of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, quite in contrast to the position in France and Germany who <Col N="2892" /> were in dispute about an area of land and who exchanged notes to express some reservations at the time of their accession to the EC.  It is quite clear from the joint actions, be it on agricultural policy in the EC or joint membership of both countries of the EC which is a powerful force in breaking down outdated barriers which divide us, that the allegations made by the Opposition party on constitutionality just do not hold water.  There is no conviction behind the statements made by Fianna Fáil in that regard and that refers to the debate from its commencement.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the gradualist nature of the agreement.  Thank God it is gradualist and evolutionary.  Much unnecessary alarm has been generated by the idea that the agreement is uniquely revolutionary and imposes enormous, unforeseen changes on the people of Northern Ireland.  That is far from the case.  As I have already explained, the agreement is a logical development from earlier initiatives on Northern Ireland taken by all the major parties in the Republic.  Also, while the possibilities for major change lie within the agreement, the actual pace of change will be determined by those most directly concerned &mdash; the people of Northern Ireland as represented by their political parties, and the Governments of Britain and Ireland.  This will happen at two quite specific levels.  First, the members of the Inter-governmental Conference will consult on a wide range of issues including political, security, legal and cross-Border matters contained in Article 2 (a).  This process, as well as permitting the very close co-operation between Britain and Ireland which we have all wanted for years, will also permit representations from the political parties in Northern Ireland dirctly to the UK Government and the parliament there for those with seats in Westminster and, indirectly, with the Irish Government which will be ready to discuss every issue with all the non-violent parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Second, the process of devolution as outlined in Article 4 enables the political parties in Northern Ireland to take over control of their own affairs at a pace <Col N="2893" /> which they can agree mutually.  Thus the overall pace of change will be determined by the actual decisions of the members of and officials supporting the Conference and by political representation to them.</P>
    <P>After so many years of conflict and violence, of growing polarisation and extremism, it is not to be expected that progress will be dramatically rapid.  Support for the middle ground, for the acceptable compromise which this agreement represents will not happen overnight, since all the extremists and supporters of violence have a vested interest above all else in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  But the combined ingenuity of the teams working on the agreement has been devoted to providing a structure which will, without coercion, encourage and support moderate views while making extremism less successful and less effective than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>In that, regard, I must congratulate my colleague, Deputy Peter Barry, on his appointment as Irish Permanent Ministerial Representative to the Conference. I have no doubt that with the agreement in sight exceptional work will be done. As a person who has gone to Northern Ireland on many occasions throughout my working life I consider it extraordinary to hear the presence of Irish civil servants in Northern Ireland being condemned either as unnecessary collaboration with the British or as an interference by a foreign power in the affairs of Northern Ireland.  Those are extremist views.  For example, my Departments, Health and Social Welfare, have had for decades &mdash; I have encouraged this &mdash; the closest of friendly co-operation with officials in Northern Ireland.  I, accompanied by the secretaries of my Departments, have visited my former opposite number, Chris Patton, in Belfast and he has also visited me in Barrettstown in the Republic.  Chris Patton made a major contribution to the agreement.  We discussed matters of mutual concern and that association has been of considerable benefit in improving the services which we give to all the people of this island.  I look forward to <Col N="2894" /> more such links between North and South in the years ahead under the general auspices of the Conference.  That is a positive development.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with structural possibilities for change within Northern Ireland.  Having just argued that the agreement is gradualist and evolutionary, building on what has gone before and developing at a pace determined by the political parties most concerned in the matter, it may seem contradictory to state at the same time that the agreement opens up hope for major improvement in the Northern Ireland situation.  In my view it opens up hope for many within Northern Ireland and in Britain who had with depression and sorrow come to feel that there was no prospect of a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland problem. It will take many years of hard work before attitudes will change in this regard.</P>
    <P>The agreement must be looked at in a calm and reasonable manner.  For Unionists on this island for the first time ever there is confirmation in a solemn and binding international agreement that their presence within the UK is accepted and, indeed, supported unless a majority of those living in Northern Ireland should wish for change.  Thus, both the strength of Unionist feeling on their nationality, such as it is defined, and on the importance of democratically achieved decisions is given specific Irish support. Similarly, for the Nationalists by whatever definition one uses &mdash; I have qualified that massively &mdash; the British Government for the first time in a solemn and binding international agreement have recognised the Nationalist aspiration towards their form of reunification and have pledged themselves to introduce legislation leading to a united Ireland whenever a majority in Northern Ireland should so wish it.  They are of critical importance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the SDLP, our counterparts in a sense, and only in a sense because I am inclined to be a socialist in the broad international understanding of that term, support the agreement. I am disappointed that the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2895" /> Party, and Deputy Haughey, have adopted a different approach.  It is not the approach of Jack Lynch or of Liam Cosgrave, men who made major initiatives. It was Jack Lynch who preserved the security of the State when it was under threat in the early seventies.  It was Liam Cosgrave who gave us Sunningdale and at this historic moment in history Garret Fitzerald is giving us a new initiative. On all occasions Brendan Corish, Frank Cluskey, Michael O'Leary and now Dick Spring were with those leaders in total support.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank my colleagues in Britain with whom I have a great deal of contact, Neil Kinnock and Lord Hughes, my counterpart in the Council of Europe, for the support given to us in recent weeks.  Their bi-partisan approach and statemanship in supporting the agreement when in Opposition is in contrast to the opposition we are facing here.</P>
    <P>As one who has opposed sectarian politics I say to the Unionists of Northern Ireland that I understand why they detest having to sit down with gunmen, the Provisional IRA, in the council chambers of Northern Ireland.  I understand, sympathise and support their opposition to that.  I have refused to allow them inside the door of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada or the Custom House on deputations and I have refused to accept them at my clinics despite intimidation and political opposition. Therefore, I am at one with the Unionist population of Northern Ireland in endeavouring to oppose the gunmen and the torturers who want to bomb us into their fascist variety of democracy.  I have suffered in a very minor way in terms of my opposition be it to some Catholic bishops who want to have their version of Catholicism enshrined here and in other regards.  I commend the agreement as an honest and hard-worked effort to reach a resolution of some of the problems of Northern Ireland.  Let us accept it in the genuine way in which it was formulated and, through careful consideration, see if we can join together in friendship with our fellow Irishmen <Col N="2896" /> and women in Northern Ireland. Through careful consideration we should see if we can join the great host of those who have offered support and constructive help in implementing the agreement after it has been ratified here and registered at the UN.  I hope it will open up an era of peace and reconciliation.  We in this House will have done the right thing for once, in terms of the work of the House itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be tempted to follow the last speaker but that is for another day.  Ireland's right to sovereignty, independence and unity is indefeasible and inalienable.  The 1916 Proclamation is there for all to see, written in the blood of our martyrs.  The Declaration of Independence by our Parliament signed on 21 January 1919, the 1948 Republic of Ireland Act, the 1949 unanimous declaration by Dáil Éireann at that time proposed by the then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, Eamon de Valera, are in our best interests and I am sure are accepted by all as what would be regarded as the constitutional approach.</P>
      <P>What we need to realise is that Britain has been in this country unwanted for the past 800 odd years.  She has never been and never will be accepted, nor has she &mdash; and this is rather unique in the world &mdash; really assimilated the Irish people into her jurisdiction, despite all those years of occupation, despite teaching us many of her ways.  She has treated us abominably over those centuries.  By that treatment and the manner of her operation here she has created an inferiority complex-ridden atmosphere, but despite this and much more that we do not have time to talk about here today but which is well known to all, over the ages the spirit of the Irish people has never been broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resistance to the occupier and the occupation by arms and determination to get her out has continued down through those years, resulting 65 odd years ago in the partition of our country.  Now we have an agreement, one heralded by perhaps the most outstanding, momentous <Col N="2897" /> public relations propaganda campaign worldwide that the world has ever seen, contrived by Mrs. &ldquo;Out, Out, Out&rdquo; Thatcher, self-proclaimed Unionist as she is, and a Taoiseach, our Taoiseach, obsessed by the belief that he was born and is divinely ordained to bring peace to our land.  I only wish it were true.  I should add, peace to our land at any cost, or at what cost?</P>
    <P>In this agreement we are giving all and we are getting nothing.  In fact, we are paying dearly for the privilege of doing this, as time will show.  We are giving the right to and recognising the right of a contrived majority &mdash; let us never forget how they were contrived in that majority &mdash; to determine the future of this island and of all its people.  The Irish role in this new agreement is at best a consultative role, but world opinion is being shaped to accept a big deal being done by what would be made to appear as two equal partners.  Nothing could be further from the truth because the UK in all cases is the final arbitrator of any and every iota of what may be determined through this Conference about which we hear so much and which will meet immediately.  The two Governments have notified each other of the acceptance of their parliaments of this new great big deal, this new great big sell-out that has taken place in these recent days.</P>
    <P>We are committed to signing the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism.  Why have we not signed it for the various Governments of different political persuasions since 1977?  We are now signing it and that will ensure that extradition will become an everyday element of our society and our life.  The Convention so narrows the question of what is a political offence, or is connected with a political offence that, in fact, any question of reneging on extradition is practically ruled out.  We should also realise that we are committing ourselves to registering this so-called agreement with the UN.  I ask to what purpose, and offer the opinion, for no purpose other than to follow up the great con job that has already been done by a contrived <Col N="2898" /> media, not only in this country but outside it and throughout the world, to confirm in world opinion Britain's claim to the Six Counties.  That is the only possible result that can flow from registration in the UN</P>
    <P>Let nobody have the idea or be conned into the belief that the UN in some way or other will be able to enter into any dispute, argument or differences that may arise in this Conference or arising from it, because registration with the UN dictates clearly, concisely and without question that it is only at the request of and with the consent of the two participating parties to the registered agreement that the UN can even begin to look at, never mind to question or to give a decision on, any dispute.  That means that when and if there is a difference, and there no doubt will be, although we might not hear much about it, there is no recourse to the UN as an arbitrator in any sense of the world.  If we are aggrieved, naturally the party on the other side who are causing our grievance and our difference will not request with us jointly that the UN be brought in to arbitrate on what is right or what is wrong according to this said agreement.</P>
    <P>Extradition, as I have said, is tied to the European Convention that I have mentioned.  Having refused since 1977, what are we signing this for now and for whose benefit?  What new wisdom have we got in this House, or what new wisdom has the Taoiseach got that his predecessors in office since 1977 did not have? We will be handing people over to the tender mercies of the Six County courts &mdash; a Judiciary that we have condemned rightly throughout the world as lacking in any semblance of justice &mdash; just as we did, for instance, in that hastily contrived case of <i>McGlinchey versus the State</i>, the Attorney General, or what you will.  That was a sad night, because it has eroded very much our faith and belief in the courts of this country by virtue of the fact that it was indecently, hastily done and that it could be seen to have been done in haste for the purpose of giving a sop to Mrs. Thatcher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not take up any of my time or yours in going into that.  I just want to say that on the other hand we are talking about security.  Security, how are you! Look at the security above at Hillsborough on the very day on which this agreement was being signed.  There were 70 extreme, violent Unionists within the walls, as it were, of the little town of Hillsborough and we are told that at least 700 RUC had been in position for days before, to ensure that there would be security.  That is the sort of security that we are giving our aid to, purely partisan security.  No Republican sat on the inside &mdash; that was taken care of &mdash; but the others were allowed inside.  Security with whom, by whom and in collaboration with whom?  Security that is costing this nation between £100 million and £250 million per year.  One can take one's pick in between those figures but it is not less than £100 million and could be more than £250 million.  We do not have that money; we need it badly for other purposes.  We need the police who give their time night and day on that Border &mdash; securing it in the interests of Britain, the occupier &mdash; elsewhere for the security of our people, our cities and towns, villages and countryside and we do not have the money we are paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to listen to the Minister for Finance, and previous Ministers over several years, to know that we have a deficit running into staggering proportions. That is the type of situation we have.  That is the sort of crawling, creeping, inferiority-ridden people we appear to be.  Object to and show why there should be no occupation.  Tell the world about it.  Tell them about the lack of justice in the Six Counties.  Tell them about the RUC, the Castlereagh Barracks, the hooded treatment people get there, the silent treatment they get there. Tell them about the UDR, which is <Col N="2900" /> another name for the B Specials despite the fact that prominent Nationalist elected people at the time of their institution actually canvassed Nationalists to join them.  They are now calling for their disbandment.  There is not a word about them disbanding.  They will not on their own any more create any road blocks during the day or at night, they will be accompanied by the RUC.  That is great; that is wonderful.  Why do they not cop themselves on as to whom they are dealing with?  What are they being retained for?  What on many occasions have they been said to do effectively other than carry out patrols, set up road blocks and enforce this security as a supplement to the British occupying army and the RUC which is to say the least, a sectarian force and were condemned in this House year in and year out, and rightly so, for their partisan and discriminatory actions over the years.  In future we are going to have the UDR.  They are going to be put behind some sort of curtain.  I think Mrs. Thatcher, when being questioned at some stage, suggested that they would be there for defence.  Defence of whom?  For what?  How, when and where?  They are partisan, sectarian right down to their shoelaces and we know it.  Those of us who want to know &mdash; whether living near there, in there or outside &mdash; can find out if we do not know already.</P>
    <P>We are going to collaborate and we are formalising with an Establishment that reeks of injustice.  We are going to have the RUC in Castlereagh and all that; we will help them to do that; we will hand over prisoners to their tender mercies. We will have the UDR not stopping us on the roads but standing in the bushes beside us with machine guns, with perhaps the old triggers clicking, just to put the breeze up anybody who might have any thoughts of lifting his head and being Irish in his own land.  We are going to have the British army who are the occupiers &mdash; do not forget they are the occupiers of this country &mdash; to whom we will be handing them over.  And we will be handing them over to the Diplock non-jury courts.  This is not being questioned. At the end of the day, even those who <Col N="2901" /> would not have any regard for any of the other things I have enumerated, will realise that it will cost this State more to do these things and to collaborate more than we have been doing to date.</P>
    <P>Then we have talk about human rights, civil rights and a bill of rights, not a bill of rights for the Irish people, of course, but a bill of rights for Northern Ireland &mdash; the Six Counties is how I describe it, which is much less misleading than Ulster or the Province as we hear so many people describe it today.  There can be no civil rights, no human rights, there cannot be a bill of rights unless and until the basic right of self-determination has been brought to this land of ours.  Is that not what it has been all about over these centuries, over recent decades and indeed the last 15 years?  The basic right of self-determination must come and be the foundation from which any and all other rights will derive.  That is not even mentioned lest somebody might ask some indecent questions about why it is not.</P>
    <P>There has been no mention of the plastic bullet ban passed by the European Parliament which we have not yet signed. There has been no mention of it in so far as condemnation of Britain's use of it, solely and only in the Six Counties is concerned.  You do not use it on the blacks in British streets; you do not use it on the whites in British streets but you use it on the Paddies, whether it be on the Shankill Road, the Falls Road, the Bogside or the Waterside.  We should never forget this and our Unionist and Protestant neighbours and friends should cop on that that is the situation, that they are Paddies in the eyes of the British, have been, are and will always remain, and are merely being used and manipulated to enable the occupation to continue for Britain's own ends.</P>
    <P>Repatriation of prisoners &mdash; has that been mentioned?  Has it been highlighted?  It is a humanitarian and compassionate matter which has been raised time without number not only within these shores but far beyond them and nothing has been done.  Then there is the Prevention of Terrorism Act which is being used to <Col N="2902" /> discriminate against the Irish in particular. What has happened about it?  Is there any mention that it will go in this new era now about to dawn as a result of this great con act known as the agreement. What about the strip-searching in our prisons, north of the Border, particularly the strip-searching of our women prisoners? Is there any mention of that, any thought of that?  Is there any word of the hooded treatment, the beating up, the silent treatment, the inhuman interrogation treatment in Castlereagh Barracks? What about the Border incursions that take place daily, that are reported and sighted?  There is nothing being done about them other than the odd protest which is ignored; very often silenced but ignored nevertheless.  Who the hell are we to complain about what Britain or her army does?  That is their business.  We are an inferior race, we do not belong on the same plain.  Is that not what has been the position down the years?</P>
    <P>Can we not also take into account that there has been no mention made of Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle when, in recent times, even more frequently patrols in ordinary boats of various kinds, filled with British army, their guns and machine guns, come nearer and nearer to the shores of our side of the Border? I should repeat that the cost, to those who are not terribly concerned or aware of the manner in which these things press down on our people near to these happenings, will go up.  We will pay more for the privilege of agreeing to what they want.</P>
    <P>Through the Chair I would also ask the Taoiseach and anybody else replying, what about the Emergency Powers Act? What about section 31?  Have we not now reached the time when all these matters can be revoked, so that we might do something to relieve our situation down here since we are so concerned about seeing that everybody is fine up above under the protection of the Crown and all that goes with it?</P>
    <P>As far as the Constitution is concerned it is being thoroughly ridiculed in regard to Articles 1, 2 and 3.  I would suggest that the people who participated in this <Col N="2903" /> agreement should also look at Article 9.2.  They should be capable of being prosecuted under Article 9.2 for their behaviour in ridiculing and violating Articles 1, 2 and 3.  One may come up with all sorts of legal arguments.  Indeed even the past case dealt with in this regard by our Supreme Court will be quoted as a reason for maintaining that what I am saying is untrue.  They are not identical cases, not that I agree with the findings of that case, <i>Boland versus the Taoiseach.</i> Whatever about the legal status being violated, there is no question but that the spirit of Articles 2, 3 and 1 of our Constitution has been violated and ridiculed by this agreement and we are going to register it at the UN for the world to see.  The Taoiseach said something some nights ago to the effect that he was not too enamoured with these Articles and did not think they should be there at all. That gives a clue, no doubt, as to how we have fared and how we will fare under this abominable so-called agreement that has been entered into and signed on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The net result of all this will be that we will give everything that is asked.  We cannot really refuse because we have no right in the last analysis to dispute anything that may come within the purview of the Conference.  Of course it will be given a very high status.  This is actually quoted in one Article of the agreement. The high status is assured because of the fact that it will be at ministerial level but not as equals.  No way is there any equality in the joint chairmanship of that Conference or in what is finally decided after each Conference meeting.  The British hold on to the absolute power to make the final decisions on any and all matters that may come within the consideration of this Conference.  We will be seen throughout the world to share a responsibility but with no power.  Therefore in the eyes of the world we will be a party to Castlereagh barracks interrogation centre, strip searching in Armagh, the treatment and the segregation of our prisoners in Britain's mainland.  Responsibility <Col N="2904" /> for these things we will carry jointly with our occupier, with no power on our part to change any of those things.</P>
    <P>It is noteworthy for anybody who is superstitious that there are 13 Articles in this agreement.  The 13th Article comes into being when the two Parliaments have notified each other that they have adopted the agreement.  The 13th is unlucky and it does not need any sage, seer or prophet to say that this one will turn out to be unlucky because it starts from a bad base and cannot but be to our detriment in the future in every sense.</P>
    <P>There is this obsession about violence. It has great emotive appeal to talk about ending violence and bringing about peace.  I fully subscribe to that emotive plea, totally and completely, but this Government and Taoiseach are restricting themselves to trying to deal with IRA violence while ignoring the root cause &mdash; the institutionalised violence of the establishment of our occupiers in the Six Counties.  There is the cause.  Until that is dealt with you might as well be whistling past the graveyard talking about putting down violence, whether it is UDA, IRA or any other sort of violence. There is no end to it.</P>
    <P>This agreement unfortunately will create more violence rather than lessen it.  It will create more violence instead of the peace that is expressed as the hope for it because it does not deal with and runs away from the real cause of the violence and the trouble in this country, which is the occupation by the British of this land of ours, to which they have no right, never had, do not have and never will.  They will never be accepted by all the people of this land, no matter who sells what out.  That will stand.</P>
    <P>The denial of our basic right to self-determination must be dealt with.  The institutionalised violence of the establishment must be dealt with.  We must treat the cause and there is only one treatment. We should be at one, totally united &mdash; whatever way we might divide otherwise &mdash; in repeating parrot-like here and abroad and especially in Britain that she must find her way out of this country in <Col N="2905" /> order that we can begin to talk to our neighbours and our Unionist and Protestant friends about how we are to live together in this country in the future instead of dying together, as nearly 2,500 have done in the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>This is what we should be talking about and not this con job which has been welcomed by President Reagan, Tip O'Neill, Senator Kennedy, Senator Moynihan, by the four horsemen.  How the hell did they know what was in it before we did?  How were they so well set up in this propaganda con job that they were able to be on the air before the ink was dry at Hillsborough?  Were they not contrived into that situation?  Do not blame them. What were they told?  Who conveyed to them what was supposed to be in the agreement which they welcomed without seeing?</P>
    <P>Why was the <i>ad hoc</i> Irish committee in Washington not consulted?  That committee have been set up across the entire spectrum of the political divide in America. Some of the finest men and women in Congress are there, black and white, in the interests of justice for Ireland. They were not asked.  There are 132 of them out of a total membership of Congress of 430.  Could they not be found or was it that they were asked and they did not get the right recording back?  Perhaps they were ignored because it was felt they would not get the right recording back. Where was the National Caucus?  Was it asked?  Not on your nanny, for the simple reason that the recording would not be in accord with the agreement in Hillsborough.</P>
    <P>Surely this is the con job of all time. Surely the contrived media control applied to this country and outside is evident.  In the RTE studios on the night of the signing, 75 to 80 per cent of the entire time of the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme was devoted to those who were pro the agreement.  Was that an accident? Was it an accident that I was the only one among a group of four who participated in a radio programme at 4 o'clock the same evening who was not clapping hands that the agreement had been signed? Nobody knew what was in it because we <Col N="2906" /> were given a copy only as we went into the studio.  This is the sort of thing that really sickens me but at the same time causes me to admire the whole operation. The British diplomacy victory of the century has culminated in the signing of this document.</P>
    <P>Why is Britain continuing to stay?  Britain came here in conquest and remained to exploit and, as time went on, for strategic reasons.  Now and in the future our land is to be used by her and NATO as the eyes and ears of those great organisations. That is what this is about but we are too damned blind in this country and in this House to see it.  I say that with due respect to the Opposition who have really come good on this.  I am delighted to see that we are not yet dead and that we will be telling people throughout the country just what a con job this has been.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to take up what was said by Deputy Blaney but I will resist that temptation mindful of the appeal made to us by the Taoiseach when he opened the debate, and echoed by the leader of the Opposition.  To take up that contribution by Deputy Blaney, which seems to me to have been an exercise in the worst form of sterile nationalism, would not be a helpful contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways I approach this problem as something of a political agnostic in the sense that I have been comforted by the prospect of wrapping around me a green flag, of whatever shade of green because, like many of my generation, I have seen a Europe where misery, destruction and loss of life were the products of nationalism in its most extreme and virulent form. I indentify some of the same signs and <Col N="2912" /> symptoms here in the form of untrammelled irredentism, all too often clothed in the language of socialism or social reform.</P>
    <P>I have looked at recent Irish history, particularly at performances in recent decades of those who stand in the tradition of Irish nationalism, and I have found it a less than edifying spectacle. What I have seen all too often has been a willingness and enthusiasm for flag waving and balladeering, and the balladeering is all the more morbid and all the less tuneful the later the night.  While all that flag waving, all those strong words, all the balladeering proceeded there has been a tendency to ignore the voices of the people of Northern Ireland, and while we balladeered and sloganised we turned our back on both communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that back turning was particularly painful in regard to the Nationalist community who had looked to us as their guarantors but who found their day to day existence shamefully neglected, shamefully put on the back burner.  Their sense of frustration, disappointment and let down was very clearly expressed at the SDLP conference by Austin Currie when he recalled his visits to Dublin as a member of the old Nationalist Party.  He said: &ldquo;We got plenty of patriotism; there were plenty of speeches made, but very little practical assistance&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;The difference between us and those who went before us is that we eventually decided that our future lay in our own hands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have said that I approached nationalism as a political agnostic, but my first and immediate instinct was that progress lay in the coming together of the people of Northern Ireland and that could best be done through a power sharing executive. But what has been the record in that regard?  We say a brave and noble experiment with people of the honour and vision of Gerry Fitt, John Hume, Brian Faulkner and Oliver Napier.  But that agreement was brought down by what amounted to a <i>coup d'état</i> in the face of a wilting British Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2913" /> Since then, successive British Governments have produced initiatives designed to move along that road.  Each of those initiatives failed.  In the meantime, both communities have contested elections to forums of one sort or another under one label or another.  All of those elections have been contested by the SDLP saying: &ldquo;We contest this seeking a place in Government, seeking to share power, seeking a role of partnership.&rdquo;  All of those elections have been contested by the Unionists on the basis that: &ldquo;What we have we hold, we share with no one.&rdquo; On the basis of that, it seemed to me that slowly and reluctantly I had to come to the conclusion that progress is not to be found through an internal solution &mdash; that the parameters of Northern Ireland are too narrow, that that society is too claustrophobic to allow either community to achieve its full potential and that it is only in a wider context that progress can be found.</P>
    <P>More than two years ago I found myself speaking in Oxford to a meeting of the British-Irish Association and, in the course of my remarks, I turned to the reality of the Northern Nationalist plight. I said that from 1920 onwards they had found themselves part of a State with which they could not identify, the institution of which were alien to them and in many instances were designed and constructed to be alien to them.  I suggested that that sense of alienation could only be addressed by a meaningful Irish dimension.  I was pressed by some of the other participants in that conference, particularly an Official Unionist representative, Edgar Graham, a clear-sighted and brave exponent of his policy position, since brutally and cowardly murdered by the Provisional IRA who declined to engage him in dialogue.</P>
    <P>He pressed me on what I meant by &ldquo;a meaningful Irish dimension&rdquo;.  In the question and answer session I sought for a word and the one that came to me was that we wanted an involvement that was palpable.  Today I looked to find the definition of that word, to see to what extent that test I had set us had been <Col N="2914" /> met.  According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary &ldquo;palpable&rdquo; means that which can be touched or felt, readily perceived by the senses or mind.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what was signed in Hillsborough last week offers a palpable Irish presence.  Indeed, the impact of that and the extent to which it is perceived by the Nationalist community has been indicated in the unanimity of the welcome that has been forthcoming from the leaders of constitutional nationalism in Northern Ireland, whether those leaders are to be found in the political arena, in the religious area or the other community leaders.  Even the briefest examination of the agreement shows how much have been gained by the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>For example, the third paragraph in Article 1 involves a commitment by the British Government to implement Irish unity on their own initiative in the event that consent to that on the part of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland will emerge.  That fully legitimises the objectives of Irish unity from the British point of view because the British commit themselves to support Irish unity actively in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>What is our role at the forthcoming Conference?  There have been suggestions that it is only consultative.  Almost unbelievably it has been suggested by some speakers in the House that our role will be less than consultative.  However, an examination of Article 2 shows how untrue that is.  Article 2 involves an acceptance by the British Government of this Government's right to put forward proposals, and then there is an obligation under an international agreement, in the interests of promoting peace and stability, that determined efforts shall be made through the Conference to resolve any differences.  That is a legally binding obligation to seek to resolve differences.</P>
    <P>Understandably, much of this debate has involved Deputies, particularly on this side, addressing themselves to the Unionist community, because it is felt that the welcome by the Nationalist side, matched by the welcome in this State by Jack Lynch and Deputy Des O'Malley, <Col N="2915" /> indicates that that case has been proved. So people have turned their attention to the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in particular, did that yesterday when he very eloquently addressed the 900,000 members of that community.  I do not think that any words I can say can advance that appeal or that attempt to engage in dialogue.  I will say, however, as clearly as I can to the Unionist community that they are not being threatened, that we have no territorial ambitions, no desire to subjugate their traditions, their values or their ethos. Instead, we rejoice in the celebration of that tradition and recognise it as part of our Irishness.  Let no one believe that anything in this agreement represents a threat to the Unionist community because there is much in this agreement that is of value to them too.</P>
    <P>As has been stressed, there is an affirmation &mdash; and the word &ldquo;Affirmation&rdquo; indicates that something that was there already is now being affirmed &mdash; in a signed legal agreement that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  There is, too, for the Unionists the comfort that the causes of alienation of their Nationalist fellow citizens are being addressed.  Why should that be a comfort?  It should be a comfort because it is on that alienation that extremism has thrived and that violence was begotten.</P>
    <P>Most contributors to this debate have accepted that there are gains both for the Nationalist and Unionist communities but there have been others, both on this side of the House and outside it, who have expressed concern about the consequences of failure.  All of us are concerned about the consequences of failure. We all recognise the fact that this agreement is not without risks but let us consider the alternatives.  An alternative is not that we do nothing and allow a <i>status quo</i>, however unsatisfactory, to continue. We have witnessed a situation, especially in the aftermath of the hunger strikes where a significant minority of the Nationalist side lost faith at least temporarily <Col N="2916" /> in constitutional politics while those who retained their faith in constitutional politics looked increasingly to an inter-governmental process for movement.  If this process were to fail, if for any reason we were to turn our backs on this agreement, that would represent a betrayal of all those who have put their faith in the political path.  That would not be an option that could be available to any responsible Irish Government.  No Irish Government concerned about the difficulties, the subjugation of the Nationalist minority, could walk away from this agreement.  As John Hume said in his address, we owe it to those people to bridge the gap between what is and what ought to be, and that is what we are seeking in this agreement.</P>
    <P>The agreement seeks to advance us on a road towards peace and stability and it seeks to do so without causing violence to any tradition on this island and on the basis of saying to both communities in Northern Ireland that we seek a society in which their identities are respected and cherished.  This generation of Irish politicians could not possibly be seen to turn away.  Too many people have suffered, not only in the past 15 years but throughout the lifetime of the Northern Ireland state, for us to ignore the prospect of improving the lot of both communities who live there.</P>
    <P>There are risks in regard to the agreement but clearly risks involved in seeking progress and movement are much less than the certainty of the chaos and misery that would follow should we decide not to do anything.  That is the choice.  There is no option of a magic wand, of saying, &ldquo;Let us have devolved Government, an internal solution, or whatever.&rdquo;  If we opted to do nothing we would be saying to the Northern Nationalists that constitutional politics do not work.  The implications of that are too dreadful to contemplate.  Instead we take our courage in our hands and determine to make progress, determine to bridge the gap between what is and what ought to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was about to say when I attempted to speak earlier, I <Col N="2917" /> had intended to come here and fulfil the spirit of the statements made both by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition in relation to how we should approach this debate.  In so far as is possible I propose to proceed in that way. However, I am labouring under a number of disadvantages, particularly because of the attitude of the Minister for Health and Social Welfare to a number of very fundamental matters that have been of great importance to Irish people, not alone down through the centuries but right up to the present.  In view of that kind of attitude I consider that I have a duty to respond to some of what the Minister said.</P>
      <P>I found it strange and to some extent frightening that a Minister in our Government could refer to constitutional implications as trivial.  He set out very determined in his opening remarks to trivialise the Constitution, to refer to it as some rather despicable document, a document that was not important and about which, if we were speaking, we were being misled.  The Minister spoke of the Constitution as a document which should be forgotten about and said that anything in this agreement should be debated on its own merits.</P>
      <P>It would be nice for all of us, in the interest of serving our own point of view, if at any time on any subject we chose to discard all those fundamental laws, directives and guidelines that have been set out by wise people down through the years to help us develop and progress in a positive way but the reality is different. I trust that the Minister will have an opportunity at a future date to reverse what he said.  He referred to the philosophy of those who follow fervently held Nationalist beliefs and aspirations as a philosophy akin to pub talk.  I am using his words more or less in saying that, but if that attitude is typical of the ethos of the Government in relation to the Nationalist aspirations as expressed in our Constitution this is a sad day for our people and for our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State disappointed me, too, because, as I think the Chair would agree, the debate had proceeded in an <Col N="2918" /> orderly and unemotive fashion up to the point where the Minister of State attempted to subvert the agreement that was entered into mutually by the Whips.  I was very disappointed with the arrogance from the far side of the House in that regard.  I could not condone the line they took and I am very disappointed that the Minister of State should be the one to set that kind of tone in terms of the rules of order of the House.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about what should be the position of any constitutional democratic party &mdash; I will not say &ldquo;Nationalist&rdquo; party for the moment because that is a word that is being frowned on and spat out by people on the other side of the House &mdash; but that any constitutional democratic party should, must and can take only one approach to this agreement, that international opinion is in favour of it, that the significance of the agreement is such as to dictate what we should or should not say and what attitude we should or should not adopt.  I reject that totally.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the background to the process which has been continued over the last few years and our Leader's position.  In 1980 he very clearly, definitely and wisely identified the problem of Northern Ireland as one that could be solved only in an international arena on the basis of Anglo-Irish relations and negotiations.  He very fervently aspired to that aim.  It was through his insight into the problems of Northern Ireland that that process was initiated and the intention was to continue it to a satisfactory conclusion.  Many speakers on the Government side, including the Taoiseach, referred to the initiation of that process and attempted to convince us that because he started this process we have to agree with what they purport to represent as the culmination of that process. If this agreement is the culmination of that process, then something went very wrong in the interim.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for referring to the constitutional aspects of this agreement and I want to refer to many other aspects which, in other circumstances and given a <Col N="2919" /> different text, might be said to be positive and commendable, but I will do that later in this contribution.  I think this agreement is badly flawed.  It is dangerous and I do not believe anyone who aspires to the legitimate cause of the reunification of this country would agree with it. Article 1 (a) states that the two Governments affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  That paragraph is a fundamental barrier to the continuation of the process as I understand it and creates a very serious international precedent for this Government, for this House and for future endeavours on the part of Irish Governments to convince the British Government of the need for political change in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe it dilutes and significantly diminishes the constitutional rights to aspire to a reunification of this country, constitutional rights that have been consistently adhered to by successive Governments.  I am sad that this Government have chosen as the opening affirmation to concede that basic fundamental principle.  This is a principle which I and the Fianna Fáil Party hold very dearly. We will continue to adhere to that principle and to reaffirm it without deviation, without compromise and without any apologies to anybody who might be caught with different philosophies and who might be ready to permit themselves to be hoodwinked &mdash; and I believe this is what happened in the case of this agreement &mdash; by promises from a source which has been found to be less than reliable in the past.</P>
    <P>My initial concern is the constitutional aspect of this agreement and what would appear to be the <i>de jure</i> recognition for the first time of the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Over the last 50 or 60 years we have had to accept the <i>de facto</i> position that it was part of the United Kingdom in terms of economic, social and political values, but our Constitution continually reaffirms for us the <i>de jure</i> position.  That, I believe, has been badly compromised in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2920" /> There is another basic fundamental flaw in this agreement, that is, the concept of the problems in Northern Ireland. If one looks through the various provisions and asks oneself where the main emphasis lies, one would have to agree that the thrust is in the area of security and related matters.  In other words, the document sets out to provide a framework to combat violence and the hope that with the co-operation of the Irish Government, that violence will be diminished significantly, if not entirely obliterated. That would be a commendable aspiration if the problem were understood but as has been the case consistently with the British Government, what has been addressed here is solely the matter of the men of violence.  We are all democratic, constitutional politicians and commend the decision to address the men of violence, but this document sets out solely to take on the men of violence without seeking the underlying problems. I believe, and I regret having to say it, that this document will not succeed and that is its weakness.</P>
    <P>I have always held the view that to say there are a finite number of people in the North, on both sides of the political divide, engaged in violence is one thing but to say that if you can track them down and get rid of them you will have cured the problem is short sighted and fails to grasp the fundamental problem which has existed since the foundation of the State. This problem is essentially about the division of the country, the unnatural situation that is the Six Counties in the north-eastern corner of the country.  That is essentially why there is violence in the North, why it continues unabated and why it is coming more to the fore in recent years.  If this problem is not addressed &mdash; and this document certainly does not do that &mdash; then we are not addressing the problem of violence in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Allied to that is the veto for the Unionists. Anybody can say that a slight step forward is important, commendable and advantageous, and I would be the first to say that, but if that step forward did not take on board an Irish Government's commitment to acknowledge the right of <Col N="2921" /> veto to the Unionists, then we could all be commending this agreement.  The British Prime Minister and others have come out publicly and stated that for the first time ever an Irish Government have acknowledged in a formal international agreement that this veto is there and that it should remain for as long as Unionists wish.</P>
    <P>My contention is that this is rubber stamping the perpetuation of violence directly and indirectly.  Some people used the Unionist opposition to impute value to this agreement.  I reject that out of hand.  The Unionist reaction, whatever form it takes, is in no way an imputation of value for this agreement.  From day one the Unionists have been asking, but have never been prepared to give.  That is the way they have acted over the last few decades and that is how they will continue.</P>
    <P>The retention of the veto in the short term or the long term is the greatest stumbling block to the elimination of violence in the North.  We do not know how long the agreement will last because definitive time spans are not involved. The agreement talks about a review after three years or in the interim if one of the parties so choose.  I am disappointed and concerned that an Irish Government should affirm in an agreement of this kind the right of that veto to remain.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we as a party are being irresponsible in taking the attitude we are taking given the level of international recognition of this agreement and its recognition by the SDLP and the two parties in Government.  To take such an approach is to deny a democratic Nationalist party their right to hold a position.  It is also a failure on the part of the Government to accommodate, during the course of this process, the view of this side of the House.  I am disappointed at the failure of the Government to consult with the Leader of my party and this side of the House in the lead up to the finalisation and formalisation of the agrement.  That cannot be condoned or commended and it must reflect a basic weakness in the final run up approach of the Government to the <Col N="2922" /> conclusion and publication of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Many things have been said on both sides of the House in relation to alienation in Northern Ireland.  It has been said that a fresh start was needed, a new approach was required and measures and mechanisms were needed to enable the Unionists and Nationalists to participate in a form of Government to which they could both give allegiance and loyalty and where they could be confident that they would get equality of opportunity, fairness and so on.  I visited West Belfast last year and saw for myself the extent of alienation there.  I spoke to numerous people who felt they could not identify with the Government, the security forces, or the courts and with the form of law and order that has been perpetuated in Northern Ireland in recent years.  It made no attempt to take their points of view on board and, fundamentally, it refused to accept and recognise their legitimate aspirations.</P>
    <P>Is this situation addressed in this document? Statements are made, opinions and sentiments are expressed there suggesting that this Conference will address this kind of acute alienation and that people in this plight can be convinced that it is in their interests to co-operate with the security forces and the forces of law and order generally.  The powers conferred on this Conference do not encourage Nationalists in this isolated position to co-operate.  They do not give them confidence in a system they believe should be fair and which should have the flexibility to recognise their aspirations.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made on both sides of the House about the Conference, its powers and functions and how important it is as part of the ovrall package.  We were told by the Taoiseach in his address to the House yesterday that:</P>
    <P>This provision, going beyond a consultative role, but necessarily because of the sovereignty issue falling short of an executive role, provides, in the Government's view the most effective method by which to ensure the existence of structures capable of eroding <Col N="2923" /> the alienation of the Nationalist minority.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach makes a very definitive statement that this Conference will have a role greater than that of consultation and the Minister of State Deputy Birmingham also referred to this aspect.  I challenge the Taoiseach to say where in this document it is implied that the Conference will have a consultative, let alone in excess of a consultative role?  Article 2 (b) says:</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom Government accept that the Irish Government will put forward views and proposals on matters relating to Northern Ireland within the field of activity of the Conference...</P>
    <P>Article 4 (c) says:</P>
    <P>The Conference shall be a framework within which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the modalities of bringing about devolution in Northern Ireland, in so far as they relate to the interests of the minority community.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other references to the function and role of the Conference in this context, but at no point in that document it is implied that the role of the Conference will take on a consultative dimension.  It is wrong and irresponsible for anybody to impute a significance that it does not have in the context of this text.  The Taoiseach said that there were no hidden agreements, that everything was transparent and that the transparency of the whole document pointed to its integrity, honesty and self-explanatory nature.  If that is the case how can the Taoiseach say it has a consultative role?  This is merely the regularisation of a forum that has been in existence over the last number of years whereby Irish Governments can put forward views and express concern and anxiety in relation to security matters and political decisions particularly as they affect the Nationalist minority community in Northern Ireland. That facility has always been there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2924" /> I recall a discussion and debate with the Minister, Deputy Barry, in this House in relation to the Prevention of Terrorism Acts and the supergrass trials where he made statements in relation to his representations detailing a whole series of concerns which he had taken to the highest level of the British Government well before this Conference was proposed.  If that is the case, and I must accept the Minister's statements on those occasions, I cannot accept that this Conference has any role other than the regularisation of what was an informal mechanism to exchange views.  If we come to the statements in the agreement as to where the final say is, it is very clear.  There is no equivocation, no qualification in relation to it.  The final sentence of Article 2 (b) states:</P>
    <P>There is no derogation from the sovereignty of either the Irish Government or the United Kingdom Government, and each retains responsibility for the decisions and administration of government within its own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>That is very explicit, very definite.  There is no ambiguity there.  Given that, the decision of an Irish Government to enter into an inter-parliamentary conference at this time must give rise to serious concern. On the one hand, given the level of violence perpetuated by the men of violence in the North in terms of the IRA and, indeed, on the other side the UDA, and the level of institutionalised violence which has been recognised by this Government and this House and has been perpetuated more particularly against the Nationalist minority community there, how can we as a House of Parliament, a Dáil, stand up and say that we agree to a situation whereby a senior Minister in our Government goes up to exchange views in a particular role in Belfast in relation to security matters and at the end of the day has no real, significant say as to how those security operations are to be put into force?  It would appear on the basis of that that the Taoiseach has allowed his Government to be compromised. Fundamentally this depends on <Col N="2925" /> a significant and enormous amount of goodwill on the part of the British Government, on significant forthcoming the likes of which we have never seen previously in the history of Anglo-Irish relations.  I have no reason or evidence to be convinced that the British Government have the commitment to be forthcoming to the degree to which this Conference would warrant they should to enable a Minister of our Government here to have a significant, influential input into policy matters regarding security and political structures.</P>
    <P>Not alone was this an Anglo-Irish dimension, it has an international dimension. If this agreement is signed under the Charter of the UN &mdash; the Taoiseach pointed out to us yesterday that it must be, that any international agreement of this kind must be signed by the UN &mdash; then inevitably any concern or protest put forward by the Minister must be put forward in a private capacity within the context of this Conference.  If no positive response is forthcoming we have no recourse to international opinion because it would be thrown back in our faces immediately that we have already been party to a formalised international agreement adopted by the UN and that is the mechanism through which all our concern, all our fears in relation to the minority in Northern Ireland must be funnelled.  We will not be taken seriously should we go outside that mechanism for the duration of this agreement.  Therefore, I consider the situation that we find ourselves in one of compromise.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the judicial system, the Diplock courts and the SDLP.  I am sorry that Senator Bríd Rogers has left the House.  First, I want to take on board a couple of sections of this document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I will withdraw that.  I want to refer to objectives on cross-Border co-operation, security and economic, social and cultural matters as defined in Article 9. Taking Article 9 in isolation I would have <Col N="2926" /> to say that it is very admirable and commendable and that the objectives set there need co-operation from all of us. I have no doubt that they will get co-operation from all of us.  It is very important and urgent that we take on the problems that have arisen on both sides of the Border as a result of this violence and the spill-over effects to the Border counties. The aspirations, objectives and aims set here deserve our support, but the big problem is the price we are asked to pay for them.  It is we, the Irish Government, who are asked to pay that price.  Having said that, I want to wish Article 9 and all it contains well.  I hope the mechanisms proposed in that regard, the programmes that are to be introduced and the attempts made to seek international aid, will be successful, but I ask the Government to look seriously again at the huge price in terms of Article 1.</P>
      <P>I have seen the judicial system in Northern Ireland at first hand during my visit to the Belfast Crown Court.  I saw Diplock courts, supergrass trials in operation. I was shocked as a democratic, constitutional Nationalist to see a judicial system in operation that seems geared up completely to support a military operation. That, to me, was very negative.  It was to be condemned.  I am sorry to have to say that I cannot see any mechanisms strong enough in this document, any programmes or structures, to take on that system.  Incidentally, I can see no reference to the judicial system in Northern Ireland or, if it is there, it is very terse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker made a considerable effort to be reasonable at the end of this speech and I commend him for the effort although he appeared to extend but a grudging wish to those who have worked so hard and so carefully to put together the agreement we are discussing.  I have listened to a number of speeches for the last few hours and I ask myself if the ordinary people whose lives could be affected by what we are doing here today and if we fail to do something here today wers listening and seeking to inform themselves about how this agreement would affect their lives, <Col N="2927" /> their standard of living, the security and the safety of their children and their prospects of a longer and peaceful life, how reassured or enlightened they would be, having listened to the speeches I have heard from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>I came to the conclusion that after listening for a couple of minutes the ordinary people of Northern Ireland, on either side of the divide, would have filtered away and proceeded to return to their boring or interesting routine daily work because they would find nothing of interest in what is being said.  The debate is being carried on in an abstract, legalistic way that gives the impression that those speaking are not concerned about individuals who happen to have a grave, serious problem, and that they are not seeking to relate to those people and their problems.  I thought that the real Fianna Fáil spoke when Deputy Blaney came into the House.  As evidence of the fact that I was not the only one who thought so, quite a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies came in to pay their respects and to listen to what he was saying.  When he has finished I thought of the Kavanagh poem:</P>
      <P>Will it never be morning, always evening</P>
      <P>After harvest always lost?</P>
      <P>When Drake was winning seas for England</P>
      <P>We sailed in puddles of the past</P>
      <P>  After the ghost of Brendan's mast.</P>
      <P>We are not sailing in puddles of the past on this side of the House.  I want to assure people that it is morning here on the Government benches and we look forward to a brighter day.  We are not gathering up, as Deputy Blaney seems to think, a lost harvest.  We are planting a seed which Deputy Blaney knows will produce a plant that will smother the bitter herbage on which he, his followers and the Fianna Fáil party have fed in recent years, of bitterness and remembrance of bad days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many lessons are to be learned from the past but we pity ourselves too much for the historic problems we have <Col N="2928" /> inherited and for the economic and social problems resulting from our history and geography.  We think we are the only people in the world who have been compelled to suffer by circumstances, factors and influences ourside our control.  That is pure and absolute nonsense.  The problem we have in Ireland has its parallel throughout the Continent of Europe.  It has all the ingredients of the problems that occurred throughout that Continent. religious, boundary and power mongering. In Poland today the people can look east to Russia and see part of their country that was annexed long since our Border was established.  In Germany they can see part of their country that is in Poland and Germany itself is divided. The French have their problems with Corsica and the Spaniards their problems in the Basque country.  Even civilised, modernised and affluent Belgium has its problems to such an extent that it must appoint two Ministers for Education, one to accommodate the special interests and concerns of Walloons and one for the Flemish.  Division is deep and real in those countries.  This is not the only place in the world where divisions exist.</P>
    <P>Let us recognise that our problem is no more impracticable than other problems that have been resolved and that it is possible to resolve this problem.  It strikes me that Members on the opposite side of the House have opted from the beginning to this day for a solution that is all or nothing.  However, nothing is what they have got and nothing is what they are happy to take if they cannot get all.  On the other hand the Taoiseach, and Tánaiste, and those who have prepared this agreement have decided to embark on the correct process.</P>
    <P>It would be very foolish of us to believe that we are celebrating the achievement of something.  What we are doing is assessing the beginning of something that could be extremely important.  This is not a settlement; it is an agreement.  If things go well, depending on the people who work it, on the circumstances that arise in the months and years ahead, on how the political sitution in Northern Ireland and Britain develops, an economic and <Col N="2929" /> other factors in the wider world, we can look forward to a steady improvement in the relationship between the people of Northern Ireland who will recognise that in it there has not been a victory for either side or necessity for either side to accept a defeat or a serious loss.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to a problem articulated by a minority on this side of the Border and a minority in the House, people have expressed serious concern that the Unionists in Northern Ireland were not consulted about the agreement.  They have expressed concern that what we are seeking to do on this occasion is what we had always said we would not do, that is, to make a deal behind their backs and impose on them terms that are against their will.  We are being over generous to the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland if we adopt that approach.  More than a month ago I believe the leadership of the majority in Northern Ireland had recognised that agreements were being made which would affect the structures by which they would be governed in the future.  They sought to bring together representatives from a wide political spectrum in Northern Ireland.  Under the chairmanship of the British Conservative member of the European Parliament, Sir Fred Catherwood, they brought together the Alliance and the various Unionist elements and put forward proposals in the full knowledge of what was taking place in the negotiations between the British and Irish Governments at the time.  They chose at that moment not to be magnanimous, not to offer a permanent place to the minority in Northern Ireland at the table where they could participate in decision-making.</P>
    <P>In the full knowledge that important decisions were about to be made, decisions they knew would be imposed upon them through the democratic system in the UK of which they claimed to be part, they chose to let things happen as they did.  Even at that stage they could have proposed a solution to the problem which would, perhaps, have satisfied the minority and made this whole process unnecessary.  The Unionists recognised <Col N="2930" /> what was going to happen but allowed it to happen although they could have changed it.</P>
    <P>We should remember that ten years ago the same Unionist politicians opposed the Treaty of Accession to the European Economic Community proclaiming that the Treaty was giving away the sovereignty of the people of Britain and was a threat to the nationality and the integrity of the UK.  However, they accepted the decision at the end of the day because they are only a small minority in a State which they claim to be part of.  In my belief they will, through the democratic process, accept the decision that has been made on their behalf. Nobody can say that the Unionist population, with 15 members at Westminister who always enjoyed a good relationship with the British Conservative Party, whose economic and social views are very close to that party and who have many friends and close contacts in that party, have not been consulted or had their views taken into account.</P>
    <P>Today there has been a wide discussion about the constitutional position in Northern Ireland.  I hear the word &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; very often.  I live in a Border constituency where people realise that a Constitution exists and are grateful for the protection it gives them but the vast majority of them have never read it although they may have heard of one or two Articles of it.  They know, in some obscure way, that our Constitution claims jurisdiction over the island of Ireland but that may not even matter in their daily lives.  People there may hear a politician refer to it on the evening news or hear people debate its Articles on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;.  When they go to buy some goods in Enniskillen or Lisnaskea they are confronted at the Border with a Free State customs post, a military post and after that a British customs post.  As far as they are concerned in their everyday life the man who said that we had jurisdiction over the island of Ireland was like the weatherman who told them at night they could expect a fine day to follow but when they got up in the morning it was raining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2931" /> In reality it is all right for the lawyers and those who like to deal in theories, but for those who live along the Border &mdash; I have lived along the Border all my life &mdash; this fine talk about the existence of an Article in our Constitution which guarantees the integrity of the island of Ireland and all that is a lot of nonsense. It means very little to the people who must make their living along the Border. It means very little to the people who live in Derry or Belfast, to the ordinary citizens of the island North or South. They want to know if they can look forward to the prospect of peace, whether the agreement can give us the opportunity to put our unemployed to work and whether we can expect a better tourism season next year with more people coming here to enjoy our natural amenities. Very few ordinary people will be asking about the last letter of the law that is written into our Constitution.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of encouragement offered to the people of Ireland by the fact that countries like the US were prepared to, give substantial economic aid if we could work out an agreement between Britain and ourselves in Regard to Northern Ireland.  I do not believe that any package of aid for Northern Ireland and the Border areas, whether from the US, the EC, Australia or anybody else will go very far towards resolving the problems that exist.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that over the past 20 years Northern Ireland has had the best package of regional aids and incentives of any place in the world.  The amount of money provided by the British Government for the establishment of industries, for the development of agriculture and for roads, money which was generated outside the Six Counties, transferred there and spent there, is almost without precedent elsewhere in the world.  Yet their relative productivity, standards of living and economic growth have continued to decline by comparison with those of the less subsidised, no better endowed with natural resources South of Ireland.  The sum of £400 million or 500 million dollars may sound quite good and that is a very generous gesture of which <Col N="2932" /> I would not want to make little, but even if we succeed in convincing the States of Europe or the European Community to go along with providing similar amounts of money they will be relatively small by comparison with the money poured into that area over the last 25 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>I do not think the European Community would be able to go along with a trust fund.  If there is participation from European countries it will be as individual States because the Economic Community has its own budgetary process.  It has its own special measures in place in Northern Ireland.  These measures can be improved an extended and new regulations can be made if the Community can find the money and thinks it is important to do so.  However, there is no substitute for giving the people of Northern Ireland the confidence to invest their own money in their own State in the interests of making a profit and in the knowledge that their investment is secure in a stable, political situation.  Until a stable, political situation is established there, we will not have a reduction in the dole queues which are the most serious in Europe, and rising as high as 50 per cent in some places like Derry, Strabane and some parts of west Ulster.</P>
    <P>If we are to make this agreement work it will not be as simple as appointing a Minister to sit on this Inter-governmental Conference, to give him our political support after two days' talk in Leinster House, to let him get on with the business up there and expect the cost to be financed by friendly States.  For the last ten years since we became a member of the European Community, in theory &mdash; and even before that when Seán Lemass established a free trade agreement with the British &mdash; we have had a situation in which we should not have had customs barriers within the Republic and Northern Ireland.  When Seán Lemass concluded his free trade agreement, we looked forward to the day when the Border would disappear.  That agreement had just matured at the time we joined the European Community.  Those of us who lived near the Border thought, as time went on and our transitional period came to an end, that that Border would <Col N="2933" /> disappear.  Instead of erasing that Border and of reducing its impact on the two communities, we first had the effects of the troubles which led to greater security but above and beyond that we had diverging economic policies and diverging taxation policies which forced the Irish Government to man that Border in a way that had not been done in previous years to pursue a protectionist policy against the citizens of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have gone to fairs and markets and met the dealers and tanglers, met the farmers and traders of Northern Ireland and I believe in my heart that there is no better way of breaking down the barriers, resolving the problems and reaching understanding then to carry on business with those people in our everyday life. Yet the Government who proclaimed here in Leinster House that this Border according to our Constitution did not exist, imposed on us this system of customs posts which made it impossible to do business.  The sad thing was that it was not on the Northern side of the Border that the barrier existed.  It was the Free State customs post personnel who looked in the boot of the car, searched under the seats, asked what you bought and how much you paid for it.</P>
    <P>I have heard at county council meetings the greatest of Republicans, men who spoke as Deputy Blaney spoke today, when occasion arose, condemn the intrusion from the Six County areas of traders and suppliers, whether it be with gravel, blocks, cement, timber or other goods which they were selling in the Republic.  Three or four weeks ago I heard people proclaiming that the Northern farmers should be stopped from buying straw down here and taking it into the Six Counties.  I am trying to point out that there is an opportunity through our membership of the European Community to reduce the impact of that Border.  After all, 15 per cent of all the new legislation which affects Northern Ireland, ourselves and the British is now made in an institution which is common to all of us.  That is some progress, a <Col N="2934" /> progress on which we have failed to capitalise. We have not sought, certainly not publicly, to ensure that in the area of sheep meat, cereals, pigs and even of dairy produce that we should have a common regime for Northern Ireland and the South.  If we had proposed that we develop policies which would seek to establish economic convergence between the two parts of Ireland, we would have got much support in the European Community over the years.  It is not late now. When we apply to the European Community and to the United States or other friendly states who offered us aid, I would like to see that aid administered in the Border areas by some body or organisation with the power to operate in a Border region rather than two separate instruments being used to spend the money on either side of the Border. There is no question that the economic and social effects and the suffering arising out of insecurity and danger have not existed solely on one side of the Border. We know what this has cost people on both sides.</P>
    <P>That is just one of the sacrifices that we must make.  We must be tolerant of the views of the minority, even if progress is not as rapid as we would like it to be. The whole subject of the obligations of Catholic legislators to legislate according to their own informed Catholic consciences sometimes worries me.  A few years ago I was travelling on an aeroplane which was flying to East Pakistan and the flight took about 14 hours.  I had some Irish whiskey with me which I was taking to the place that I was going to visit, which was China.  All that time a man was sitting beside me with whom I developed a good relationship.  He was in Britain on business.  Some time during the night when he got his coffee I asked would he like a little drop of Irish whiskey. He said that he would love it, but looked around and said that he had better not, that he had some friends behind him and he did not want to get 12 lashes when we landed at Rawalpindi.  I pitied this man on whom was being enforced the morality of the majority of the country in which he lived.  I live in a parish where <Col N="2935" /> traditionally something like 30 per cent of the people were what we used to call Unionists.  I do not believe that they are Unionists any longer; they participate in the ordinary political activity in the parish, vote and are members of political parties.  I do not want anybody to tell me that because I am a Catholic I must impose my Catholic views on those neighbours. I do not have to have the Garda Síochána, the Army, or the machinery of State to tell me what I ought to do according to my informed Catholic conscience. I object to anybody telling me that I must impose my theological belief or anybody else's on a minority of people who feel quite free to do something I think is wrong, providing, of course, that we legislate in the interests of public order, justice and security.  As one who comes from an area where a minority have always lived peacefully, happily and in harmony, I feel I ought to tell this House that it is fine to talk about Articles of the Constitution but it is another matter when we are asked to pay the price that must be paid in many ways for the eventual reunification of the people of this island.</P>
    <P>As a person who started off my life very impatient about the whole process I did not think I would have the patience to wait until I was 46 years of age to see that Border disappear.  Today I am quite happy at 46 years of age to see the beginnings, or what I hope will prove to be the beginnings, of the end of the division of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Members from all sides of the House in making a brief contribution to this debate.  I wish to respond in a positive way to the plea from the lead speakers for restrained and reasoned contributions.  For our part the tone and tenor of the debate was set by our Leader, Deputy Haughey, who, in keeping with the tradition of Fianna Fáil on the Nationalist question, displayed, in his thoughtful contribution, sensitivity about the conscientiously held views of the two Northern traditions, supported by reasoned and logical arguments towards <Col N="2936" /> finding a permanent solution for the ending of an era which has caused anxiety and heartbreak for those traditions for over half a century.</P>
      <P>In the same way as we hope and appeal for tolerance and understanding between the two traditions, it is equally legitimate to claim that the same criteria should apply to the differing traditions within this House, the aspirations and hopes of the differing political philosophies, indeed, the views of individual Members who spoke here who feel deeply and strongly on how and by what means a solution can be found to this great human tragedy.  It can be credibly said of all who have spoken in this debate that we all share a common desire in seeking an end to bloodshed and violence and of creating a social and economic climate in all of the island of Ireland, a climate in which people can live in peace and harmony with each other, in which there is a respect for human dignity and an acceptance and respect for democracy and the rule of law.  Tragically, for far too long these conditions have not prevailed in Northern Ireland.  It behoves all of us to keep on searching for a solution.</P>
      <P>We should put on record in this debate our appreciation of the many people in this House who over the years tried, as we are doing today, to find a lasting solution, who, alas, saw their hopes and aspirations dashed by renewed violence and bloodshed. It is also right that we should acknowledge the efforts of the many people in Northern Ireland who, in very difficult and dangerous circumstances, tried in their way to bring about a unification of hearts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to and wish to acknowledge, the efforts of the SDLP and other reasonable thinking people in the North who gave so much of their time and who so generously put their lives at risk in an effort to bring about peace and reconciliation.  The SDLP and all those groups could always look to this party for support and encouragement. I can assure them of a continuance of that support in our common goal and desire to bring about peace and stability on this island.  They, perhaps more than us, have borne the heat of the day. <Col N="2937" /> I can honestly say that though we may not have been there to share the burden physically with them, we shared very much in the mental trauma and anguish all of us have experienced in that part of the island over such a long number of years.</P>
    <P>I should like also to acknowledge the generosity of the Taoiseach in paying a tribute to our party leader for his untiring efforts in raising the Irish question to a new dimension and status.  Even if we do say it from this side of the House, Deputy Haughey's commitment to and passion for a united Ireland have surmounted all of his other very genuine commitments to social and economic development.  It would be a travesty of justice and a grave injury to the man and this party if attempts were made to deny him the recognition he has so dearly earned for himself in this sensitive area of national administration.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil welcome and support every positive step along the road to Irish unity.  That view has been expressed consistently by the present Leader of Fianna Fáil and was reaffirmed by him in his opening remarks in this debate.  If that commitment has been overshadowed by his reaffirmation of our party stand on sovereignty and on the legitimate right of the Irish nation to decide its destiny, then let me, from this side of the House, endeavour to put the record straight.  I believe, and I know it is the view of my party, that having achieved what has been achieved in this agreement &mdash; and I do not want to sound like a pessimist &mdash; it is not unreasonable to say many question marks surround the agreement itself.  It should not have been necessary in this agreement to give statutory international recognition to British sovereignty over part of our legitimate territory.  It is a very serious, retrograde step which prevents any Irish Government, regardless of the success or otherwise of this agreement, from ever again raising at international level the question of the partition of our country.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening comments that this House should try to understand the <Col N="2938" /> legitimate and sincerely held views of those who differ from this Government on some aspects of the national question. For me and for Fianna Fáil this issue is basic to the ethos and traditions of our party which I hope will always be upheld by the party.  I do not want to use emotive words but the British Prime Minister's success in having the partition of our country officially recognised and confirmed by international agreement is asking us to sell our soul and should not, with goodwill, have been necessary.  If there was a genuine intent and a genuine desire on the part of the British Government to assist in bringing about peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland I do not think we should have been asked to go so far along that road.  I will not make an issue of that matter in this debate because I notice that people are only waiting to point the finger and say that we are putting our national aspirations ahead of the need to achieve unity and reconciliation.  I want to say quite categorically that this is not the case as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  We have registered our protest at that part of the agreement.  History will judge our stand on it.</P>
    <P>I assure the Taoiseach and the Government that we will support all positive moves which we have been assured will quickly develop following the acceptance of this agreement.  Fianna Fáil have never stood in the way of progress towards unification and Fianna Fáil policy through the years has endeavoured to bring about a situation by negotiation, dialogue and discussion where some progress could be made along that road.  I would be the first to acknowledge and recognise that it is a tedious, difficult and dangerous road which must be planned and taken in stages.  It has always been our policy to recognise that aspect of negotiations in relation to unity.</P>
    <P>I will be watching promised developments in the area of administration of justice, although I must confess that I was extremely disappointed some nights ago when listening to a news programme on one of the British channels.  Questions were put to the British Prime Minister in <Col N="2939" /> relation to this agreement and she was asked about co-operation between North and South on the administration of justice. Her reply was very evasive and certainly did not offer anything positive which would be of encouragement to me. I will be watching in particular the promised development in the area of the administration of justice.  If there is a single area of British rule in Northern Ireland which stands out as corrupt and unacceptable it must surely be the maladministration of justice.  While we have reservations about registering this agreement at the United Nations, I hope that body will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that a proper concept of justice and human rights is implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>Our Leader said yesterday:</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, that we look closely at what the arrangement offers in this regard, particularly in the security area.  One of the most unpalatable aspects of the administration of Northern Ireland at present is the structure and operation of the security services there, the manner in which justice is administered and the procedures adopted in the courts.  It is the administration of justice and the operation of the security forces which presses most heavily and grievously on the Nationalist community, that causes most resentment, anger and the feeling of injustice.  This resentment, anger and sense of injustice focuses particularly on the UDR, a sectarian armed force, which would not be tolerated in any other parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the civilised world would a system of justice which has been based on lies and deceit be allowed to continue for so long as in that part of our island. Nowhere would the continued imprisonment of people convicted in supergrass trials be allowed.  Many other speakers on this side of the House referred to that despicable performance in what is supposed to be the administration of justice in Northern Ireland.  Nowhere in the <Col N="2940" /> civilised world would the continued degrading of prisoners through strip-searching and other humiliating practices be allowed to continue, as they are still continuing in Northern Ireland prisons. If there are areas of priority following the setting up of this proposed Conference, I appeal to the Taoiseach to make justice a priority because it is the area from which all other progress must evolve.  It is the one area which more than any other has divided and alienated the two communities for so long.</P>
    <P>This agreement sets up a forum for dialogue and discussion.  I believe in the principle of open and frank discussion and such discussion is even more important when the parties are and have been as opposed in their views as the two traditions have been in Northern Ireland.  It must be said, however, that the right to exchange views has been acknowledged and accepted by both Governments and this has taken place under successive Governments in Britain and Ireland over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>The present proposals formalise and regularise that situation to some extent. They also have the added impetus of having the discussions conducted in a regularised forum in the presence of a Government Minister.  To the extent that such an arrangement is an improvement on the existing position I welcome and support it, but it must be said that no additional status or validity is conferred on the views expressed within that forum. All we got really was a vague statement that a determined effort will be made to try to understand and find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The commitment to sovereignty is endorsed and consolidated by virtue of the agreement, and it will have international status.  It is not unfair to ask what we got in return for the consolidation and international ratification and recognition of the partition of our country.  We have an arrangement whereby the Irish Government may put forward proposals. The agreement says that a determined effort will be made by the British government to understand the problem but, at <Col N="2941" /> the end of the day, that same government will make decisions.  How does one interpret or understand the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;determined effort&rdquo;?  What is the status of that statement?  I submit that it is nothing more than a good intention and in that I am being generous in my interpretation.  I wish to co-operate and to see it succeed.  In a situation in which we have given so much, can we not be more specific and positive in the areas which the agreement identifies as areas for discussion and progress?  I find it difficult to accept that the consolidation and ratification of Partition will contribute to an environment in which the Nationalist minority can expect to have confidence.  However, I hastily add that I am sure that they, like us, will be anxious to give this new forum a chance.</P>
    <P>I ask the House and the Members opposite to give serious thought to the amendment which has been tabled by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I ask them not to write it off as simply an amendment for the sake of putting down an amendment. Read it line by line, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph.  I say in honesty and sincerity that it contains many positive proposals which will bring us well along the road to achieving our goals and ambitions in relation to unification.  The amendment reflects the views of the majority of our people.  It supports the proposals for discussion and dialogue and phased progress in the North, but it also protects our rights and aspirations to secure the eventual reunification of our land.</P>
    <P>It must be a matter for concern that the agreement which was signed may be in conflict with Article 2 of the Constitution. There may be those who will argue that the end justifies the means in this regard, but I contend that any attempt to dismantle the Constitution in this way is to undermine the foundation upon which the State is built.  However, I am not qualified to speak in that regard and I leave that argument to the constitutional lawyers but I restate my view that it should not have been necessary to give official international recognition to the permanent division of our country. <Col N="2942" /> Britain should not have the right to sovereignty in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the British Prime Minister, in her television interview in the House of Commons, went out of her way to state the significance of that arrangement.  Surprise has been expressed on the Government benches and it has been suggested that somehow or other Fianna Fáil should not dare to express reservations in relation to this proposal.  It would be a sad day for the House and the country generally if Fianna Fáil, the largest political party in the country who have contributed so much to national development over the years, who have consistently championed the cause of national unity, who, more than any other party, reflect the tradition and culture of our nation, should not be able to give free expression to their thoughts in this very important debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to outline the depths of despair which exist in Northern Ireland.  It is important to remember some of the things which happened there between 1969 and 1984.  During that time, there was an unprecedented level of violence in the western world.  Not many people in this House know the number of reported bombings, arson and shootings which took place.  The number of recorded instances during that period in Northern Ireland is 43,000; 2,300 people were killed, 24,000 people were injured or maimed, Northern Ireland has the highest prison population in western Europe.  The security cost at 1982 money values to Britain was £5.5 billion and £1 billion to the Republic.  The economic loss, as estimated in the various reports produced by the Forum, was £4 billion to the North and £1.2 billion to the South. The loss in terms of tourism, industrial development and promotion and many other areas of economic activity is included in that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current situation due to the violence has had a profound effect on the administration of justice.  Between 1978 and 1982 22,000 people were arrested, the vast majority of whom were not charged and were released.  Northern Ireland <Col N="2943" /> is a breeding ground for despair and violence and, written all over the Forum report, based on those facts, is the great urgency for something to be done which was recognised by all the parties in the Forum.  That urgency imbued all members of the Forum with the reality that the risks of doing nothing would make the current conflict endemic and irreversible and would also make instability irreversible.</P>
    <P>It must be put on the record of the House that British rule in Northen Ireland amounts to nothing more than crisis management.  Until we get back to democratic politics in Northern Ireland that will have the consent of all elements there, there can not be progress.  That is a starting point from which we should look at the agreement and at the current situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate here, astonishingly has been taken up with Article 1 (a) and (c) in the agreement.  I do not wish to be political in any way but the whole of Fianna Fáil's resentment is based on &ldquo;any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  Have Fianna Fáil read their Forum report lately?  I would ask them to read from page 13, paragraph 3.16:</P>
    <P>Both the Irish and British Governments made declarations on the status of Northern Ireland in which the Irish Government recognised that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland until a majority there desired it...</P>
    <P>That referred to the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies should read the report of the debate here on that agreement.  They will see that the Sunningdale Agreement had a provision similar to the Hillsborough Agreement at Article 1 (a) and (c) which gives a declaration by the British Government:</P>
    <P>(a)  affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only <Col N="2944" /> come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland;</P>
    <P>(c)  declare that, if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, they will introduce and support in the respective parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</P>
    <P>Much of the ground that seems so  in Article 1 of this agreement contains no more, and to a great extent less, than was provided for at Sunningdale, which the Fianna Fáil Party did not oppose.</P>
    <P>I would like to analyse closely the Unionist position and their views on this agreement, not from a co-religious point of view but from the point of view of someone who patiently listened to their submissions in the Forum.  It is quite clear that they were seeking to protect three aspects of what they saw to be Unionism. The first was their link, association and affiliation with Britain.  That was symbolic in so far as it was a link with Westminster and the Crown, sterling and other matters.  The second identity they wished to protect was religion, the Protestant religion, which would give them a liberty of individual conscience.  The third thing they sought to protect was an economic structure, the link with Britain, which gave them better roads, better houses and better schools than we have down here and to a great extent a better standard of living and infrastructural services.</P>
    <P>That is what they seek to protect and we must ask ourselves how would this agreement impinge on those three facets of Unionism.  In this agreement are we, as they would perceive us, seeking to be Fenians, Papists, who are trying to indoctrinate them with a Gaelic culture? I feel frankly that their comments of treachery and betrayal aimed at the British Government have been quite wrong because none of those three facets of Unionism is being impinged on in any way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2945" /> The truth of Unionism today is that what they seek to protect is their dominance in a political power structure in Northern Ireland.  That is the nub of their complaint.  I say quite frankly that they do not have the right to maintain that dominance, but they have the right constitutionally to protect their Britishness, their Protestantism and their economic structure.  This House must respect that. This agreement does not seek to superimpose on them any impingement of their identity but to give equal status and recognition to both communities.</P>
    <P>To a great extent the biggest part this House could play in this debate is to explain to the Unionists that there is a hell of a difference between Gerry Adams and Garret FitzGerald.  In my discussions with them I have found them all too quick to say that Gerry Adams is more overt and Garret FitzGerald more subtle but that they both want the same thing.  They do not want the same thing.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and this side of the House accept the Unionist identity in its Britishness, in its religious connotations and its economic structure.  I will turn to the argument about unity, this sacrosanct principle that cannot be foresaken at any price.  I turn to page 19 of the Forum report, paragraph 4.6 which states:</P>
    <P>The parties in the Forum, representing a large majority of the people of Ireland, reaffirm that their shared aim of a united Ireland will be pursued only by democratic political means and on the basis of agreement.</P>
    <P>The only quibble I have with the Forum report is that it did not have a phrase there that it should have had.  The report is littered with consent and agreement but it did not say that no such consent, no such agreement, exists.  That is the stark reality about Northern Ireland.  It is the basis on which the unity argument breaks down.</P>
    <P>This House should look for a modern form of Irish nationalism to conform with the eighties, to try to form a type of society that transcends religious differences and try to accommodate all traditions in a credible way and not in a <Col N="2946" /> fickle or superficial way, and to establish institutions to protect those diversities and to allow for self-exprrssion, to reject sectarianism and the bigotry that has existed both North and South for too long, and to allow the full level of civil and religious liberties.  Until we broaden that Irish identity and until it goes out loud and clear to Unionists that Irish nationalism has changed in the eighties, we cannot expect their attitude to chance.</P>
    <P>If we read some of the statements of current spokesmen for unity and our attitude to Partition we will see that when we talk about &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo;, in a subsconscious way we are not talking about buying Northern Irish.  Many people, perhaps not those in the House, when they are writing to addresses in Northern Ireland do not put just &ldquo;County Derry&rdquo; or &ldquo;County Armagh&rdquo; on the bottom of the envelope but &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; as well. The Partition subconsciousness has imbued us all.  It relates to everything from soccer teams to commemorative stamps.  Until we change our subsconsciousness about Partition we cannot expect others to realise that nationalism has changed.</P>
    <P>The weakness about the arguments on unity is displayed by the fact that it would cost the Irish Exchequer increases of 45 per cent in every tax under every Revenue heading.  Already we are the highest taxed country in the western world.  The British Government will not and cannot talk about unity, and Northern Ireland does not want unity.  How can we get unity?  We have been waiting 60 years to get it and we are not any nearer to it. Those who argue for Irish unity rely on a failed entity continuing to fail.  They rely on instability becoming greater.  My honest opinion is that the proponents of unity as a single solution depend, unfortunately, on the men of violence to bring about further instability in order to achieve that.  The biggest weakness of the unity argument is that we will get it through full consent.  To Unionists that sounds like saying: &ldquo;We will allow you your freedom but everybody in the State should be celibate&rdquo;.  That is an analogy <Col N="2947" /> of the way Unionists perceive consent.  It does not exist.</P>
    <P>Having said what I believe will not work, I should like to put on the record what I think would work and where blame should be apportioned for the last decade of violence.  I am clear and concise in my thinking in that regard.  I blame singularly Merlyn Rees and Harold Wilson for a failure to implement the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement.  Their weakness and their disaster in not holding firm against the UDA organised workers' strike was the saddest feature of Northern Ireland history in recent times.  The Sunningdale Agreement represented the best bet for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  Since then we have had no political structures.  Instead, we have had a vacuum in which polarisation has extended and in which the extremists and the men of violence have gained ground not only in terms of violence but also in terms of the ballot box.</P>
    <P>In analysing this agreement we must realise that it is easy for Members on this side of the House to support.  It has been supported with a fanfare of trumpets and has got huge international support but it must be said that the agreement is extremely fragile.  People who are in favour of the agreement must have the stomach for the difficulties that lie ahead. Sinn Féin and the IRA have a vested interest already in undermining the Conference. I am sure that they are dreaming up H-Block hunger strikes that would make an Irish Minister's presence extremely difficult.  They will use the issues of strip-searching, of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act and many other sensitive issues to try to make the position of the Minister for Foreign Affairs untenable. Likewise, those outside the House who support this agreement will have to have the stomach to face up to this because the success and the stability of the Conference depend on the reasonableness of the Irish position, not to be walked on but to be reasonable in their demands and in their decision making and consultation process.</P>
    <P>Similarly, during the Ulster Workers <Col N="2948" /> Council strike those people were able to cut off both water and electricity supplies. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that within a year Unionists could repeat that performance.  Therefore, those supporting this agreement must have the foresight, the determination and the courage to be able to say that whatever happens, whatever broadsides may be launched by extremists on any side we will stand firm in the interest of constitutional Nationalism and in the interests of peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>We must analyse the problems that will arise for the Conference.  Many of these emerged during the Forum discussions. For example, in regard to chapter 8 which deals with joint authority, the procedure was that each party put representatives on a committee who would consider each of the three models proposed but that committee were unable to put forward precise answers to what were very difficult questions.  That chapter 8 contains such phraseology as that the model of joint authority is an unprecedented model in the world; that there would be shared powers, provision of devolution to a local assembly, formal recognition of the two identities and rights, a bill of rights, public expenditure and an external role to be determined and resolved between the two Governments.  That objective impartial group were unable to put forward the answers in regard to a joint authority structure.  How much more difficult would it be then for the Conference to provide the solutions?  We must be patient and reasonable in relation to the various areas that will have to be dealt with.  One area that must be dealt with is that of the geographical and economic desolation that is evident both east and west of the Bann and in the cross-Border region where EC funds were not utilised simply because agreement could not be reached as to their utilisation.  Harmony and ecumenism between the Churches must be fostered, too, as part of the role of the Conference.</P>
    <P>The success and the role of the Conference will depend on two factors, first, a determination to oversee and insist on the introduction of dialogue and partnership <Col N="2949" /> within Northern Ireland and, secondly, our being agreeable, positive and constructive in making it clear that this Government believe that the power-sharing executive is the best way forward for the day-to-day business of Northern Ireland.  Unless the constitutional Nationalists who are prepared to take their seats when they are duly elected have a meaningful role and can deliver to their constituents, as is the case of Members of this House, they will continue to be eroded and corroded by Sinn Féin.  There is no other outlet or valve by which the Unionist expression can be absorbed into this agreement.  There must be power-sharing but that does not mean that there will not remain other contentious issues such as the Judiciary and the UDR.  I predict that the success and viability of this agreement is dependent on tying in the third part of the triangle in solving the problem of Northern Ireland, in other words, not only the London-Dublin access but the access of Belfast and Northern Ireland generally. To arrive at that situation we must have a reasonable Irish Minister because politics of any kind are of the people, by the people and for the people.  Unless the people of Northern Ireland can see that the institutions that are established reflect those principles they will regard themselves as isolated and will turn to less stable structures.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Forum who worked very hard and gave up every Thursday to work on the report, a report that has not been debated in the House, will not have an opportunity to speak during this debate.  Deputy Nora Owen and others have asked me to convey their anxiety as to their not having that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that we must change Irish Nationalism.  We must bring it into the eighties and nineties by making it open and by insisting on protecting the elements of Unionism that are reasonable &mdash; Britishness, religious convictions and the economic link.  However, Irish Nationalism cannot and must not allow a situation where Unionists through their rhetoric and their dominance insist on an <Col N="2950" /> unfair power structure within Northern Ireland.  The basis of consent should be that the principles of Unionism should be protected but that any claim on their part to a right to unfair political structures that would oversee the day-to-day running of the affairs of the minority community cannot be sustained.  In so far as this agreement sets out to change that it is to be very much welcomed.  Those who have regard to the urgency involved and to the loss of life and limb can only support the agreement.</P>

Brady ar an gclár seo agus a moladh inné ag Deputy Haughey, ár gceannaire agus is dócha go bhféadfá a rá go bhfuilimid i gcoinne an chonartha &mdash; agus glaoim &ldquo;conartha&rdquo; ar an rud a síneadh an Aoine seo caite.

      <P>I support the amendment in the name of party Whip as moved yesterday by our Leader, Deputy Haughey.  I am strongly of the opinion that all the paragraphs of this amendment will be addressed by Deputies on this side of the House because, in my opinion, in that amendment lies the true position of this famous, or otherwise, agreement which was signed last week by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2951" /> The second line of our amendment reads: &ldquo;having regard to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland&rdquo;.  As a Corkman I felt very sad when I heard the Taoiseach say in Cork last Monday night that he regretted that Articles 2 and 3 are in our Constitution.  The Taoiseach has been talking about referenda, but would he care to put Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution to a referendum at this time, or at any other time, or will he delay it until such time as he feels such a referendum would be passed?  I totally reject that statement made by the Taoiseach in Cork.</P>
    <P>I will comply with the wishes expressed by the leading speakers in this House yesterday that we should refrain from being emotive, that we should keep this debate on a level it deserves.  I have no wish to do other than that, but it is very difficult.  I will find it very difficult, even in the short time available to me, to restrain myself from becoming emotive.</P>
    <P>One of the basic aims in setting up the Fianna Fáil Party in 1926, an aim to which we have subscribed over the years by tradition and convinction, was to repair the damage done by the Treaty signed a few years earlier &mdash; the same Treaty which was confirmed in this House in 1925 &mdash; and to restore to all people of this island a sense of belonging to an Irish nation.</P>
    <P>In Government my party eliminated many of the structures contained in that first Treaty, like the oath of allegiance to a British monarch, the withdrawal of the annuities, the hauling down of the Union Jacks which in 1938 were flying over our ports, and we introduced the 1937 Constitution, so vehemently and determinedly opposed by some people.  When they were returned to Government in 1948 they repealed the External Relations Act, which only required signing a document, and created a Twenty-Six County Republic which we never intended, which the people never intended, and they helped to make that mythical Border more credible.  By this agreement we are copperfastening the deeds which were carried out by the same type of people <Col N="2952" /> who opposed the early measures.  That is why I say it is difficult for me not to be emotive about this subject.</P>
    <P>Nobody in any part of the country should or would oppose any efforts which will help to resolve the situation which has existed in the Six Counties down the years.  We are all conscious of the sufferings and the degradation imposed on the people of the Six Counties, particularly the Nationalists.  We are all aware that it is necessary to have economic, social and cultural development with our brethren in the Six Counties and to that effect we had the efforts of Mr. Séan Lemass and Captain O'Neill.  This party have always indicated, and will continue to do so, their firm commitment to the unification of this country by peaceful means.  We never intended coercion as a means of solving the problem.  We will at all times encourage developments that can secure peace and justice in the Six Counties but we will not abrogate our constitutional position on Articles 2 and 3 to achieve those aims.  That is what has happened in this agreement.  We will not oppose any body or conference that would help the situation in the Six Counties but we should not give international effect to an agreement in which decisions are to be made by the UK Government.  We should not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the UK Government as is now being done by this Government to maintain their jurisdiction over part of the national territory. God created one island but this Government in pursuance of their tradition are creating a bad situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the massive publicity campaign about this agreement, it was interesting to be told that in the European Parliament on Friday morning last at about 11.30 a.m. a member of the Parliament, not from this country, stood up and asked that a motion be passed congratulating the Governments of Ireland and Great Britain on signing the treaty but was ruled out of order because the treaty had not yet been signed.  That gives an indication of the expertise used by the diplomatic service of the British Government aided and abetted by our Government in publicising in Europe, America <Col N="2953" /> and elsewhere this marvellous agreement signed here last Friday.  The Council of Europe was another location where British diplomacy and expertise was applied. The Council of Europe had decided to deal with the Forum report which was scheduled to be dealt with in January. When the matter came up recently in the Council a British member in that Council indicated that the agreement now signed by both Governments superseded the Forum report and so confirmed that the wish of the constitutional parties to the Forum report was bottom lined.  A unitary State for this country has now been superseded by this recent agreement which is in direct contrast to the Forum report in that it provides that the UK Government is the arbiter of that mechanism and the Conference that is to be set up.</P>
    <P>Our amendment should be examined line by line by all concerned because it is high time the stand Fianna Fáil have taken on this issue is considered.  The real cause of the problem in the Six Counties has not been addressed in the discussions that have gone on over the past 12 months.  The problem is still with us. There is no commitment in the agreement by the UK Government to withdraw the guarantees that are the cause of the problem which has been there since the first Treaty was signed in 1921.  Where a problem is identified the cause is first removed so there should be at least an indication that the cause of the problem here, the presence of Britain on this island and the support and guarantee she gives to bolster up what was a puppet administration, will be removed.  This agreement suggests that we can go towards devolved government.  Do I take it that means we will restore Stormont? Does it also indicate that this marvellous Conference which has apparently been approved by all the people around the world will self-destruct at the arrival of devolved government in the Six Counties? I respectfully suggest that the problem which exists here has not been addressed in this agreement.  That problem is the support and guarantees given by the UK Government.  Instead what <Col N="2954" /> are we doing?  We are re-establishing the position of the UK Government being the deciding factor, the arbiter, the decider of policy.  We may make suggestions &mdash; and that is nothing new.  We have always been making suggestions and proposals.  Many times they have fallen on deaf ears in the British administration. Are we now saying that in future &mdash; to quote words expressed so often during the press conferences we are going to depend on the faith of the British Government?  Have faith in the British Government.  Nobody in this country, based on our experience, could have faith in the British Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy J. Leonard has sought and has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment of the House the subject matter of Question No. 10 on today's Order Paper.  Deputy Leonard has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  I am raising the subject matter of two questions on today's Order Paper which were taken together.  Time ran out at 3.30 p.m. and I was unable to pursue them by way of supplementary question. I feel very strongly about the subject and I think it should be attended to by the Department to ensure that lower priced generic drugs rather than the proprietory brands be used more extensively.  The questions were:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on the action he proposes to take following the GMS <Col N="2955" /> report on the increasing cost of medicines in 1984.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Health the steps he has taken since he received communications from J. A. Long, Administrator, GMS, indicating the saving which could be made if the lowest priced generics in a range of tranquilisers and antibiotics were prescribed.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of health boards, as I have been for many years, are deeply concerned at the reduction in health services in many areas necessitated by financial constraints.  Here was an area in which we were led to believe that substantial savings would be effected in the price of drugs in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the last report of the GMS and the cost of operating the scheme.  Fees and medicine costs have increased by £11.5 million to £98 million. The average number of consultations per panel patient in 1984 was 6.11.  It was 5.89 in 1983 and it is expected to be about 6.20 in 1985.  This is when we are facing so many cutbacks and restraints in so many essential areas of the health service.</P>
    <P>The situation was summed up very well by Mr. Long, Secretary of the GMS Payments Board, in a letter dated 16 January 1985 to the Secretary of the Department of Health, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Dear Secretary,</P>
    <P>The Board has asked me to convey to you its deep disquiet and dissatisfaction at the absence of adequate means to control the growth of expenditure in the choice of doctor scheme.  Every other area of the health services has had to bear substantial cutbacks and be subjected to stringent control.</P>
    <P>I wish to concentrate on the drugs area. He continued by saying:</P>
    <P>The drugs bill is affected not only by consultation rates but by (i) the price of drugs, (ii) the particular drugs prescribed, (iii) the designation of the <Col N="2956" /> drugs prescribed e.g. a proprietory brand or a generic preparation, (iv) the frequency of prescribing in relation to consultations, (v) the number of items prescribed per prescription form issued, (vi) the quantities prescribed and (vii) the drug strengths prescribed.</P>
    <P>...it is considered that the margin between the prices paid by the Board and the prices applicable in the United Kingdom is still too high.</P>
    <P>...it was shown in an exercise recently undertaken for your Department that if the lowest priced generics in a range of tranquillisers and a range of antibiotics had been prescribed and claimed for in 1983 as much as £1,368,000 could have been saved on an actual ingredient cost of £3,276,800 i.e. a reduction of 42 per cent on these two ranges of drugs.</P>
    <P>I have pursued this matter of these generics year after year.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>While it is realised that before there could be an insistence towards the prescribing of the lowest priced preparation it would have to be established that the supplier of this preparation had the capacity and commitment to cater for the total market requirement, the exercise does show the wide scope for savings through greater use of generic preparations.</P>
    <P>It has been proved that the home based drug companies can provide many drugs at a lower rate and also they would be providing much needed jobs.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter in 1982 and following a discussion at the North-Eastern Health Board I received a letter from a drug company which stated that there was a regional hospital in Ireland with an annual medicines bill of £962,000.  The company could supply approximately one-third of that hospital's requirement at a lower cost than they were paying then.  They went on to say that in the six months prior to that they had sold the hospital £200 worth of drugs.  They maintained that if they could get one-third of that business they could employ at least <Col N="2957" /> 20 more people.  The overall drugs bill was £90 million at that time, and they said they could employ 250 to 300 extra people.</P>
    <P>That gives an indication of what could be done in that field.  I raised this by way of question because recently other countries have made strenuous efforts to ensure savings on drugs.  <i>The Irish Press</i> of Saturday 5 October 1985 contained an article from which I quote:</P>
    <P>For the 80 million Americans who use the tranquiliser drug Valium, good news is on the way.</P>
    <P>The drug, which currently costs about $25 a bottle of 100, will soon drop to $13 a bottle thanks to new legislation that makes popular drugs available in generic form rather than under any brand name.</P>
    <P>Henceforth Valium will be known as Diazepam, its actual chemical name, and it is expected to be a big hit with consumers.</P>
    <P>Hoffman-La Roche, who market Valium, had a 17 year exclusive copyright on selling the drug, but now that has run out.  Thus, the generic brand of Valium, in addition to generic brands of many other popular drugs, will soon be available at a far lower cost.</P>
    <P>That report referred to a country that is the home of drug production and private enterprise.  It is better able to afford to pay a high price.  I accept that there is a lot of drug abuse there also.  Some months ago the British Minister of Health directed health authorities in the UK to ensure that excessive expenditure on drugs does not arise because of adherence by prescribers to costly branded drugs.</P>
    <P>This matter has been discussed on many occasions at meetings of the federation of health boards of which I am a member and there has been general acceptance that there is an opportunity to reduce costs substantially.  Money is urgently needed in other areas of the health service.  I understand that the amount allocated for 1985 under the GMS for drugs was £93 million but in the <Col N="2958" /> first two months of this year 20 per cent of that allocation had been taken up.  For the same period last year 18.7 per cent of the allocation had been taken up.  I have been given to understand that there will be a huge shortfall in funding to health boards under the GMS.  If the weather deteriorates there will be a greater demand under that scheme and further funding will be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that there is a massive over-expenditure on drugs, particularly on costly drugs.  There is a lot of over prescribing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the cost of drugs.  I am concerned about that because in many other areas of the health service, such as the dental and ophthalmic services, there have been severe cutbacks. A few weeks ago a student who was entitled to obtain spectacles under the ophthalmic scheme did not get any benefit because the scheme was not in operation at the time due to a shortage of funds.  Many adults who possess medical cards have informed me that because of a shortage of funds health boards are not in a position to permit them avail of free dental treatment.  There have been serious cutbacks in the home help service and in the transport scheme.  There is adequate evidence to show that if generic drugs were used health boards save a lot of money.  There is evidence from Mr. J. A. Long, Administrator of the General Medical Services Board, that it would be possible to make a saving of 42 per cent, £1,368,000.  If that amount of money was divided among the health boards for use on the dental or ophthalmic schemes it would be of great help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1983 I asked the Minister for Health in the course of a question the value of drugs and medicines imported which could be supplied by home manufacturers. At that time the Minister said that the only drugs currently being imported which could be supplied by home manufacturers were generic drugs <Col N="2959" /> and it was unlikely that this market exceeded £4 million at present.  The Minister went on to say that a wider range or drugs could, in theory, be replaced by generic drugs capable of manufacture by Irish companies.  I have made the point that Irish companies are in a position to supply those drugs.  The Minister also told me in reply to that question that the value of these drugs would depend on the capacity of Irish companies to produce them and their ability to sell them.  There is a ready made market to sell Irish made drugs through the various hospitals and clinics.  It is a weak argument to suggest that Irish companies may not have the ability to produce such drugs.  We are spending a lot of money on drugs that could be produced by home manufacturers. The Minister should examine this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Health (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases the Department of Health are accused of not providing sufficient funds but the Deputy's complaint tonight is that we are spending too much money on a particular item although it is possible that his criticism is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments to doctors and pharmacists in respect of fees and medicines in 1984 amounted to £96,251,198.  In 1984 the supply of drugs to medical card patients cost £67.8 million.  Of this, £13.4 million was accounted for by fees paid to pharmacists and the balance was the ingredient cost of drugs.  The average cost per patient was £51.40 for which approximately ten drug items were supplied.</P>
      <P>The cost of drugs in the GMS is a product of: the total number of consultations per patient; the number of consultations at which a prescription is written; the total number of items prescribed on each occasion and the choice of item and the quality prescribed on each occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2960" /> There has been a rise in visiting rates in recent years and this has resulted in an increase in the number of items prescribed. Furthermore, the introduction of new and relatively expensive drugs to the market has had its impact on the GMA.  For example, the single most expensive drug prescribed in the scheme in 1984 was introduced in Ireland only three year ago and has a relatively high unit cost.</P>
    <P>A number of steps have already been taken to control the cost of drugs in the GMS.  Had these steps not been taken the costs of drugs in 1984 and in the current year would have been significantly higher.  The exclusion of over the counter items which do not require a doctor's prescription in 1982 resulted in a significant drop in the number and cost of drugs prescribed.  These items can be bought without hardship in the vast majority of cases and the annual savings which have resulted from that decision are approximately £8 million to the GMS. This is despite the suggestions which have been made from time to time that more expensive drugs are prescribed in substitution for excluded items.  There is no evidence to suggest that this is extensive, or significantly affects the total savings achieved.  Under the terms of the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries agreement, which came into force in 1983, the price of drugs supplied on the Irish market is controlled with the result that drug prices may not exceed a differental of 7½ per cent over corresponding UK prices.  In addition, new discounts were introduced for sales to the GMS and to hospitals.  The benefits of this agreement are worth approximately £5 million per annum to the GMS.</P>
    <P>Doctors participating in the GMS are regularly circulated with details of the relative cost of regularly prescribed drugs which demonstrates the desirability of generic prescribing.  Furthermore, pharmacists are obliged to dispense from the cheaper, if not the cheapest, range of drugs wherever a prescription is written generically within the GMS.  This ensures that the benefits of generic prescribing are in fact realised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2961" /> The GMS payments board now supply participating doctors free of charge with a copy of the <i>Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin</i> every month.  This gives independent expert assessment of the relative merits of drugs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the regular encouragement of the GMS payments board, new licensing measures have been introduced since October 1984 under which all drugs, generics as well as branded drugs, are subject to exactly the same licensing requirements which are administered by the National Drugs Advisory Board.  This is a measure of assurance for prescribing doctors and pharmacists as to the quality, safety and efficacy of generic drugs.  My Department have pointed out this particular benefit to representatives of the medical profession in the course of recent discussions.</P>
    <P>The exercise carried out by the payments board at the request of my Department showed that significant savings could be achieved if the lowest cost generics were dispensed whenever a range of tranquilisers and antibiotics was prescribed. In fact, savings would represent 42 per cent of the cost in question.  However, it must be pointed out that there are doubts as to whether the cheapest drug would be available nationwide on every occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In some places they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that it is doubtful whether they would be.  Furthermore, there are very many drugs, especially recently introduced, expensive drugs for which no generic equivalent is currently available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, there are limits to the extent of the savings which can be achieved in drug cost through mandatory use of generics.  However, my Department are fully conscious of the <Col N="2962" /> scope of savings in this area and have been emphasising this matter in the course of negotiations with the medical profession on the future of the GMS.  The most effective way of ensuring that there is a significant reduction in drug costs is to tackle all of the components of drug costs outlined above.  In particular the prescribing rate itself must be addressed. The report of the working party on the GMS published last year pointed the way forward to a new style of general practice which would be less dependent on drugs and would instead emphasise patient education and preventive work.  It also pointed out how doctors could be encouraged to be more cost conscious in their prescribing.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been going on between my Department and the Irish Medical Organisation on a new contract in the GMS which would give effect to this approach and would provide an appropriate context within which generic prescribing would have a prominent place.  These negotiations are continuing and it is hoped that they will result in a situation where the scope for economies in the cost of drugs will be realised to the benefit of doctors, patients and the taxpayer alike.  My Department's position in these talks has reflected fully the views of the GMS payments board in respect of all of the matters which they raised.</P>
      <P>Should the negotiations prove unsuccessful, it will, of course, be necessary to consider alternative methods of ensuring that only what is necessary is in fact spent on drugs prescribed to GMS patients. Clearly, it is more desirable that such reductions be brought about with the full involvement and co-operation of the medical profession but the evidence as to the scope for savings is conclusive.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 November 1985.</P>

      <P>The general hospital policy for Cork provided that there be three hospital complexes as follows: (1) Cork Regional Hospital; (2) South Infirmary/Victoria Complex; (3) North Infirmary/Mercy Complex with a rational distribution of services between these three locations.  A proposal for the integration of the services provided by the South Infirmary and Victoria hospitals was recently approved by me.  This will involve <i>inter alia</i> the establishment of a single management committee with powers to decide on the management of the hospitals as a single entity. <Col N="2797" /> It has been decided to transfer the services from the Cork Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital.  Its ophthalmology service will go to Cork Regional Hospital and its ENT service to one of the voluntary hospital complexes.

      <P>A scale of fees for fixed appliance orthodontic treatments was agreed between representatives of my Department and the orthodontic group of the Irish Dental Association in September 1983 so that no dispute exists on the fees issue.  However, <Col N="2798" /> when the fees scale was agreed to, the orthodontists then sought the establishment of a national scheme with guaranteed annual funding for fixed appliance cases.  Since arrangements for the provision of treatment and funding are entirely matters for the individual health boards my Department could not agree to these new demands of the orthodontic group.  The present position is that health boards are free to have fixed appliance orthodontic treatments undertaken by private orthodontists provided the fees paid do not exceed the scale agreed in negotiation with the orthodontic group of the Irish Dental Association.</P>

I understand that the board's long term plan at present is to replace this hospital <Col N="2799" /> with a new one on the same site.

      <P>It is my intention and has been by practice to give priority to the development of <Col N="2802" /> primary health care services.  This is in keeping with the international recognition that primary health care is the foundation for an effective health care system.  The scope for giving effect to this policy is, of course, constrained by the weight of existing commitments.  However, the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, contains a firm commitment to bring about a redistribution away from institutionalised services to community-based services in the medium to long term.  Already substantial progress has been made in strengthening the principles of primary health care which, as the Deputy will be aware, is of relevance for all sectors of health care and not just services provided outside institutions.  I am arranging for the Deputy to be sent a detailed progress report on developments in the health services since January 1983 which identifies particular measures which have been taken in the primary health care area.  I would refer here specially to the additional resources made available to the Health Education Bureau and the introduction of the measles eradication scheme as examples of progress in this regard.</P>

Research carried out for the bureau indicated that 89 per <Col N="2809" /> cent of the public was aware of the anti-smoking campaign in June 1985.  At the beginning of the campaign in November 1984 52 per cent of those interviewed recognised the symbol of the knotted cigarette.  By June of this year 81 per cent recognised it.  Whereas 14 per cent were familar with the pun on word &lsquo;Knot&rsquo; in November, 48 per cent were aware of it in June.</P>
      <P>I view the anti-smoking campaign as one vital part of efforts to tackle the serious public health problems posed by smoking.  It is for this reason that I hope to introduce shortly a Bill containing a provision which will impose a levy on the advertising and sponsorship expenditures of tobacco companies.  The money raised by this levy will be made available to the Health Education Bureau to extend their educational campaigns to encourage people to stop smoking.</P>

Of course there will be need for residential facilities of various kinds.

Is cuideachtaí sealbhaíochta sócmhainní iad Óstlanna Gaeltearmann Teo. agus Saorcloch Teo. agus níl siad i mbun trádála.  Tuigtear ón Údarás go bhfuiltear ag súil le cuntais iniúchta d'Óstlanna Gaeltearmann Teo. go dtí 31 Deireadh Fómhair 1985 faoi dheireadh na bliana agus do Shaorcloch Teo. go dtí 31 Nollaig 1985 go luath san athbhliain. Tá leachtaitheoir ceaptha do GPE Teo. ó 23 Meán Fómhair 1985 agus ní raibh cuntais iniúchta go dtí 31 Nollaig 1984 faighte ag an Údarás go dtí an dáta sin.

      <P>I am not aware of any particular problems in relation to travel costs being experienced by individuals residing in Ireland and working abroad.  When accepting an employment abroad an Irish resident might normally be expected to negotiate terms of employment which would take into account any special travelling costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenses incurred in travelling between home and place of work, <Col N="2823" /> whether in Ireland or abroad, are essentially a part of an individual's personal living costs and, accordingly, vary between one person and another depending on the choice of residence and mode of transport.  If over and above the personal allowances, relief for travelling expenses generally were introduced it would be extremely difficult to withhold similar relief in respect of other items of personal expenditure, which might be thought to have an equally meritorious claim for consideration.  The way would be open to all sorts of claims arising out of the personal and domestic circumstances of the taxpayer &mdash; which would be very difficult to refuse &mdash; and a serious loss of revenue would ultimately be involved.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since ceasing employment on 5 July 1985, the taxpayer has submitted to the inspector of taxes two claims for repayment of income tax on the grounds of unemployment.  The claims have been dealt with.  A cheque in settlement of the initial claim was issued to the taxpayer on 1 October 1985, and a cheque in respect of the second claim will be issued as soon as possible.  If the taxpayer is still unemployed he should <Col N="2828" /> now submit a further repayment claim to the inspector.  The inspector wrote to the taxpayer on 8 November 1985, for the details required to enable his final liability for 1984-85 to be determined.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, at the commencement of the current year, it was considered that the taxpayer's total estimated assessable income for 1985-86 was unlikely to exceed the appropriate exemption threshold of £6,000.  Accordingly, an exemption certificate was issued.  However, on the basis of the taxpayer's 1985-86 return of income, his estimated total income for that year exceeds £6,000.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the husband ceased employment on 4 October 1985 and on 4 November 1985 he submitted to the inspector of taxes a claim for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment. Such claims are dealt with by reference to earnings to date of cessation of employment and tax free allowances to date of claim.  On 12 November 1985, a return of income form was issued to the husband for completion to enable the claim to be processed.  The inspector will now write to the husband for the necessary signed authorisation which is required for the purpose of transferring any balance of allowances to his wife.</P>

      <P>The person concerned made a claim to occupational injury benefit on 1 October 1985.  Pending the completion of investigations in regard to this claim his entitlement to disability benefit on an <Col N="2834" /> interim basis was examined.  However, as he has less than the minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year governing his claim, 1983-84, he did not qualify for disability benefit.  His entitlement to occupational injury benefit will be determined when the investigations referred to above are completed.  His entitlement to invalidity pension has also been considered.  That pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work. One of the contribution conditions is that the claimant must have not less than 48 contributions paid or credited in the last completed contribution year before the date of the claim.  The contribution year at present governing entitlement to invalidity pension is the period from April 1984 to April 1985.  According to the records of the Department there are no such weeks of insurable employment registered in respect of the person concerned for this period.  He is not therefore qualified for invalidity pension.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which was enacted last July, provides for the implementation of EC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  Section 24 of the Act states that it will come into operation on a date to be fixed by ministerial order.  It is generally known that the delay in implementing the Act is due to the fact that one of the trade unions which has the highest number of staff membership in the Department has taken the view that the implementation of the Act cannot go ahead until such time as certain staffing issues have been resolved.  Discussions are actively under way on this matter at the present time and it is the intention to begin implementing the Act as soon as the difficulties have been resolved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.  As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 369 on 23 October last nobody may be committed to prison merely for non-payment of civil debt.  A person may, however, be committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order to make certain payments in discharge of a debt, an order which may be made only after examination of the person's means designed to establish the person's capacity to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2840" /> The statistics sought for the years 1981 to 1984 are not readily available and could not be compiled without the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time in court offices and in the prisons.  However, the number actually committed to prison for failure to obey a court order for the payment of debt would represent a very small percentage of the total number of committals to prison in any year &mdash; on the available information it is thought that this figure would be about 3 per cent.  At present there are 18 persons in custody on foot of such committal warrants.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there has been any general delay in the payment of European Social Fund aided training grants. However, I am aware that in some areas such as the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, there have been delays, because of the large expansion in the number of students qualifying for the grants.  However in this particular case it is understood that payment of the September and October grants will be made within the next week.</P>

      <P>My Department are not aware whether interest charges were incurred by Galway County Council in the financial year 1984 in relation to their operation of the higher education grants scheme.  Since the introduction of the scheme in 1968 recoupment in respect of the local authorities' expenditure in a particular financial year is paid by my Department in the following financial year.  There was no undue delay in the payment this year of recoupment to Galway County Council in respect of its expenditure in 1984.  In accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, recoupment is payable only in respect of the cost of the grants awarded and paid by an authority and, accordingly, an amount in respect of interest charges cannot be included in the recoupment.</P>

      <P>The specimen higher education grants scheme issued by my Department to the local authorities each year contains a provision as follows:</P>
      <P>Every effort will be made by the... County Council/Corporation... to pay the maintenance element (if any) of a grant-holder's grant in three equal instalments, one as early as possible in each term, and the individual paying orders will be addressed to the grant-holders c/o the Bursar's office of the University or other educational institution concerned.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to apply that provision in its functional area and I would be concerned if there was any undue delay in the payment of grants to students.  Since the introduction of the grants scheme in 1968 recoupment in respect of the local authorities' expenditure in a particular financial year is paid by my Department in the following financial year.  There is no undue delay in my Department in paying recoupment to any particular authority after its application for recoupment is received.</P>
