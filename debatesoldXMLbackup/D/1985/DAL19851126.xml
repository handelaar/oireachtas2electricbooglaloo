      <P>den Taoiseach an bhfuil sé sásta leis an tslí ina bhfuil cúram na Gaeilge roinnte amach ar na hAirí go léir; agus an measann sé gur fearr don teanga é Aire amháin a chur i gceannas ar leathadh na Gaeilge i ngach gné de shaol na tíre.</P>

      <P>Ní chun leas na teanga a rachadh sé dá mbeifí le freagracht iomlán. i leith na Gaeilge a chur ar aon Aire amháin.  Fiú ó thaobh na praiticiúlachta de, ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé indéanta na cúraimí atá ag an Aire Oideachais i leith na Gaeilge, mar shampla, a <Col N="2" /> aistriú go dtí Aire na Gaeltachta.  Is fearr i bhfad ó thaobh na teanga de, go mbeadh freagrachtaí i leith na Gaeilge ar Airí éagsúla ina réimsí oibre féin.</P>
      <P>Tá freagrachtaí faoi leith ag Aire na Gaeltachta faoi alt 3 den Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú) 1956, ina measc dul i gcomhairle, sa mhéid is gá nó is cuí, le Ranna eile Stáit chun leas na Gaeltachta agus na teanga a chur chun cinn.  Táim sásta go gcomhlíonann Aire na Gaeltachta an dualgas atá air faoin bhforáil sin.</P>

      <P>Chuala mé an chuid is mó de fhreagra an Taoisigh ach tá <Col N="3" /> roinnt de nár chuala mé i gceart.  An dtuigeann sé na deacrachtaí atá againn ceisteanna a chur síos faoi chursaí Gaeilge nuair nach bhfuil aon Aire freagrach anseo, mar a fuair mé amach nuair a chuir mé ceist síos do Aire na Gaeltachta faoi chláracha Gaeilge in RTE?  Bhí orm an cheist a chur don Aire Cumarsáide, ach dúirt seisean nach raibh sé freagrach, gurb iad RTE a bhí freagrach agus atá freagrach.  Tá me ag fiafraigh den Taoiseach nach mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá mbeadh fiú amháin Aire Stáit freagrach? D'fhéadfainn ansin ceisteanna a chur ar an Aire sin agus gheobhadh seisean an freagra amach ó Roinn, nó ó Roinn Stáit nó ón Chomhlacht Stáit a bheadh i mbun an ruda sin.  Ní féidir linn é sin a dhéanamh faoi láthair.</P>

      <P>Níor thug mé ach sampla amháin, agus fuair mé an freagra ón Aire Cumarsáide nach bhfuil aon fhreagracht oifigiúil ag an Aire Cumarsáide mar is gnó do chuid RTE féin é.  Níl Aire na Gaeltachta freagrach as chúrsaí Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Uair amháin ba é an tAire Oideachais a bhí i gceannas cúrsaí na Gaeilge: uair <Col N="4" /> amháin bhíodh an tAire Oideachais i gceannas cúrsaí Gaeilge ar fad sa tír. Anois, an bhfuil aon Aire ar féidir linn ceist a chur air?  Tá cúram ag an Stát faoi seo, tá cúram ag an Rialtas faoi ach níl aon Aire nó Aire Stáit, fiú amháin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is prepared to increase the headage payments this year as a once-off measure to help farmers affected by the bad weather earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantial Exchequer funds have been made available for various measures to assist farmers who have been affected by the bad weather.  These measures include the winter fodder scheme, the Shannon Valley flood scheme and the feed voucher scheme.  It is not possible to provide further Exchequer funds to finance an increase in headage payments.</P>
      <P>As regards a suggestion put forward by one of the farming organisations for financing such an increase, I indicated in the Dáil on 6 November that I was keeping this under review in the light of budgetary constraints and the Estimates which are being drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the maximum amount allowed under EC regulations in respect of the headage grant is not being paid here.  Because of the exceptional circumstances on this occasion following the disastrous weather conditions during the summer, would the Minister consider, as a once-off measure and by way of alleviating the serious problems of the farmers, and of enabling them to have adequate cash flows, making the maximum amounts available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We never did pay the maximum headage grants allowable.  In reply to the second part of the supplementary, the answer is no and that is for the same reason as the reason outlined in the original reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if he backed up by the same amount the £17 million available in Europe for extending the headage payments, the net cost to the Exchequer <Col N="6" /> would be offset by the direct cash input that would be made available throughout the country by way of that £17 million from Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced of that argument and as I have pointed out previously, I am not enamoured of the equity of the scheme being suggested by Opposition Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it has been available since our accession to the EC but we have never used it to the maximum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that only IR£20 million has been spent on the western development package; and if he proposes any alteration to the scheme which could result in a more efficient utilisation of the funds within the proposed period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from aid for projects related to the processing and marketing of agricultural products, the total expenditure to 30 September 1985 under the western package is about £69 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package operates by way of a programme approved by the EC Commission and this programme is subject to review at intervals of four years.  The first <Col N="7" /> such review is at present under way and an examination is being made of the options available for making the package a more effective instrument for the stimulation of agricultural development in the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that that scheme which was supposed to have been £30 million per year has been a flop and that under some of the headings there has been practically no takeup?  Would he agree also that the conditions under which the scheme operated were such as to render it practically impossible for people to qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, certain restrictions were imposed on the package at the time but there are certain headings under which we are ahead of schedule.  Though we are only four years on, the greater part of the ten year allocation for rural water supplies has been taken up.  I take it that the Deputy is referring to such items as forestry in respect of which less than £1 million of the £18 million earmarked has been taken up.  It is against that background that the matter is being reviewed currently.  The review is at a very advanced stage and we hope that some of the problems can be rectified as far as possible from an Irish point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it was ridiculous so far as a severely handicapped area was concerned to impose the kind of restrictions that were imposed regarding qualification for the scheme?  Is it not time that those restrictions were lifted?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the value of the beef and dairy mountains currently being held by the EC; if he will be presenting any proposals to the EC to dispose of them; and the proportions of Irish beef and dairy products that were sold into intervention in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated value of the intervention stocks of beef and dairy products held by the Community at the end of October was about £4,200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposal of intervention stocks is <Col N="10" /> within the competence of the Commission. I have however, pressed consistently for an extension of the range of disposal measures on both internal and external markets.  For example, a new measure which I have actively pursued for the sale of concentrated butter for cooking and baking was introduced recently by the Commission, and I understand that further disposal measures are under consideration.  I have also pressed for measures to maximise sales on the commercial market and so reduce intervention intake.</P>
    <P>So far this year 16 per cent of Irish production of beef and 44 per cent of production of butter have been sold into intervention.</P>

      <P>Very little of the stock is suitable for the type of use the Deputy may have in mind.  There is also the added element that however low the price got for the disposal of this stock, it is a very important source of finance to keep the Community going.  As long as we can get a reasonable price for it, there is much to be said for selling it on the open market.</P>

As regards milk products, we are using a lot of butter for cooking and baking purposes; that is one way of getting rid of it.  The present Commissioner is very active in his efforts to get rid of as much stock as possible. Stocks are at a very high level, first, because of the continued increase in milk production up to last year and, second, as a result of the culling of cows which has increased the beef mountain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 35 together.  Due to the limited Exchequer resources available, assistance for flood damage victims had necessarily to be confined to farmers in areas of the Shannon Valley most severely affected by flooding.  However, farmers in County Mayo and in other parts of the country who have been unable to conserve adequate winter fodder for their livestock were in a position to benefit from the winter fodder scheme 1985 and also eligible for the feed voucher scheme, details of which were announced earlier this month and which is due to close tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Shannon area, and we are not objecting to help being given there, but there are areas in Mayo and elsewhere where land is covered by sand, bog and grit of all sorts.  When the Shannon subsides at least the farmers will have land but in many instances the farmers in Mayo will have no land left and they can get no help by way of grant to get their land back into production.  The Government should alleviate the problem of these small farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has not been drawn to any particular difficulty in Mayo which is not apparent elsewhere.  If there was an area which might have been included it is that area adjacent to Dowra, County Cavan, where there was flooding of a nature which might have merited aid.  That was not included because it came to light after we had decided on the areas to be included in the relief for the Shannon Valley.  During the past summer and early autumn everyone had trouble as regards flooding, but unless there was something exceptional about the degree of flooding, we did not even examine the question of making relief available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

I cannot start issuing vouchers until I know the total number of applicants.  The sooner I know that the sooner I can get the scheme working.  The original closing date was 20 November and it has now been extended to 27 November.  I want to ensure that people get these feed vouchers as quickly as possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As much as I sympathise with the Deputy, I would not like to give him false hope because I might have to look at many similar areas.  I have an additional problem: we allocated £2.5 million for the winter fodder scheme on 8 August.  One million pounds of that was for fertiliser and £1.5 million was allocated for first time silage makers.  We estimated that the maximum number of people who would avail of the first time silage making scheme was 8,000.  It transpired that something like 30,000 have availed of that scheme.  As a result our estimate has gone through the roof. Instead of spending £1.5 million, we will spend something like £6 million.  It is proving extremely difficult to find that extra money and, therefore, it will be extremely difficult to find additional money for cases similar to that mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately 1,800 eligible new entrants applied for additional quotas out of the special reserve I set up some months ago.</P>
      <P>The Department were unable to allocate these quotas until the necessary returns were received from all purchasers. The final returns, which included two of the major co-operatives, were only received in the past week.  These are now being processed and all purchasers will be notified of their allocations over the next few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that people have been left waiting so long due to some creameries being very slow in making returns.  Two major co-operatives only came in with returns as late as last week despite repeated requests to come in earlier.  The Strand Dairies in Clonakilty were in on 12 August and if more people followed that example we would be in a position to allocate the extra milk by now.  In reply to the initial part of the question, there were 2,150 applicants under the heading &ldquo;New Entrants&rdquo;.

      <P>The fixing of annuities in respect of land allotted by the Land Commission is a matter solely for the Commissioners.

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the estate he refers to was allocated in 1980 and shortly after that representations were made to the Land Commission and there was a reduction of 50 per cent of the annuities at that stage.  What complicates the matter now is that the land has been vested in those owners and obviously because of that the Land Commission are not in a position to intervene.  There is little that one can do about this.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture his proposals for the restructuring and modernisation of the Irish bacon industry; if he will make a statement on the present slaughter capacity; and if he will give details of the capacity of each plant, especially the number of plants which have capacity to kill in excess of 5,000 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>While our pigmeat export factories have an annual capacity of about 2½ million pigs, they are currently operating at around 70 per cent of this capacity.  Details of individual plant capacity are confidential but I can say <Col N="21" /> that only three plants have a capacity in excess of 5,000 pigs per week.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there is a need for rationalisation and modernisation within the industry if it is to compete more effectively, particularly on export markets. For this reason a central pig slaughtering policy has been adopted under which it is intended to have at least six central slaughtering units, and maybe as many as ten, each capable of slaughtering 6,000 pigs per week, to cater for its own needs and, on a contract basis, for the needs of neighbouring processors.  Generous grant aid is available from the IDA and FEOGA to suitable applicants who wish to participate in this programme.  As well as reducing slaughtering costs and facilitating greater concentration of value-added processing, these central units will meet the standards of the US and other countries, thereby enabling traders to gain access to those export markets closed to them at present.</P>

      <P>I can see the problem there, or rather there could be a problem. The Deputy will admit that we went a considerable distance towards solving that problem by allowing straw to be omitted from the calculation.  Let me say that the Deputy's fellow Deputy from County Monaghan, Deputy Conlon, had a great deal to do with that.  He lobbied me very intensely and I think some of the local co-operatives also.  I think it was a help but you could not possibly keep tabs of inter-farm sales of hay from one to another and what not.  I know some farmers bought hay dear and could not very well afford to do it.  It is just not possible to solve a problem of that dimension.  I hope, that you did not mind my mentioning a Deputy in your constituency, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question No. 14 and Priority Question No. 41 together.  Home production of fruit and vegetables grown for the fresh market has been expanding and there was a 6 per cent increase in acreage between 1982 and 1984.  During the same period imports of produce of the types that can be grown here, including potatoes, decreased by 22 per cent.</P>
      <P>Efforts are being continued by my Department, An Foras Talúntais and ACOT, in conjunction with the growers' organisations, to seek ways of further reducing imports and developing the industry by the application of new production technology, improved marketing arrangements and the provision of a reorganised horticultural advisory service.</P>
      <P>Continued progress will be helped by the introduction of legislation to provide for the registration of potato growers and packers.  Financial help is available from my Department to aid the establishment of a national potato co-operative, for the conversion of glasshouses from oil to solid fuel heating, for the employment of a market co-ordinator for the glasshouse industry and for setting up producer groups, for example, the horticultural co-operative launched today.</P>

They ran into some marketing problems but the Deputy will be pleased to hear that they have now tied in with a marketing group of national standing to set up a marketing arm to the potato co-operative.  The launching of the horticultural co-operative this morning is another good move.  They are doing their business in a realistic manner.

I should like to add that at present we are drawing up a new structured scheme and are looking at the question of provision of items such as silage slabs.  This matter is being pursued actively and it is hoped to publish the details of the scheme within a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 28 together.  While I have seen reports of comments by the scientist referred to, the position is that the EC scientific group headed by him have not yet submitted their final report on hormone implants to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage the Council of Ministers has taken no decision on the proposal by the Commission to ban the use of hormone implants in livestock production. Ideally, any decision in this matter should be based on a scientific assessment of the effects of the use of the hormones.  However, this country as a major beef exporter must also take account of the views and requirements of our customers abroad if we wish to <Col N="31" /> continue to export to them.  In this connection it has to be recognised that consumers in some member states have become increasingly concerned about the use of hormone implants in livestock production and that certain member states have in fact already prohibited their use. This has serious implications for our trade with those countries even though there is at the present time no scientific evidence that the five types of hormones in use, particularly the three natural ones, have harmful effects on human health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Will the Minister indicate the stance he will take when this matter comes before the Council of Ministers?  Will he consider the imposition of a penalty scheme, similar to that operated by co-ops in regard to antibiotics in milk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is before the Council of Ministers.  It has been discussed at great length for some time past but a decision has not been taken although there was a specific proposal from the Commission.  I might add that the latest proposal from the Commission is quite different from the original proposal. The latest proposal is greatly influenced by an opinion delivered by the European Parliament some six or eight weeks ago.  That opinion was very heavily in favour of the prohibition of all hormones. Prior to that the Commission had expressed the view that only synthetic hormones should be banned because the evidence as to whether they caused a health hazard was inconclusive.  At that time the Commission did not propose a ban on natural hormones but since the decision of the Parliament was delivered they changed their attitude and are now proposing that all hormones, synthetic and natural, be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banning of any substance is not a very logical thing to do when the scientific evidence available indicates that it presents no danger.  The scientific commission set up five years ago clearly stated in a finding issued two years ago that the three natural hormones which we use <Col N="32" /> here do not produce any health hazards. At a Council meeting I expressed the view that it was totally irresponsible to ban something which has been shown scientifically not to have any ill-effects. On the other hand we have a very serious problem on our hands in that political movements, particularly the Green parties, on the Continent, are campaigning heavily for the prohibition of all hormones irrespective of the scientific evidence. We must bear in mind that the Governments of those countries are tending to yield, if they have not already done so, to that pressure.  We must further bear in mind that we export something in the region of £200 million to £250 million worth of beef to those mainland EC countries.</P>

The Council is at present discussing these proposals and as a result of those discussions will ultimately put forward something more concrete.  We will then decide what our position will be.  The measures being proposed at the moment are not all that draconian.  There is a move away from the proposal put forward in last year's price package for a direct reduction in prices.  On this occasion they are talking more in terms of co-responsibility levies.  Another matter which worries us considerably is that payment will depend on the quality of the cereal.  Because of our climate and soil the quality of our goods is often not as good as it should be.

Under a national reserve which I announced in July last some 6,000,000 gallons are being allocated to new entrants by way of permanent quota.  As milk production is limited by quota, improved returns to milk producers and others in the industry must come from the development of more value added <Col N="37" /> products and better marketing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to mislead the House by saying that there is any realistic hope of getting such an increase. The tendency, as one can see from the recently announced proposals under the heading of the EC Milk Cessation Scheme, is to cut back further within the EC.  The present proposal is for a 3 per <Col N="38" /> cent reduction in EC milk production and for countries to have the option of reducing their national production by a further 3 per cent.

Individuals may have serious problems but that is a matter for them to work out in conjunction with their co-operative society.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I should like to ask the Taoiseach to look at the situation of some of these reports that are coming before us from committees.  Quite frankly, it seems to some of us that the report on which the House is being asked to sit late tonight about credit cards for civil servants travelling is not exactly a major issue of policy requiring our time or the expenditure of this House sitting until a late hour.  I do not wish to make any point about that but I think there is a case for looking at the reports of these committees and the manner in which they are being dealt with.  There are complaints that the reports of some committees do not get in here at all and other committees seem to have a monopoly of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter on which the House has taken a decision.  Reports of this committee are required to be brought before the Dáil for discussion within 12 sitting days regardless of their content or what people may think of their content.  That was the decision of the House.  It is a matter for the members of these committees of all parties to decide what issues they wish to take up and have discussed in the House and we then have to provide time for their discussion.  I note the Deputy's point but it is the <Col N="128" /> House itself which has so ordered its business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I might put it to the Taoiseach that whereas it is of great significance that civil servants should have credit cards to facilitate their travelling arrangements, there are perhaps other matters of greater importance and significance in the body politic at present. What I am suggesting to the Taoiseach is that the whole matter be looked at.  A report of this kind &mdash; which I do not think is of any great moment &mdash; might have been taken in conjunction with some other business in the normal course of events.  However, I might just ask &mdash; perhaps I should be addressing my point to the Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept that the Deputy has a good point.  We have been in touch with the chairman of the committee to discuss with him and he is considering the possibility of taking reports together here so that, if there are several reports dealing with matters, which individually may not seem of great importance, they could be taken together to have a more rational use of the House's time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Private Notice Questions particularly, surely it is a matter of your interpretation of the provision in the Standing Order?  The Standing Order is not all that tightly framed and it could make this House more effective and relevant if matters of this sort could be raised as Deputies seek to raise them.  Alternatively &mdash; I think I have put this to you on a number of occasions &mdash; you might take the initiative in seeking to introduce procedures which would enable us to deal with these matters as they arise, matters of urgent public importance.  After all, you have your own particular responsibility for the affairs of this House and for its dignity and relevance. We look increasingly silly in the eyes of the public if we cannot raise matters of importance, relevance and urgency.</P>

      <P>The Chair does <Col N="134" /> not wish to comment on the merit of Deputy Haughey's remarks but any change in the procedure is a matter ultimately for the House.  I am satisfied beyond doubt that if the Chair were to indulge in what I would describe as a flexi-interpretation of Standing Orders, the Chair would find itself in an absolutely impossible position.  I remember one occasion &mdash; I will not go into details &mdash; when an application was made to me and I thought it would be harmless to allow it irrespective of the Standing Order but I had no sooner allowed it than I was told that it constituted a precedent.</P>
      <P>That gives the House an example of the position in which the Chair finds itself.  The Chair has a difficult enough position, he is not complaining about it as he is very glad to be able to do his best to carry out his functions.  However, I am satisfied that if the Chair were to depart from a strict interpretation of Standing Orders and precedent he could not enforce order.</P>

I cannot think of anything which is of more public importance than the matters raised by Deputies Wilson and Ahern.  In deference to your wishes I will not mention the incident.  Those matters should come within a reasonable interpretation of the provision within the Private Notice Question ambit.  I should also like to suggest to the Government, through you, that in incidents of this kind in which there is great public interest the ministerial statement procedure should be more readily availed of.  After all, it is ridiculous that when we meet after these incidents referred to by Deputy Hyland we cannot say anything about them and that Ministers cannot offer any explanation.</P>

A short time after I took this Chair I read out what was in order on the Order of Business and in doing so I followed strictly one of my predecessors who went to the trouble of putting the same thing on the record.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When this debate was adjourned on 10 June last I had been drawing the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill contains a weakness in that it does not seem to recognise, even obliquely, any dimension of life in this capital city except transport.  It is true that the Bill is expressly about transport but it seems a pity that there should be no recognition in the Bill or in the Minister's speech that a city is more than simply a road network covered by a network of public transport.  I went on to say that it was only the latest example of the kind of attention which this capital city gets and which leaves it, on any objective scale, very low down the list of European capitals in terms of amenities and appearance and the preservation of the things which once made it admirable.  I suggested, not for the first time, that the condition of the city was such that it needed <Col N="138" /> not just a transport authority but a complete department, perhaps a separate local government structure different from that enjoyed in other parts of the country, in order to solve Dublin's problems. I put forward this idea as one which should be supported not only by Dublin Deputies.  It is just as much the capital city of Deputies coming from Loop Head or Malin Head as for Deputies who live in Dublin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not seem to mention or authorise the provision of facilities which are relevant to transport and which are normal in large cities in Europe and even in Britain, for example, the pedestrianisation of city centre areas.  This has been tried here but only in a tentative and half-hearted way.  The only teeth which the Bill seems to contain regarding the control of traffic could be summed up in a few provisions about bollards and ramps.</P>
      <P>Just before I reported progress I was speaking about the rapid transit system, the first instalment of which has arrived in the form of the DART system.  I praised those operating the system and the public for the respect which they show it. Nothing that I said then about six months ago has changed as far as I have been able to observe.  It still remains a credit to the Dublin public and to the CIE staff who take pride in operating the system.</P>
      <P>I object very much to the DART system being made a target for macrosocial criticism.  I often hear it said that money has been poured into this system which is supposed to serve only the affluent suburbs, whereas nothing like enough money is put into the road systems and transport serving suburbs which are not so affluent.  It is not the case that the DART system serves only affluent suburbs.  It is quite true that it runs through some of them but it also runs through districts which are not affluent. Anyone travelling on a DART train at any time of the day would be able to see that the people sitting around him represented a cross-section of Dublin citizens, some well off and some poorly off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the system runs there, that it represented an extremely heavy capital investment and that it would <Col N="139" /> require twice the number of passengers to justify itself at present is not attributable merely to the decision-making power of the people living in Dublin 4 or on the Howth Road.  It is attributable to the fact that a permanent way was already there and in service.  There was a tradition of using it.  It is not as though anybody had decided merely to convenience people in comfortable suburbs by pouring enormous sums of money into the construction of an entirely new track.  This was the only suburban track which Dublin still possessed.  I do not think there is anybody in the House who does not regret that the other suburban track from the old Harcourt Street station to Bray via Shanganagh Junction was torn up about 20 years ago.  I hope some day to see that track reinstated.</P>
    <P>We have planned the city in completely the wrong way by not taking advantage of that extremely expensive infrastructural investment.  In the case of the Kingstown line substantial private investment was made more than 150 years ago.  We should have planned the extension of our city in such a way as to make use of that very expensive and very much underused network. The Chair represents a county constituency and must have noticed that within five minutes of leaving Kings-bridge station you are out in ragweed country which is no longer built up and there are fields on either side, whereas in districts in which there is no railway there are miles of built-up areas with poor transport.  Instead of building Tallaght and Blanchardstwon in the way they have been built, although they are not very far from rail lines, we should have built our extended suburbs along those lines.  I am thinking of people who would wish to commute into the city or across country. That would have avoided many social problems and expenses which the State has to bear in terms of providing bus services.  However, it is not too late to learn.  The lines that CIE made an effort to bring into use as far as Maynooth should be considered for eventual upgrading and incorporation into the rapid rail transit system with whatever <Col N="140" /> necessary spurs &mdash; I am sorry it should have to be spurs &mdash; to serve Tallaght which does not have a rail line running through it and Blanchardstown which has a rail line running close to it.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the rapid rail transit system and he spoke of the difficulty of getting the feeder services off the ground.  I do not know how well they will work.  I suspect that the utility of the service will diminish rapidly as one gets inland.  I do not think many people would want to take a bus from, say, Ranelagh to go to the railway station at Sydney Parade or Lansdowne Road to travel to some point in the centre of the city or a short distance to the north.  I am not an expert.  I take it for granted that CIE have done their homework and their market research and that they know that, if they can provide feeder bus services, they will get more people using the DART services.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that CIE have not been able to get the feeder services going because of industrial difficulty with regard to a squabble about one-man buses.  I will say something that the Minister did not say.  Perhaps he was under the constraint that Ministers are under but which does not weigh so heavily on back-benchers. It is simply not tolerable that an industrial dispute &mdash; I do not want to prejudge it &mdash; should prejudice this immense public investment on which many thousands of pounds are going out of the window in interest charges every day.  It is not tolerable in a small country like this that we should have had to carry on our backs this damned dispute about one-man buses for the past 25 years.  I do not care who I offend, whether it be one union or all 28 unions that serve CIE.</P>
    <P>There are 28 unions servicing a concern that would be lost inside a large private corporation in Japan or in the United States.  There are 22,000 employees and they need 28 unions to represent them. It is not tolerable that the ordinary mass of people, which includes many trade unionists, should have to carry that burden.  It is not tolerable that taxpayers &mdash; including these workers wearing their taxpayers hat &mdash; should be asked to carry <Col N="141" /> the load of sustaining a service that cannot be made profitable because an agreement cannot be got about one-man buses.  I know there are cities in England where the one-man bus service has not yet arrived and no doubt that is the reason we are holding on to the system in this country.</P>
    <P>As I have often said here, we cannot take any step forward unless we make sure the English have taken it well ahead of us.  However, on the Continent there is no such thing as a two-man bus.  Our system imposes a very severe burden on the public.  I am speaking as a public representative and not merely as somebody against the trade unions which is not the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Soviet Union has one-man buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not tell us a lot because over there the decisions are made without any form of consultation. They do not have free collective bargaining or free anything.  A person has to take the goods supplied by the State and at the prices determined by the State.  A person accepts the wages that are paid by the State and lives in a flat allotted to him by the State and if he does not like that he can damn well lump it.  That is the system over there.  However, Deputy Wilson made a valid point and I do not wish to belittle it.  If it is possible to have a one-man bus system even in a country like the Soviet Union which is often able to achieve the appearance of full employment by overmanning State enterprises, I cannot see why we should have to pay for something more expensive.  Any public representative who, out of fear of causing resentment among the unions, neglects his duty to speak for the mass of people, including many trade unionists in their dimension as taxpayers, is not doing his job.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must express grave disappointment at the failure of CIE and the unions to agree so far on the provision of feeder services for the DART.  If the huge <Col N="142" /> public investment in DART is to be even half justified, it is absolutely imperative that these feeder services commence without further delay.</P>
    <P>That was last June.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>CIE and the unions should know that if they are not prepared to provide the feeder services there are many private operators who would be so prepared and I am under some considerable pressure to consider this option.</P>
    <P>That was six months ago but there are still no feeder services, public or private. Time is going by and much money has been lost.  I should like the Minister to explain what has happened in the past six months to the feeder services.  Will he state what progress he is making to give CIE, management and unions, a shock by obliging these services to be provided by private enterprise, even if only as an experiment?</P>
    <P>In section 29 there is a reference to the Dublin Transport Authority as being a licensing authority.  They will have the function of licensing operators, presumably that means private as well as public operators.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>In deciding whether or not to grant such a licence, the Authority shall have regard to the public intereset regarding the provision of passenger road services in the Authority's functional area.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain what he means by public interest.  I admit this is a general phrase and we use it very often without feeling the need to explain it, but it does not occur in the definitions section and because of the nature of this subject matter it is important that we know what is in the Minister's mind.  Is it a public interest consideration if money can be saved?  I should have thought most citizens, groaning under the load of taxation, would say yes: indeed I think they would regard it as one of the top elements of the public interest if public money could be saved.  Has the Minister got a mental reservation along the lines that the public interest is sufficiently regarded <Col N="143" /> if some element in industrial relations is taken into account in deciding whether to permit the operation of a private licensee?  I sincerely hope that what the Minister has in mind in the public interest has nothing to do with industrial relations because we cannot afford the kind of industrial relations we have had in CIE during the years.</P>
    <P>In sections 23, 24 and 25 where the functions of the Authority are mentioned there are some curious expressions.  They lead me to wonder if this is the only Authority on the face of the earth with no authority to issue instructions or to make decisions.  The Authority's functions in relation to planning are central because city planning is inconceiveable without regard to transport planning and transport planning is inconceivable without regard to the way the city is growing and has grown.  Section 23 provides:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, from time to time make grants to the Authority of such amounts as with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, he considers necessary to enable the Authority to meet its administrative and general expenses.</P>
    <P>I can make recommendations.  So can Deputy Wilson.  Mick McGilligan's daughter Mary Ann can make recommendations to the Minister.  In other words, this Authority will not be entitled to say that this or that service shall be provided.  They are only allowed to make recommendations.  They are allowed to make recommendations to the planning authority part or all of whose functional area falls within the authority's functional area as to the content of the Authority's development plan, etc.  It is the same in respect of planning applications and planning appeals.  In this regard it is not even recommendations: all they can do is to furnish observations.  I will furnish them with observations but they will pay no attention to them; they are not under any obligation to have regard to the observations furnished to them by this Authority.  I say in a general way, and I <Col N="144" /> should like to hear the Minister deal with it in his reply, that it seems to me the whole area of the relationship between the Authority and the planning body is extremely feeble.  The Authority do not seem to be giving any kind of authoritative input, something one would expect of a body being called an authority.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the composition of the Authority.  It has been somewhat sweated down from its original form. According to section 2 of the Schedule, the Authority will consist of not more than 12 members appointed by the Minister, including not more than four persons who for the time being are members of the local authorities in the Authority's functional area.  I do not see that there is any case whatever &mdash; I hope this will not be regarded as undemocratic, because even democracy has limits &mdash; for including four amateurs on the Authority.  The democratic element in regard to management and relationships with the Authority consists of the Minister, answerable to this House, and it is this House that controls him, that can put in or out the Taoiseach who appointed him.  There is no need for this tipping of the cap to the democratic principle by putting four passengers on this Authority.  That is what they will be unless, by some fluke, there is somebody in Dublin Corporation, Dublin County.  Council or Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, or some of the new councils coming up, who is an expert, who knows something about transport above and beyond complaining about its shortcomings.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason to put four local politicians on this Authority.  It means it will have four fewer places for people who know something of the subject, like knowing something of why we get convoys of seven or eight buses on a road, other than merely complaining about them.  I hope I will not offend some members of local authorities, like Deputy Joe Doyle when I say this, but those four members will be four extra wheels on a coach that already will have eight wheels, I hope, of expert people.  All the other four will do is to create the friction that wheels in contact with the ground usually <Col N="145" /> do: they generally hold up the speed with which the Authority may make improvements.</P>
    <P>On private operators, I want to come back to something the Minister said in his introduction, not in connection simply with the DART services or with the feeder service for the Dublin Area Rapid Transit.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>While there may well be scope for the provision by licensed private operators of limited or specialised bus services in the Dublin area, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the likely extent of such provision.  As I have said, the establishment of the DTA and the reorganisation of CIE will provide the environment in which CIE management and staff should be able to deliver an efficient and reliable service.</P>
    <P>CIE have been going for 40 years.  What is wrong with the structure they have? Why can they not deliver the services we would like to see without this new Authority?  What is there in the existing Authority and structure which prevents CIE management and staff from getting on with one another and making sure that the people who are paying for the whole show will get a decent service?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It would be inconsistent at the same time to prevent private operators from providing scheduled services on any extensive basis, even if they were in a position to do so.  CIE must avail of the opportunity provided for it, however, and no doubt the DTA would keep the licensing in question under continuous review. </P>
    <P>As I said, CIE have been there for 40 years &mdash; I remember as a small boy the time of the change.  CIE have had plenty of time, and warning after warning, thunderbolt after thunderbolt, from inside and outside the House, and there is no more room for pussyfooting.  There is not even the room left by the Minister last June about the pressure he was getting to have private operators provide the feeder services for DART.  Here we are, six <Col N="146" /> months later, still without the feeder services, public or private.  The Minister should regard himself as having no option but to give himself statutory powers if necessary to put the private sector, even if only as an experiment or as a warning, into some parts of the Dublin city services, and even provincial services.</P>
    <P>We often hear the argument that the private sector is interested only in the cream, in the profitable bits &mdash; they would like to run the 6, 7A and 8 buses but they do not want to run the two weekly buses from Manorhamilton to Clones.  I can see the force of that argument and, if it were so, I would not have private enterprise in either, but even as an experiment I would cut CIE services rather like a sandwich cake and parcel or option out by tender concessions to operate specified parts of the services, and anybody who took on a profitable bit would be obliged to take on a bit that up to the present incurred losses.  I would not sell out or let or make any concessions of the good bits alone.  I realise the social service bit is there and any Deputy from a thinly populated country area will know that more forcibly than I am saying it.  However, we might be able to get private enterprise to take on a good bit joined to a bad bit, to take on, so to speak, a package without charging the people the subvention of more than £2 million per week which CIE at the moment are losing.  I do not call it a commercial loss in the strict sense, because of the social dimension.</P>
    <P>I admit that many national transport authorities in Europe lose money.  Most of the rail services in Europe, if not all of them, lose money.  I am not singling CIE out as being bad: I am only singling them out as costing the Irish people more than we can afford.  It may be that other countries could bear £2 million a week, £112 million last year, but we cannot afford that type of subvention.</P>
    <P>The Minister must look around urgently for some way of shedding that burden and placing it on some other shoulder.  I am not saying this because I am committed to Thatcherite policies or anything of that kind.  I merely wish the State to be clear of the burden of paying <Col N="147" /> out week after week £2 million that it cannot afford.  The idea that a monopoly of public transport is defensible in a country where it is costing so much requires to be defended.  The onus is on those who believe in a transport monopoly for a State body to prove that there is no other way in the public interest of providing the service.  It is a fair point to draw attention to those Articles of the Constitution which deal with property and with enterprise and to show that far from suggesting that the Constitution leans in favour of public enterprise or towards nationalisation, it enthrones private enterprise and states that the State shall endeavour to supplement private enterprise wherever necessary.  In a State like ours, there is no room for the contention that a public monopoly of any public utility is the natural and necessary formula.</P>
    <P>While I cannot accuse CIE of waste, I cannot absolve them entirely either on that score because it is in the nature of all public authorities who make investments other than out of their own pockets, to spend money needlessly.  This may happen in some small way or it may be in a big way but money dribbles out of the public purse in a way that it could not dribble out of the pocket of a private individual because he depends on his money.  As I have said here before, the State leaks money at every joint.  At every joint the State is squirting £100,000 here, or a couple of million somewhere else.  As it moves along the earth, it lards it, as Shakespeare said of Falstaff.  Money is spent on criteria and after a degree of diligence which no private individual or family could afford.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with praise, which I sincerely mean, of the people who run the DART service and who are evidently proud of that service, but contemporary with the establishment of the DART has been installed at Westland Row station a row of shining stainless steel barriers. The idea is that one places his ticket in one of those machines and the ticket flashed up the other end while at the same time the barrier is released thereby allowing the passenger to walk through. <Col N="148" /> There are 12 of these barriers at the station, as many as might perhaps be required in the Montparnasse station of the Paris underground at rush hour or on Christmas Eve.  Such a number is not called for at Westland Row.  I have not yet seen any of these barriers in use.  The stream of passengers there rarely reaches a point where it is not possible for a single ticket checker to clip the little green squares out of the passengers' tickets.  I am referring to that station because it is the only one apart from my local station that I use but I use it frequently.  If you or I were running a train service, or if we were shareholders in the operation, we could not afford that kind of expenditure. I could not put a figure on the cost of these barriers but I am sure it was not insignificant.</P>
    <P>I do not go around snooping to see where money is being wasted by CIE.  I am speaking only from what I have seen but I am sure anybody else here could relate the same sort of experience.  It is an example of the way the State leaks money but it is in the nature of things that that would happen in State controlled operations.  However, it should be in the nature of a Government such as this one, who are committed to trying to reduce State expenditure, to reduce the number of areas in which the State is exposed to the risk of losing money because of slack management.  Management is not necessarily more slack in this case than in any other but in a State enterprise there must be more slackness in that regard because the money is not coming from the pockets of those whose decisions result in the losses.</P>
    <P>Section 40 deals with road works and I have some fault to find with this section. Ostensibly the provisions seem sensible. It is provided that the Authority may direct, in respect of any public road in their functional area, the periods during which, the times at which and the manner in which road works may be carried out. However, there is no definition in the definition section of &ldquo;road works&rdquo;.  The Minister of State who is present will realise that I am not making a cheap debating point in saying this but such <Col N="149" /> a definition should be included.  In the absence of any such definition I am left in doubt as to whether what is meant is road works connected with road improvements. In other words, are we talking about road widening, road narrowing or the incorporation on a roadway of some element of traffic apparatus such as bollards? If what is meant are works carried out by public utilities and which involve digging up the road, that should be specified. If such works are not included, it is not worth including the section in the Bill because it should encompass works carried out by Bord Telecom, by the Gas Company, by the ESB and by the water works and sewerage departments.  A similar point was made in a submission from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and which I think was submitted after the publication of the Bill.  That group said that they had long been dissatisfied with the manner in which road works are carried out in the city.  Well may they be dissatisfed.  I have lived in several cities in Europe and I know many more but I do not know of any in which there are pavements so scarred by road works as it the case in Dublin.  There has been a series of excavating and of filling in, sometimes carelessly with tar flung into them and other times not so carelessly.</P>
    <P>The chamber of commerce continued in their submission that it was not clear to them that there is adequate planning of works, integration of the requirements of different utilities and a sense of urgency in completing road works once initiated with minimum disturbance to traffic flows and to the vital business interests of those directly affected by such works.  One need only step outside the door and into Merrion Street to find an example of what is meant.  I do not know what is going on there.  It does not seem to be anything radical, but radical or trivial those works have been in progress for up to three months or perhaps more.  I consider the chamber of commerce submission to be totally justified and I think anyone else living in this city would be of the same opinion.  The Authority ought <Col N="150" /> to be given specifically the power to control the operation of road works, including those required for the purpose of public utilities and not merely for the road section itself.</P>
    <P>Section 33 refers to parking prohibitions. I have no fault to find with this section except that I would have liked it specifically to have empowered the Authority to do something which for all I know may be within the jurisdiction of the Garda or of some other body.  I refer to specifying hours during which loading and unloading may take place.  It is common to find narrow streets and lanes in this city, where commercial vehicles are parked, either completely blocked or where the stream of traffic is reduced to one lane.  I appreciate that people must do business and that loading and unloading must take place but in some continential cities, if not in all, this operation is permitted only at certain times of the day.  These are usually very early morning hours or late evening hours.  I realise that if a supplier or a wholesaler was asked to put staff on the road to deliver goods at, say, 7 a.m., he would have overtime problems and so on and that such an operation would not be economic for him but there is no reason for the citizens of Dublin having to endure such inconvenience and irritation while the citizens of other European capitals are spared that problem.</P>
    <P>I realise that, if this were to be regulated along the lines I suggested, it would put costs up for somebody; but we have to weigh up the social advantage of marginally increased costs, perhaps not even that but better organisation between distributors and retailers on the one hand, and the social cost to the public by having a sluggish traffic flow of the sort which frequently develops at the bottom of Leeson Street at the St. Stephen's Green junction, where at all hours of the day, there are large vehicles double parked supplying the eight or ten shops on either side of the street.  That situation is duplicated all over the city.  The occasional traffic warden or member of the Garda Síochána who initiates a prosecution <Col N="151" /> against the distributor is regarded as persecuting them.  I see their point because they have to do their business, but it should be regulated in such a way that they have an hour or two in the early or late part of the day when minimal disruption would be caused to the public.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make arises on section 10 which deals with the Authority's functional area.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), the Authority shall perform its functions in relation to the area...comprising the county borough of Dublin and the administrative county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>What has the administrative boundary to do with the transport problem?  Where is the relationship between an administrative boundary, which as often as not coincides with a barony or something which goes back to the days of Richard III, and the transport problem which arises because of the patterns on which land is acquired and developed?  There is no correlation.  Perhaps I have not understood this properly and I do not mean to offend anyone in the Department, but I would have said that was an insufficiently thought out provision.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why the Authority should not, within limits, be given power to determine their own functional area in such a way as to include the solidly built up areas to the west and to the south &mdash; as far as Leixlip on the western road and Bray or beyond on the southern road, both of which are very large towns in different counties?  Will there be administrative difficulties because the Authority's writ does not go beyond the bridge coming into the village of Leixlip?  All the building has started at the far side of the bridge.  Are we to draw the same conclusion about the point at which the Bray Road runs into Wicklow?  That is a nonsensical provision.  I urge the Minister to look at it again and ask himself where is the correlation between a transport policy and administrative boundaries which, to some extent, are historically determined, and whether it would not be <Col N="152" /> more sensible to give himself the power to determine from time to time, perhaps by order subject to the usual annulling resolution in this House, the area within which the Authority should function.</P>
    <P>In spite of the reservations I have expressed and my criticism of this proliferation of public bodies when there is no real reason why the existing bodies should not do their jobs properly, like everybody else I wish the Bill well and hope it will result in a better transport system from the point of view of the transport user and the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome in principle the idea behind this Bill in that there is an obvious need for an Authority to co-ordinate the various aspects of transportation and traffic control in the Dublin area.  However, in my view the Bill before us has some very serious deficiencies and perhaps on Committee Stage we will be able to deal in more detail with them.</P>
      <P>It would obviously be of benefit to achieve a co-ordination between the different agencies which at present deal with traffic control &mdash; Dublin Corporation, the Garda, the Department of the Environment, CIE and so on.  There is a range of bodies with an input into how our traffic is regulated and it is very important to have a central authority to deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traffic problems facing Dublin at present are, I believe, the direct result of a failure of Governments in the past to ensure that public transport services were developed as the population of the greater Dublin area expanded.  County Dublin is the fastest growing urban area in western Europe but our public transport system is possibly the most underdeveloped in any capital city in the EC. The opening of the DART last year was an important and significant advance, and the rapid transit system should be extended.  When considering comparative costs in relation to the DART and its development, it is important that we put into the equation the vast cost of the development of roads in the city and county areas.  Rarely do we hear anybody <Col N="153" /> speak of the cost of site acquisition, land acquisition, the acquisition of property and so on, which is necessary to provide the huge dual carriageways, overpasses and by-passes which are being built at present.  If we were to carry out a proper cost benefit analysis and comparison with the real cost of alternatives I am certain that the rapid transit system or DART as it is commonly known, would be seen as a very economical way of ensuring the provision of a modern public transportation system for the city and county areas.</P>
    <P>Obviously this system is unsatisfactory at present in that it only services some of the better off areas of the city, running from Howth to the Bray area, but CIE have substantial plans for developing that service.  There is no reason why the huge working class populations in areas such as Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Finglas and Ballymun, should not be serviced by that system.  It is a question of whether the Government, not just this Government but previous Governments and perhaps future Governments, are prepared to invest in public transport rather than in the development of infrastructure which continues the growth away from public to private transport.</P>
    <P>There are very clearly benefits for the citizens of the greater Dublin area in having a more efficient and better organised public transport system.  There is no benefit at all to anyone whether a passenger in a bus or a private car owner who gets stuck in a traffic jam, in O'Connell Street or along the Quays at peak time when the atmosphere is polluted causing other kinds of problems, stresses and strains.  Recent statistics show that 64 per cent of commuters in Dublin travel to work by car compared with 32 per cent who travel by bus and 4 per cent by train. If the quality of life in the city is not to deteriorate further, the aim must be to shift the balance dramatically in favour of public transport.</P>
    <P>There must be a specific Government policy to that effect.  There is no sense in the Government saying that it is their wish to have a living city and cleaner air while, at the same time, pursuing policies <Col N="154" /> directly opposed to that.  It can be argued that, but for the recession and the drop in sales of new cars, the conditions on roads around the greater Dublin area would be far worse than they are at present. We should plan now to change our direction in relation to transport.  We are talking about getting people from one place to another in the most effective and efficient manner in terms of pounds and in terms of the environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome in that it attempts to co-ordinate a number of areas of traffic and transport.  It contains a number of reasonably progressive ideas.  However, it combines with these ideas a conservative approach to transport planning.  It is useful to have a co-ordinating Authority dealing with Dublin transport but the powers given to the Authority in this Bill make it a fairly weak Authority.</P>
    <P>My first objection to this Bill relates to the composition of the Authority.  It is not acceptable that authorities of this kind should be nominated by the Minister in power.  This means that there are political appointments which will dominate the Authority.  There should be provision in this Bill to ensure that there are nominees from other interested bodies such as An Foras Forbartha and CIE.  There should be nominating procedures similar to the reformed procedures in regard to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The concept of a transportation Authority is in line with the practice in Great Britain.  For instance, there is the London Transport Authority and the Passenger Transport Executives in Merseyside, South Yorkshire and so on.  In Britain the Passenger Transport Executives actually operate the buses and in some cases the trains.  There is a grave danger that the Dublin Transport Authority will become just another layer of bureaucracy standing in the way of better services.  At the moment various commuters', tenants', residents' associations and other groups have direct access to CIE district management. There is infinite potential under this new Authority for CIE to evade responsibility in relation to what they ought to do.</P>
    <P>There are some other defects in the <Col N="155" /> Bill.  Part IV does not specify the conditions applying to the issuing of licences which exist under the 1932 Road Transport Act.  Under section 12 of the original Act, among other things, the Minister had the power to specify the service frequency, the number of vehicles to be allotted, the type and colour of the vehicles to be provided by the operator and so forth.  Section 12 of the same Act allowed the Minister, in laying down conditions for licences, to specify the wages and conditions of employees.  I am not sure whether or not those sections were amended subsequently as I had not time to investigate it to that extent.  It is important, in view of the effective black economy operating at present from which a number of private bus operators draw their labour, that this Authority should have power to specify the conditions for employees and the wages that should be paid.  There should also be a relationship between the wages and conditions applying to private operators and the wages and conditions applying to CIE workers. Otherwise one could not realistically claim that there is fair competition between them.</P>
    <P>Another disappointing aspect of the Bill is that it does not lay down guidelines as to the financing of public transport. Section 21 allows the Authority to make recommendations on expenditure priorities. However, the fundamental question as to how we finance public transport is not dealt with.  At present Dublin buses recover their costs with ticket revenue to an extent far higher than in most European countries.  There is nothing in this Bill to indicate that the Government are coming any closer to fulfilling their promise to pay a public service obligation grant which was promised some time ago.  If such a grant were paid to public transport operators, as it is in the UK, the question of deficits would be brought into perspective and we would have less talk of CIE having an unfair advantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> private operators.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, it is interesting that, in borrowing the concept of a metropolitan transport authority from <Col N="156" /> the British practice and legislation, the Government did not see fit in this legislation to provide for the establishment of transport users consultative committees. When we were taking ideas from the UK legislation we should have taken up this idea of a users consultative committee as well.  It seems that practically everybody is consulted in relation to public transport, except the users.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill seems to be based on the premise that Dublin's traffic can be reformed by the establishment of a co-ordinating organisation.  That is a false premise.  The traffic problems in Dublin can only be solved by infrastructural investment in roads and public transport, by having a proper balance between the investment in both, by ensuring that the development of our roads does not affect the environment of those who live in the city or on the outskirts of the city and that an adequate public transport system is available which will avoid people having to invest in cars, which they can ill afford at present, to get from one part of the city to the other.  The proposed Authority have this power and also they will have no power to operate services directly themselves.</P>
    <P>While I cannot see the Bill improving the situation except in a very marginal way, it deserves support as far as it goes, but we have only scratched the surface of the problem of transport and traffic in the Lucan area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport scene, especially in Dublin, has been of great concern to public representatives and for that reason I welcome the Dublin Transport Authority Bill now before the House.  There have been a number of improvements in traffic problems over the last 10 years, with the road development programmes which I need not enumerate here, from the earlier Stillorgan road development to the more recent Palmerstown, Santry and Swords by-passes. I welcome the current schemes of major road construction such as the airport road, and we must add to this the substantial volume of the continuing <Col N="157" /> smaller schemes of road widening, resurfacing and improvement.  In recent years three new bridges have been built across the River Liffey.  The traffic management initiatives in the area of one-way streets, including traffic reversal on the quays and the extensive bus lane provisions, improvement in car parking, more off-street car parks and more meters to facilitate short term parkers are all welcome. The electrification of the Howth-Bray railway line gives a new standard of speed and comfort to commuter traffic. Recently Dublin Corporation announced that shortly they will introduce an infra-red signal and central computer control for a test period of two months aimed at easing the movement of Dublin city buses.  The system will be installed at nine traffic light locations in the city, allowing Dublin Corporation traffic controllers to give buses on more than a dozen routes more rapid passage through critical junctions by giving the green light for as long as necessary to get buses through.  This system has worked extremely well in European cities and it should go a long way towards easing traffic problems here.</P>
      <P>All these measures have contributed and will contribute to an easement of the traffic situation in Dublin.  The programme which I have just outlined reveals a determination to tackle a problem which if left unattended would have created chaos and virtually seized up the city with the gravest implications for the commercial and economic life and activity of the city.  It is in the above context that we should approach the Dublin Traffic Authority Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force who were a forerunner to this Bill have been functioning for the past number of years and working fairly well.  This has encouraged me in the hope that, given the right co-ordination structure, the various elements in the total traffic scene, the Department of the Environment, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, CIE, the Department of Communications, the Garda and the Department of Justice will launch a sustained and concerted effort for further improvement.  The Dublin Transport Authority's outline in this Bill <Col N="158" /> seems to be a co-ordinating structure rather than a radical reallocation of authority and resources.</P>
    <P>I must agree with Deputy Kelly here. I would have preferred to see this legislation creating an authority with greater teeth and possibly with the setting up of a specialist traffic law enforcement agency. The Bill leaves traffic responsibility still with the Garda.  This is really a mistake. The Garda are fully occupied at present with the prevention of crime, including vandalism, prosecution of offenders, control of drugs, policing of crowds and protection of persons and property.  It is of concern, therefore, that all traffic law enforcement, with the exception of limited parking control, remains with the Garda.  Traffic law enforcement needs sustained interest which the Garda force with their full range of concerns will not be able to provide.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am pleased to note that a provision in the Bill moves the traffic warden function to the DTA.  This is sensible, but it is important that the move be more than a cosmetic change in reporting lines.  The wardens as a force have manifestly not been well managed, and it is right that they be managed by the DTA whose priority is in the area of traffic and transportation rather than by the Garda who have other vital responsibilities, as I have outlined.  Let me refer to a report on the analysis of parking characteristics at parking meters just to show how inefficient the warden system under the control of the Garda is at present. The survey recorded 8,518 parking offenders at parking meters.  Of these the survey also recorded that only 530 or 6.2 per cent received tickets.</P>
    <P>There has been public disquiet for a long time at the manner in which roadworks have been carried out in the city. The engineers of the road and traffic department of Dublin Corporation have done their very best to co-ordinate road repairs but up to now statutory authorities such as An Bord Gáis, BTE and the ESB could open the roads without seeking anyone's approval.  This has been remedied in the Bill which provides under section 40 that the DTA are empowered <Col N="159" /> to regulate the timing and manner of execution of roadworks in their functional area.  Also they are empowered to see that these roadworks are carried out with the minimum disruption of traffic and with a sense of urgency.  Deputy Kelly was not too sure of the interpretation of that section, but I hope that anyone who intends to open the roads for any purpose will now have to get the permission of the Authority.</P>
    <P>In the area of public transport services, which is dealt with under Part IV of the Bill, the Authority will set objectives in relation to the extent and standards of bus and suburban rail services to be provided in the Authority's functional area by CIE within their Exchequer subvention. The Authority will also monitor CIE's progress on meeting such objectives. This will impose a healthy discipline on CIE and will enable value for money to be assessed as far as the Exchequer's subvention is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals concerning the licensing of car parks and the involvement of the DTA in the approval of charges.  I welcome also the proposed powers of the DTA in relation to road ramps.  Dublin Corporation have for some time now been carrying out experiments in this area which have proved very successful.  A number of small residential roads in Dublin are being used continuously as rat runs, and the erection of ramps will have a desired effect.  It would be very regrettable if section 32 of the Bill was to hold up or hinder in any way the pilot scheme at present in operation in Dublin Corporation, although I accept the principle that road ramps should be used in a limited way only.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about the pedestrianisation of large zones in the inner city in common with what happens in European cities.  He said it had been tried in Grafton Street in a halfhearted manner and with mixed results.  I do not share his view on that.  I think it has worked very successfully in the parts of the city where it is in operation at present.  It was also his view that it should be tried in a wider <Col N="160" /> area of the city, perhaps in an area connecting the northside with the southside. Deputy Kelly may be interested to know that Dublin Corporation have plans in hand for connecting the pedestrianised Grafton Street with the pedestrianised Henry Street.  It is important for pedestrians in the city to have a corridor to walk through from one shopping area to another.  However, there is a problem in regard to pedestrianising streets in that it leads to a lot of illegal street trading, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the rapid rail systems.  I would have preferred if that system had been introduced from the centre of Dublin to Tallaght and not on the Howth-Bray line.  All that was needed on the latter line was new rolling stock. Had I been a member when the scheme was given the go ahead I would have expressed the view that the money allocated would have been better spent on a Dublin-Tallaght route.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the lack of feeder buses to the rapid rail service and I agree with his sentiments in that regard. I read recently that CIE intend to introduce an auto-fare system whereby passengers on entering the bus will place the correct fare into a tube.  I understand that the company intends to introduce that system which may solve the problem of feeder buses.</P>
    <P>The last two speakers expressed disagreement about the composition of the new transport authority.  Deputy Kelly said there was little point in appointing representatives of local authorities to the board, but I disagree.  Local authority members deal with three main problems &mdash; housing, planning and traffic.  All local representatives in the Dublin area deal with those problems daily and it would be a pity if a transport authority for the city did not have representation from local authorities.  They would not be free passengers, they would pay their way.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa suggested that the board will be filled by political nominees of the Minister of the day.  That might have been the practice in the past, but the Government have taken a definite line on this.  It is their policy, as occurred <Col N="161" /> in regard to the appointment of members of An Bord Pleanála, to appoint the people best qualified.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for some time that the traffic and transport problems in Dublin are imposing high costs on industry, public transport and private motorists. That trend will continue until traffic problems are solved.  The establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, with its comprehensive range of functional powers, will go a long way towards dealing with our traffic problems.  For that reason I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision to set up this new authority which will play an important role in this city.  There should be a minimum of delay in setting up the board.  Like Deputy Doyle, I am a member of the Dublin traffic study group and we are frustrated because of the difficulties that face Dublin Corporation, motorists, pedestrians and motor cyclists due to the state of traffic in the city.  Of all the cities I have visited &mdash; I have been to many cities in the Far East and in the West &mdash; I have not seen traffic conditions as bad as they are in Dublin.  There is a great lack of discipline among different sectors &mdash; motorists, pedestrians jay-walking, or cyclists not paying attention to the traffic lights or failing to give an indication when crossing a road.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote some statistics, published by An Foras Forbartha, in regard to road accidents in 1984.  In that year 465 people were killed on our roads, 8,210 were injured, a total of 8,675.  In January of that year a total of 683 were killed or injured on our roads; 583 in February; 581 in March; 694 in April; 683 in May; 740 in June; 824 in July; 791 in August; 728 in September; 841 in October &mdash; a very bad month; 773 in November and 754 in December.  It is interesting to note that in November more accidents occurred than in December, but that may be due to the fact that in December there is always a big compaign urging people to be careful when driving over the Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to that report 156 pedestrians were killed in 1984; 493 received <Col N="162" /> serious injuries; 917 received minor injuries, making a total of 1,566 pedestrians involved in accidents or 18 per cent of the total number of people involved in accidents.  With regard to pedal cycle users 40 were killed in 1984; 200 seriously injured, 500 received minor injuries, making a total of 742 or 8.6 per cent of all accidents.  A total of 59 motor cycle users, including pillion passengers, were killed; 346 seriously injured, 560 received minor injuries, making a total of 965 or 11 per cent of all accidents.  A total of 187 car users were killed; 1,559 seriously injured and 3,046 received minor injuries making a total of 4,792 or 55 per cent of all accidents.  A total of 13 goods vehicle users, or 5.1 per cent, were killed and two PSV large vehicle users, or 1 per cent, were killed.  Other vehicle users killed amounted to 0.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>One thing about these figures which troubles me somewhat is that these are percentages of all accidents.  What percentage would the figure for pedestrains be of all pedestrians out and about?  We had a total of 742 pedal cyclist accidents and that figure does not give the whole story.  People will take it from those figures that it is quite safe to cycle in Dublin or any other city because there are so few pedal cycle accidents as opposed to car accidents.  However, there are very many more cars on the roads than bicycles.  We know without having to do too much research that 1,566 pedestrians is a very small percentage of all pedestrains.  However, 742 cyclists may make a very high percentage of all cyclists on the roads and the same goes for motor cycles.  Perhaps An Foras Forbartha could direct their attention to these matters, regarding which I have placed a couple of questions for written reply next week.  If we go on the number of cycles imported into the country each year we can get a rough idea of how many cycles are on the road and in the case of motor cycles we can find out from the numbers registered.  We can see that the figures of 18 per cent for pedestrians, 8.6 for cycle users, 11.1 per cent for motor cycle users and 55.2 per cent for car users do not give the whole picture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> It is important to keep in close touch with the local authorities.  The Minister has mentioned an intention of doing this. He says that the Dublin Transport Authority will be connected to the new local authority system for Dublin city and county.  I hope he will pay attention to what the local authorities are saying. There must be a flow of information from local representatives.  We are all the time receiving representations from our constituents about the road conditions.  The road traffic conditions in Dublin are the worst I have ever seen anywhere, mainly because of the lack of discipline.  This comes through lack of enforcement. People go through traffic lights of any colour.  The Garda are needed for more valuable work than chasing a car that has gone through the traffic lights.  When I was visiting Dayton, Ohio, a couple of years ago the people there were complaining that enforcement of the law on motorists was too rigid and that motorists were having a really bad time.  My comment was that it was better to have the law enforced to a greater degree than was reasonable in some people's minds than not to have it enforced at all.</P>
    <P>Pedestrians can jay walk, cyclists can also go through the traffic lights, cyclists can ride on unlit bicycles.  I have been tempted to put down a question asking the number of prosecutions for riding an unlit bicycle.  Fines for illegal parking have been ridiculous.  They have recently been increased but certain types of parking should have greatly increased fines attached to them.  I am thinking of the motorist who parks beside the traffic lights allowing only one single lane of traffic to form, and the best example of that is at Lower Fitzwilliam Street.  The cars here are parked facing out towards the middle of the road.  Motorists parking in this manner know there will be no serious consequences.  In this case the fine should be very substantial and the word should be let go around that there will be a fine of £50 or £100 if one parks in such a manner as to create single line traffic.</P>
    <P>I drive 400 miles a week and I know what it is like trying to get from one place <Col N="164" /> to another.  I know the temptation to take chances in order to get to a meeting or appointment on time.  These delays would not happen if there were some discipline among motorists.  I have lately adopted the mentality of staying behind the slow moving car in the middle of the road and letting the person behind me worry.  When the traffic lights indicate that people turn right, they still do not turn right.  The green light appears to have an hypnotic effect on some people. When this board is set up I ask that they look into these matters.  I wonder how many people have been prosecuted for jay walking since that legislation was brought in some years ago.  I have often felt that it should be taken off the Statute Book because it has not been put into effect.  People will ask how do you prosectute an old lady for jay walking?  The fact is that there is no discipline and one might as well not have phasing of traffic signals.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the committee will be dealing with the problem of bollards and ramps.  I know that in certain areas these ramps can be very dangerous if hit by a car going at high speed.  One has to be very careful where these ramps are situated, to avoid damage to nearby property. If motorists become aware of the presence of these ramps, they will realise that they could be injured or their car damaged.  The ramps could be of a minor nature, not the high ramps seen very frequently when approaching check points in the North.</P>
    <P>Traffic management, as it obtains at present, is very bad.  The lack of link lighting is incredible in this modern age. The new road from Lucan to Palmerstown is a magnificent carriageway; but the traffic lights along it, particularly from Chapelizod up as far as the King's Hospital, is a good example of lights sited very close together but not linked.  Traffic lights are not intended necessarily to slow traffic down but they should be linked in such a way that they lead to a continuous flow of traffic.  I have only today written to the superintendent regarding the traffic conditions in Lucan which make a laughing stock of traffic management. <Col N="165" /> It is not in my constituency but is on my way home.  Evidently some genius decided to stop traffic turning left into Lucan village, where there was a filter left lane, so that now there is a backlog of traffic any time of the day.  One only has to go into Lucan to experience such frustration through sheer bad traffic management. Neither is the timing on lights very good.  However, I must say, in defence of the people who have the contract to service lights, that when a fault is reported they do repair if fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>A traffic authority remote from local authorities which may just list certain suggestions in a patronising way will not be at all effective.  There must be people appointed to that Authority determined to unscramble the mess that exists at present. They must be people prepared to listen to elected representatives regarding certain problems.  Such people must also resist the kinds of pressures which sometimes are brought to bear on public representatives to have certain alterations made which may not be in the best interests of safety.  For example, some years ago people were looking for a bridge to be sited over a particular road. In spite of the fact that officials then considered that such a bridge would cost £100,000 and would not be used, people insisted on that project going ahead. Tremendous pressure was brought to bear on local representatives.  If, one of those representatives said he had to be guided by officials' advice in this matter, that it would be dangerous to have such a bridge built for a particular reason, the other local representatives would lose no time in getting word around that: &ldquo;We could get it through but your man is opposing it&rdquo;.  That type of pressure being removed will do no harm at all.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing also that the Dublin Transport Authority will be taking over the licensing of taxis in respect of which a very unsatisfactory situation obtains. People are hiring out taxis at night time to friends.  There may be people with five or six plates not even driving their own taxis.  They may have been able to purchase a number of taxi plates from one another.  I am against this practice.  If a <Col N="166" /> taxi plate is not being used by the man who sought it then it should be handed back.  But people are buying up taxi plates, gradually leading to them running a fleet of taxis, employing people who, in turn, might not be the best people to drive taxis because very often they have not undergone any particular test.  The Dublin Transport Authority should take a hard look at this matter.  The Taxis Drivers Federation are also in favour of a fair distribution of taxi plates.  They are against this practice of people having five or six plates, having all sorts of people doing part time jobs at night, very often people who are drawing unemployment benefit.  Possibly because of lack of investigators to work night shifts, it is very difficult to track such people down.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the Authority are not being given any teeth under the provisions of this Bill.  Unless they are empowered to act in a strong manner they will meet with failure.  The Minister should reconsider his attitude because it is my understanding that they are given no real teeth under the provisions of this Bill.  Perhaps this aspect could be examined again on Committee Stage when we shall have some suggestions to make, and also in relation to a budget for this Authority.</P>
    <P>I must apologise because I came in rather late without having had as much time as I should have liked to prepare my contribution.  However, I have got off my chest many of the things I have had in my mind, many of the things which run through one's mind while one is driving and experiencing these frustrations.  The Ceann Comhairle does not have to experience these any more &mdash; he lets somebody else get the ulcers.  The interesting thing is that every motorist will agree with you.  They will all say &ldquo;you are absolutely right&rdquo;.  It is contended that none of us is to blame, but we are all to blame because we all contribute towards these conditions.  Often we see people driving 60 miles per hour up one road and down another.  I was very nearly run down today by a joyrider in Dame Street. I was in the island in the middle of the road and I remained there even though <Col N="167" /> the lights were with me because this driver was swerving all over the road, travelling at about 60 miles per hour up past City Hall.  As usual in such circumstances, there is never a garda in sight. Perhaps we will read about some unfortunate victim who will have been run down in the meantime by that type of person.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority should make life difficult for the car thief, the joyrider, by ensuring that there is proper protection particularly in housing estates, with a proper ramp or bollard system being installed, something to slow down the joyrider so that he will know if he goes in there he will be caught and that he can no longer use side roads.</P>
    <P>This Authority have a tremendous opportunity to do their task well because they are starting from a most awful situation from a traffic point of view.  None of us now enjoys getting into our cars going on a long journey because discipline has totally broken down.  The top priority we seek is enforcement of the law and in respect of which the Garda will have to do their job.  From our meetings with the Garda in the Dublin Corporation Traffic Study Group I know they experience certain frustrations also in doing their job.  Whatever changes in the law are necessary to render their task easier should be effected.  Rather than their having to go into court each time they charge somebody for not having a light on a bicycle, some way should be devised by which such charges are brought in by, say, an inspector handling 25 or 30 such charges, making the charges on behalf of these gardaí so that they are not taken off our streets.  In the times in which we live these gardaí should be doing something else.  Some way should be devised by this new Authority to allow an inspector go in and present charges to the District Court on behalf of all the gardaí who have made prosecutions. Then there might be a little more enforcement.</P>
    <P>The casualty rate will increase rather than diminish because enforcement is non-existent.  Something must be done soon.  We have not seen a radar car for many years.  We have not seen much <Col N="168" /> activity by the pick-up truck.  Dublin Corporation have one pick-up truck which the Garda drive.  We should have four pick-up trucks, two operating on the north side and two on the south side, picking up cars which are causing obstruction. People are very selfish.  It is said that tourists do not mind getting a parking ticket because they know the car hire company will pay.  This charge is included by the car hire company in advance of the car being taken out in anticipation that parking charges will be incurred.  If cars were being towed away even the tourists would have to think twice.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will deal with the famous boot which they use in London.  That would take care of a lot of people who do not give a damn about their fellow citizen.</P>

      <P>I hope this Bill will ensure that transport and related matters in Dublin will be improved.  I sometimes have reservations when I hear about another body being set up which is either to take charge of something or to look into something.  If this body achieves even some of the objectives set out for them they will be doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>I would hope for increased co-ordination between the various bodies who deal with road and transport planning.  It appears that one unit may be working in total ignorance of another unit.  Common sense discussion will solve these problems.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the traffic difficulties in Dublin arise from various factors, including historical ones.  Many of our streets were constructed long ago and are not capable of carrying juggernauts. Generally the streets were not built for heavy traffic but by using imagination in relation to one-way streets, bus lanes and various other developments there can be an improvement.  It is certainly to be hoped that the Dublin Transport Authority will alleviate the traffic problem in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems due to inadequate parking facilities in the city centre.  Many people bring their cars into the city, in spite of difficulties in parking, due to a <Col N="169" /> lack of faith in our public transport system.  All our main thouroughfares are filled with traffic, sometimes flowing but often jammed.  Only by discussion and liaison between the interested groups can an improvement be brought about.  The Dublin Transport Authority will have to liaise with Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. Perhaps this could be done in a formal way so that there would be consultations at all times.</P>
    <P>It is daft when one reaches the boundary of a local authority area to see good lighting and other facilities on one side and very little provision for traffic on the other.  We must ensure that this kind of thing does not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the setting up of this Dublin Transport Authority will mean an end to the parking chaos.  I have some sympathy with people who infringe the rules to a certain extent, possibly by parking on a single yellow line.  I feel particular sympathy for people who go to River House to tax their cars and find they have been given a parking ticket.  I do not, however, have any sympathy for people who park on clearways or cause obstruction to other motorists and pedestrians. Certainly there will have to be greater enforcement of the traffic regulations.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Dublin Transport Authority will be taking over some of the roles exercised by the Garda will undoubtedly lift some of the burden from the Garda.  All the various interests must be represented on this new Authority.  It should be a body on which there are no &ldquo;passengers&rdquo;.  It will probably be composed of about twelve members by the time the local authorities, the Garda, CIE, the Taxi Owners' Federation and possibly trading groups are taken into account. An Authority composed of people from these organisations would know their business.  However, I am a little worried regarding the fact that they have to refer their recommendations to the Minister.  I hoped that they would be in a position to make decisions which could be acted upon.  Having consulted expert opinion they should be allowed to implement plans like the establishment of bollards, <Col N="170" /> ramps or <i>culs de sac</i> in certain areas.  At present some estates are used as a throughway by motorists putting the lives of children and adults at risk.  If bollards were put up in estates which are used as short cuts the residents would be very grateful as it would slow down motorists. There is also a case for the provision of ramps and, although people have asked for these to stop joyriders, they would also be a deterrent to speeding motorists who go through a 30 miles per hour or a 40 miles per hour zone at 50 or 60 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>There should also be a further development in relation to the DART service, which has been working well.  Admittedly its cost was very high and it is only by greater usage that there will be a return from it.  That means providing feeder buses from outlying areas to bring people to the DART stations.  The service covers an extensive area from Howth to Bray and I hope that the Minister will without further delay ensure that these buses are provided either by CIE or a private concern. There has been far too long a delay in this regard and people are not getting the full benefit from DART.  It is important that the service should be utilised to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Provision should also be made in relation to cyclists and there should be stricter enforcement of lights on bicycles and reflective clothing.  Unfortunately, while many motorists cause accidents, if a cyclist is involved there is an inevitable result.  There should be an onus and a duty on cyclists, like every other road user, to make sure that they are seen and that they observe the rules of the road as well as the motorists.  They should not go through red lights just because it is convenient to do so.  There must be greater enforcement of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>The work of the commission has been of great benefit to Dublin over the past few years in regard to one-way streets, bus lanes and pedestrian only zones after a certain time.  Shopkeepers in Grafton Street and Henry Street welcome the fact that people can walk safely in the area and do their shopping with ease.  Of <Col N="171" /> course there is a problem in regard to parking in the city and it will not be solved overnight.  People would like to leave their cars at home but public transport does not cater adequately for them.  However, there are car pools in operation and they make sense considering the high cost of petrol.  People living in the same area and working in the city can use one car which is of benefit financially and also ensures a steady flow of traffic.  If people had faith in public transport they would use it more often, but of course if a service is unreliable they will go back to their cars.  Buses and trains should run on time so that people can depend on them. Nobody wants to be waiting around on cold evenings for buses which do not come.</P>
    <P>I hope the Authority will look at the operation of public transport with a view to improving it in certain areas.  I hope the Authority will also look at road works. We are all aware of the barrels being erected, drills taken out and holes dug. While we are wondering what is going on more holes are dug.  While I agree that when repair work is necessary Bord Telecom, the ESB and Dublin Gas have to be taken into account, and there should be some consultations and liaison between them.  The question of carrying out repairs in off-peak hours should be investigated.  I hope the Authority will ensure that unnecessary roadworks are not undertaken and that, when work is necessary, as much as possible is done at weekends or in the evenings.  In some instances a one-way system has been introduced quite successfully to ensure a continuous flow of traffic.  I sympathise with people who have to carry out repair work, but they cause havoc in many areas with the result that there is a further snarl up of traffic.</P>
    <P>I hope the Authority will give consideration to the operation of the school warden system, I have received complaints recently in my constituency that these wardens come on duty too late or leave too early.  Many of them are not available to help young children leaving <Col N="172" /> school.  Everything possible must be done to ensure that children are protected fully.  Consideration will also have to be given to the location of traffic lights and roundabouts.  Matters like these must be considered fully to see what improvements can be made.</P>
    <P>I hope the Authority will function properly and ensure that transport in the Dublin area will function effectively.  It will be the job of the Authority to see to it that there is liaison between the various bodies concerned.  I hope the Minister will indicate when he expects the Authority to be in operation.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that difficulties arise from time to time in relation to casual traders.  While I have no objection to the man selling chips or fruit and vegetables doing business, it is important that the customers or other motorists are not put at risk because of the way the trader has parked.  I hope the Authority will consider this matter.  I am glad to support the Bill and I hope it will go some way towards improving the present traffic problems in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will bring some order into certain chaotic areas in the Dublin transport system.  I live on the north side of Dublin and I represent in this House and in the city council a large constituency in that part of the city.  The main areas in which I should like to see the Authority become involved immediately and thoroughly are areas that have been matters of concern to Dublin city councillors.  They have had a limited role in the supervision and operation of the taxi service in the city.  There is also the question of examining the possibility of the licensing of private buses for which there has been a great demand in parts of the city due to the inadequacy of the services offered by CIE in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time there has been a need to take action in relation to heavy vehicles parking in the city.  These cause great danger, discomfort and environmental damage to communities who have to put up with the problem.  In some instances engines of refrigerated vehicles are left <Col N="173" /> running all night and a number of fatal accidents have been caused as a result of the parking of these heavy vehicles. Despite many plans, the local authorities have failed to provide adequate parking facilities.  It is essential that such facilities be provided so that lorries could use them and thus not park on residential streets. Lorry drivers should be forced to use the new toll bridge.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the roadworks programme be co-ordinated.  Deputy Keating provided us with the information that in the past 12 months Merrion Square, just outside this House, has been uprooted 74 times.  This is a quite extraordinary figure and must indicate chaotic management.  Within a month of the Phibsboro Road being finally completed sections were opened up for various works.  This is quite inexplicable.  It must be possible to co-ordinate this kind of work and the Authority must give urgent attention to it.</P>
    <P>As a northsider I look with some envy at the superb public transport system now available to the residents of the coastal broker belt in Dublin.  By comparison, the north and west of Dublin are almost like a transport desert.  There has been total under-investment in public transport for those areas.  In the next decade this must be a social priority.  In respect of the development of the city, there is the objective of creating three mini-cities on the fringe of Dublin at Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  However, they have been provided with only the minimum transport services.  We are sending many young families into those areas that are already suffering a high degree of unemployment and where people cannot provide their own private transport.  One would imagine that the public transport services would be improved to cater for that need.  Instead, the people are allowed to suffer from inadequacy.  For social and national development reasons I should like to see public transport investment in the next decade aimed at the provision of services in those areas as a priority.  Rail lines are available as far as Cabra and beyond. <Col N="174" /> Initial planning has been done by CIE but substantial State financing is lacking.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the DTA to look at the needs and the great potential for the development of a DART type service, some form of commuter rail service, to Cabra, Finglas and Blanchardstown, and the Tallaght-Clondalkin areas.  I hope the Minister will indicate some advanced thinking in relation to this.  From my direct communications with CIE, I understand planning has been going on.</P>
    <P>Members of Dublin City Council have been concerned with the taxi service in Dublin.  Responsibilities are divided between the Garda and the local authorities. I would welcome some direction in regard to the taxi service because of the integration of the system with the Dublin Transport Authority.  There has been concern that local authority control over the taxi service in Dublin was only in regard to the number of plates to be issued in any one year.  Real control, the issuing of licences, was out of their hands. It has been brought to my notice that there is extensive abuse of the taxi plate system in a number of ways.  Many people are multiple plate owners, though it is a stated objective of the Taxi Federation and the clear desire of the local authorities, that where possible there should be a one man one plate system or some form of double sharing.  I have been told of one extraordinary case of multiple plate ownership.  A certain Dublin citizen is in possession of eight plates which are sublet to drivers who are paying the person involved £90 to £100 per week for the privilege of using those plates.  If we add that tidy situation up we are talking about an income of £1,500 per week, a very healthy income to allow to anybody. These plates were given out on a lottery system originally and handed out by the local authority.  We have a responsibility to ensure that those abuses will not be allowed to continue.  There are many people who have been working for years who would like to get into the system full time but cannot afford the kind of investment involved.  These plates are valued at between £8,000 and £10,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> People operating on a one man one plate basis, who are paying their taxes, demand a better system.  It has been reported to me that there is widespread abuse of the social welfare system by people acting as co-drivers.  They have flexibility and can turn up at employment exchanges whenever they choose.  I have had these reports from people involved in the business who are anxious to see the system tidied up so that people who are anxious to earn an honest living can do so.  I hope the new Authority will look at this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that will give the new Authority responsibility for the routing, pricing and licensing of all bus services.  It is desirable that this should be taken out of the hands of the Department who tend to have a single view, that being the view of CIE.  I am not satisfied that in all cases CIE are the only body who can offer an adequate service.  There may be room to introduce alternative services, particularly in areas to which CIE have been unwilling to offer services, in one instance in my constituency over a period of 18 months.  Attempts by private individuals to provide a bus service were blocked by laws which prevented anybody getting into the business.  The possibility to inquire into this is to be welcomed.  The new Authority will be distant from the Department and from CIE in relation to routing and pricing questions.  This will be welcomed by ordinary Dublin consumers who have been expressing concern about travel costs. They may now get a more objective and detached hearing.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to my concern about the effects of heavy industrial traffic in Dublin city.  Dublin Corporation have failed to make adequate provision for the proper organisation and management of such traffic in the inner city.  They have failed to provide adequate spaces which companies could use or be compelled by law to use for parking.  The local authority are not in a position to prevent enormous juggernauts, articulated trucks, parking in side streets in built-up residential areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="176" /> In a written study in regard to the toll bridge in Dublin one is struck by the fact that for some reason, probably related to pricing, industrial traffic has not been using the bridge to the same extent as ordinary motorists.  This is very disappointing and a view was put forward at a meeting indicating that most freight carrying is priced on the basis of time spent travelling and that there is an inbuilt incentive to take longer rather than shorter routes.  This should not be tolerated and legal steps should be taken to ensure that where a facility like the toll bridge exists, involving a loan guarantee to the local authority by the State, plus the significant environmental implications for the city centre, it should be possible to compel larger vehicles to use the route that is most suitable.</P>
    <P>I can see great potential for the DTA to help to shape the face of Dublin, which is at a crossroads at the moment with the announcement of possible major new investment in the inner city.  We should ensure that Dublin will develop in the way many of us would like to see it develop.  There must be policy decisions that Dublin city would be developed more in line with continental cities, with a living centre, rather than being developed on the American style, a throughway for people coming to work and to shop occasionally, but not to live. traditionally Dublin has had a living centre.</P>
    <P>What we do with traffic in Dublin city, how we provide for a public transport system and how we manage access to the city for people who wish to live here and work here are all questions that are of vital importance for the future.  I hope this transport Authority will include that major environmental consideration in all their decisions.  Perhaps this, together with the major package of investment announced here at the commencement of this session, would ensure that Dublin which is at a turning point, which has long been in decline in terms of the quality of the city, would take a turn in the right direction and that we could begin to rebuild a living centre which would be served adequately in transport terms.  We <Col N="177" /> must endeavour to preserve the best of Dublin into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>When I studied the subject of constitutional law some years ago I recall being lectured about the merits and demerits of various forms of Government, included among which was the institution of the State board or of the semi-independent statutory body, the term used sometimes.  I recall being told that there were two excellent merits in this system from the point of view of Governments and of Ministers in particular. The first was that the State board hived off from the Minister concerned any responsibility for coming into the House and answering questions from Members regarding the activities or functions that properly should come within the control of the Department concerned. The second great merit was that the State board provided the opportunity of giving jobs to the boys, as it was put crudely.</P>
      <P>We have gone very much astray down through the years in hiving off from Government Departments functions that should rest properly with those Departments and which with proper organisation could be administered well and efficiently.  What we are debating here is a further twist in that same screw.  We have had the transfer of the areas of posts and communications to semi-State boards and now in relation to transport the Department of Communications are setting about hiving off their responsibilities to Members of the House in the matter of answering questions and of facing up to their responsibilities.  I can visualise a time when other Dublin Deputies and myself will wish to raise questions, to probe and complain and make a fuss about shortcomings in what is available for our constituents, only to be told by the Minister that that is no longer his responsibility and that our inquiries must be directed to the transport Authority. This is a very unsatisfactory trend in our development and it is time it was discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation can be saved <Col N="178" /> if the responsibility is retained here, if we can ask questions about these activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That should be the whole objective of parliamentary democracy, but unfortunately we are allowing ourselves to slip into the very undesirable trend of hiving off responsibilities from Ministers.  The excuse being put forward for the development in transport is that it will make for a more efficient system, but I do not believe that will be the case. What is happening will result in the setting up of a whole new hierarchy, a whole new Civil Service structure with board members.  Civil servants will be recruited, though for the most part they will be duplicating functions that are performed already in other quarters.  It is remarkable that no civil servant can be taken on in other areas unless the numbers have become very run down but by way of this legislation we are creating a whole new set-up that will require totally new staff to perform functions that are performed already in the planning departments of local authorities, in the traffic departments of the Garda and so on.</P>
      <P>Apparently for all this funds are available. We can find £400,000 for the operation in the very first year.  How is it that for this new Authority it will be all right to take on an entirely new staff while for other areas in which staff are needed urgently, apparently extra recruitment is impossible?  We are told that this new body will be the great planning organisation for the future but have many of our problems in the traffic and communications area in Dublin been caused by lack of plans?  We have not lacked plans and neither do we lack talk on the subject. What we require are the implementation of these plans and the funds that are necessary for their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the planning of the new town of Tallaght where the population is now approaching the 100,000 mark, Dublin County Council did a very fine job so far as laying out the arrangements were concerned.  Nobody could fault either of the two provisions they made in the communications field and these did not <Col N="179" /> require a Dublin Transport Authority or any other authority.  First, the council reserved land for a busway into the city. That land was reserved all along where the new town was developed.  That required a fair degree of forecast and thought and the planners are to be complimented on it.</P>
    <P>However, they went further and reserved also a line for a rapid rail route from Tallaght into the city so that more efficient rail transportation would be available to the people being set up in the new town.  The expression &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; might be the appropriate one to use in this context because many of the people in Tallaght consider that they were set up in Tallaght.  The planners reserved land also in the town centre for a railway station but in 15 years or more no step has been taken to implement those plans. Will the new Authority, at a cost of £400,000, push the matter further?</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister did not give any great encouragement in that regard and neither has any such encouragement been forthcoming from him at meetings we have had with him on the subject.  He says that there is the possibility of an alternative of a cheaper service to Tallaght such as a busway or a diesel rather than an electrified rail service, a possibility which was discussed with CIE.  However, no definite proposals have emerged yet in that regard. The people of Tallaght would be very happy to have a diesel route.  Nobody would insist on an electrified as opposed to a diesel rail service.  Also, a busway along the reserved land would be very acceptable to the people of that area.</P>
    <P>The measure, to a very large extent, is a window-dressing operation.  It is an excuse to avoid taking action that is necessary in the transportation field in the greater Dublin area and cannot be accepted as a substitute for the real thing, that is, providing the services that are so urgently required particularly in the new towns.</P>
    <P>I am a strong supporter of rail transport and I make no apologies for saying that.  I am a strong supporter of public transport, <Col N="180" /> too.  I believe that if a sound, efficient and cheap transportation system were provided, people would use it.  I also believe that the pricing policy of CIE has been mistaken.  I do not say that is a policy they have adopted by their own choice; it is a policy which has been dictated to them by successive Government directives.  Unfortunately, successive Governments never provided financing to CIE that would enable them to provide an efficient and cheap service.  CIE were required to operate as if they were a business rather than being recognised for what they are &mdash; a social service.  In every civilised country public transport is heavily subsidised, as are fares.  When CIE increase prices it is counterproductive.  It is another twist in a vicious circle, because the more the prices are increased the more people are frightened from using the service and the more people are encouraged to use their own cars, thus causing the traffic jams.  The Bill seeks to avoid this.  If the service was cheap, adequate, reliable and efficient people would use public transport.</P>
    <P>The provision of a rapid rail service to the densely populated suburban areas of Dublin will be an expensive procedure. We have the necessary expertise to build an electrified train system.  The teams who constructed the DART are now redundant and their expertise lies idle. Those people are being paid dole money for doing nothing whereas they could be gainfully employed providing a service which is critically and urgently needed. There are immense advantages and savings in having a rail system that will serve up to 100,000 people.  We cannot just look at the initial capital cost, as we unfortunately tend to do.  If that service were provided there would be fewer cars on our roads, the amount of petrol saved would be enormous, as would be the number of man hours saved in traffic jams.  We would also save a great deal of money importing oil and we would do ourselves a very big favour in the environmental field because, as is known, pollution from all this traffic is reaching frightening proportions.  The level of lead emissions from all this heavy traffic is of <Col N="181" /> serious concern to me as a resident of Dublin, for myself, my family and my constituents, and it is something we will have to tackle.  One way to tackle this problem would be to make substantial improvements in our transportation system.</P>
    <P>I wish I could come to the conclusion that the Dublin Transport Authority would solve all those problems, but I fear they will not.  The only way those problems can be resolved is by a determination at Government level to make available the funds needed to provide the infrastructure for our public transport which is so urgently needed.  When the Authority come into being they will not be able to make and enforce any definitive decisions.  When it comes to the crunch they will be little more than a recommendatory body.  The original proposal from the Transport Consultative Commission some five years ago envisaged an Authority of a different kind, namely one that would have a block grant provided by the Government.  The Authority would decide how that money would be spent and they would have the powers of deciding between the conflicting demands of public and private transport and between rail and road transport.  But power of that nature is not being given to the Authority.  They have no real power to sort out Dublin's chaotic transport system and they are confined so far as finance is concerned to making recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Authority are given power to give licences to private operators.  Frankly, I find that provision a matter of concern.  I take the view that all public transport in Dublin should be provided by CIE. Admittedly, they should not be licensed to provide an inadequate or deficient system.  But if there are inadequacies and deficiencies in CIE &mdash; and there are &mdash; they should be promptly investigated by the appropriate authority, and the Authority should have power to see that these defects are corrected.  I am concerned about the licensing of private operators. We know how they work.  They select the most profitable routes and leave the State organisation to pick up the tab and serve <Col N="182" /> the less profitable areas.  That is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the pricing control is taken from the National Prices Commission and given to the Authority.  What merit is there in taking that function from one State authority and giving it to another?  Is that the reason we are setting up this Authority at such expense?</P>
    <P>I am not very happy about the nature and structure of the proposed authority. There is very little democratic structure to it.  We are told that the board will be made up of persons with wide experience and competence in transport, that only four of the members will be from the newly elected councils for the Dublin area.  Who are these people with wide experience and competence?  In what function are they engaged at the moment?  Cannot all the functions and advisory functions proposed for this Authority be met, if the Government and the Minister are so minded, within the existing structures?  Does there not already exist the necessary expertise in the Department of Communications, in the local authorities and in the Garda Síochána?  Is there anything to stop the Minister, whenever he wants, calling a departmental committee, calling in representatives from the planning sections of the local authorities and from the traffic department of the Garda, and dealing with any matters of an advisory or recommendatory nature which need to be dealt with, which is all this Authority are given the job of doing?  It would be far cheaper to do it that way.  We would not have to spend £400,000 in the first year with, no doubt, escalating costs in future years.  Existing expertise is already there and should be called upon.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that the DART was built along the wrong axis.  It was built on the north-south line serving areas that are already very well equipped with cars, where people for the most part do not need a rail link.  That is why the Minister has to bemoan the fact that it is not being used to a sufficient extent.  The people living in Tallaght and west County Dublin who could make such good use of the system would be totally reliant on <Col N="183" /> using it as most of them do not possess the luxury of a motor car.  They would use such a line if it were provided.</P>
    <P>The nub of the Bill is that the function of the Authority will be to monitor the ongoing lack of funds in CIE.  Is that the reason we are setting up this Authority? We could better use that money in improvements to the transportation system.  The question of roads construction and financing will apparently be outside the ambit of this Authority.  That will remain with the Department of the Environment.  So, it is not even a question that there will be an overall link of roads into this Authority.  The whole development in the new areas has been a matter of concern.  We have road reservations all over west County Dublin in newly developed areas which are abandoned and covered with mounds of rubbish and so on.  It is a waste of good land and I wonder how long they will be left reserved in that way lying between housing estates.  In the meantime they just cause a problem and a serious nuisance.</P>
    <P>Although I am not very happy that this Bill will make very much progress in achieving what it sets out to do there are some valuable functions given to it, functions which could be organised and performed without setting up a Dublin Transport Authority, things like the provision of ramps dealing with the situation in residential areas, controlling parking of juggernauts and all this sort of thing which has caused problems.  Some progress may be made by the Authority in a minor way in functions of that nature but the Authority was not needed and it would have been better to have tackled the undoubted problems by providing the necessary finance to provide rail and road links to serve the people of the new towns around Dublin.  They need a transport system.  They are entitled to expect it.  It should be provided and that should be the objective of our transportation policy.</P>

      <P>I have the task of initiating the reply to this debate.  I understand that the debate started five months ago and that many contributions have been made from both sides of the House in the interval.  I listened to two contributions, one from Deputy Flaherty and one from Deputy Taylor this evening.  Listening to Deputy Taylor, I will find out from him privately afterwards who was his teacher on constitutional law.  His teacher must have been a man of some cynicism when the only good he can find in semi-independent statutory authorities is that (a) <Col N="185" /> they provide jobs for the boys and (b) enable the buck to be passed.  I hope that is not a reflection on the general tone of the teaching on constitutional law in whatever institution Deputy Taylor attended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it had merits and demerits.  I was quoting two of the things. There may be advantages as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the DART, I know that the provision of DART has been criticised in terms of cost.  One could argue as to whether that criticism is justified bearing in mind that the original funding arrangements, for good fiscal reasons, could not be adhered to and a large amount of debt had to be accumulated during the building process which tended to distort the overall figure.  What we must remember is that DART represents a very considerable technological achievement by CIE from their own resources.  They refurbished that entire line with a minimum of disruption to the existing rail services, and practically no disruption to the road services that ran close to or across the railway.  The signalling, the bridges, and the electronics were all designed and built by CIE.  It took a lot of very high quality expertise to do this on time and without disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. M. Taylor Mr. M. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not tragic that we cannot continue to use that expertise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right to pay tribute to CIE during this debate.  I share with Deputy Taylor the wish that this expertise would continue to be used. Obviously, one of the tasks of a new transport authority will be to give advice as to where that expertise can be used in designing and building new rail links into the populous new suburbs and towns of Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  It will be an expensive measure in money terms. There is no doubt about that.  That is a very important consideration which the new Authority will have to bear in mind when making up their minds on the advice they will give.  In addition to the <Col N="186" /> expense there will be tremendous advantages, socially and economically, in providing a speedy, relatively cheap form of transport for many thousands of citizens in those suburbs.  As the House may gather, I like many others have a certain sentiment towards the railways.  Speaking in sentimental terms, only, I would certainly urge the development of such a rail link.  Obviously in the real world in which we live there are harsh economic considerations to be taken into account.  That will be the task of the DTA in giving the appropriate advice to the Minister and Government of the day as to whether the rail link that Deputy Taylor is keen to see in Tallaght and Blanchardstown will be built.</P>
      <P>Another factor which the Authority will take into account, I am sure, is the expertise now developed and being put in place in Inchicore for the building of carriages there.  The contract which as Minister for Transport I had the pleasure of initiating for the provision of new mainline carriages provided, after the initial carriages were supplied, for the components and a licensing system to be provided in Inchicore so that the carriages after the initial stock would be entirely home built.  Again, an engineering expertise in Inchicore will be available and I have no doubt that that consideration too will be taken into account by the new Authority.</P>
      <P>The overall strategic purpose of the Bill is to improve the planning and operation of road and rail transport in the Dublin area and the management of road traffic.  It is quite clear that, from all sides of the House, there is support for this general strategic objective.  The Bill is not just replacing the non-statutory Dublin transport task force with a new statutory authority.  The new statutory Authority will, of course, build on the work of the task force in improving traffic management in the Dublin area, but in addition they will have major, new, necessary functions which are not there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These functions will be to assess and rank public needs and expenditures as far as public transport by road and rail is concerned, and to secure better physical <Col N="187" /> planning so that public transport needs can be better met in the future.  Many of the transport difficulties being encountered currently, which have been with us from some time, arise inevitably from the physical environment in which the transport is operating.  This is an unavoidable consequence of development of the city, but from now on planning and control of the physical environment must have an eye to the traffic implications of it.  In this regard the new Authority will have an invaluable and essential kernel role to play.</P>
    <P>During the debate there were many valuable suggestions as to how the Authority should operate, suggestions made by Deputies with firsthand knowledge of the problem and experience of local authority service in the area.  The performance of the Authority will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Minister for Communications and in that connection the possible extension of the Authority's functions as contemplated under section 9 of the Bill will be under consideration, though at this stage it would be inappropriate in the view of some Deputies to give the full range of powers to the Authority. The involvement of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service and, if necessary, the Minister for the Environment will ensure a full overview so that the most effective arrangements can be made for the exercise of the new functions.</P>
    <P>When we come to Committee Stage we will deal in detail with the provisions of the Bill, but I would like to comment on one or two points raised on Second Stage.  Deputy Richard Bruton expressed disappointment that the Bill does not deal specifically with the question of value for money in CIE expenditure and he talked of hidden losses and services which should be identified and tackled separately. Under section 28 the Authority will specify the requirements which CIE should try to meet in providing bus and suburban rail services in Dublin and, in so doing, the Authority will be endeavouring specifically to foster greater and better usage of expensive public transport <Col N="188" /> resources entrusted to CIE through, for example, elimination of unnecessary duplication between bus and rail services. An example of that is parallel bus and DART.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should mention that CIE have announced recently that large capacity single deck buses will be introduced on 8 December to provide a feeder service for DART and this should increase greatly the level of use of that service.  To ensure continuation of that, overseeing CIE will be part of the new Authority's function.  Another example of ensuring greater and better usage of the transport resources through CIE would be a tailoring and revising of new services to meet the needs of developing areas of the city and surrounding townships. However, Deputy Bruton should not overlook the Government's plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> Decisions taken earlier by the Government in relation to CIE have established a totally new functional and financial regime for that body which has produced very satisfactory results as regards levels of subvention.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I would like to echo the congratulations of the Minister for Communications to CIE on the great progress they have made in living within the new levels of subvention.  In this context one should acknowledge that the achievements now coming to fruit in CIE in this regard are the result of careful management for a number of years past.  Because of some troubles in the industrial area, CIE were inclined to get a bad name and one was inclined to overlook the tremendous level of management expertise that has been in that company.  The fruits of that expertise are now becoming apparent in the improved financial position of the company.  There has been a tremendous reduction in the numbers employed in CIE over the last number of years, a reduction achieved peacefully and now showing itself in the better financial position.  Therefore, it is only right that I should echo the Minister's congratulations to CIE on their achievements and pay tribute to those in the company who have been working over <Col N="189" /> the past five years or thereabouts to achieve this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson adverted to the possibility of CIE acting as agent of the Authority. It had been intended in 1982 that CIE would have to operate in consonance with the Dublin transport plan proposed by him as Minister and this effectively would mean the Authority taking over the planning function of CIE.  No final relationship between CIE and the Authority had been worked out at that stage because the in-depth McKinsey study was then in progress.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the authority on the lines of the Bill before the House was a major element in the Government's programme on transport reform announced in <i>Building on Reality.</i> Another major element was the restructuring of CIE into three subsidiary bodies.  That is something which is presently under consideration and the exact form of which will be announced in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government's economic and financial policies and their disastrous impact on employment, investment and living standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland at the end of 1985 faces a bleak, economic and social situation that has no parallel since the 1950s.  There is no sign of any real recovery.  In most material respects the economy is in a much worse state today than it was three years ago when the Coalition took office.  We now have mass unemployment, crushing levels of taxation, and a hugh national debt that has grown from £12.8 billion to over £20 billion in three years.  Living standards have been grievously <Col N="190" /> depressed, but the fall in living standards has not been matched by any increase in jobs or healthier public finances.  No Government in recent times have been guilty of such a appalling record of failure and mismanagement or presided over so much damage to the national economy.</P>
    <P>This motion deals with Government economic policies and it is necessary, therefore, to try to follow the path of those policies since the Government took office.  First there was the Joint Programme for Government.  A great deal of that document was abandoned within a few weeks of the Government's taking office.  Despite election promises to pursue &ldquo;a more flexible approach&rdquo; to our national economic problems, deflationary policies were embarked upon immediately with the 1983 budget.  This comprised a set of savagely deflationary measures which took immediate effect. Later, in October 1984, after the Government were subjected to severe criticism from many quarters about the mismanagement of the economy and document <i>Building on Reality</i> was announced with a massive build-up of publicity.</P>
    <P>In effect <i>Building on Reality</i> set out to maintain existing policies but with greatly scaled down targets.  In particular, it offered no improvement on the employment situation.  By this autumn it had become clear that <i>Building on Reality</i> and its projections are so far off course that they are no longer relevant.  Unemployment is much higher than even the very high peak predicted in the document, public service pay and current budget deficit targets have been massively breached. By its own standards <i>Building on Reality</i> has failed in its primary purpose. There are now no attainable policy objectives left in the document.  The Government point to the rate of inflation, to interest rates and to the balance of payments as evidence of the success of their policies.  But in fact inflation and interest rates are doing no more than reflecting international developments and the improvement in the balance of payments is simply a reflection of the totally depressed state of the economy.</P>
    <P>In one of his characteristic economic <Col N="191" /> U-turns the Taoiseach stated recently at the IFA special conference that &ldquo;the economic strategy of stimulating growth is the only realistic approach to job creation and to the improvement of our national finances&rdquo;.  But in May 1983 the Taoiseach claimed that &ldquo;the maintenance of public solvency requires action diametrically opposed to that which the employment situation demands&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's recent statement must be looked at against the background of a serious falling off in economic growth this year.  It is now calculated to be 1 per cent as against 2½ per cent in 1984.  How can a growth rate, a miserable almost non-existent growth rate of 1 per cent, do anything for job creation or improving our public finances?</P>
    <P>In the Joint Programme for Government the Coalition promised &ldquo;firm and decisive action&rdquo; to halt and reverse the growth of unemployment.  Unemployment was then 170,000.  Today it is 226,000, and will no doubt in the next couple of months revert to an even higher figure.  The Government's only argument now is that the rate of increase in unemployment has slowed down.  But even if it were true what hope or solace does that offer?  It is in fact an admission that unemployment is still rising.  It is no great consolation to someone wearily answering ads, for employment to tell them that, even though there are more and more people unemployed, the rate of increase is less than it was.  Furthermore, in the last three years unemployment has, in fact, risen twice as fast in Ireland as elsewhere, and we have been doing significantly worse than our EC partners.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of these appalling figures is the degree by which the real level of unemployment is now masked by temporary training schemes and by high emigration.  There are a number of alarming indications that emigration is reaching very large proportions.  It is accepted that the CSO figures on passenger traffic to and from this country are not a very accurate guide.  Nevertheless, in 1984 an astonishing 39,000 more people left this country by air, sea and across the Border <Col N="192" /> by public transport, compared with 13,000 in 1983.  There is other circumstantial evidence of a big surge in emigration. Increasingly as all Members know local authorities are finding themselves left with houses on their hands as happened during the massive emigration in 1956. We all know from personal experience and observation at local level that people are going away and going away in large numbers.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Taoiseach claimed that at least employment would begin to rise again this year.  The Central Bank rejects this claim.  In its latest report the bank points out that the average level of employment in industry will show a somewhat larger decline than previously forecast, that there will be further declines in employment in the building sector and in the public service and an overall fall in agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken no serious employment initiatives.  On the contrary they have taken a number of measures in successive budgets, such as cutbacks in capital investment, the public service recruitment embargo, the liquidation of State companies, which were clearly going to increase rather than reduce unemployment.  Employment is clearly not a priority of the Government.</P>
    <P>The decline of the construction industry has been accelerated again this year. The index of employment in September shows a 15 per cent decline compared with an 8 per cent decline in September of 1984 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the previous year.  The recently announced measures for the rehabilitation of older dwellings, while welcome, will not have any serious impact on the situation, compared with the flattened out state of the economy and the continuing sharp decline in capital spending by the Government.  There are no major construction schemes being undertaken at the present time.  The submission of the construction industry in September 1985 states that &ldquo;the most critical factor facing the economy and the construction industry is a total lack of confidence&rdquo; and that &ldquo;there will be no improvement until there is positive Government action&rdquo;.  The increase in <Col N="193" /> VAT from 3 per cent to 10 per cent between 1983 and 1985, the abolition of the residence related tax incentive scheme, the abolition of section 23, and the residential property tax are listed as factors that have greatly accelerated the decline in the industry.  The decline in output was 15 per cent in 1983, 8 per cent in 1984 and an estimated 6 per cent in 1985.</P>
    <P>The Government's positive discrimination against the building and construction industry has puzzled and dismayed many thousands who have relied on that industry.  The absolute neglect of the industry is as clear and as definite as it is inexplicable.  The positive contribution which the building and construction industry has made in the past and is capable of making to overall economic development cannot be questioned.  It is a valuable part of the overall economy in the employment it gives, in the infrastructure it provides and in the fact that in the main, it uses indigenous materials and resources.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that the industry has been brought to a situation from which many of those fully conversant with it in all its aspects believe it may never recover.  It is not simply a matter of activity slowing down.  The very fabric of the industry is disintegrating.  The industry had a network of expertise and skills which covered the whole country and it had an organisational structure and management and professional services which enabled it to undertake projects of any size, from the smallest to the largest and of any complexity, from the simplest to the most advanced.  The structures which existed and which could be mobilised to undertake any new project are disappearing.  Old established firms are being liquidated.</P>
    <P>We heard on the news this evening that another old firm, Roecrete, have gone into liquidation.  Professional partnerships are being dissolved, valuable building and construction skills embodied in a trained workforce are disappearing.  The industry is now in such a state of disorganisation and demoralisation that it will take a long time to put it back into its <Col N="194" /> former capacity and to re-establish its structures and restore its capacity.  There are many things in the Irish economy today to be deplored and regretted, but there are none more heartbreaking than the state to which this once reasonably prosperous, well organised industry with such enormous potential has been reduced.</P>
    <P>The last three years have also seen a serious decline in investment.  Up to 1982 the level of investment in the Irish economy was always a surprising source of encouragement and particularly the manner in which it held up even in the worst circumstances.  Despite a modest increase this year compared with last year, investment in manufacturing industry is far below the levels of a few years ago.  This is beginning to be reflected in a tailing off of growth in industrial production and exports.  Industrial production actually declined in the first seven months of this year.  The slowdown is particularly pronounced in the chemicals, metals and engineering sectors &mdash; in other words, these sectors where there has been a heavy concentration of foreign investment.  Export growth has also slowed down, with exports in the second and third quarters down on the first quarter. The ESRI commentary observes: &ldquo;This pause in export growth was due mainly to a failure of the modern industries to maintain their previous rate of growth&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It must be a cause of serious concern for the future that, export growth is now tailing off.  Balance of payments problems could well re-emerge.  The ESRI point out that the deficit will be the smallest proportionately since 1975, but that, also was a year of deep recession, and add: &ldquo;However, it should be recognised that it (that deficit) is being achieved at a time of continuing recession in the home market, and would be liable to rise sharply if there were to be a vigorous recovery in domestic demand&rdquo;, in other words, confirming my thesis that the balance of payments improvement this Government are claiming credit for is in fact nothing more than a clear-cut reflection of the depressed state of our economy and the <Col N="195" /> low level of consumer demand and expenditure.  The ESRI also remark with regard to next year: &ldquo;There is not expected to be a vigorous recovery in demand during 1986&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not know how the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or any member of the Government can claim that they see light at the end of the tunnel, or that we are the healthiest economy in Europe when those simple facts are considered. In my view, this Government have a close down mentality.  This applies in both the public and private sectors.  When difficulties arise, their first instinctive reaction is to send for the liquidator.  Attempts are rarely made to formulate a reconstruction package of proposals, or to make some effort to maintain the enterprise and preserve the employment.  The results of all this, the accumulation of all these actions can be seen in the lengthening dole queues and in the thousands of shattered lives of men and women who have given a lifetime of service to an organisation only to find themselves suddenly and brutally thrown aside, often, unfortunately with no adequate provision for their pension and other entitlements.</P>
    <P>In my view it has become increasingly important also that we look a great deal more closely at the role played by the commercial banking system in these situations and in the economy generally.  In the case of many recent closures both in the public and private sectors, banks have and had a lead role in closing down a number of enterprises.  If we are to blame the managements of the enterprises in question for allowing them to get into financial difficulties, can we completely exonerate their bankers in all cases?</P>
    <P>The commercial banking system currently is compelled to make enormous provision for bad debts.  This is a very serious aspect of the economic and financial situation.  That bad debts have arisen on this scale is almost certainly a result of the continuing decline in the economy and the loss of markets, both domestic and overseas.  Again, however, the question must be asked, can the banks themselves be completely exonerated?  Have <Col N="196" /> there been errors of judgment of major dimensions on their part, either by advancing too little or indeed, equally unfortunate in some cases, advancing too much?</P>
    <P>For some considerable time now, the Irish commerical banks have, in effect, negatived the whole principle of limited liability.  This has arisen from their widespread practice of demanding personal guarantees from proprietors and directors of limited liability companies for advances made to those companies. These personal guarantees have operated, in effect, to completely set aside the protection that limited liability is designed to afford to the entrepreneur. At present, there are a number of instances of this kind in cases where limited liability companies have failed and directors are being called upon to forfeit all their personal possessions.  Is it legitimate for bankers to pursue directors personally in this way for their most personal possessions, to the extent that they are left totally destitute?</P>
    <P>This is a whole aspect of the economic and fiscal situation that will have to be looked at very carefully indeed.  There is no point in this Legislature enacting legislation providing for companies and their activities and, in particular, enshrining in the legislation the principle of limited liability if the banking organisations, the commercial banks are, in effect, going to operate in such a way that there is not really limited liability because of their insistence on personal guarantees. Apart from the humanitarian aspects of these actions by the commercial bankers, I believe they are detrimental to enterprise and act as a disincentive in the economy.</P>
    <P>In my view, one of the major defects of the economic and financial policies of this Government was their total commitment to high levels of taxation.  The very first thing the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, did when he came into office in July 1981 was to impose a budget of crushing taxation which has since been recognised by most economic experts to have been a major mistake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> In subsequent budgets, taxes were substantially increased in practically every area, direct personal taxes and indirect taxation.  It is now clear that these drastic increases in taxation have been totally counterproductive.  Their inevitable outcome is the size of the current budget deficit that we face this year and the prospect of another major current budget deficit next year.  These levels of tax have killed incentive and depressed economic activity to such a level that we are now experiencing diminishing returns in many areas.  For instance, VAT this year has failed to reach the targets set by the Minister in his budget.  As I have said on another occasion, what the Government have been doing is adjusting everything downward.  Higher and higher taxes are now bringing in less while, at the same time, they have completely depressed economic activity and made recovery impossible as long as they are maintained.</P>
    <P>I have already publicly committed Fianna Fáil to the lowering of tax levels as an essential element of an economic recovery programme.  A major change is needed.  The monetarists have had their day.  Their policies have failed.  They have reduced this economy to what can be described only as a devastation level. Because the economy has been so depressed, it no longer has the capacity to generate the necessary levels of resources to finance public expenditure at present levels and, as a result, we have had this explosion of Government borrowing in the last three years &mdash; as I have already pointed out, £12.8 billion at the end of 1982 to approximately £20 billion at the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto for the June 1981 general election, Fine Gael and the present Taoiseach promised to reduce the standard rate of personal tax to 25 per cent.  That was their specific election promise going into that general election campaign.  Of course, that promise has not been heard of since.  Again the Joint Programme for Government promised that the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries was to be <Col N="198" /> reduced and indirect tax increases minimised in order to help to reduce inflation. It is important to repeat that: in the Joint Programme for Government that they drew up coming into office this Government promised that the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries was to be reduced and indirect tax increases minimised in order to help to reduce inflation.  Yet the first Coalition budget in 1983 gave no income tax relief of any kind and imposed unprecedentedly high rates of VAT, up to 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>Total taxation was slightly under 36 per cent of GNP in 1980.  In 1984, due to measures put forward in successive Coalition budgets since July 1981, it is now 42.5 per cent of GNP.  Therefore, total taxation has increased from 36 per cent of GNP in 1980 to 42.5 per cent of GNP.  This is actually a high tax Government and there is no way they can avoid admitting to that description.  In other words, in today's terms, this Government are taking approximately £1,000 million more in higher taxes.  In this country we have now reached the ludicrous stage where a single industrial worker could be paying the top 60 per cent tax rate on an income which is little over £9,000 a year.</P>
    <P>There is probably no other country in Europe that subjects significant numbers of its industrial workers to the top rate of tax.  Four out of ten taxpayers in this country are in the higher bands.  The indirect tax levels after the 1983 budget were the highest in Europe.  Surely, bearing in mind the increase in the population, and especially the adult population, the depressed state of consumer spending &mdash; well below now what it was in 1980-81 &mdash; is the surest possible proof of the severe squeeze on incomes by taxation in the last few years.</P>
    <P>This State faces major financial problems which have got worse, not better, in the last three years.  There is a serious revenue shortfall this year.  The VAT returns up to mid-November show an increase of 3.5 per cent only over the 1984 figure instead of the 9 per cent increase targeted in the budget.  Of course, it is possible that that situation may improve <Col N="199" /> a little coming up to Christmas on account of the increased levels of consumer expenditure always associated with the Christmas period, but I do not think there will be any significant improvement.  In fact, all the indications are that consumer spending this Christmas season will not be of any particular significance in that regard.  Therefore, we have had the situation in which the Minister, in his budget in the early part of this year, targeted for a 9 per cent increase in VAT and he is getting 3.5 per cent only.  Surely there could be nothing more clearly indicative of the failure of his fiscal policies than that statistic?</P>
    <P>While there are no official figures published, except quarterly, for the current budget deficit it is possible to calculate that deficit from the weekly Exchequer returns with an accuracy of plus or minus £10 million.  Halfway through this last quarter of 1985, by 15 November, the current budget deficit had already reached £1,350 million as against an original target of £1,234 million.  If the Minister, in the course of this debate, wishes to contradict that figure he is, of course, at liberty to do so.  But from our calculations &mdash; and we have not access to the sort of information the Minister has &mdash; the current budget deficit is already £1,350 million at this stage.  Therefore, it is likely that, at the end of the year, there will be a gap of at least £100 million or possibly more.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach came into this House &mdash; I recall it well &mdash; and claimed that the State was on the edge of bankruptcy when the current budget deficit was 7.4 per cent of GNP in 1981.  But he now maintains, when the deficit is 8.5 per cent of GNP, that national solvency has been restored &mdash; an interesting use of statistics &mdash; we were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, the IMF wolves were at the door in 1981 because the budget deficit was 7.4 per cent of GNP.  But now there is light at the end of the tunnel; we are one of the healthiest economies in Europe when the current budget deficit is actually 8.5 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>That the monetarist policies pursued by this Government have brought unemployment and hardship cannot be denied.  They have destroyed national morale and confidence. It is true also that, as economic and financial policies, they have failed totally to reach even their own narrow, limited, monetarist objectives.  One of the key objectives this Government set themselves as an esential part of their policy of fiscal rectitude was to reduce the current budget deficit.  There can be no gainsaying that; we all recall it, it was repeated again and again &mdash; the new philosophy was fiscal rectitude and what had to be done was reduce the size of the current budget deficit.</P>
      <P>The document <i>Building on Reality</i> specified that the current budget deficit should be reduced to 5 per cent of GNP in 1987 &mdash; in 1987 the current budget deficit was going to be 5 per cent of GNP. This year the current budget deficit is already running at approximately £1,350 million, way ahead of even the historically high figure that was projected at the beginning of the year.  By the end of the year certainly it will be the largest budget deficit every recorded in the history of this State both in its actual amount and in the percentage of GNP it will represent &mdash; £1,350 million at least representing 8.5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now learn from comment in the newspapers that the Government have settled the estimates of expenditure for 1986.  It is difficult to understand why any such exercise had taken place.  At the time of the publication of <i>Building on Reality,</i> we were told that one of its cardinal virtues was that it established for the first time certainty in regard to public expenditure; that the entire community would know for certain what the level of expenditure under the different headings would be for each year of the plan.  The total for 1986 was set at £5,630 million, with the amount under each heading clearly set out.  We must ask now, are those &ldquo;Reality&rdquo; spending totals going to <Col N="201" /> be adhered to?  Perhaps the Minister will tell us in his reply.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been informing us throughout the year that the document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> is still on target.  If this is so, will the figures for 1986, set out in that document, stand or will we be subjected to another set of euphemisms, like &ldquo;rolling forward&rdquo;, &ldquo;adjustments within the framework&rdquo; and so on?</P>
    <P>I believe we shall have to be vigilant about what the Government do in this crucial area and also in the related area of the size of the current budget deficit. In previous years at this time we were subjected to a great deal of comment and discussion about the possible size of the forthcoming budget deficit for the following year.  So far, Government spokesmen are remaining remarkably quiet about this aspect of the public finances.  I would like to ask all those who have spoken and written so eloquently about it in previous years what has changed.  Is it no longer the central crucial issue that we were lectured about?  Is there no longer any concern about this enormous discrepancy in the nations's accounts and that each year it adds another layer to the national debt?</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office they professed themselves to be deeply alarmed about the rate of public sector borrowing and the size of the national debt.  At that time the total national debt was £12.8 billion.  Since then it has risen at dizzying speed to a point where it is now over £20 billion. This is the greatest single increase in the national debt ever incurred in the period of office of any Government.  It has gone from 100 per cent of GNP to 130 per cent.  Foreign debt was £5 billion in 1982; it is now £9 billion.  The proportionate increase in the last three years is something the like of which has never been seen before.  Insofar as any reduction in the amount or the rate of Government borrowing is concerned, all the unemployment, all the hardship, all the emigration, have been suffered in vain.  The policies which caused them have brought no improvement whatever in the state <Col N="202" /> of the public finances, which are now infinitely worse than they have been at any time in the history of the State.  The huge publicity campaign waged about the public finances has been discarded and fiscal rectitude is a dead duck.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment refers to expenditure having been got under control. Government expenditure was kept below the original budget estimate by Fianna Fáil in 1982.  It was again kept under estimate by this Coalition in 1984, but that is all.  It will not be this year.  A key element in control of expenditure was supposed to be the publication in September and a debate on the Book of Estimates in the autumn session.  That was a specific commitment in the Joint Programme for Government.  It has been abandoned.  On the other hand, in 1982 we published the Book of Estimates on 18 November, not just in time for a Dáil debate but for full-scale debate in a general election campaign.</P>
    <P>The key question of fiscal policy and the Government's honesty as we approach the 1986 budget is whether the Government will do anything serious about the current budget deficit in line with <i>Building on Reality,</i> or whether they will just add another billion pounds or so to the national debt in order to achieve tax cuts.  <i>Building on Reality</i> effectively ruled out tax cuts, but we shall have to wait and see and the answer will be very revealing from many points of view.</P>
    <P>The reduction in interest rates is the next point that the Government see fit to boast about.  Irish interest rates are simply following international trends, but with the important proviso in this country that real interest rates, or the gap between the rate of inflation and the rate of interest, is unprecedentedly high. Under this Government the gap has steadily widened.</P>
    <P>Any apparent reduction in the growth of unemployment, as I have explained is attributable mainly to emigration and training schemes.  Compared with 1982 there has been no improvement of expenditure control.  The improvement in the balance of payments is to a considerable extent simply a reflection of the <Col N="203" /> depressed state of the economy with some contribution from industries brought in under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the economic problem today.  Its social and human implications are deep and serious.</P>
    <P>The lack of any possibility of securing employment is forcing thousands and thousands of young people to go abroad in desperation, in search of some form of employment that will give them an income, a standard of living and restore their personal dignity and self-respect. That is the cruel reality of Irish life today. It is one specific outcome of the monetarist policies pursued for the last three years.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged by this Government.  They must stop trying to conceal the reality behind a screen of figures and statistics.  The Irish economy, as it has been run, is not providing employment now and does not offer any hope of employment in the future.  For many thousands of others, those who are unemployed and for a variety of reasons cannot or will not leave their homes and families, the situation is now desperate. Their living standards have been depressed down to a real, hardship level. For them it is a struggle &mdash; a daily, weekly struggle to survive.  There is actual hardship and deprivation in our local communities today to an extent never before known.  Large numbers of families are in need and have no alternative but to have recourse frequently to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or some similar charitable organisation.</P>
    <P>Hopelessness has entered into the very fibre and fabric of our society.  The humiliation of unemployment, the sinking feeling that it is no longer worth while even looking for a job, the erosion of dignity and self-respect have created a mood of apathy which is now feeding upon itself and has become the predominant state of mind in the local community. In the suburbs of our cities, there are now whole streets where practically nobody goes to work.  Unemployment and apathy is the pervading atmosphere. <Col N="204" /> The one or two people who actually go out to work feel different and isolated.</P>
    <P>It is to this depressing and scandalous state that the policies of this Government, pursued relentlessly and heartlessly over three years, have reduced our people.</P>
    <P>A major programme of economic recovery must await a general election. This Coalition is too divided on basic issues of economic approach, too wedded to monetarist doctrines to make the radical change in the direction of economic policy that is needed.  The very terms of the Government amendment demonstrate that they are not in touch with the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>Positive policies are needed, not a pathetic attempt to defend the present failures.  The revival of the construction industry must be a major priority.  There is ample work that needs to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The importance of the tourist industry for Ireland must be recognised again. There is much work we can do in developing not only accommodation but facilities and activities and places to visit.</P>
    <P>Our natural resources must be properly exploited.  We have tended to neglect the wealth of the sea off our coasts.  That must be corrected by setting up the proper supportive institutional structures. Our investment in agriculture has been cut by three-fifths over the last three years.  We must seek to create the conditions for an intensification of agricultural production in areas where this is still open to us.</P>
    <P>We must develop our technology base for modern industry.  Our future lies in a well-trained generation of young people, ready to take up the challenge of new technologies and new types of economic endeavour.</P>
    <P>Our taxation system and the cost of our public utilities should be examined closely to see whether they are creating unnecessary obstacles to enterprise and investment.  The right assistance to particular sectors may lead to a radical improvement in their performance, as has often happened in the past.</P>
    <P>What is needed is an economic policy <Col N="205" /> that will turn the country around; restore a spirit of enterprise; give people back their confidence.  Economic recovery is necessary and possible.  The present economic situation is leading us to social disaster.  Mass unemployment will destory community life as we know it, if it is to remain as a permanent feature of national life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The policies which the Government followed since assuming office three years ago are not, as the Opposition have repeatedly tried to make out and which Deputy Haughey again tried to make out this evening, the products of a naïve ideology or a simplistic obsession with accounting concepts to the exclusion of the real needs of the economy and our people.  Nor are they to be dismissed or categorised as monetarist, another of the buzz words which the Opposition discovered over the last three years, an insult to be hurled when they cannot think of anything else to say.  Our policies must be seen in the context of the potentially disastrous situation which existed when we took over the reins at the end of 1982.  Indeed, after the publication of the famous 1983 Estimates, referred to <Col N="206" /> by Deputy Haughey, which did not come anywhere near covering the problem for 1983, it is easy for the Opposition to forget the full extent of the crisis which faced us at that time.</P>
    <P>Activity in the economy was stagnant, even declining.  Real GNP was falling and manufacturing production had declined for two out of the previous three years; unemployment was spiralling upwards: almost 40,000 more people were out of work than a year earlier; our balance of payments situation was frightening: the cumulative deficits over the four years to 1982 amounted to half of our total annual production; inflation was rampant: the value of money had been halved in less than five years.  Our international competitiveness was being seriously and relentlessly eroded; the imbalance in the public finances seemed to have assumed a permanent character, with the EBR, for the second consecutive year standing at about 16 per cent of GNP; and interest rates were at exorbitant levels, putting impossible strains on the financial position of businesses, farmers and the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>That was the situation which was patently not coped with in <i>The Way Forward</i> published in October 1982 and which was not properly addressed in the Estimates published by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government in November 1982.  Our response to that situation could not conceivably have been to ignore those seemingly insuperable problems and to hold out vague promises that all would come right of its own accord.  Instead, we confronted the reality, put to the people an honest assessment of the situation and said that we would face up to the difficult decisions needed to put the economy on a sound footing again.  We confronted head on the real problems of the economy, the creation of sustainable employment, the control of inflation and the restoration of our international competitiveness, the correction of the public finances and the reduction of borrowing. In spite of all the fine words in December 1979, January 1980, March 1982 and October 1982, those problems were not addressed by the Deputies opposite, nor <Col N="207" /> have they been addressed by them since December 1982.  They have not been addressed here tonight either and in the prescriptions offered by the Opposition over the last three years there has not been a single, solitary proposal which would even come near addressing the reality of those problems.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy to deal with the problems &mdash; we never said that it would be &mdash; and inevitably the measures taken have not been popular with everybody. We have had to put up with the constant jibes of those who purport to share our analysis of the problems but, at the same time, put forward solutions designed to win short term popularity which run diametrically opposite to that analysis, solutions indeed which contain the seeds of disaster.  Deputy Haughey, for some reason best known to himself, did not go that far tonight and, for once, we heard a speech on the economy from the Opposition which did not put forward the madcap solutions which they have been trying to peddle around the country for the past three years.  Perhaps we should be grateful that, so far in this debate, we have been spared the nonsense of the various ready formulae that come tripping off their tongues.  We have so far also been spared a repetition of the nonsense for which the Opposition Front Bench spokesman on Finance recently got his knuckles rapped.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the public are misled by the fanciful economies underlying those pseudo-prescriptions for the problem.  The real test of the Government's strategy is whether they are achieving the results we claimed they would, and I have no doubt that the record speaks for itself in that regard. Substantial progress has been made on both budgetary and taxation policies. Control has been restored over the management of the annual budget.  The deterioration in the public finances has been halted and Exchequer borrowing requirements and the public sector borrowing requirement as proportions of GNP have been reduced.  The burden of <Col N="208" /> taxation in 1985 will fall for the first time since 1979.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey appears to have found in the figures a reason for suggesting that taxation this year will take 42 per cent of GNP, although he claimed that he does not have access to all the data, which is true.  He cannot get it right now and his party did not get it right in earlier years.  Current Government revenue this year on the post budget estimate will amount to 40.9 per cent of GNP including tax and non-tax revenue.  Deputy Haughey, in his haste to find something bad to say, may have forgotten that non-tax revenue is not part of the taxation system.  That was the first own goal in what should have been a serious debate on the economy.</P>
    <P>We have also made progress in restructuring the tax system and these policies have been successfully pursued notwithstanding a difficult economic environment and, as a number of aspects of the recent economic performance prove, they are beginning to produce positive results.  The restoration of proper management of the annual budget has been a key objective for the Government.  In the period between 1979 and 1982 the average overrun on the annual target for the current budget deficit was 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>I must now take issue with a claim which Deputy Haughey made a few moments ago and I should like to give figures for the performance in each of those years.  The overrun in relation to the current budget deficit in 1979 was 80 per cent of the target; in 1980 it was 55 per cent; in 1981 it was 56 per cent and in 1982 it was 46 per cent.  Contrast that with the situation in 1983 where we over-ran by 7 per cent of the original target, in 1984 where we had an undershoot of just over 4.5 per cent and with this year when we will have a small overrun, nothing like the level claimed by Deputy Haughey.  He should get better advice on the interpretation of figures.</P>
    <P>In the period 1983 to 1985 the average overrun will be about 3 per cent and the variations in this period have been well within normal estimating bounds which <Col N="209" /> clearly show that control over the management of the public finances has been firmly restored.  The gap in 1985, while it will be a little larger than we had reckoned on, will be nothing like as big as Deputy Haughey indicated and will pale into insignificance compared with the performances of the Fianna Fáil Government under Deputy Haughey's leadership which never seriously addressed the problems of carrying out a set of financial policies which co-ordinated their budget targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have clearly shown that they can manage the resources which the people entrusted to them, within the budgetary limits set out to get the results they want.</P>
      <P>The period prior to 1983 was marked by continuing deterioration in the budgetary position notwithstanding the major remedial action commenced in the budget of July 1981.  Since 1982 the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced from 15.8 per cent of GNP in 1982 to somewhat over 13 per cent of GNP this year.  In the same period the public sector borrowing requirement has been reduced from 20 per cent of GNP to somewhat over 16 per cent of GNP. Against the economic background of this period these represent substantial achievements that lay a groundwork for the future that will be of inestimable value to taxpayers in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of the current budget deficit is much more deep-rooted and difficult to resolve than most analysts imagined in the early eighties.  With high real interest rates, weaknesses in revenue buoyancy and demographic and labour force pressures on public expenditure, restrictive policies are necessary merely to prevent the deficit from rising.  I remind the House that every time Deputy O'Kennedy comes into the House to talk about the economy he insists we must reduce the current budget deficit but every time we discuss any measure <Col N="210" /> designed to do that he says no, he will not support it.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, we have recognised the fact that in the absence of the policies we have pursued the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement would have simply exploded.  It is a total fallacy, and a dangerous one, to argue that all the action taken since 1982 has been in vain.  If those on the Opposition benches who make this argument really believe it, then they show a total inability to understand the workings of the economy and their total unsuitability ever to be entrusted with any kind of responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The inexorable increase in the tax burden over the previous five years has been halted this year.  In 1985, for the first time since 1979, the tax burden will fall.  Deputy Haughey, and Deputy O'Kennedy, if he is advising him, should look at the figures again.  The national plan commits the Government to avoid any further increase in the burden of taxation and we will adhere strictly to this commitment.  Significant progress has been made in the area of tax reform.  The <Col N="211" /> income tax system has been significantly restructured as has the VAT system. Much more needs to be done and will be done.  The problem of tax collection and tax evasion have also been thoroughly reviewed and a whole battery of measures is being taken to solve them.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of the Government's economic policies is to reverse the upward trend in unemployment.  The achievement of this goal depends, among other things, on the rate of economic expansion.  Faster growth creates more job opportunities and it helps to reduce the budget deficit because it boosts tax receipts and reduces expenditure commitments. That is why the recovery in national output in 1984, which has continued this year, is most welcome.  Everyone now acknowledges that our growth performance last year was the best in Europe.  However, it may not be fully appreciated that this performance was achieved against the odds.  Growth in our European export markets was relatively sluggish and so our export gains were due more to increased market share than to a general improvement in the trading environment.  In addition, and in direct contrast with the growth rates recorded from 1977 to 1981, last year's growth performance was achieved in the context of a further improvement in the fiscal position.  Those two factors will be extremely important.  There is the potential there on which we can capitalise if people will read the lesson that is there to be read.  I say this particularly in relation to the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some slowdown in the rate of growth had been expected this year as a result of the way very high level of international interest rates and of the forecast slowdown in our export markets. In manufacturing industry it was thought that some of the recently established firms would be approaching peak production levels, while in agriculture it was considered unlikely that the combination <Col N="212" /> of favourable factors which resulted in such a strong increase in farm output and incomes would be repeated this year. While export growth has slowed down, both personal consumption and investment are turning up following a protracted period of decline.</P>
      <P>Even if overall growth in output this year will be less buoyant than in 1984, its profile is more favourable, with a better balance between consumption, investment and trade.  This is true also of the manufacturing sector, where the more established labour-intensive sectors, taken together, appear to be holding their own this year.  The overall growth performance in the manufacturing sector since 1982 has been very impressive.  On the reasonable assumption that the out-turn for 1985 will be in line with trends in the year to date, output will have expanded by about 30 per cent in real terms over the last three years, and by year-end we should be somewhat ahead of schedule for achieving the growth objective set out in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were not such a serious matter, the Opposition's attempts to link the further increase in unemployment which has occurred during our term of office specifically to our policies would be amusing. Have they forgotten that at the end of 1982 there were 180,000 people out of work, more than double the number five years before, and that unemployment was rising at almost 40,000 a year?  To ascribe all of that increase to the policies of our predecessors would be a naive exaggeration and I would not attempt to do so.  However, I am entitled to demand in the interest of common sense and constructive debate that they desist from the spurious claims they make in connection with unemployment.  The task of generating enough jobs to cater for our rapidly expanding labour force, let alone to put the unemployed back to work, requires the active co-operation of all sections of the community.  This requires that the Government provide leadership and that they be seen to take a responsible approach.  This, I believe we have done, and we would claim at least part of the credit for the relative improvement in the <Col N="213" /> employment situation over the past few years, even if it still falls short of what we need and hoped for.  It requires also that we fully appreciate the wide range of influences that affect employment here and that the Opposition give up the wild, jingoistic claims which seem to pass for argument on their benches.</P>
    <P>By the end of last year, the annual increase in the number of registered unemployed had moderated to less than half of that in December 1982 and this encouraging trend has been maintained throughout most of 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>While a single month's figure must always be treated with caution, the fact remains that in October the live register showed the smallest year-on-year increase since the middle of 1980. This development is all the more noteworthy for having occurred against a background of continuing growth in the labour force.</P>
      <P>Apart from reflecting the favourable impact of the special initiatives introduced by the Government to boost the numbers at work, to which I shall refer in a moment, the easing in the unemployment situation also stems from a more positive employment position.  Although total employment, which fell by 23,000 in the year to mid-April 1983, continued to decline in the following 12 months, it did so at a much slower rate; indeed, the rate of decrease in non-agricultural employment during 1983-84 slowed to less than half that of the previous year, mainly because of a sharp reduction in net job loss in the industrial sector.  While comprehensive figures are not yet available for the period after mid-April 1984, the indications are that the trend has continued to improve since then, to the point where total employment has already begun, or will shortly begin, to grow again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never made any secret of our belief that it would take some considerable time to turn the tide of unemployment. Apart from ensuring that the <Col N="214" /> unemployed were spared the worst financial hardships of their situation, the Government, recognising the particular disadvantages which beset the young and long-term unemployed in times of high-unemployment, acted to improve the employment prospects of both groups. The numbers engaged in special employment and training schemes under the aegis of the Youth Employment Agency grew from about 33,000 in 1982 to about 53,000 in 1984, and is likely to have increased again during the current year.</P>

Is Deputy O'Kennedy trying to cast aspersions on those people? We are succeeding in doing what we set out to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to alleviate the plight of the long term unemployed, whose chances of successfully re-entering employment in the short term were poor, the Government announced, in the national plan, the introduction of a social employment scheme providing part time work for one year for persons who have been unemployed for over a year and are drawing unemployment assistance.  This scheme is now under way and I am pleased to say that over 4,000 people are currently benefiting from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important and hearteningly successful Government initiative is the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, designed to assist the unemployed to start their own businesses.  This scheme attracted over 4,500 participants in its first year of operation in 1984, and, in the current year, at least a similar additional number <Col N="215" /> will have taken part.  Apart from helping to dispel the notion that the unemployed are simply not interested in work and prefer to remain on the dole, these enterprises can act as an encouragement to others to follow suit and many will become important local centres of employment.</P>
    <P>In addition, important initiatives on employment creation were introduced by the Government just over a month ago. These measures included:</P>
    <P>the designation of the Customs House Dock Site for a major redevelopment programme: a wide range of incentives will be made available to stimulate investment in construction; the institution of an additional programme of inner city development and reconstruction in Dublin by designating specific areas of the city and making a wide range of incentives available: in the same way, specific areas in Cork and Limerick will also be designated;</P>
    <P>the establishment of a new scheme of home improvement grants;</P>
    <P>the introduction of a programme of improved community and leisure facilities and other general amenities to develop much needed facilities principally in urban areas;</P>
    <P>special new grants to develop better facilities at hotels and guesthouses: grants will be made available up to a maximum of £30,000, and the investment that these grants totalling £2 million will generate will yield a substantial number of jobs;</P>
    <P>the accelerated development of the natural gas grid: the Government have decided in particular to extend the grid to Limerick and Waterford, bringing the benefits of gas, together with a substantial number of construction jobs, to a number of cities, towns and industries that do not enjoy them at present;</P>
    <P>doubling of the number of new employees eligible for aid under the Employment Incentive Scheme; <Col N="216" /> the introduction, in order to stimulate new employment, of a scheme of exemption from PRSI contributions by employers for the tax year 1986-87 in respect of additional new full time employees taken on by any private employer between now and 31 March next who have been on the live register for at least six months. </P>
    <P>I find it particularly amusing to hear Deputies Haughey and O'Kennedy out of one side of their mouths criticising the Government for being rigid and monetarist and out of the other side finding something to criticise in flexibility and fine tuning.  They have shown again tonight, as they have done for the past three years, total inability to make up their minds about any single prescription, total disability to make up their minds about what are the important and the less important ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>These initiatives are imaginative and wide ranging and are a tangible response to the unemployment situation.  They are designed to boost private sector job creation, particularly in the construction sector.  These measures are fully consistent with the Government's overall economic strategy as outlined in the national plan <i>Building on Reality.</i> They should be seen as fine tuning of the plan strategy which is flexible enough to accommodate changes where these are considered desirable and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress in controlling inflation has been particularly encouraging.  Inflation has now fallen from an average rate of over 20 per cent in 1981 to significantly less than 6 per cent.  The year-on-year increase in August at 5.5 per cent was lower than the rate in the UK and was in line with our EC partners.  The year-on-year increase to May 1985 at 5¼ per cent was the lowest since 1968.  Recent reductions in petrol prices, and in mortgage interest rates came too late to be included in the most recently published <Col N="217" /> inflation figures, but they will have a beneficial effect on the rate for the year as a whole.  This is now likely to be around 5½ per cent, better than the plan target, and better than the expectation of 6 per cent or below at the time of the budget.</P>
    <P>Control of inflation is central to the Government's economic policy and is particularly important in maintaining our competitiveness as against our main trading partners.  One reason why our employment performance has been disappointing in recent years is that the rate of increase in earnings here has consistently been much greater than in most of the countries with which we compete. Since 1979, for example, hourly earnings in manufacturing industry in this country have doubled.  In the same period, earnings in our main trading partners &mdash; the EC countries, the USA and Japan &mdash; have increased by only 57 per cent, not much more than half the rate of increase here.  Among our narrow-band partners in the EMS, the rate of increase has been even less, at only about 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Here I come to one of the important lessons which the Opposition, clearly, have not begun to see in our performance in recent years.  If, as has been the case since 1983, we have managed to increase our market share internationally against countries that had a more favourable development in labour costs than we, had lower inflation rates that we and lower interest rates, how much better can we not do in output growth now that we have our main cost indicators more closely in line with those of our competitors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tell us about the 30,000 new jobs he was supposed to get for the 246,000 unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say to the Opposition, to our interest groups, to our trade unions and employers that we now have the conditions on which we can build and create employment, because we are more competitive and can reverse the trend of recent years.  Our predecessors failed to get cost indicators under control and, consequently, we lost employment.  They <Col N="218" /> are the opportunities that have been given to our people, to the unemployed and the young people looking for jobs. In bringing about those improvements in inflation, interest rates and in balancing the economy we have been given an extra margin and it is up to us to use it to get our people into jobs.  I am prepared to do it.  I am prepared to say the policies that are needed.  They have been spelled out many times and voted on four times in this house.  I invite the Opposition, if there is any reality in their concern, to support us in those policies.</P>

      <P>I agree that the Minister has spelled out his policies, but I hope to illustrate in the 20 minutes available to me &mdash; I compliment the Minister on how clearly he spelled out his policies &mdash; that those policies clearly are not working. I will try to do that as dispassionately as I possibly can.  I shall begin by referring to the reply to a question which I received in the past few days from the Minister for Finance.  My question was to ask the Minister the number of taxpayers now in the country and without going into the massive documentation he was good enough to send me, the reply is 972,000. The figures in respect of the previous years are: last year, 975,000, the year before 984,000 and in the year before that, close to 1 million.  My reason for giving these figures at the outset is to demonstrate that, wherever the blame may be laid, the number of people available to pay the taxation necessary to keep the State moving, is decreasing.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1984-85 figure for the number of taxpayers is an indication of the underlying economic difficulties facing us.  Unlike the Minister I do not see that necessarily as a healthy sign. Rather, I see it as a sign of continuing unemployment and emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate gives us an opportunity of discussing where we go from here as we enter the second half of the eighties.  The issue is not only that but whether policies <Col N="219" /> being pursued offer any better hope and outlook for the future.  I was amazed to hear the Minister accuse the party on this side of the House of trying to link unemployment to his policies.  That is what I understood him to say.  If the Minister believes the unemployment should not be linked to Government policies there are major difficulties facing us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need to look at the Joint Programme for Government which was put before the people on the formation of this Government, to look also at the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i> which can safely be said to be running into major difficulties and at the Minister's 1985 budget speech.  How can any Deputy judge and assess what a continuation in office of the Government would mean other than by examining the printed record of the Government and measuring where we are at in terms of their specific targets?</P>
      <P>I am not interested in off-the-cuff remarks by the Minister or in his new enthusiasm for his job but I am interested in considering what the reality is <i>vis-á-vis</i> what the Minister and the Government told the House it would be.  If the Government were being interviewed for their jobs, comparisons of those two figures would render it extremely difficult, for them to be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment problem is the single most important issue concerning us.  We in this House have a joint responsibility to the unemployed, not <Col N="220" /> only for economic reasons but in terms of the despair, the apathy, the crime, the subversion and the emigration that are prevalent when there is gross unemployment. The Government admittedly inherited an unemployment figure of 187,000 but we might remind them that at that time they pointed out that that was a disastrous figure and in all their documentation pledged, not only to stem the trend, but to reverse it.  Since then &mdash; and I am putting this in as dispassionate a way as possible because this is how we should act in this House &mdash; the unemployment figure has increased by 40,000.  In his budget speech this year the Minister said that unemployment should begin to level out.  That has not happened and it is clear that the figure which is now nearing 230,000 continues to rise.  As an average throughout the year it may be a little lower.</P>
    <P>According to the national plan the unemployment figure for 1985 was to be 215,000.  Last month the figure did fall and I was one of those who welcomed that improvement but I pointed out also that there were reasons for this and that the underlying figure was much higher and in my view would continue to increase.  One of the reasons for the fall is the increasing number of people in training schemes which in effect are building up a kind of deferred unemployment pool.  Another factor is the growth in the number who have given up altogether, the discouraged unemployed, and most obvious, there is the increase in the emigration figures.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks I have put a number of questions to the Taoiseach in that regard.  The replies have been revealing.  At the beginning of this decade there was a net outflow from the country of 2,000 people.  The figure increased later to 7,000 and to 14,000 recently, though I suggest that the real figure is about 25,000.  The effects of that are obvious. We have been losing our best and brightest people and there is cause for anxiety about the number of Irish in Britain who are experiencing extreme difficulty, who are sleeping rough and so on.  Again, the assumptions in the <Col N="221" /> national plan on emigration have been wrong.  The Minister might say the figure is different but it is much higher and therefore I suggest it is wrong.  Likewise, it is possible to say also from the statistics I have given that the figure in the plan for unemployment is quite different from today's figure and that therefore it was wrong also.</P>
    <P>The plan forecast that manufacturing employment would increase but the reality is that, according to the reply to a question I put to the Taoiseach recently, there is 21 per cent unemployment in that sector.  How can we stand over a plan that predicted an increase in the number of employed in manufacturing industry when the opposite is the case?  That is the sector that we were told would create the wealth to keep the economy going. Anybody who has ever devised a plan for this country or for any other can say that the manufacturing area is essential and crucial because that is the main area in which the wealth in generated to allow the services spin off.  The general unemployment level is 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not think any member of the Government can say legitimately that the assumptions in the plan were accurate or that its targets are being met when a central feature is already off line and dangerously so.  It is important to make that point.  According to the Joint Programme for Government the current budget deficit was to be eliminated in 1987.  Later that was amended to 5 per cent.  That was after the National Planning Board got the Government off the hook and suggested this was an acceptable way of doing so.</P>
    <P>I have put it to the Government also that it is essential and central to the credibility of the national plan that the 5 per cent target is met because all of the other policies are built around that 5 per cent. I am trying to consider the plan, to consider what has happened and to rest my case simply on the point that the facts and figures that were laid before the House by the Government have not been achieved and have not come anywhere near to being achieved.  The national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> is in shreds in the sense <Col N="222" /> that all the assumptions and the targets have gone off the rails.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That 5 per cent is central to it.  I have spoken about unemployment, manufacturing industry and the current budget deficit going off the rails and the figures I have given were taken mainly from replies to Dáil questions from the Taoiseach and the Minister.</P>
      <P>In the budget speech the Minister said the figure would be 7.9 per cent in 1985. We know now it will be over 8 per cent &mdash; perhaps 8.3 per cent or 8.4 per cent. The Government should admit that the 5 per cent target is irretrievably lost.  If they do not admit that, will the Minister in this debate affirm that target?  If he does, will he point out where the £800 million needed to achieve that 5 per cent target is going to be found, or is the target going to be abandoned?  They are the central questions I want to put to the Minister, and his response will dictate the future of this plan.</P>
      <P>The national debt stands at £20 billion. I can say without any fear of contradiction that this is the highest percentage of GNP for any industrial country.  To get that down to simple figures it means £17,000 for every employed person.</P>

      <P>I want to discuss the repatriation of profits.  Some time ago the Minister introduced a scheme to allow companies to buy Government securities instead of exporting their profits.  Perhaps he would tell the House sometime how many of these multinationals have bought Government securities and if he has succeeded in stemming the outflow of profits.  It seems to me that this offer has not worked.  So far as I can ascertain, there are still £1 billion of profits made <Col N="223" /> by multinationals being sent back to base and if this scheme had worked that figure might not be so high.  How are we going to stem this pull-out of profits?  I do not think the scheme introduced by the Minister will remedy this situation.  When the scheme was introduced I wished it well but I pointed out that I did not think the multinationals would fall for it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they have a choice of taking their money out of this country or investing it in Government stocks, they will opt for the former.  As the Minister knows, wealth is a mobile commodity. From the figures I ascertain that the amount being sent out of this country is enormous.  I ask the Minister to take further action in this area and to encourage multinationals to invest not just in Government securities but in Irish industry and investments generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister said investment has increased, and I accept that, but the investment was largely in the area of plant and machinery.  The type of investment envisaged by the new industrial policy is in labour intensive industries. To that extent the total increase in investment is not very significant.  There are other indicators which worry me.  The volume of house building activity is 40 per cent below what it was in 1981, the number of Dublin housing starts is 20 per cent below last year's level, cement sales are down by 7 per cent since the start of this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> The National Development Corporation was one such response.  We are told there is £300 million available to invest in Irish industry through that agency.  The reality is that that is £300 million of authorised share capital, not equity, and that sum is to be handed out in lots as small as £1 million.  There is no £300 million available to the National Development Corporation because it is only an authorised figure.  The Government have specifically to approve every investment over £2.5 million and the Minister has to approve every investment over £1 million.  There is no £300 million available. The Bill could have said £800 million, £900 million, even £10 billion, it would not have mattered.</P>

      <P>Authorised share capital is only that, it is not equity capital. When we debate that Bill that is the figure I will be interested in hearing about.</P>
      <P>I want now to deal with the nonsense that we must set up another State company to get in touch with existing semi-State companies, who together will set up a third company and that will provide employment.  Why cannot the existing semi-State companies be given some of this £300 million and let them get on with the job of forming these companies instead of setting up another semi-State agency so that they can have another talking shop, and see if they can create some employment?  Obviously this National Development Corporation was set up for ideological reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial policy generally is over-dependent on foreign industry.  There has been a failure to encourage the kind of linkages we need in the economy and to protect domestic middle sized firms &mdash; like Clarks.  These firms would have been protected if we had had a sensible industrial policy.  I do not need to remind the Government of the increasing pressure on the middle classes &mdash; I think everybody is in the middle class.  Most of these <Col N="225" /> people are piling up debts, bank overdrafts and running from building societies. There was a recent case of a mother who was hauled off to prison because she could not pay a few pounds on a cooker. Is that the kind of society we are trying to run?  This kind of fear and tension is driving people to bouts of depression. The Minister will know exactly what I mean when I say that.</P>
    <P>Recently the Commission said that Ireland had the third lowest living standard in the EC.  Having said that, there are some positive points which I put before this House many times before.  It would be churlish of me not to say that I welcome the Minister's move on PRSI. He will remember that for a long time I have been saying that a sliding PRSI scale or policy which says that the more people employed the less PRSI is paid, is a sensible policy.  I compliment the Minister for making a move in this direction but there is much more which still can be done in that area.</P>
    <P>We can do a lot more in the venture capital area, as I pointed out time and time again.  If we take the bureaucratic shackles off the venture capital scheme I believe it will work.  I want the Minister to put an early warning system into some of our larger companies so that we do not wake up one morning and read on the front pages of our newspapers that another company employing 500 people has gone to the wall.  I want the Minister to concentrate more on small domestic industries, remembering that the United States have largely solved their unemployment problems by the growth of small industries.</P>
    <P>As regards the dockside that was an interesting development.  I wish it well. There is only one solution to this country's economic problems and that is a new philosophy which concentrates not on battening down all the hatches but on creating some kind of movement and wealth and putting on a pedestal the people who run the companies to build the profits which give the employment. That is the road forward and not the one which is being followed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure:</P>
      <P>Review of a Proposal to Introduce a Charge Card System for Civil Servants Travelling on Official Business. </P>
      <P>I thank the House and particularly the Minister for Finance for the opportunity to have a brief discussion on this proposal which can effect some standard of savings and introduce greater efficiencies in certain areas.</P>
      <P>This committee report, circulated to all Members of the House, which is a short one, examined the possibility that the Exchequer might benefit from the introduction of charge card facilities for civil servants travelling on official business. The committee felt that an experimental pilot scheme should be established which would allow civil servants to use charge cards in making payments related to official travel.  The report suggests that the use of such charge cards could improve the Government's cash-flow and could also gain credit of about 60 days in some cases on payments for official travel and related costs.  In this context I should mention that the gross expenditure last year was £21.5 million for travel and £14.5 million for subsistence &mdash; a total of about £36 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also suggests that the use of charge cards would improve employee productivity and morale, that official travel would become more convenient and would involve less security risk and also that the Government's buying power with the travel service and other suppliers would be enhanced because expenditure could be readily monitored and reported and would, <Col N="227" /> therefore, have a greater competitive edge.</P>
    <P>The improvement in employee productivity and morale would concern any member engaged in any evaluation of the public service at the present time.  In view of the difficult economic era there has been an increased degree of scrutiny in relation to public expenditure generally. One of the concerns is that some of this evaluation may result in a diminution of morale and professional pride in a service for which this House has a great degree of respect.  The introduction of a modern innovative purchasing technique which implies by virtue of its being granted to the recipients a certain degree of trust would unquestionably add to the morale and productivity of the people involved and would show civil servants that they are trusted to do their business effectively and efficiently on behalf of the State.  It obviously means that official travel will become more convenient.  Anybody who has gone abroad on official business will be aware of the occasional difficulties which arise caused by the need to make elaborate pre-emptive arrangements and of the difficulties attached to transacting business in foreign currencies and so on. A card which brings the opportunity of doing business in an international language reduces the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Not insignificantly, the reduction and the virtual elimination in some respects of the security risks, which the card would bring with it, is also to be welcomed and would make for greater peace of mind for the bearers of the card.</P>
    <P>The Government's borrowing power is close to the heart of the Minister and those watching public expenditure patterns as they emerge.  The buying power of the public service could be more easily monitored and evaluated by the high tech approach which is adopted in the context of charge and credit cards.  The enhancement of expenditure monitoring would yield significant results.  Easier, more rapid evaluation of where individuals and Departments spend moneys will unquestionably lead to stronger purchasing power.  It is significant that because of its <Col N="228" /> clear accountability factor it would lead to a reduction in mistakes, whether deliberate or otherwise, in the claiming of expenses for travel arrangements.  The card affords an enhanced measure of security in that respect.  The competitive edge is also a valuable one.  Where there is the possibility of block purchasing, of competing in the market place, these things are helped where one has more accessible information at one's fingertips.</P>
    <P>In July 1984 the committee decided to investigate the possibility that the Exchequer might benefit in overall terms from the introduction of charge card facilities for civil servants travelling on business. At this stage it is no harm to distinguish between the concept of a credit card and a charge card.  The main difference seems to be that a charge card account has to be settled in full approximately every 30 days, whereas with a credit card account it is possible to get something like twice that length of credit free of charge depending on the time of the month at which the charge is incurred.  A charge card is normally a method of deferred payment which is targeted at the business traveller who is not looking for credit as such.  In terms of cash flow and creditability there may be potential for evaluating and possibly implementing a system for charge/credit cards.</P>
    <P>The committee heard evidence from Diners Club International, to whom I on behalf of the committee extend gratitude for their great willingness to talk to us without any strings attached to help us to develop this report.  They acted in a selfless and civic-minded manner for which we thank them.  The resultant paper is to the benefit of all.  The Diners Club International at our request made a detailed submission and the views of the Department of Finance were then obtained on the feasibility and possible cost benefit to the Exchequer of the introduction of a charge card system.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the committee's inquiry were to examine the procedures used within the public service in the payment of charges for travel and subsistence, to compare them with the alternative system proposed by Diners <Col N="229" /> Club and to consider whether better value for money could be obtained from that or some other system.</P>
    <P>I hope that the House and the Minister for Finance will embrace the committee's fairly moderate conclusion that a pilot scheme should be established for the introduction of a charge card system.  In arriving at this conclusion we were mindful of the fact that charge cards are used widely in the private sector and by certain semi-State sponsored bodies where they do not cause any difficulty and where they add to the ease, flexibility and accountability of the organisations which use them.  In addition, the operation of the charge card service in the US Federal Government has proved to be successful and the most recent reports on that indicate that that experiment has been very successful and that it is proposed to extend it.  Therefore, the committee are conscious of the need for innovation and experimentation within the public sector and we understand that a pilot scheme or, indeed, a service-wide scheme could be introduced by the charge card companies operating in Ireland and that if approached in the right way they might do this free of charge.  Our recommendations suggest that the pilot scheme at least should be carried out free of charge if at all possible and that it would not involve any net increase in cost to the Exchequer.  We believe that is in the interests not just of the Exchequer in this case but of the credit/charge card companies who, one would hope, would justifiably also generate extra business and extra advantage from the activity.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are fully aware that there will be occasions when charge cards cannot be used.  This has been the experience in the US, and this is overcome by maintaining a more modest system of cash advances in cases where cards would not be appropriate.  However, with the increasing scope first of all in terms of range and comprehension of card services throughout the world, and secondly by the increasing variation in terms of flexibility and versatility which the charge card companies have now introduced, there are relatively few cases where it <Col N="230" /> would be necessary to continue with the cash advance system.  Therefore in the circumstances my committee have no hesitation in recommending that a pilot scheme should be introduced following detailed investigation by the Minister for Finance of the merits of the scheme on the understanding that there would be no net increased costs to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We are confident that the proposal, which I submit is modest, would have advantages not just for the Exchequer but also for the individual Departments and individual users of the charge card system in terms of self-image, flexibility, versatility, and efficiency, not to mention the significant savings which we believe will arise from the introduction of the scheme eventually.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by restating my gratitude to Diners Club International and Mr. Brian Murphy particularly and to the other card companies who have offered whatever assistance and advice they can to help us to progress the system.  I express my gratitude to the Minister for Finance who has at all times &mdash; I am not saying this merely because he is in the House but because it is true &mdash; expressed a particular degree of sympathy towards the aims and aspirations of the committee and has taken a close personal interest in our work which we have found heartening and encouraging.  Accordingly, I commend this modest report to the House and to the Minister and await with interest his reaction to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee recommend that we introduce a pilot scheme in an appropriate Department for a limited time on the condition that there would be no increased net cost to the Exchequer.  I will comment on that proposal in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, if I may without disrepect to the committee or chairman, to observe that the remarks that he made just now about the effects of a charge card system of this kind on the morale of the Civil Service are not remarks that can be attributed to the committee but rather to one group who made a submission to the committee.  I would also like to make the <Col N="231" /> point that my Department, indeed at my instigation, were quite keen to ensure that we provided whatever information and analysis we could on it, and we identified as part of that the areas of expenditure which might be amenable to the use of charge cards.  In relation to 1984 they are the following: an expenditure of about £900,000 by the Civil Service on foreign travel and about £4.5 million on domestic travel which is largely composed of expenditure on petrol.  To the extent that the chairman of the committee, Deputy Keating, is making the case in relation to foreign travel I must point out that it is a rather small proportion of the total amount of travel and subsistence expenditure in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The recommendation itself should be put in the context of the existing methods of dealing with travel and subsistence costs.  Both travel and subsistence allowances for domestic and foreign travel in the Civil Service are determined within the conciliation and arbitration framework. The subsistence allowance combines both actual and overhead costs and is expressed as a <i>per diem</i> rate which is varied from time to time in line with the development of travel costs generally. There is an advantage in that in terms of the simplicity of supervision of travel costs by those charged with responsibility for the accounts branches in Departments and, while there may be different views about their level, the system we have in operation at the moment is easily controllable and its results are fairly transparent for those who must make sure that it works as it is intended to work.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the charge card system would reduce the need for cash holdings by individuals who are travelling and the Exchequer might also benefit from the reduced demand for imprests; imprests being to the layman the indent that an officer makes before he travels in order to be funded.  In my Department's submission to the committee we estimated tentatively the savings on the cost of funds at about £100,000 and that was largely a kind of cash flow saving that we <Col N="232" /> identified there.  With interest rates now considerably below the level they were at when that submission was made, I would think that the saving could be considerably smaller than that.  Of course there would be certain costs.  While the chairman of the commitee has indicated that it might be possible to run a pilot scheme without charge &mdash; that is free of charge by one of the companies &mdash; I am not giving any hostage to fortune in saying that.  I hardly think it realistic to expect that that would always be the case.  Some costs would be involved which could take a variety of forms.</P>
    <P>There would also be some difficulty, particularly as regards domestic travel and subsistence.  The case is now, and I do not know how long it will be the case, that there would be some restriction on the number of outlets in which charge cards could be used, so that the gain in convenience in terms of domestic travel for the officials involved might not be all that significant.  Some administrative costs would be involved also because, to the extent that one is running two systems in parallel, an extra administration cost is involved, and to the extent that one was running a charge card system with the current C and A determined system of travel and subsistence allowances, one would have to be matched against the other in any case to make sure that the criteria of the travel and subsistence allowance scheme were being adhered to.  Therefore, I see some difficulties in it from that point of view.</P>
    <P>One company made a submission to the committee and other companies have made submissions to my Department which we have looked at.  I think I am right in saying that the Department of Finance is the only Department in the Civil Service that has an experience of charge cards because, as far as I know, it is the only one where we have any number of official charge cards.  They are used by a small number of officials who have to travel abroad frequently in the course of their duties and I am bound to say, although I am sure that the gentlemen in question are people who like convenience when travelling, that they do <Col N="233" /> not appear to have made a great deal of use of the cards for a variety of different reasons not the least of which is the fact that they are travelling on fairly well worn tracks and other arrangements have been made to cover the expenditures involved.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind on the subject to put it at its most general.  There would be a difficulty in relation to the integration or the simultaneous running of the system with the travel and subsistence allowances system that exists under the C and A machinery and I am not quite sure that there would be any very substantial or noticeable gain in convenience to officials on the one hand to set against some possible administrative difficulties on the other hand.</P>
    <P>If I may return to the morale question for a moment, I am not 100 per cent convinced by the arguments that the system of charge cards would have a noticeable effect on morale.  I do not think it is a matter of trust or anything of that kind.  Indeed, I should like to make the point that at one time I had an official credit card that was made available to me by my employer.  When I left the employ of that organisation I felt, having used the card quite a bit during my period of employment, that it would not be a bad idea to have one on my own account.  As happens in many such cases, I did not do anything about the matter for a while until one day I received a letter of offer from a company that said that I had been picked out of a fairly select group of people in a particular income bracket and that they would be very happy to have me as one of their card holders.  Of course, that galvanised me into action again and I said, &ldquo;That is a good idea; I was intending to do that anyway.&rdquo;  I filled in the form, sent it off and waited for my card to arrive.  The next thing that arrived a couple of weeks later was another long and polite letter from the company which said how happy the company were that I had applied to become a card member and asked for my permission, and a date to be fixed, to send an investigator to have a chat with me.  That incensed me no end and I wrote back a very rude letter to the company saying that they <Col N="234" /> had picked me, that I had not gone out looking for them and I was not particularly impressed that after they had picked me on the basis of having access to certain confidential information about me they also wanted to send an investigator as well.  The moral of the story was that I did not go ahead with that on the basis of that experience.</P>
    <P>I am not saying at all that any company would wish to send me a letter now and ask my permission to send an investigator around to the Department of Finance because the probity and rectitude of the Department of Finance, as we heard a few moments ago from the benches opposite, is without question.  I will take up the suggestion made by the committee in the spirit in which it is offered.  The best response I can make to it is to say that we will monitor the use of the official charge cards that exist in my Department to see whether in that framework any expansion of their use would prove to be of value.  We will have to measure the results of that against the system that exists for the handling of travel and subsistence allowances for officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading between the lines my impression is that the Minister's mind is not closed to the possibility of looking at the existing charge cards that are used in his Department and, possibly, extending that system.  I would be grateful if the Minister would contradict me if I am wrong.  I do not know how many such cards there are, or whether the number of cards could be said to constitute a sub-system or not.  On the question of morale, I should like to state that none of us is carrying a big flag on that but, regardless of whether it is perceptible or not, it is a reasonable argument and one that has carried weight in the experience of those semi-State agencies here where such cards have been employed.  I do not see any reason why it would not have some degree of impact in the same respect for people in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal argument we are making is that it may well affect a saving.  I do not think it is that important whether the <Col N="235" /> saving is a big or a small one.  All these terms are relative.  Even the inevitably cautious reply from the Department of Finance to our initial promotings indicated that there could be a saving.  I have no doubt with the relatively strapped position of public finances that any saving should be welcomed and that if somebody is willing to say, &ldquo;Give us 12 months in a fairly closely monitored area of activity and we will try to bring about a saving for you&rdquo;, that the offer will be taken up and embraced readily in the hope that the target might be overshot.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the rates for subsistence and travel but, obviously, that is not something we have any view or comment to make on.  That is totally outside our jurisdiction and is a matter for the Minister and the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  It is not something that our report touches on or something we wish to get involved in.  The basic question is the kind of possible savings. Ultimately the reason charge cards and credit cards are becoming more widespread is that areas of the private sector see an advantage in them.  I have not adequate experience in that commercial sector to know what those advantages are.  I suspect that there are large areas of the public service where such a system would not necessarily be the most appropriate.</P>
    <P>I can equally conclude that there must be significant areas of the public service where it would be administratively relatively easy and unquestionably would effect a saving.  If charge cards were not working in the private sector we would not be having this discussion.  They work because they bring about perceptible advantages.  Some of those advantages will undoubtedly accrue in this case if it is given an opportunity.  I am sure all Members sympathise with the Minister's bad personal experience related to his initial application and I am mystified as to what might have prompted the scenario of the charge card company sending an investigator to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is any consolation to the Minister I should like to tell him that a colleague of mine had a similar experience.  It turned out that many years ago he had undertaken to take out a subscription to <i>Time</i> magazine and had not paid his dues.  I am not suggesting for a moment that anything of such an untoward nature occurred in the Minister's case.  I do not know if the card companies will take up the Minister's invitation to send him a letter now because I suspect that the outcome would not be so much that the card company would ask to send an investigator but they might fear that the Minister might send an investigator from the Revenue Commissioners if they were in anyway difficult about it.</P>
      <P>The individuals in the card companies with whom the committee and I have had discussions are at the service of the Department.  I hope dialogue will ensue and the Minister in his wisdom in due course might come to a judgment which will ensure that the system in his Department in a small way will be extended wherever possible so that any opportunities might be availed of.  It works in the semi-State companies and in the American Government.  It could work here. What is being said is that a company or companies will sit down with the officials to work out a closely monitored system for a period of time.  Administrative costs can be a subject for discussion and negotiation. Certainly, there is bound to be some degree of overlap if two systems are running parallel.  Ultimately, there may be benefit in it and we proffer that suggestion in that constructive spirit to the House for further consideration.  We are heartened by the fact that the Minister has kept both his mind and the door open to the possibility of development in that respect.</P>

      <P>The decline in the proportion of total exports which is represented by the agriculture based products reflects the development of the industrial side of the national economy rather than any fall in agricultural based exports as such.  In fact, the value of agricultural based exports rose from £1,177 million in 1981 to £1,629 million in 1984, an increase of 38.4 per cent while in volume terms they rose by approximately 12.5 per cent in the same period.  In addition, receipts from the FEOGA guarantee section, which are largely dependent on the level of agricultural exports, increased from £305 million in 1981 to £648 million in 1984.  The Government policy of encouraging and assisting the expansion of agricultural production as well as achieving a higher level of added value in the food processing industry will further stimulate total receipts from agricultural exports.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture in view of the huge increase in the export of hay and other fodder to Northern Ireland, the measures his Department are taking to ensure that those involved in these exports do not benefit, either directly or indirectly, from the schemes introduced to assist farmers hit by this summer's bad weather.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together.  The schemes which I have introduced to alleviate the problems caused by adverse weather conditions this year are designed to assist those farmers whose fodder situation has been most seriously affected.  Only farmers who have less than 75 per cent of their livestock feed requirements qualify for aid under these schemes.  Also, the schemes are restricted to those farmers whose main occupation is farming, who have not more than 60 livestock units and who have limited off-farm income.  Applications for aid are assessed by the local officers of the farm development service of my Department and they have been instructed to ensure that farmers who sold off fodder do not abuse the schemes. With regard to farmers who have excess supplies of fodder, the only action open to my Department is to exclude such farmers from assistance under the fodder aid schemes, and that is being done.</P>

It is not possible at this stage to indicate what measures can be provided to encourage the production of high quality fodder but I am very conscious of the need to stimulate the making of silage on a wider scale, particularly in the western region.</P>

      <P>The available statistics relate only to fatal farm accidents and these do not show any significant change in recent years. However, this does not mean that every effort should not be made to prevent such accidents.  It has long been the policy to promote farm safety through educational, advisory and publicity measures. These activities are now directly implemented by ACOT which emphasises the safety aspect in their courses at <Col N="45" /> agricultural schools and colleges and in their advisory work on the farm.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the serious disease situation in a number of areas of County Galway, my Department's veterinary officers have been giving particular attention to the difficulties encountered there in recent months.  This attention has taken the form of ongoing intensive testing in the problem areas, specialist advice to herdowners and active investigation of the role of wildlife.  There have been signs of improvement recently in the disease situation in County Galway and it is hoped that further progress can be achieved through intensive testing and continuing co-operation and involvement by farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of omitting salary scales in advertisements placed by the Local Appointments Commission was adopted by the commissioners in an effort to control expenditure on advertising.  The majority of vacancies being advertised are similar posts under the various local authorities or health boards; the approximate level of salary is known to the people who are interested; candidatures are satisfactory and full details of the salary scale are given in the documentation issued to intending applicants.</P>
      <P>Where the post being advertised is a new type of one or where the status of the post may not be clear it is the practice to quote the minimum and maximum points of the salary scale.  Employing authorities are satisfied with these arrangements.  A similar practice operates in relation to advertisements placed by the Civil Service Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As with other types of insurance cover, increase in premium rates for motor cycle insurance reflect the continuing and substantial level of losses incurred by insurers providing this particular insurance.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that insurers only provide third party cover for motor cycle risks, since comprehensive cover is also available.  However, even in the case of a policy restricted to third party cover this does not of itself limit claims, because, under road traffic law, the cover granted for personal injuries must be unlimited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that we should accurately evaluate the cost of creating a job in manufacturing industry and I am happy to inform him that my Department, in consultation with the management committee on industrial policy, are drawing up a uniform basis for computing cost per job, which, I expect, will be agreed within the next six weeks.  When drawing up cost per job figures care must be taken to define what precisely is being measured.  A number of first time jobs created in any year arise from grant payments in previous years. Similarly grant payments made in any one year will give rise to new first time jobs in succeeding years.</P>
      <P>It might not be prudent to pre-determine a cost per direct job above which one would not go in supporting a project. There is another factor, namely, the indirect employment associated with the project, arising from the further investment of the value added generated by the sourcing of raw material requirements in Ireland, which must be taken into account.  Every effort must, of course, also be made to quantify such indirect jobs although the figures will be somewhat more difficult to determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall targets set for job creation in the White Paper on Industrial Policy is the growth of manufacturing employment of between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs per year.  This is a very ambitious target in the light of past trends here and in other countries.  All Government agencies concerned with manufacturing, whether in the investment, export or technical support areas, are being required to use their resources in such a way as to jointly assure the achievement <Col N="54" /> of these targets over the ten year period of application of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>The franchise system is of particular significance in the retail sector, where we have seen in recent years a substantial growth in the number of new outlets being operated under franchise.  Save for compliance, as appropriate, with planning legislation etc., there are no restrictions on the development of this system of trading and I do not consider that there is any need to devise an action programme to encourage it.  Of course where such a system could be used in the promotion of exports of goods or services it will be actively supported.  Any suggestion the Deputy wishes to make in this regard will be carefully studied.</P>
      <P>In so far as manufacturing is concerned, the Industrial Development Authority are actively promoting the use of joint ventures, licensing and technology acquisition among Irish manufacturing firms as a means of developing their business.  The upgrading of the teachnical expertise of domestic companies is a key objective of the White Paper on Industrial Policy, published in July 1984.</P>
      <P>In 1984 the IDA intensified their strategy of using their network of overseas offices to work with Irish firms seeking licences and joint ventures.  Recent progress in this area was set out in my reply to a question by the Deputy relating to technology acquisition grants on 31 October 1985.</P>

      <P>The block grant allocations to individual local authorities for 1986 will be determined following the settlement of the budgetary provision for road grants for 1986.  Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of improvement works on county roads rests with the local authorities.  The expenditure involved falls to be financed by the <Col N="67" /> local authorities from their own resources which may be supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department.  The block grant may also be used, in the case of county councils, for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The disposition of the block grant, including the extent, if any, to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is a matter entirely for each local authority.</P>
      <P>This year, the block grant allocation to local authorities was increased by 10 per cent compared with 1984.  Earlier this year, I announced that a grant of up to 75 per cent of the cost will be paid towards the cost of approved improvement works on the more important county road bridges, with a view to the preservation of the county road network.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that for the current year, 1985-86, the taxpayer and her husband are assessable to income tax on their combined incomes under the provisions of section 194 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. The figure of £17.04 mentioned in the question is the aggregate weekly amount <Col N="79" /> for the current year of the PAYE allowance (£600) and the PRSI allowance (£286).

      <P>The person concerned submitted a claim for a retirement pension on 23 October 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of this pension requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 188 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.  This is equal to a yearly average of only five and he does not, therefore, qualify for a retirement pension.  Neither will he qualify for an old age contributory pension at age 66; a yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.  Depending on his means, he may qualify for an old age non-contributory pension when he reaches age 66 on 24 October 1986.

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable in place of disability benefit to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 October 1980.  He is not qualified for benefit as regulations provide that where a claimant has no contributions paid or credited for any two consecutive contribution years preceding his claim, he cannot qualify for payment of disability benefit, or the award of credited contributions in respect of periods of incapacity for work, until he has a further 26 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned had less than 156 contributions paid.  He also has no contributions paid or credited in the years 1972 and 1973 and has not had 26 weeks of insurable imployment since then. Accordingly, he cannot be considered for disability benefit, invalidity pension or for the award of credited contributions in respect of unemployment or incapacity for work.</P>
      <P>He is presently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the South Eastern Health Board at the weekly rate of £31.80.</P>

      <P>The appeal of the person concerned against the means of £29.15 assessed against him was submitted to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer considered that he had sufficient information to decide the case without an oral hearing and on 15 January 1985 also assessed the applicant with means of £29.15 weekly derived from the profit from his holding.  He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £47.80 weekly being the appropriate rate in his case of £76.95, less means of £29.15.  Under new arrangements introduced some months ago it is open to the person concerned to reapply for an oral hearing.  In view of the length of time which has expired since the last review it will first be necessary to have his means reinvestigated.  If he wishes to pursue this course of action a form for this purpose can be obtained at his local employment office.  In the meantime, weekly payments will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

His application, which was received on 24 October 1984 was therefore rejected and he was notified accordingly on 28 January 1985.  A fresh application form was issued to him in August 1985 in response to representations from the Deputy.  If the applicant's circumstances have changed he should complete this form and return it to the Department.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 3 September 1985 but following the completion of inquiries her claim was disallowed on the grounds that as she was not genuinely seeking work, she was not available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing on 6 November 1985 but the appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment.

Payment was disallowed from 7 March 1983 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed <Col N="103" /> the opinion that she was capable of work. The decision to disallow payment was upheld by an appeals officer who decided that she was capable of work from 7 March 1983 to 12 August 1983.  She submitted further medical evidence beyond 12 August 1983 in respect of the same incapacity and her claims for the periods from 13 August 1983 to 1 October 1985 were also disallowed.

      <P>The national plan <i>Building on Reality 1984-1987</i> outlines at paragraph 7.85 the priorities in regard to additional provision in the third level sector.  These do not include the provision of a regional technical college in Monaghan and no such proposal has been made to my Department.  In this connection it should be noted that the regional technical colleges were established to serve designated regions, each region comprising a number of counties or parts thereof. County Monaghan is served by Dundalk Regional Technical College.  There would not appear to be a substantiated case for a regional technical college in Monaghan.</P>
