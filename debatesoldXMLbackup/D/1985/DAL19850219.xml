    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any firm arrangement have been made with regard to the date, venue and agenda of his next meeting with the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach <Col N="2" /> wish to comment on persistent and apparently authentic newspaper reports to the effect that the next meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister will not take place before the summer of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of commenting on such reports.  The only thing I can do is to reiterate what was said at the time of the last meeting, that there would be a further meeting between us in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall he told the Dáil on 20 November <Col N="3" /> that a further meeting would take place between himself and the British Prime Minister &mdash; he attached great importance to this fact &mdash; early in the new year.  Does he wish to comment on the fact that that statement has already been proved to be untrue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would simply say it has not been proved to be untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us now that the meeting is likely to take place within the next few months? Nobody in the House would ask for the time, date and so on because of security reasons but surely the Taoiseach can tell us if these persistent reports that the meeting will not now take place before the summer and after the local elections in Northern Ireland are true of false?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting will take place in the next few months.  I do not understand the sources that suggested the postponement of the meeting.  That is not the case.  No date had been fixed and there is no question of postponement. The meeting will take place in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not obvious to all that the statement that the meeting would take place early in the new year can no longer be complied with and that to that extent the Taoiseach misled the House and the public?  Will he not be honest enough and man enough to admit that this meeting will not take place before the local elections in Northern Ireland and that these much vaunted talks between himself and the British Prime Minister are going nowhere?</P>

He made a great fuss of the fact that a meeting would be held early in the year between himself and the British Prime Minister.  That is not now going to happen.

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his recent discussions with the vice-President of Nicaragua, Senor Ramirez.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me, nor is it the established practice, to disclose publicly details of confidential discussions of this nature. Senor Ramirez's visit here was part of a tour of west European countries and, as the Deputy will appreciate, my discussions with him concentrated on the current crisis and prospects in the Central America region including the situation in his own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned with the damage being done to the political and economic system in Nicaragua because of the United States-backed Contra campaign?  Has he any plans to raise that at the highest level with the United States authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not belong to the same party and perhaps I may be permitted to ask a question.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the vice-President of Nicaragua made the same point to him as he <Col N="6" /> made to me, namely, that all the Nicaraguans were seeking at this stage was a resumption of talks between themselves and the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the question of what was discussed in detail but it is well known that the Nicaraguan Government are anxious to have a resumption of those talks and they are also concerned that the Contadora process should proceed.  It is our position, with the other members of the Ten, that we favour the continuation of the Contadora process which we support strongly. We hope that the meeting that failed to take place in the past few days can be organised as soon as possible for a constructive discussion of the issues raised in the Contadora act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw it, but I cannot understand how the same question could be allowed.  Has the Taoiseach any plans at present to open up diplomatic relations with not only Nicaragua but the whole Central American region, even at consular level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain countries we have honorary consuls, but there are no plans for diplomatic relations with the countries in question.  There are financial constraints and limitations on the range <Col N="7" /> of diplomatic relations that we can organise. We are not at present contemplating a move of that kind which would be costly in relation to that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider the position in relation to diplomatic relations since relations at consular level would not be too expensive for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make a distinction. There is consular representation, which does not constitute formal diplomatic relations.  We have honorary consuls in various areas, and that is open to consideration.  The question of our honorary consular representation is under active review at present, not particularly in that part of the world but generally. No doubt that review covers Central America, but I have no details of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The party which visited Nicaragua recently brought out a report containing certain recommendations. Has the Taoiseach any plans to pursue these recommendations with our partners within the EC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How that question arises out of the question on the Order Paper is not clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Taoiseach discussed matters such as these with Senor Ramirez when he was in Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the unavailability of statistics for emigration in 1983 and 1984 and in view of the Government's inability to <Col N="8" /> identify present trends in emigration, he will initiate an investigation into emigration patterns since the last census with the assistance of second and third level colleges, foreign embassies and Irish associations particularly in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give special responsibility to a Minister of Government or a Minister of State to consider all aspects of the alarming increase in emigration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  I do not accept that there has been an alarming increase in emigration.  The evidence from the CSO is that their best estimate of net emigration in the period April 1981 to April 1984 is an average of 6,000 a year, and their best estimate suggests that net emigration in the year to April 1984 was less than in the year to April 1983.</P>
      <P>The most recent information available from the school leavers survey and the Higher Education Authority's report does not suggest a high level of emigration. For example, it is estimated that, of over 62,000 school leavers in 1983, only 1,500 had emigrated in the following year.  Fewer than 500 primary degree recipients in the same year and about 250 other third level award recipients are estimated to have left &mdash; many of them for further study or training.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's contention that emigration has commenced at a substantial rate does not receive any support from these data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach honestly believe the figure he has just read out, of 6,000 people per year emigrating from the country at present, in the light of all the experience and all the estimates coming from very worthwhile sources? Let me quote two such sources to him. One is the figure given by the Irish Association in England in &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; during the week of 30,000 people and the second is <i>The Irish Times</i> today which contains a very good article emanating, I believe, from the American <Col N="9" /> Embassy indicating that 55,000 holiday visas were given out last year and the estimate of the people in the embassy is that 5,000 of those are remaining in the US in an illegal capacity.  In view of those facts will the Taoiseach stop giving us this statistic which he had given to the House already on 22 January?  It is totally inaccurate, and I put it to him that there is now a very serious problem with regard to the number of people &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should confine himself to asking questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's conclusion.  I accept that the best estimate of net emigration furnished by the CSO is subject to a margin of uncertainty and is based on data which are necessarily incomplete and is only a kind of census so that we can get an accurate assessment of the inter-censual emigration.  A problem exists in assessing that and it is necessary perhaps to look to other information.  The best information we have, which is the most solid, is the figures from the sampling of school leavers and the HEA's report which gives us a picture of the number of people emigrating in the year after completing their education.  These figures show a low proportion involved, in the case of school leavers 1,500 out of 62,000.  Also the CSO tell me that the numbers contacting various Irish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that the labour survey I am talking about and the statistics of the HEA are a laugh makes a laugh of the Opposition.  At least they are reasonably solid data, not speculative in character.  The only other information I can add is that the CSO tell me that the numbers contacting Irish societies and Irish centres in Britain are quite small <Col N="10" /> and, in so far as they exist, are a very inadequate basis for measuring emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach or any member of Government been in contact with the embassies &mdash; US, Canadian, Australian or British &mdash; to ascertain the veracity of what Deputy Fahey has confirmed?  I have the same information directly from those embassies. Secondly, has the Taoiseach been directly in contact with, for instance, the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain who will confirm to him that the figures he has trotted out here from the HEA or whatever are just a laugh, as I said?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that the people in Britain who are dealing with this and trying to cope with it are so alarmed that they are seeking a discussion with him and probably with the Opposition to see how we can provide for the welfare of young people?  In the light of those facts would the Taoiseach not acknowledge that Government have a special responsibility to young people?  In the light of those facts, will he not consider giving that special responsibility to some member of Government to ensure that those who are forced by the policies of this Government to go are at least properly prepared and advised in advance?  At this point they are not.  If the Taoiseach wants to ignore those facts he can do so, but they are facts.</P>

      <P>We must confront not this issue being put forward by the Opposition but the fact that there are not opportunities for emigration.  People are not emigrating and we must try to cope with this problem at home.  It is here in the form of unemployment.  That is the issue, and to try to turn it into emigration to evade the issue of domestic unemployment is very foolish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy once more and regrettably is displaying his ignorance. If he had read <i>Building on Reality</i> he would know that the estimates on <Col N="12" /> unemployment are based on one of two sets of alternative projections by demographic experts in respect of emigration, that the lower estimate of emigration was chosen and is the basis of that report, an estimate which involves in the next two years a net emigration rate of 5,000 per annum.  That may turn out to be right or otherwise but it is the basis on which the plan was prepared.  It does not require, provide for or include in any form a high level of emigration as the Deputy would know if he had bothered to read the report rather than making a fool of himself here.</P>

      <P>That is the one piece of information we have from that source about school leavers.  It is based on a sampling technique which is reasonable and appropriate to give an accurate result with a certain limited margin of error. The other information we have and which is practical is the Higher Education Authority Report which gives specific figures for the numbers who have left.  There is no point in the Deputy producing a mythical figure of an emigration rate of 30,000.  That simply shows a degree of ignorance and irresponsibility which is inappropriate.</P>

I have said very carefully that the best estimate for the past three years is 6,000 per year.  The method by which the figure has to be arrived at is a method which is uncertain and unsatisfactory and I would not place undue reliance on it.  The better figures are those we can get from specific surveys such as the school leavers survey and the Higher Education Authority Report.</P>

      <P>The relevance to emigration is slightly remote but let us consider the facts.  The estimate in <i>Building on Reality</i> for the level of unemployment at the end of 1984 was 220,000, seasonally adjusted.  The actual figure was 221,000 seasonally adjusted.  The Deputy should not try to fool the House or the people by producing figures that are not comparable with each other, by producing figures that are not seasonally adjusted and comparing them with figures that are seasonally adjusted.  His tongue-in-cheek approach of trying to fool people will not get him anywhere.  As I have said, the future projections of unemployment are based on the projections for employment set out in the plan and on the low figure of the alternative figures offered by the demographic experts.  They involve net emigration of 5,000 in the next two years.</P>

      <P>I would be happy to clarify the position for the Deputy.  The Minister of State at my Department, in answer to a question from the legislative committee, said then that the frequency spectrum technically could carry about 30 stations of different orders of magnitude. A misunderstanding got abroad from that that what the Minister of State said was that there would be 30 stations. Subsequently, in order to clarify the position I said that while the frequency spectrum could carry up to 30 stations, if we went by the IBA standards in Britain the figure would be rather less.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that he is not in a position to include this in the 1985 Estimate because the legislation has not been passed by the Dáil and I accept that.  Would this require a Supplementary Estimate for his <Col N="20" /> Department and will he indicate if he has made some estimates?  He has studied the matter for the last two and a half years and I feel sure that his advisers and his Department have advised him of the estimated cost to the Department of setting up stations or organising the Independent Local Radio Authority.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to locate the Independent Local Radio Authority in Cork.  This is naturally welcomed by the Cork Deputies, but is a very small replacement for Ford's, Dunlop's and the other major factories which have been closed.  Nevertheless since it will be located in Cork, would the Minister not think it appropriate, in view of the urgency of the legislation, that his Department could be in a position to have earmarked suitable premises for leasing or purchasing when the time comes?</P>

That is not to say that that will not take place &mdash; my guess is as good as anybody else's in this case.  I imagine that we are likely to have different types of radio stations, some very local indeed and perhaps others more widespread.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a number of pirate stations in operation which are completely community stations, in that they are run by community interests and not for profit.  There are other stations which are only profit-orientated. I cannot be precise and cannot anticipate how this will develop.  I imagine it likely that we will have some sort of two-tier system.</P>

      <P>The 1985 bovine TB eradication programme commenced yesterday with the issue of test listings to those veterinary surgeons who have agreed to participate in the scheme on the terms and conditions laid down by the Government in the context of the national plan.  These arrangements have the full backing of the major farming organisations.  The executive of the Irish Veterinary Union, however, have decided to reject the arrangements and I understand that they are currently balloting their members on this decision.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that in agreeing in the present difficult financial situation to provide substantial extra funds for disease eradication the Government demonstrated their commitment to getting rid of bovine TB once and for all. However, they are not prepared to continue with the testing arrangements which have failed to achieve any progress in recent years and so in the interests of taxpayers generally and of farmers, who bear much of the burden of the disease, they have decided that the provision of extra funds should be subject to certain conditions which will give me more effective control over the operation of the eradication measures.</P>
      <P>There is more than enough testing work available and I invite all veterinary surgeons to participate in this important national effort.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill arises from a specific situation that has arisen and which has such serious implications for the maintenance of public order here that the Government have no option but to move with speed and decisiveness to deal with it.  Information has been conveyed to me by the Garda authorities that a large sum of money which is the proceeds of criminal activity by the IRA &mdash; specifically extortion under threat of kidnap and murder &mdash; has found its way into a bank in this country and is being held to the use of and for the purposes of the IRA.  In recent days it became apparent that those who are the custodians of this money would find it necessary to make a very early move to transfer it.  This necessitated urgent action by the Government to prevent the money becoming available to the IRA to fund its campaign of murder and destruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act, 1939, contains provisions which declare the property of unlawful organisations to <Col N="132" /> be forfeited to and vested in the Minister for Justice but those provisions of that Act do not contain a sufficiently precise formula or mechanism by which the Minister can seize the property while at the same time giving anybody who may claim to be the legitimate and <i>bona fide</i> owners of it the right to have their claims determined by the courts.  For this reason, the Government have decided to ask the Oireachtas for new powers &mdash; powers which will not only provide a mechanism for dealing with the instant case but which will also establish a framework for dealing with any future cases of this nature that may arise.  Hence, this Bill, amending and extending the Offences Against the State Acts, is now before this House.</P>
    <P>In bringing the Bill before the House I am, as I hope the House will appreciate, necessarily constrained by security considerations from outlining to the House the full extent of the information supplied to me and to the Government.  However, I believe it is both possible and necessary to give the House an indication of the nature of the evidence.</P>
    <P>The sum of money involved is, as I have said, a large one.  There are cogent reasons why I should not be specific or give even an approximate figure but, to give some idea of what I am talking about, I will say that we are speaking in terms of a seven-figure sum and I would not want anybody to infer from that that I mean the smallest possible seven-figure sum.  It has already been moved across international frontiers and may, to an extent at least, have been &ldquo;laundered&rdquo;&mdash; to use a modern colloquial expression. Members at this point may legitimately wonder how firm is the basis for what I have said.  The answer may be deduced from the following.  The Garda Síochána received information of a very definite and specific character regarding the handing over, outside this jurisdiction and by people not resident within this jurisdiction, of a very large sum under pressure of Provisional IRA threats with &ldquo;kidnap-related&rdquo; background.  The details covered the movements of the moneys from one foreign bank account <Col N="133" /> to another and into the Irish banking system.</P>
    <P>All the details, no matter how reliable the sources the Garda Síochána might have, would be taken with a due degree of caution.  What seems to put the matter beyond any reasonable doubt is that, at a particular point in that series of transactions the Garda Síochána obtained independent evidence that confirmed the accuracy, at that point, of what had been disclosed.  That independent evidence is, at least in part, available to the Garda Síochána in documentary form because legal proceedings were taken by a public authority in one foreign country in relation to certain aspects of the banking transactions in that country.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear to the House that I asked the Garda Síochána whether there was any possibility that the sources from which they received the details to which I first referred might have learned of those details from some foreign banking contacts or whether there was any other way whatsoever in which what I might call the two streams of information could have had a common source and were therefore not truly independent.  I have been assured that no such possibility exists &mdash; that the Garda Síochána are aware of the precise nature of the contacts that made it possible for the initial information to be given to them and that the confirmation, in the sense in which I have used that term, is independent.  On the information available to me, and given the assurances received from the Garda Síochána about the independent nature of the confirmation, it seems to me that the matter must be taken to be beyond any reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to everyone that, if this money were to be used for IRA purposes, the consequences for human life on this island would be grave.  I do not need to spell out what it would mean.  In these circumstances, the Government and, I submit, the Oireachtas, have a clear moral duty in the interest of the common good to intervene to stop this from happening. I believe it can be argued that there is also a legal duty to do so deriving <Col N="134" /> from the Constitution itself.  The Constitution, as the House is well aware, places on the State an obligation to safeguard the rights of all its citizens, to respect them and to defend and vindicate their personal rights whenever they are threatened. I do not need to lecture this House on the evils of the IRA.  I will simply recall &mdash; because it is important in the context of this Bill that I should do so &mdash; that since the IRA compaign began again in this country in the 1969-70 period thousands of people have been murdered and maimed on this island.  In this part of the country 12 members of the security forces &mdash; Garda and Army &mdash; have been murdered in the past 14 years.  Millions of pounds have been taken in armed robberies. And, on top of all that, the tragic position of the people of Northern Ireland has become worse.</P>
    <P>We now have to deal with the unusual and difficult problem of these funds.  It is one for which a solution has not been easy to find.  Although the 1939 Act clearly provides that the consequential effects of the Government making a suppression order against an unlawful organisation includes depriving them of property held by them, as I have said, the Act does not provide a clear mechanism whereby the Minister can take over property which becomes forfeited when the organisation is declared to be unlawful.  There is provision in section 22 which authorises the Minister to take all necessary steps, including the initiation of legal proceedings, to get the property into his possession but, apart from the fact that this provision is vague, it is not desirable &mdash; for reasons which I am sure the House will appreciate &mdash; for the Minister to have to initiate a court action in circumstances such as this where speed is of the essence. That is the kernel of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House addresses itself to this problem in a direct and, I think, commonsense way.  I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 2 will be that, on production to a bank of a document signed by the Minister bearing the seal of the Minister and stating that, pursuant to section 22 of the 1939 Act, certain <Col N="135" /> moneys described in the document are, in the Minister's opinion, forfeited as being the property of an unlawful organisation, the bank will be obliged to pay those moneys into the High Court as directed by the Minister.  There is provision requiring the bank to notify the person, or persons, in whose name the moneys are held of their payment into the High Court.  This provision is being brought in on a temporary basis only and will operate for three months only unless continued in force by Government order. The Government will be able to reactivate it but only for three months at a time.  This is, I believe, an important limitation on the power of the Minister and will, I suggest, act as a safeguard.</P>
    <P>When the moneys are paid into the High Court it will then be open to any person claiming to be the owner of them to apply to the court within six months for an order directing the High Court to pay the moneys, together with appropriate interest, to him.  If the High Court is satisfied that section 22 of the 1939 Act has not had effect in relation to the moneys &mdash; this means that, subject to what is contained in section 8 of the Bill, which I will deal with shortly, if the court is satisfied that, loosely speaking, the moneys are not moneys belonging to an unlawful organisation &mdash; and if the court is also satisfied that the person claiming the moneys is the owner of them, the court will be obliged to order that the moneys be repaid to the person claiming them.  In any such proceedings that might be brought, the Minister will be entitled to be heard and this will, of course, enable him to defend the action he has taken.</P>
    <P>If proceedings are not brought within the six month period or if they are brought and are dismissed, the Minister may then apply to the High Court on an <i>ex-parte</i> basis &mdash; this means that he will not be obliged to serve notice on any other party &mdash; for an order directing the moneys to be paid into an account for the benefit of the Exchequer.  However, there is specific provision in this section for preserving the rights of any person <Col N="136" /> claiming to be the owner of the moneys who does not apply within the six month period.  It is open to such a person to bring an application any time within a period of six years of the payment of the moneys into the High Court.  If he can satisfy the court that there are reasonable grounds for this failure to bring an application within the six month period &mdash; he may, for example, have been abroad and unaware of the Minister's action &mdash; and if he also satisfies the court as to the other matters &mdash; namely, that the moneys are not the moneys of an unlawful organisation and that he is the owner of them &mdash; the court is obliged to order a refund of the moneys to him.  Where the High Court orders moneys to be refunded, either within the initial six months or pursuant to &ldquo;late&rdquo; applications, the court is empowered to award compensation to the person in respect of any loss incurred by him.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which deals with evidence, provides that if a document is produced in court signed by the Minister and starting that moneys described in the document are &mdash; again loosely speaking &mdash; the property of an unlawful organisation the document shall be evidence of that fact.  This does not, of course, mean that it is conclusive evidence of that fact but only that it is evidence and, like all or virtually all evidence, it can be rebutted.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of this section will enable a party to proceedings relating to ownership of moneys paid into the High Court to apply to the court for an order directing the bank or a specified officer of the bank to produce and prove to the court documents or records in the bank's possession or capable of being produced by it relating to the operation of the account to which the moneys relate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is an important provision because it will have the effect of conferring full immunity on a bank for acting in compliance with a document of the Minister requiring it to lodge moneys in the High Court.  The corollary of this, however, is that under section 7 if a bank fails to comply with a requirement to transfer funds into the High Court it will be guilty of a serious offence and any <Col N="137" /> member of the bank's staff that is responsible will also be guilty of an offence and liable to be charged accordingly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to section 8.  This does two things.  First, it removes any doubt there may be that all the property of an unlawful organisation is forfeited under section 22 of the 1939 Act and not just property held by it at the time a suppression order is made.  Second, it applies section 22 &mdash; the forfeiture provision &mdash; to moneys held for the use or benefit of or for the purposes of an unlawful organisation.  This widens the scope of the forfeiture provision and deals with what probably is, in many cases, the reality, namely, that moneys will be held by &ldquo;front men&rdquo; for unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the main points of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to say that the Government have not lightly brought forward this Bill and would not have done so were it not convinced that the Bill is essential and that there is no other way of dealing with the problem that now faces us.  I do not deny that it is a strong measure and that the power it confers on the Minister is one that ought never to be used lightly.  I can and do now give a firm assurance that I will not use it lightly but it may be more to the point if I say that I do not think that it can ever be used lightly, if only because any use of it is open to immediate challenge in the High Court and one in which the Minister of the day would face the hazard of having to pay compensation for any loss.  The provision for a confiscation or forfeiture of the property of unlawful organisations is there since 1939.  To the extent to which this Bill expands its effectiveness, its main provisions are usable only for a period of three months initially and, after that, only for a limited period at a time if and as authorised by Government order.  I have no evidence that would make it either necessary or appropriate for me to act under it at present except in relation to the one specific case I have mentioned but I think it right to say that the information available suggests that it may well be needed on occasion in the <Col N="138" /> future though obviously, unless such a situation were to arise, within the initial three month period, it would require a Government order to authorise any ministerial action.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced and is being taken in the Dáil exceptionally and as a matter of urgency on the basis of assurances given to the Dáil by the Minister on behalf of the Government.  These, in effect, are that the passage of the Bill as a matter of urgency is essential in the interest of the security of the State and to meet the immediate requirements of those interests which cannot be secured in any other way.</P>
      <P>When the Government of the day ask the Dáil to pass a Bill such as this without subjecting it to the normal parliamentary scrutiny and debate, they are asking the Dáil to accept the need to do so in the national interest and on the basis of trust. Having regard to the nature of the assurances given in relation to the urgency of this Bill, the Opposition are prepared to take the legislation on trust from the Government and, accordingly, are prepared to facilitate the passage of the Bill without delay.  In doing so, we also take it on trust that the terms of the Bill are appropriate and adequate to achieve its purposes in a manner consistent with the Constitution and that it will be used for no other purpose.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances and in the national interest, we are satisfied to acquiesce in the passage of the Bill through all Stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The speed with which the Bill has been brought in leaves us in a great difficulty because of the impossibility of studying the implications of the various sections.  I agree, as Deputy Haughey said, given the assurances by the Minister that the Bill is necessary. However, in the case of an Act which has been there since 1939 &mdash; 46 years&mdash; it is extraordinary that the Government did not see that there would be difficulty in <Col N="139" /> the implementation of a particular section until a specific occasion arose and then had to bring in a rushed Bill of this nature.  That is something which should not happen in this House and I hope that sections of this Bill do not have implications which we cannot see or understand in relation to sequestration of trade union funds or anything of that nature.</P>
      <P>We have not had an opportunity of studying the Bill but we have been assured by the Minister that it deals only with a particular section of the Offences against the State Act.  Presumably the Minister is referring to subsections (a) and (d) of section 22 of the Bill although that is not specifically stated.  I hope that this Bill simply refers to the section of the Offences against the State Act dealing with the difficulties of the Minister for Justice in taking possession of, recovering or getting in all personal property which becomes forfeited, etc.</P>
      <P>On the basis that it is dealing with a particular situation and that it cannot be extended to cover other organisations in future, we accept the need for the Minister to rush it through this House.  Bills rushed through in this manner can cause enormous difficulties in the future which we cannot evaluate now and, after all, the purpose of Parliament is to evaluate Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an unhappy experience here in the relatively short time in which I have been a Member of this House in regard to rapidly passed legislation.  A Bill was passed in 1970 with more or less the agreement of all sides of the House which, subsequently, did not stand up to constitutional challenge.  Like every other Deputy, I only saw this Bill five minutes ago and I have not had a chance to think about it but &mdash; and perhaps the Minister could study this in the short time available before the Bill goes to the Seanad &mdash; it seems that the provisions which the Minister intends should entitle somebody in whose name money is to challenge the forfeiture and essentially, as the Minister said, to demonstrate that, loosely speaking, the money <Col N="140" /> is not the property of an unlawful organisation, is activated in a sense in respect of section 8 because that section, in order to remove doubt, provides that property which becomes the property of an unlawful organisation at any time is subject to the powers of section 22.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, unless I have misread the Bill in my haste, it seems to be the case that the only way a court could decide that section 22 did not apply would be by effectively according something like a declaration of legality to the organisation concerned but, under the Principal Act, the time for that is up within 30 days after the making of a suppression order which, of course, is long out of time now.  I apologise if I have wasted the time of the House by making a point which perhaps I would not have needed to make if there had been time to study the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will examine that point and see if there is any substance in it.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the House for facilitating me and in particular I thank the Leader of the Opposition. He has taken the legislation on trust and I accept that.  I should also like to thank Deputy Mac Giolla for facilitating me.</P>
      <P>A number of points have been raised. Deputy Mac Giolla asked about the sequestration of trade union funds.  This could not arise without <i>mala fides</i>.  The power is specifically limited to unlawful organisations.  There is a remedy in law and a bona fide trade union would not have any difficulty in proving ownership. It would not apply to a trade union.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke about certain provisions extending to organisations which would not pay money to central or local government.  This would not arise because the legislation applies only to proscribed organisations under the Act which are specifically the IRA and the INLA.  They were proscribed by order of the Government and the Bill would not have the scope the Deputy seemed to suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about a challenge in respect of section 8.  In effect it is intended to extend section 22 by section 8.  This means there would be an onus on a claimant to show that the property is not held for the use and benefit of a proscribed organisation.  Deputy Mitchell asked what would be done with the money.  In the first instance it would be paid into a court account and if after six months there was no litigation it would become Exchequer funds.  It would be a <Col N="142" /> matter for decision as to how that money would be spent.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  The purpose is to make it clear that an order may be made at any time when subsection (2) (a) has ceased to be in operation so as to bring it into operation again.  Without the amendment there could be a possible argument that the effect of the positive provision in paragraph (c) (iii) of section 2 (1) that subsection (2) (a) should cease to be in operation at the time specified would mean there would be no power under sub-paragraph (iii) to revive subsection (2) (a) after it had ceased to be in operation at that time.

      <P>Section 2 (1) (a) (i) refers to moneys that would have been, but for the operation of section 22, the property of an unlawful organisation.  Take a case where by means of a robbery, extortion or kidnapping a sum of £X came into the possession of an unlawful organisation and was deposited in a bank.  Could it be rightly said that the money was the property of the unlawful organisation? Might it not be the position that it would remain the property of the source from which it had been unlawfully extorted? It might be in their name but would it become their property?</P>
      <P>The section as it stands is confined to moneys.  One could visualise a situation where the asset held by the bank might not be in money form but in the form of a security bond and so on.  Perhaps consideration might be given to extending the description to securities and so on.</P>

Since we have not had time to examine the Bill and since it it likely to remain on the Statute Book for 46 years, I should like to see that enshrined in the Bill.  Would the Minister accept an amendment in respect of this section on the following lines: &ldquo;(3) The provisions <Col N="146" /> of this Act shall not apply to organisations that may be declared unlawful under section 18 (f) of the Principal Act.&rdquo;  That section refers to an &ldquo;organisation that promotes, encourages or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the central fund or any other public funds for the non-payment of local taxation&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I did not give the guarantee the Deputy suggested initially.  I said it applies to the proscribed organisations, the IRA and the INLA.  If the Government decided by order under section 19 to proscribe some other organisation it would apply, but that does not mean it would apply to the organisations suggested by the Deputy.  It is not intended to apply to them and would not apply to them.  It would apply only to organisations that have been specifically proscribed by Government order.  It will not necessarily be operational for 40 years because the enabling section which allows the Minister to act will have a three month life and to reactivate it will need an order of the Government to extend it beyond that time.  If a period lapses, if it falls into disuse and has to be reactivated, it will require an order of the Government that will have to be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way and it can be nullified by a negative motion of the House.</P>

Another Minister for Justice in another Government may declare an organisation that advocates the non-payment of local taxation as an unlawful organisation under section 19.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): There can be an unlawful organisation that is not a suppressed organisation.  In the <Col N="147" /> 1939 Act there are criteria that make an organisation unlawful and one of those is non-payment of taxation to a central exchequer or to a local exchequer.  That is not the same as a suppressed organisation. The suppressed organisation must be suppressed by order of the Government. It applies only to suppressed organisations. Because it arises directly out of section 22 of the Offences against the State Act, the forfeiture derives from the fact that it is a suppressed organisation. That is the point at issue.  The provision does not have the effect and the extent the Deputy fears and could not have that effect and extent.</P>

Consequently, there must be recourse to the courts so that people who feel aggrieved can challenge the opinion of the Minister and in that case whatever would be an appropriate defence would be considered by the court.

      <P>I wish to oppose this extension in respect of this committee. It is becoming something of a joke, certainly to people outside this House and to those who are trapped in situations of irretrievable marriage breakdown.  The committee was established in July 1983 and it should have reported in July 1984.  This was subsequently extended to December and a guarantee was given at that stage that the report would definitely be made by December.  Subsequently they got a further extension until February and again we were assured that the report would be before us before 19 February.  Now we are being asked for a further extension, and I see no valid reason at this stage why that should be granted.  No reason has been offered by the chairperson of the committee as to why they want this extension. What difficulty is being encountered in reporting?  No official report by the committee has been given to Deputies since November or December 1983.  We read plenty of news reports and speculation about what is taking place, but this House is not being kept up-to-date about the discussions and the debates that are proceeding.  Therefore, I oppose the extension for a further period.  I see no point in prolonging the agony, so to speak, of those involved in the committee or of this House.  It is time that the matter was brought back to the floor of this House so that the House can discuss the problems and make decisions in relation to them.</P>

Since this committee was instituted it is fair to say that no other committee has put in the same amount of work in the first year.  In a number of <Col N="150" /> weeks we had two days of sittings often of four hours a day.  For the past six months we have met twice a week at an average of about six hours per week.  Last Sunday we found it necessary to move out to Athlone in the hope of getting a long, quiet day to complete the report. Very few committees have given the same service.  We are conscious of the seriousness of this report.  We are being very careful to bring a report to this House which will be not alone the pride of the committee but also of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  No time is being lost and we hope to have the report completed in a week or so.  Nevertheless, we have decided to seek an extension to 21 March.  I assure the Deputy that our committee are working well.  I know that Members who perhaps are not really interested in what is happening and have not been associated with the social aspects of it as we are think that this is a long time, but we have covered a very wide area.  For that reason it is not possible to produce the report on the date expected; therefore we are seeking an extension and I hope that the House will approve of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last Thursday at the commencement of my speech, the Fianna Fáil stance on this Bill indicates how little they care about the welfare of women.  From reading the weekend newspaper reports of the machinations of their party meeting it is very clear that their decision to oppose was arrived at through no other motivation than political opportunism.  It is disgusting to see the contempt with which Deputy Haughey treats women both in and outside his party.  I feel sorry for Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, the party's spokesperson on women's affairs, <Col N="151" /> who must find it difficult to reconcile her role as chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights with the blunt rejection by her party of this Bill.  Women TDs on both sides of the House are approached and confided in by other women on problems dealing with family planning, marital difficulties and health problems generally.  Indeed, although each of the 14 women in the Dáil was elected by her local constituency, most of us are aware of the countrywide constituency of women who look to us to represent their voices, needs and aspirations in Parliament on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Women are unhappy with the existing law, which has many defects and is limiting and restrictive in its provisions and operation.  Certain factors in the 1979 Act, such as the prescription requirement for non-medical contraceptives and the allied cost, the limited outlets for medical methods such as the IUD and the diaphragm and the singling out of natural family planning methods have combined in the last five years to create a psychological barrier which many women in the childbearing years find very daunting. They tell me this constantly whenever I meet them throughout the country.  We are not disputing in this Chamber the right of people to plan their families, yet many women tell me that they are unable to do so under the present system.  For thousands of couples family planning means using the rhythm method, <i>coitus interruptus</i> or total abstension from sexual intercourse.  Women in these situations live with an anxiety, that men will never know, of calendar watching month after month.  It is sad that a significant proportion of Irish women seeking abortions in England are married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Health has said repeatedly that there is no demand for change in the present legislation, and we know that his leader very quickly decided to oppose this Bill in its entirety.  Given that this is an issue primarily of importance to women, the question must be asked: did the Opposition party seek the views or advice of the four women TDs and one woman Senator <Col N="152" /> in that party?  Deputies Eileen Lemass and Mary Harney who are opposite, and Deputies Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and Mary O'Rourke as well as Senator Honan have shown a degree of commitment to women's issues.  I fail to understand why such a fuss is made about the minimal essential amendments to the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979.  That Act itself was contrived legislation to give effect to the rights won in the Supreme Court by Mrs. McGee in 1974.  In effect, because it resulted in such limited access for women who are legally entitled to a family planning service, it was a case of being given a right with one hand which was taken back with the other.</P>
    <P>Only a very limited number of GPs have the necessary training to advise on all methods of family planning.  Over half the 15 family planning clinics in the country operate in the general Dublin-Dún Laoghaire-Bray area with only five further clinics for the needs of people in the rest of the country.  It can be assumed reasonably that most couples would prefer to consult their family doctors for contraceptive advice, but where those doctors will not for reasons of conscience give that advice couples have no option but to attend at the nearest family planning clinic even if it is a far distance from their home.  In a small scale survey of 41 GPs in the Eastern Health Board area it was found that while 90 per cent gave advice on the pill and two-thirds gave advice on natural methods, only 43 per cent gave a service in relation to condoms. Most agreed that there was a need to expand family planning services.  That is from minutes of the Eastern Health Board of 3 November 1983.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the 1979 Act favours the better off, those who are more mobile, better informed and know how to get access to a comprehensive service, while effectively it abandons the more socially disadvantaged women particularly those living in rural areas whose need of real assistance is very much greater.  For this reason I welcome the proposals in the Bill which will give discretion to health centres to provide contraceptives to clients.  I believe it <Col N="153" /> highly likely that, while fertility control is quite widespread, it has become in many cases the solitary responsibility of an individual wife carried through with little discussion or support from the husband. If the greater emphasis in the future on the use of condoms creates a climate in which men can begin sharing responsibility for family planning, we will see a welcome reduction in the number of women on the pill many of whom for health reasons are unsuited to it.</P>
    <P>As a parent of three young adults I am as anxious as anyone in this House that my children &mdash; and everyone else's children &mdash; should grow up with respect for themselves and for the law and with care and concern for human life young and old.  My responsibility combined with that of their educators was to give them guidance and example to enable them to distinguish right from wrong, to resist temptation and to understand that we all must make decisions for ourselves in life and then accept the consequences of those decisions.  Let us be clear about what opposition to this section of the Bill is saying to our young people.  Are we saying that although we know from statistics available that a number of you are sexually active, we do not want you to use contraceptives which could avoid pregnancies?  Are we saying that, though you can get married, pay tax, vote, be elected to local government, join the Army, go to prison, study for the priesthood, on the very fundamental issue of responsibility for your sexual behaviour we, the legislators of this country, do not trust you?</P>
    <P>In considering the reservations and the doubts which have been expressed by people who disapprove of contraceptives being available to single people, I examined the age profile of TDs and found that 66.6 per cent, or 109 Members, of this House are 43 years of age or over. As such, we are products of an era in Ireland in which we were inured by family, religious and educational influences to have a very distorted and unreal vision of sexuality.  Speaking for myself, I recall that sex was never discussed openly, but was always alluded to as <Col N="154" /> related to vice and badness.  The manner in which anything remotely connected with sexuality or female biology was dealt with in my adolescent years altogether denied girls an understanding of their basic bodily functions, left unanswered the many questions about sexuality and prepared us not at all for the roles of wife and mother.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the educators of those years were well-intentioned and did what they perceived was best for the young people in their charge.  Many of us in our adolescence suffered in silence, in most cases ignorant, innocent, but carrying excessive guilt that we might inadvertently commit a sin against the virtue of purity.  We felt we were treated like moral subversives, young men and women whose developing sexuality was conspiring to undermine the moral good name of the nation.  Any instinct on our part to reason matters of sexuality out for ourselves would have to contend with the likelihood of eternal damnation for entertaining and enjoying what were termed &ldquo;impure thoughts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Thirty years have seen wide-ranging changes.  Young people in Ireland now have a more informed, open and honest attitude towards relationships and matters relating to sex.  Today's parents and educators are by and large much more enlightened people who are as concerned with directing young people towards a code of good sexual behaviour, as they are prepared to listen to and help resolve the difficulties young people may be experiencing.</P>
    <P>The only fair and rational way to deal with this measure is for us to recognise that there is a generation gap between the majority of the Members of this House and the group in Irish society for whom we are legislating.  In an area like this, one generation can hardly have the right to apply their expectations to another generation.</P>
    <P>Democracy should prevail in this Chamber, where the people most affected by this Bill &mdash; women, single people and those under 25 &mdash; are severely under represented or not represented at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Finally, for my part, voting for this Bill is a vote of confidence in a new maturity in this country, but particularly a vote of confidence in our young people.  I am proud of my three children, whose vitality, optimism, honesty and care for others is one of the most rewarding and inspiring features for me of today's Ireland.  I deplore the hysterical proclamations which have been made about and for young people in the wake of this legislation. This amendment is not about abortion. It is not about permissiveness.  It is not about venereal disease.  It is about breaking the awful cycle which compels people to behave according to a fixed <i>diktat,</i> for the wrong reasons or because some judge that what sufficed for our mothers and grandmothers is relevant for today.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister of State, both on Thursday last and today, spent so much time criticising the leader of our party when she should have been discussing the Bill.  I would merely point out that, as Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey introduced the Family Planning Act, 1979, and that what we are discussing is an amendment to that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate last week there seemed to be a lot of confusion among the Government parties as to what Government policy is or indeed as to what the policy of each of the two parties to Government is on this issue.  Deputy Seán Treacy told us that there was no one calling for this legislation and went on to refer to it as so-called party policy, while Deputy Flanagan made the point that when the Programme for Government was being discussed he was under the impression that a review of the Family Planning Act would involve the spending of more money in the area of natural family planning.  He made the point that Fine Gael did not have a mandate from the people on this legislation.  When I say that I do not know of any public demand for this Bill I am reflecting the view of my constituents.  I have received only one letter in support of the Bill.  The opinion <Col N="156" /> poll undertaken by Irish Marketing Surveys and the MRBI &mdash;<i>Irish Times</i> poll show that between 58 and 62 per cent of the people surveyed would be opposed to the free availability of contraceptives for everybody.  Those two polls are a reflection of the reaction I have been getting in my constituency.  Consequently, I must ask why the Minister is introducing the Bill in such a case; why, when it was not included in the legislative programme after Christmas, do we now find it before the House?  Are the Government merely trying to distract attention from the disastrous budget or are they trying to push the Bill through before there has been an opportunity for a public discussion of it?</P>
    <P>I was amazed to read in today's <i>Irish Times</i> a report that the Minister would consider withdrawing the Bill or would refuse to implement its provisions should it be amended on Committee Stage. Surely this goes against his reference, in introducing the Bill, to reasonable and constructive criticism.  Perhaps the newspaper report does not correctly interpret the Minister's view.  However, I must ask him why there have not been consultations in this instance with interested parties, the kind of consultations that Deputy Haughey had in regard to the 1979 Act.  People are suspicious of a Minister who in his own constituency officially opened an illegal family planning clinic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>People in my constituency are asking why the Minister is not concentrating on the major health problems.  He knows, for instance, what the situation is in the Western Health Board area, where there is no dental service, where wards <Col N="157" /> are being closed because of lack of funds and where, for the same reason, a new maternity wing in Galway cannot be opened.  These are the problems the Minister should be concentrating on.</P>
      <P>Regarding the age limit proposed in the Bill, people in my constituency have been asking me how this provision is to be implemented.  Bishop Cassidy of Clonfert is reported as having referred to the legislation as optimistic, unenforceable fiction.  When one considers the way in which the licensing laws are operating, one is justified in asking how this legislation is to be implemented in regard to the question of age.  It may be that more people are calling for changes in the licensing laws than there are people calling for the proposed change in the Family Planning Act.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the statements of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the proposed changes are minimal.  They are serious changes.  An impression is being given that because Government Deputies who might have conservative leanings are supporting the Bill, it will be passed in the House.  One political correspondent referred over the weekend to Deputy Joe Doyle and to the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, a neighbour of mine, as people who would not want to open the floodgates of immorality because one was a former sacristan and the other is a pioneer.  That is getting away all together from the terms of this Bill.  One could argue in that vein on any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the debate to be on the practicalities of what is here before us. The Family Planning Bill of 1979 put family planning in the health care area. There may be problems in operating this Bill and these have been pointed out by some Deputies, but I suggest that the medical profession, in operating that 1979 Bill, do so in a caring way.  I do not agree that free availability of contraceptives will bring to an end unwanted pregnancies and illegitimate births.  Deputy O'Hanlon quoted to the House a high abortion rate in Denmark of 42 per cent in 1981, an increase from 8 per cent in <Col N="158" /> 1978. In Great Britain the number of abortions and illegitimate births also increased during that period.  In 1968 their abortion rate was 2.5 per cent, but it increased to 19.6 per cent in 1981. During the same period illegitimate births increased from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.  Those figures show that in countries with free availability of contraceptives and with all the necessary back-up facilities of family planning clincis, sex education in schools and so forth, there has been an increase in illegitimate births and in abortions.  Young people are being accused of being irresponsible when there is free availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Much of this recent debate has been about the Church-State relationship.  I am sure that the House will agree that the Catholic bishops should speak on the Church's teaching.  The Catholic theologian, Dr. Gabriel Daly, has appeared on television twice within four days, stating that he has no objection to the Bill. These people are entitled to give their opinion.  I welcome also the appearance of the Bishop of Limerick on the Sunday television programme.  I hope that there will be balance in the presentation of these programmes.  It is not right that one point of view be given predominance.</P>
    <P>The values which young people have and the good relationships and mutual respect which they have for each other are being undermined by this Bill.  They are under many pressures in these times, one obvious pressure being unemployment, but there are pressures to be associated with the legalising of contraceptives for everybody.  I greatly fear that young people will be exploited.  I am concerned about the environment which we will be creating for our young people.  I am confident that the Bill will be defeated and that the wish of the people, as expressed in opinion polls and to me in my constituency for there to be no change in the legislation, will be finally decided by this House when we vote on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which seems central to me in this debate, and certainly which is cardinal to the Bill before the <Col N="159" /> House and the legislation which it proposes to amend, is that we are talking about criminal law.  No amount of references to health, family planning, caring this and compassionate that, will obscure the fact that criminal law is at the centre of the stage in this subject.  The reason for that is that in the area of contraception, as in other areas, the Irish State has taken on itself to limit what is essentially the citizen's right to do exactly as he pleases within the four corners of law.  It has taken on itself to limit the citizen's right to do as he pleases and to enforce that limitation by a threat of criminal punishment.</P>
      <P>Essentially, what this Bill proposes to do is to relax that threat of criminal punishment in certain cases.  I am not going to follow Deputies, on whichever side of this issue they have spoken, down the question of abortion statistics, promiscuity statistics and the collapse of society as we know it, or, for that matter, the points of view, which have their own validity, which my colleague, Deputy Fennell, was advancing here a moment ago and which other Deputies have advanced and will advance in the future.  My main concern is and has been since 1974 &mdash; so that anything I say now will not come as a surprise to those who watch what Deputies say &mdash; that central, from my point of view, is the issue of the extent of the criminal law and the entitlement of the criminal law to encroach on people's privacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No State that I know of attempts to make its criminal law co-extensive with the moral injunctions which most of society might be willing to recognise. Nobody wants to live in states or communities which have attempted to do that in the past, like the puritan communities of New England.  Perhaps there are Deputies here who would be afraid to say so, but let me say that I do not want to live in a community like that.  I do not want to raise a scare about it, because I do not see any danger that this country is going to turn into such a thing.  On the contrary, the trend is all in the opposite direction.  I just mention the puritan New <Col N="160" /> England communities in order to suggest to the House that the day when a State &mdash; and there were very few even then &mdash; attempted to enforce its perceived morality by means of criminal law, by means of judge and jailer &mdash; and yes, gallows &mdash; has passed away.  I do not think that anybody &mdash; Catholic, Protestant, Jew or Presbyterian &mdash; regrets that.</P>
    <P>Every State accepts that the function of criminal law is a good deal humbler than the function of moral code.  A moral code is transmitted ideally by example, by parents to children and, in a parallel manner, by Churches or Confessions to their members.  It necessarily has wider frontiers, much wider boundaries than has criminal law, though it is not easy to see where the boundary is to be placed. I have not a set of rules of thumb, nor has anybody, for suggesting where one is to stake out the boundary which will shut the criminal law off from certain areas of existence.  I have not got such a rule of thumb, and attempts to set up such a rule of thumb have uniformly failed.  Even if there were such clear boundaries they would shift from age to age and from generation to generation.  Wherever the boundaries between criminal law and morality lie there are certain dictates of prudence which the State ought to respect and there are certain values in human dignity which a State ought to respect, which will have a restraining influence on the protrusion of criminal law into areas which might perhaps be sufficiently regulated by the group's social mores or religiously transmitted morality.  These values are not slight.  A State which takes it upon itself to enforce something which it is not able to enforce is making itself ridiculous and making its law ridiculous.  For an example of this we do not have to go any further than the Fianna Fáil Bill which this Bill proposes to amend.</P>
    <P>I was quoted in a newspaper recently as saying something at a Fine Gael party meeting which I did not bother to contradict, party because meetings are supposed to be in private and partly because it was a trivial thing anyway.  I got so many people writing to me saying that <Col N="161" /> they understood I had said this and that they heartily agreed with it, that I want to explain what I would have meant had I said it.  I was reported as saying that there was no public demand for this Bill. There is a certain amount of truth in that. I have heard of no demand for anything of the kind but the reason why there is no strong public demand for it is that the present law is a farce and it is disobeyed wholesale.  People can do without the law one way or the other in this area.  A former student of mine wrote to the paper the other day to contradict what he had seen attributed to me as an opinion though in fact I had never said it and he said that all that Deputy Kelly need do was stroll 500 yards from his office to find a huge demand which is actually being supplied.  That demand is supplied so far as I am aware in defiance of the law.  That is what I mean by an unworkable law &mdash; one which the State does not mean to police and cannot police.  The State does not give a damn whether it will ever be policed but it enables it to sit smugly back with its hands folded over its stomach and say &ldquo;We have done our duty by the youth of this country&rdquo;.  That is the kind of law we had here five years ago and if the Minister did nothing else but show that up I would support him for it.</P>
    <P>It is important for the State to keep in mind what it is capable of getting away with in enforcement, and what it is capable of policing, or what it could reasonably expect to police without carrying out instrusions into family and individual personal life, so shocking and so intolerable as to destroy the dignity of individuals and of society.  There have been states like that in the past.  We do not need to go any further than Nazi Germany where the state intruded into the fireside by requiring the son who was a member of the Hitler Youth to report his parents for politically disloyal sentiments. The Nazis did not believe in half measures.  They went right into the fireside and broke up families to ensure political loyalty.  Most states do not conduct their affairs like that and would not be tolerated by free men if they did.  That is one criterion which should inhibit the <Col N="162" /> State in trying to impose any rule whether founded on morality or otherwise.  The other value to be protected is the value of individual personal privacy which has now come more or less to be recognised by the Irish courts as a dimension of the citizen's personal right.  In relation to this, nobody can lay down an absolute limit. Clearly, I do not have individual privacy so impregnable that I can refuse to disclose my affairs to the income tax people. There are many other areas where the State's legitimate concerns will breach my privacy but there is no doubt that we all know what is meant by individual liberty and we have a rough calculus of when we feel somebody is going too far in poking his nose into somebody else's business.  Nose poking, is what this law is all about.  It is the intrusion by the State into private lives.  It has nothing to do with morality.  My objection to it has nothing to do with not sharing the moral points of view with which it starts out.  It has everything to do with believing that the State has exceeded what should be its true measure in the way it has done this for the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>In case anyone thinks what I am saying is shocking I would draw the attention of the House to this.  Like other Deputies of my party I have had a particularly large number of letters probably associated with the fact that a small number of us publicly said we would vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the pro-life amendment.  I do not apologise for that.  In doing so I was only doing what I had told the people on the doorsteps.  In the 1982 election my party were committed to doing it.  I will not rake up that history, but I did it partly for that reason and partly because I thought that a rebuttal to that amendment, unnecessary though it was, would have an unsettling and destablishing effect in regard to what should be the people's consensus on the sanctity of life both before and after birth, where it is not sufficiently respected here.  That may be the reason why some of us have had an unusually heavy post.  My post is to me a very politically unsettling one.  I have had upwards of 150 letters of all kinds, the great majority from my constituency; the great majority <Col N="163" /> of them urge me to defy my party, to abandon them and vote the other way.  I am grateful to those people for having uniformly addressed me temperately.  I have had no trace of abuse or intimidation.</P>
    <P>Any of the people who did me the honour of writing to me to put their points of view politely and reasonably must have known that it is 11 years since I said something of this kind in the House, when Deputy Cooney's Bill was going through.  In case anyone is shocked by this, there are several areas of what I might call sexual irregularity which are not crimes at all and some never were crimes here.  For example, ordinary fornication is not a crime; adultery is not a crime; the act of prostitution is not a crime; it is not a crime to take money for sexual services.  There all kinds of offences associated with prostitution which are an attempt to keep it within bounds &mdash; the offence of soliciting, living on immoral earnings and so on &mdash; but the act itself is not an offence.  The reason these things are not an offence is that the State considers that it would be beyond them to enforce a criminal law in that area.  I would ask Deputies who think otherwise, do they suppose that this means that the State is condoning immorality in this area?  Do they suppose that merely because the State does not send the police around to see who is misbehaving sexually with whom, that this is a sign that it is a matter of indifference to the State and that the State is condoning it or sponsoring it?  Of course it does not mean that.  It simply means that the State for a mixture, no doubt, of the motives I have mentioned regards it as impossible to police such an area and that it is best left to individual perceptions and individual intuitions of morality.</P>
    <P>There are a whole stream of immoral imperfections, some of them very serious, which a confessor would regard morally serious, which are not criminally punishable either.  The whole field of domestic tyranny, not to speak of cruelty, does not come within the purview of criminal law unless it amounts to assault, <Col N="164" /> or cruelty to children in a statutorily appraisable sense.  The whole gamut of meanness, of falseness, of speculation, of profiteering, of backbiting, of ingratitude and so on is not a crime and no one in their senses would think of making them a crime because in order to pursue such offences the State would have to recruit a police of an elaborateness not seen since the world began and would have to reduce the private lives of its citizens to a zero.  Cardinal Ó Fiaich and many of the bishops have missed this.  In a rhetorical address the other day Cardinal Ó Fiaich said that no legislation passed by the State could make artificial contraception morally right.</P>
    <P>I do not know what other Deputies may feel about this and therefore I will not go into it now, but I say with respect that the Cardinal's utterance is beside the point.  This Bill does not purport to make artificial contraception morally correct. It does not set out to do this.  It withdraws the criminal law, not entirely but very largely and substantially, from the area of contraception.  I hope this will not come as a subject of amazement to anybody, but the Bill proposes in a nutshell to restore the law pretty much to the condition it was in when Cardinal Ó Fiaich was a schoolboy, and most of his fellow bishops.</P>
    <P>Though it has not been emphasised in the House, until 1935 we had no such law on our Statute Book; and in the childhood of Deputy Oliver Flanagan and even in the lifetime of Deputy O'Hanlon, it was no offence in Mountmellick or in Carrickmacross to import contraceptive devices for one's own use or for sale to others, whatever the person's marital status.  That is an amazing thing.  &ldquo;We never knew that&rdquo;, people will be saying. &ldquo;That is a new one on us.  I thought we always had a strict law about this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We had not.  We did not have a strict law about these things until 1935, and that law skulked through the House, almost because Deputies were afraid to say anything in favour or against it in case they might have to use a word which was unacceptable according to the standards <Col N="165" /> of the time.  All we are doing &mdash; we are not even doing that because up to then the thing was subject to almost no regulation at all except that advertising contraceptives was prohibited by the 1929 Censorship Act &mdash; is bringing the law back part of the way to what it was when the older generation now were first frisking around the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>I would ask if it is therefore the case that we should picture the Irish Free State in the years before 1935 as a scene of the horrors Deputy Flanagan portrayed here the other day, and likely to emerge if the Bill becomes law.  Was the Irish Free State the scene of licentiousness as gross as we have been led to apprehend?  Of course, I will be told that is a disingenuous and rhetorical question because we all know the world has changed and that Ireland has changed since 1935.</P>
    <P>Indeed it has, but that has a lesson for us because if Ireland has changed since 1935 it has done so in spite of the most complete zareba, in spite of a Maginot Line of the most defensive legislation ever to appear in Western Europe, with the possible exception of Portugal or Spain.  One could lump in with the whole of North Europe a large part of the rest of the world.  Ireland has changed in spite of the laws against contraception and on censorship.  The latter were so ludicrous in their operation that even Fianna Fáil finally found the courage to amend them. Ireland has changed despite the constitutional prohibition on divorce.</P>
    <P>I do not need to labour the point that Ireland was not a hotbed of licentiousness before the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act closed the floodgates.  We all know that is not the case and if it looks like becoming the case now it is because all that has taken place despite all the ingenuity of legislation to stop it.  I do not want to be taken as avoiding a point that could be made against me at this juncture.  Although we are not doing so in this Bill, we might appear to be running ahead, to be winching down the gates a little faster than the flood is building up on the outside.</P>
    <P>That might appear to be likely to accelertate our approach to the world norm, <Col N="166" /> but whether we like it or not we are nearer to the world norm now than we were ten or 15 years ago, for better or for worse.  There is no use in our deploring it. Many of us do not like the kind of society we now have.  There are about 100 reasons why one might not like it, depending on one's disposition, including what we are talking about now.  In many respects we have moved nearer to the world norm and the question is whether, if we pass this Bill, we will accelerate that approach, whether we will even up the waters between this canal basin which we have been occupying for the past 60 years and the rather higher waters outside.</P>
    <P>I admit that is a fair point and I cannot contradict it.  I will not start deploying statistics to produce a table to prove the increase in the number of illegitimacies or abortions and say that all this happened contemporaneously with something else. That would not prove it happened as a consequence of that other thing.  Such an argument is hard to rebut.  It is hard to be sure that we are not accelerating the thing, but my feeling is that whether we had this Bill or not or whether the Bill will be defeated or not, Ireland will move nearer to the world norm.</P>
    <P>To use a figure of speech which I did not invent but of which I would have been glad to be the father, not only can we not stop the world from turning but we cannot stop ourselves from turning with it.  That leaves the State, the Government and the Dáil with a net question: is the entirely problematical, entirely speculative chance of perhaps retarding our approach to the world norm a sufficient justification for continuing to maintain a very substantial inroad on personal and family privacy?  Everybody must answer that question as they see best themselves. I think the answer is no, because I start from the intuitive conviction that this area of life essentially is so intimate that the State has no business poking its nose into it.  Everybody will have their convictions about that, and I respect the sincerity and the reasonableness found among those such as Deputy Glenn, who does not agree with me, and Deputy Flanagan. My conviction is that this area of life is <Col N="167" /> so intimate that the State should keep out of it unless it has compelling reasons for interfering.</P>
    <P>A compelling reason is the protection of young people &mdash; I will be back to this in a moment.  In the meantime, I will deal with one other argument or form of rhetoric which has accompanied attacks on this Bill not just on the other side but from outside and from many people who write to me and, let me not put a tooth on it, who have told me they have always voted No. 1 for me or have always supported Fine Gael.  They have intimated that their allegiance to me and to Fine Gael will be somewhat on the line if this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>I would be very sorry if the consequences which they apprehend from the Bill were to come to pass and I would then be anxious to support measures to try to mend the damage.  However, I do not think we are paid here to express opinions that we do not hold.  I do not think we are paid here to express the opinions of others.  I think we are paid to express the ideas we hold ourselves.  My perception of this area is that it is something too private for the State to be allowed interfere with.</P>
    <P>One of the items of rhetoric deployed by the opponents of the Bill involves an accumulation of evils.  One finds in the same breath contraception, divorce, and abortion being mentioned just as was the case in the pro-life referendum debate two years ago.  It is my view that those things are perfectly separate.  I announced to the House the position I took up during the pro-life referendum debate and I got a lot of congratulatory letters &mdash; though nothing like as many as the admonitory ones I have now got &mdash; from people who were glad I had taken the line I did.  Those letters came from people from inside and outside my constituency. Many of them, I gathered from the way they wrote even of those who were pleased with what I had done two years ago, were inclined to say that unless the referendum was passed we would have a whole train of other things including these other objectionable matters which <Col N="168" /> seemed to belong together in their minds. Of course they are perfectly separate.</P>
    <P>The State is right to treat abortion as a criminal offence.  I say that not in any way meaning to imply that there is not to be a lot of understanding for someone who is driven by despair, abandonment and one thing or another into that crime but it should remain a criminal offence. I have no doubts in my mind about that but I cannot see how that conviction requires me to criminalise contraception. I cannot see how one follows logically from the other although many of my correspondents seems to think that those two things belong together.  Indeed, there is a point of view &mdash; I will express it myself because I think that logically it is not entirely sound &mdash; that will say that a State which forbids abortion is logically obliged not to impede a precaution which, even though one might have moral doubts about it, at the very least will tend in the case of the individual to avert a pregnancy which will expose an unborn being either to the danger of destruction before birth or of growing up in a very hostile and unfavourable environment afterwards. That point of view exists.  I do not wish to overlook the objection to it and I know that Deputy Glynn who has never spoken with anything except courtesy in this matter will be the last to be putting opinions into my mouth which she knows I do not hold.  I accept that there is an objection to that point of view namely, that if one were to take all wraps off promiscuity even with contraception the net result would be more pregnancies and not fewer.  I am inclined to think that that is so and the figures in England show it but whether those figures have anything to do with the availability of contraception or not, whether they would be there anyway even if contraception was forbidden, is the problem I cannot get any kind of a conclusive answer to.</P>
    <P>I should like to say one more thing about the right to privacy.  The House ought to consider that it is bound by Article 15 to enact nothing which is contrary to the Constitution.  As I understand the way the law has functioned under the 1979 Act it is the case that non-medical <Col N="169" /> contraceptive devices are prescribed by doctors and that the medical profession very much resent this.  I do not need to make the medical profession's case for it but there is more to it than merely the question of doctors being a bit upset because they are asked to do something which is not really the job of a doctor. There is also the question of whether it is not a gross violation of a family's privacy that they are obliged to resort to a doctor in order to get the doctor to prescribe for them in an area which is not a medical area.  Therefore, those people are obliged to disclose to an outsider who in this context is perfectly irrelevant the most intimate details of their life in order to achieve a facility which is non-medical. They are obliged to disclose those details in a context in which the doctor does not have any function whatever to advise them.  By definition a doctor cannot advice them about a non-medical preparation.</P>
    <P>To me that is a breach of privacy.  That marital privacy is breached by the 1979 Act.  I believe that if that point were taken along the lines Mrs. McGee took her case it would have a very good chance of success.  I will go further than that, although this necessarily is more speculative, and say that I would not be inclined to put much money on the proposition that the Supreme Court would not declare in this area a right of privacy for the individual also, whatever his or her marital status.  There can be no certainty about that but I should like to direct the attention of the House to the fact that in 1983 in the Norris case two of the five judges pronounced very strong judgments in favour of the concept, and the deployment of the concept in that case, of individual privacy in the area of intimate relations.  That pair of judges, who are still on the court, were outvoted by the other three but I think it is an open question &mdash; I will not go any further than that &mdash; whether in some kind of legal context which was not so unmentionable as the Norris case that majority would hold up apart from the fact that one of the three judges has now left the court and been replaced.  It is questionable whether that <Col N="170" /> majority would hold up, and it is a perfectly open point on which I would not like to risk money either way, that the court might in a setting like this, irrespective of marital status, come to the conclusion that to subject this area to prescription was an intrusion on individual privacy.</P>
    <P>If the House rejects the Bill there is a very good chance that just as the Fianna Fáil Government found themselves overtaken by the McGee case in 1972-73, we will find ourselves passed out once again by the Supreme Court.  Whether that would be to the honour of the House and to the honour of Irish democracy or whether it would merely allow us to hug ourselves at having been spared individually a lot of odium, a lot of telephone calls and a lot of letters I will not pronounce on.  Deputies are here to speak their minds, do what they think is right and not to shelter behind what may come along in the form of a Supreme Court ruling.</P>
    <P>I should like to express two serious reservations about the Bill.  One of them, I am afraid, is now only academic but the other the Minister could do something about and I honestly urge him to do so. The first reservation bears on the age of 18.  I accept the Minister's point that that age limit as he has devised it will not be a national joke in the way that the 18 age limit in the case of supplying drink in a public house is concerned because, as he has pointed out repeatedly, there is an absolute liability on a chemist or whoever it is to make sure that the person being supplied is 18 or over.  A publican, in order to be caught by the law, has to be shown to have knowingly supplied drink to a minor but in this case the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; does not occur so that nobody can escape the penalty the Minister is providing for an unauthorised dispensation by saying that he or she did not know the boy or girl was under 18.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point and so far as an age limit is workable at all &mdash; even that is arguable &mdash; I accept he has gone as far as he could.  My concern is more with the age 18 itself because I do not think 18 is an age at which people should <Col N="171" /> be permitted, encouraged or facilitated to enter into serious relationships, including the marriage relationship.  I do not think it is an age at which they should be facilitated or encouraged in the formation of casual relationships from which serious results may follow.  I hope Members do not think, having heard the first part of my speech, that this is an unduly square opinion.  It will not come as a surprise to any person who follows the proceedings of the House because I said this last November when we were passing, for the most trivial of reasons as they seemed to me then, the Age of Majority Bill.  It is the passage by the House of that Bill which makes me feel that it is probably a waste of breath for me to say this now.</P>
    <P>When that Bill was going through I said, among other things, that if we passed the Bill and the age of majority was reduced from 21 to 18 we would be knocking out of our own hands a powerful weapon for arguing, should such a thing later become necessary or opportune, that 18 was too young an age for access to contraceptive devices.</P>
    <P>We have been depriving ourselves of that argument.  We have been logically incapacitating ourselves from putting up that argument.  I think I was the only Deputy in the House to object to this reduction in the age of majority.  I was, I will not say laughed out of it; I was not treated impolitely &mdash; not that I would not have been well used to it if I had been &mdash; I was politely laughed out of it, let me put it that way, by Deputies on the far side, including Deputy Mary O'Rourke who told me that she had much more confidence in young people than I had, who told me I was looking on the gloomy side.  Both she and I are the parents of more or less grown up children and we both, I think, know what we are talking about.  I do not claim to be any better at it, probably worse than she is; I accept that she knows what she is talking about but her perspective was a different one. Young people, she said, can be trusted; they are not as lightheaded and as feather-brained as Deputy Kelly thinks; he <Col N="172" /> has got far too gloomy a view of them. The same kind of tone was taken by, I think, Deputy Fahey &mdash; I did not remain for too much more of the debate but essentially I was a lone voice in here in maintaining that 18 is too young to get married, for anything that will facilitate marriage, such as the ostensible reason for that stupid Bill, such as the facilitation of a mortgage.  It follows from that that I also think it is too young for entering into casual relationships which can have extremely serious consequences which can last for the rest of one's life as can marriage.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the chance of arguing this has passed because, of course, it is not possible to advance this argument any longer, to say now 18 is too young &mdash; even though this is the very emotive point which Deputy Glenn and those who think like her have quite rightly latched on to &mdash; in the form of saying we are facilitating the supply of contraceptives to teenagers. I agree with Deputy Glenn about that but, if so, we did that damage here three months ago.  It is not possible any longer to press the Minister to apply what I would have preferred, namely, the old measure of maturity, 21 years, to this area.  I would have been happy enough with an age limit of 21, completely happy with it, but I think 18 is too young.  I have children of my own who are just above and below that age.  I feel I know what I am talking about and I would not wish them to get into that kind of situation which we are led to expect to fear.  But I am afraid that the argument based on the level of the age limit has crumbled in our hands and we ourselves crumbled it up here in our hands three months ago.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of the 18 year old majority and our making statutory adults out of 18 year olds &mdash; the ones about whom we are now crying because they are not fit to be treated as adults and I agree they are not &mdash; then why did we make them adults here three months ago?  Naturally we would not have done that, Sir, &mdash; and I know you have heard this so often you hardly need to wait for me to say it &mdash; except for the example which we so slavishly awaited and then <Col N="173" /> so blindly followed from Britain.  Needless to say if the English had still thought fit to retain a 21 year age of maturity we would be damned but we would not find one too; there would be some little reason we would find for delaying a change downwards.  It is the English we have to thank for that.  I should say that the English cannot be blamed for what they think right for themselves but we can be blamed for slavishly imitating them.</P>
    <P>My second reservation relates to the question of State involvement.  Most of the letters I received expressed what I might describe as a generalised outrage about this Bill.  But a few of them, a respectful handful &mdash; they were coming in such volume I could not be certain to have read every line of all of them &mdash; made what I think is a very substantial point.  It is this: not only did they feel that the State was facilitating licence or promiscuity but they felt this Bill would have the effect of getting the State to subsidise it, to support it actively.  It is not easy to see the substance of that point but it is there and I sympathise with it.  If I felt indignant at the idea of single people being given access to contraceptives &mdash; which I do not feel indignant about because, as I said before, it is none of the State's business &mdash; I would feel deeply outraged, as I believe does Deputy Glenn, at the idea that the State was actually going to subsidise this which, even if only marginally, it does in the form of supplying them through health institutions run by regional health boards and hospitals which equally depend on public money.  Every Government ought to recognise another rule of prudence apart from the one I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the rule of prudence not to attempt the impossible, or the unpoliceable.  A further rule of prudence is: do not antagonise, do not switch off, do not make enemies of your own people; do not do a violence to their feelings greater than you feel to be absolutely necessary and indispensable in order that you achieve the object you believe is right.  If a Government can reconcile or accommodate dissenting opinion &mdash; only, of course, where that <Col N="174" /> opinion is sincerely held; I do not mean where it is just cooked up for political motivation &mdash; where a Government can, without violence to its main objective accommodate, reconcile, assuage dissenting opinion, it ought to do so.</P>
    <P>What I would like the Minister to do, and would support him in doing, would be &mdash; and it would not affect the chemist shops or privately run or privately financed family planning clinics and so on &mdash; to give exceptional treatment to the State-supported outlets he envisages here, permitting those outlets to supply non-medical contraceptives to married people only.  That is a small gesture.  It would not wreck the Minister's Bill.  It would go some distance, though perhaps not far enough, to reconcile and meet half way the perfectly sincere and very strongly held opinions of Deputies like Deputy Glenn and I suppose some of the Deputies on the far side of the House and which are held by quite a lot of people in the country.  I would urge the Minister to consider whether he can go some distance, perhaps along the lines I suggest, at least to removing from his Bill the reproach that the State is actually subsidising or providing a facility which a taxpayer, perhaps a violently objecting taxpayer, has to contribute to in the provision of devices which are regarded as objectionable and which the State is wrongly regarded as having a role in keeping out of people's reach.</P>
    <P>The last two points I want to make before concluding bear on the Church and State dimension to this controversy &mdash; on which I will not spend long &mdash; and on the role of the Opposition.  I should like to echo something which my former colleague, Mr. Richie Ryan said yesterday &mdash; the suggestion made in recent weeks that the Catholic bishops are somehow wrong in speaking their minds on this point, or even in concerting an orchestrated sequence of pronouncements is a suggestion which never should be heard in a democratic State.  The bishops, I think, have the wrong end of the stick in assuming that the State should legislate by means of the criminal law in this area.  I think they are wrong about <Col N="175" /> that.  But they are absolutely entitled to speak their minds.  I cannot understand how anyone can begrudge a Catholic bishop something he would not begrudge to a Protestant bishop, would not begrudge to a communist, would not begrudge to a newspaper editor, would not begrudge to anyone else in the country. I cannot understand that.</P>
    <P>I disagree with them about this, I think they have got the wrong end of the stick. I think &mdash; as I shall hint in a moment &mdash; they are imprudent in taking the line they have taken if it is not an impertinence for me to offer a view like that.  But their right to do all this is absolutely clear.  The question whether it is sensible for them to have entered into this controversy in the form and with the intensity that they have is a separate question.  It is not really a political question, I suppose, but let me just say a word about it.  I do not think that the Catholic Church in this country is the same organisation that it was when I was a student when the mother and child scheme was being debated and even later when the Fethard-on-Sea boycott was taking place and things like that were happening.  It is an organisation which undoubtedly commands a huge and reverential following in this country.  Perhaps that is because the people can see no other organ in the State for which they feel the faintest regard or respect.  It is easy to blame them for taking what bishops say seriously when they have so little reason to take seriously much of what they hear in here?  But their standing no longer depends on authority in the old fashioned sense.  It no longer depends on belting people with croziers.  It may once upon a time have depended on that.</P>
    <P>Once upon a time it was the case that it was dangerous for a politician to step too far out of line with what the Catholic Church required.  Those days have utterly passed away.  I know there may be corners of the country where that is not apparent.  I will not expand on this but there are corners of the country in which it is not apparent that the institutional authority, in the hardest sense of the <Col N="176" /> word, of the Church has not yet dissolved. However, I believe, broadly speaking, that it has dissolved and it does not require any courage to dissent from the bishops these days and no courage to attack them.  It may require a lot of courage to defend them, and at times they require defence.  Their position with the people no longer depends on the crozier or authority, still less on anything like spiritual tyranny; it depends on the respect and the affection which the Church here has earned over the years, the decades and the centuries.</P>
    <P>If I may voice the respectful view of a very low grade Catholic, I think they would be much wiser to depend on that affection and respect for their pastoral effects rather than on what might be interpreted as the exercise of authority. That would be more prudent, and particularly so in a case like this where it is so easy to interpret their intervention as an effort to shackle the secular arm on to a theological engine.  It is very easy to represent what has happened here in the last couple of weeks as an attempt to get the arm of the State operative in support of a theological proposition.  That is a position which it is unwise for a Church to get itself into.  It has already caused a lot of difficulty in quarters which are, no doubt, predictable.  It is especially unwise in this case when this country is nearly, if not absolutely, unique among countries with mainly Catholic populations in having the kind of laws which we have in this area.  I cannot think of any Catholic country &mdash; perhaps Spain and Portugal may have done so until their respective revolutions &mdash; which enforces a particular moral view in the area of contraception by means of criminal measures.</P>
    <P>The most conspicuously Catholic country in the world in recent years has been Poland; and I take it for granted, since the Polish Government is composed of Marxist atheists, that there is nothing in Poland analogous to the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1935.  Looking at it, perhaps from an ignorant perspective, there seems to be no lack of vitality in the Church which Cardinal Glemp leads and I cannot see any sign of corruption or <Col N="177" /> degradation among the Polish Catholic people.  In fact, if the evidence, which admittedly tends to be displayed in political settings, is anything to go by, the reverse is the truth.  I wonder whether the Irish people, even in present conditions and even for so long as they have the beautific enjoyment of Deputy Haughey's Act, would produce displays of spontaneous fidelity to their Church and carry them through in the face of governmental opposition and disapproval as widespread as has been seen in Poland in the last few years.  I offer that view with humility, although I know some of my audience will not believe that possible. I am not a close follower of Church affairs and I may have got quite a wrong impression of this question in so far as other countries are concerned, but these reflections are made in the certainty that clerical intervention here will be misinterpreted and that we are virtually unique in the Catholic world in having laws of this kind.  This leads me to think that it might have been more prudent for the Church to address its people through parish pulpits and through its ordinary medium of spiritual leadership rather than through formal episcopal statements, although I defend the right of the bishops to make them and reject the criticisms which have been levelled at them for opening their mouths about anything.</P>
    <P>I am getting a bit tired of reading that frequently heard and glib suggestion that it is the duty of an Opposition to oppose. Of course, in a sense it is.  It is paid by the people to oppose that which it judges deserves opposition; but it is not a maxim which can be taken literally because, if it were, no Bill, no stage or section of a Bill, no question, motion, estimate or resolution would go through this House without opposition, votes and conflict. The few Deputies that are here know that that is not so and that measures are waved through regularly.  We had an example this afternoon although I admit the circumstances were very special.  Deputy Tunney knows that many measures go though without provoking opposition from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> Their own reports of the Fianna Fáil Party meeting on the subject held last week or the week before agree that the party leader said &mdash; if I am wrong about this, Deputy Tunney will put me right, as he would say himself, <i>quam celerrime</i>&mdash; that whatever about the rights and wrongs of this Bill &mdash; this was in answer to Deputies who had voiced general agreement with what the Bill was trying to do &mdash; he saw in this Bill a chance of unhorsing the Government, of embarrassing and demoralising them and, ultimately, of breaking them up.  Even that is a legitimate, political ploy.  If I think that a Government are unconditionally a disaster, which was my opinion all through the time when Deputy Haughey sat over here, I certainly would take any course consonant with keeping the law and not doing anything false, treacherous or dishonourable to put them out.</P>
    <P>However, there are exceptions to that rule and one is where the national interest on balance is likely to be more injured by the Opposition acting rigidly and opposing everything, just for the sake of doing so, if as a result the Government are frustrated in what they are doing, than if it forbears to offer that much opposition.  This case is a direct consequence of the inter-position of a whole row of bishops.  One of our cant phrases is that the North is our first national problem and that the destruction of the Border &mdash; by peaceful means, of course &mdash; is our first national objective.  Even the opinions &mdash; contemptible though they may be in some respects &mdash; of the majority in the North have to be of some little interest.  They are gleefully saying to one another: &ldquo;Look at your men below.  The bishops have them again&rdquo;.  That need not have been the case if the bishops had stayed clear of this controversy, but it has become the case and has given a kind of edge to this confrontation which otherwise might not have been there.  Even though it has not influenced anything I said in the debate up to this &mdash; I still have the same opinions &mdash; it makes me extra apprehensive about the national results if this Bill is defeated.  What will Deputy Tunney say the next time he goes to <Col N="179" /> Bodenstown?  Will he be able to hold his head up if this Bill is defeated?  If every Orangeman from Limavady to Newry is cheering because it is demonstrated once again that his forefathers were right and that the Roman Church will do down any democratic government, how will Deputy Tunney say that he took part in that result?  Without being rhetorical or wounding at the expense of Deputy Tunney, I appeal to the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have expressed either agreement or a lack of disagreement with this measure not to oppose it and not to incur the reproach of having driven yet another wedge between us and the Protestant population in the North.  I ask them not to hand the Unionists yet another stick with which to belabour the Nationalist cause.  I ask them not to oppose this Bill, but I do not ask them to cross the lobby.  By having the courage of their convictions they will do more than ensure the passage of this Bill; they will bring a breath of spring into the House and a new season in which we may have a chance, which I hope for always, of a new climate and a new growth.</P>

      <P>Since this Bill was introduced the debate has exploded on to the public scene and it has become far more an issue of who rules rather than a question of family planning or the availability of non-medical contraceptives. There is a very strong case to be made for a calm rational debate in this House on the merits or demerits of the Bill, but to a large extent that has been made practically impossible as a result of the intervention of the bishops on the one hand and the fact that a number of Deputies from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties have decided to claim conscience. Conscience is a very strange thing.  It only applies to sexual matters apparently. Fianna Fáil have decided to use this disarray on the Government side as a means of unhorsing the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official Fianna Fáil position on the Bill is not that they are opposed to it. They have not presented a case that there is no need for improvement in the family <Col N="180" /> planning area.  Their basic case appears to be that there is no demand for it and that there are more important things to be done by the Government.  On both counts they have no case.  There is a demand for comprehensive family planning facilities.  The various opinion polls which were published recently, one by <i>The Irish Times</i> and the other which the Minister produced, clearly indicate that there is a demand for comprehensive family planning facilities.  I presented the Minister with more than 6,000 signatures from people around the city who indicated that they required that comprehensive family planning facilities should be provided through the health board clinics. I have received numerous letters from practically every county showing that there is demand for such facilities. The only objection I have to the Bill is that it does not provide for comprehensive family planning but is only a very minor step on the road to meet the needs that exist.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal later with the question of the State and the Archbishop's statements.  It is important to stress one other issue in relation to the point made by Fianna Fáil and in some cases by members on the Government side that there are more important issues to be dealt with.  I might be one of those Deputies who would argue very strongly that there is urgent need for Government action on unemployment, poverty and so on and that the level of social welfare payments are deplorable and a disgrace, but I will not attempt to nor will I argue that the quality of women's lives are any less important than those issues.  The question of unwanted pregnancies is equally as important as the question of unemployment and poverty and the development of responsible attitudes towards sexuality by both men and women are equally important to the other social problems we face.  I ask those who argue that there are more important issues why they did not promote the same views when we had at least as much unemployment and poverty in 1983 when that ridiculous and nonsensical eighth amendment of the Constitution was forced through this <Col N="181" /> House and forced before the people in a referendum.  It is completely inconsistent to argue that there are more important things than family planning facilities and that there is no time to debate this issue for a few hours in the House having spent practically a whole Dáil session debating an issue for which there was no real demand.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House will be aware that The Workers' Party has always been critical of the 1979 family planning legislation and has consistently argued that a comprehensive family planning service should be provided as an integral part of our overall health system. Our party's approach to family planning is governed by the belief that it is a fundamental personal right to plan the number and spacing of one's children and that it is an important area of preventative health.</P>
    <P>In some other countries, particularly in the Third World, concern about the long term implications of rapid population growth is the primary argument for family planning, but in this country recognition of the right of women to control their own fertility, together with concern for the personal health of women and their families, must be the factors to be taken into account when deciding on our policy in this area.</P>
    <P>It has now been established beyond any doubt that women who bear children too early, or too late in life, or have too many children or too many children too close together, put themselves and their children at risk.  Teenage pregnancies are particularly at risk.  A recent Pan American Health Survey on infant deaths showed that 26 out of over 1,000 children born to mothers under 20 died in the first year of life, compared to 15 per 1,000 born to mothers in their late twenties.</P>
    <P>Women who become pregnant in their later years take on particular health risks for themselves and their children.  Once women pass the age of 30, their chances of bearing a premature or underweight baby begins to rise along with the chances of experiencing complications during childbirth.  Infant mortality rates rise also.  Older mothers are more likely than <Col N="182" /> younger mothers to bear babies with congenital defects.  The clearest rise in genetic risk involves the condition known as Down's Syndrome, commonly called mongolism.  The incidence of Down's Syndrome among infants rises dramatically with the mothers age &mdash; ranging from near zero among babies born to young mothers to as many as 14 per 1,000 among infants born to mothers over the age of 40.</P>
    <P>That is a fact, regardless of whether a mother is married or unmarried.  The number of children a woman bears affects her health and that of her family to a significant degree.  A first birth carries a slightly higher risk of complications or death of her child than in the case of later babies, primarily because the first birth reveals any physical weakness or genetic abnormalities in the mother or the father. With the fourth birth the incidence of maternal deaths, stillborn deaths and infant and child mortality begins to rise. Clearly, general health would improve remarkably if comprehensive family planning measures were more widely available and more widely used to reduce early and late pregnancies, to enable couples to have only the number of children they want and to keep a healthy interval between births.</P>
    <P>The 1979 legislation is clearly inadequate and has failed to meet the needs of the community.  Deputy Haughey's 1979 Act is restrictive, sectarian, discriminatory and inefficient.  It was based on political expediency rather than on medical or social needs and, for those reasons, it was strongly opposed by The Workers' Party.  We pointed out the law would be unworkable, that it would discriminate against people dependent on the public health service and against those outside major urban centres and that it created a distinction between &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and other methods of contraception purely on sectarian grounds, purely on the grounds that the rhythm method was the one acceptable to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and that other methods were not acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>Here it should be made clear that the debate put forward by some Deputies <Col N="183" /> here last Thursday about contraceptives, about condoms and their objections to their being available to young people, is dishonest.  What they really believe is that contraceptives should not be available to anybody.  They believe that regardless of whether a person is married or single, is over 18 or under 18 years, there should be no access to contraceptives because they regard their use as immoral.  These people believe the bishops have the right to state this and that as loyal Catholics they must obey the bishops.  I intend to go into that aspect later.</P>
    <P>It should be clear that many of those opposing the Bill in this House are not being entirely honest when they argue on the 18 year age limit.  What they would like to see is the abolition of availability of contraceptives to anyone, regardless of age and marital status.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Deputy Tunney will tell us if he thinks contraceptives should be available to anyone?  Perhaps those who are opposing this Bill will express their view on whether contraceptives should be available?  The Roman Catholic position is that contraceptives are immoral.

      <P>The Deputy is not listening.  Perhaps he should continue writing his notes and let me get on with my contribution.  He can make his speech when I am finished.  It is clear that the law has been openly flouted, simply because it was never workable in the first place.  Over 100,000 couples use the voluntary family planning clinics and almost one million condoms were imported in one year alone.  For women outside of the few major towns that have a voluntary clinic the situation is very difficult unless they have the money to travel or a sympathetic doctor is available, that is assuming they can find a doctor who has not got scruples of conscience.  Neither option appears to be very common and such areas have produced many harrowing case histories.  There are many areas where pharmacists have simply refused to stock non-medical contraceptives.  I understand there is not one chemist in the 50 mile stretch between Galway city and Clifden who stocks contraceptives. Another problem for women in these areas is the marked tendency to over-prescribe the pill which is a relatively high-risk form of contraception because of the poor levels of knowledge and training on the part of many doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind there is a widespread demand for contraception to be made more widely available.  This was confirmed by the poll carried out by <i>The Irish Times</i> and is backed up by the poll referred to by the Minister in his speech which was prepared for the Health Education Bureau by Irish Marketing Surveys Limited.  <i>The Irish Times</i> poll shows that 41 per cent of those surveyed believed contraceptives should be made available to everybody.  Even more significantly, a substantial majority of those in the child-bearing ages &mdash; 66 per cent among those under 24 and 55 per cent between 25 and 34 years &mdash; were in favour of providing contraceptives for all. <Col N="185" /> At the same time, the strongest opposition to any change came from those over the age of 65, clearly outside the child-bearing age.</P>
    <P>Major organisations such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, representing almost 600,000 workers &mdash; far more representative than some of the small groups who are ranting against this Bill &mdash; have expressed support for a liberalisation of the law.  I, and as far as I know every other Deputy and Senator, received a letter last December from the Irish Transport and General Workers Union which made clear their support for a liberalisation of the law.  I am referring to a letter dated 17 December 1984 which was addressed to all Senators and Deputies in connection with the Family Planning Act, 1979, and which was signed by May O'Brien, Women's Affairs official of the ITGWU.  The first paragraph stated:</P>
    <P>Lest it should be believed that there is no demand for a replacement of the above Act by legislation that is appropriate for today's needs, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has already made submissions to the appropriate Minister for new legislation.  They represent a substantial sector of the public.  It goes on to indicate that they support the Congress position and are urging Deputies to push for change in the 1979 legislation.  I would address a number of remarks to a number of Deputies in this House.  I am thinking particularly of Deputy Prendergast who declared himself to be speaking as a trade unionist.  He is a member of the ITGWU and I understand that he was a full time official with that union up to recently.  I ask him why he finds himself unable to support not only his party's position on this Bill but his trade union's position also.  There is some question about his consistency in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of demand, I have indicated that I handed over 6,000 signatures to the Minister about a year ago and 2,000 of those signatures were from the Dublin North-West area. <Col N="186" /> Other people independently of me and of The Workers' Party had collected signatures of people seeking an extension of the 1979 Act and comprehensive family planning.  Along with that a scientific survey in the Dublin North-West constituency which I represent was carried out by the Dublin north-west women's group on the attitudes of women on various matters which showed that 93 per cent of the women surveyed indicated that they would favour an extension of the 1979 Act and the provision of comprehensive family planning facilities through health board clinics.  That survey, information on the matter in which it was conducted, the list and so on are available to anyone who cares to have a look at it.  It was published in the press about six months ago.  Some people just do not want to acknowledge that a demand exists.  It is easy to stand up here and say that there is no demand, nobody has approached me.  The reality is different.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, my one reservation about the Bill before the House is that it does not go far enough.  By any standards it is a very limited measure and it seeks simply to amend one section of Deputy Haughey's Irish solution to an Irish problem. The Workers' Party believe that it is disappointingly narrow because it makes no attempt to provide facilities which could have been provided.  Indeed, the Bill represents a retreat on the part of the Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond. In an interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> in January 1983 he described the 1979 Act as most unsatisfactory and based on outmoded and unworkable regulations. He went on to say that he would most likely propose that most sections of the 1979 Act be repealed.  In an article in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 29 May 1983 that paper's political correspondent, Geraldine Kennedy, who has shown herself to be fairly well informed about Government intentions &mdash; we know that in the past a Government were also fairly well informed about her intentions &mdash; outlined proposals which she stated the Minister was to put to the Government regarding <Col N="187" /> amendments to the 1979 Act.  Among the more significant of these were suggestions that the special position accorded to a natural family planning would be dropped and that it would be made lawful to distribute or publish literature relating to contraceptives.</P>
    <P>None of these points has appeared in the Bill, and the Minister owes us an explanation.  If he believes that most of the 1979 Act should be repealed, why have the Government not brought in a Bill which will do that?  This Bill simply tinkers with the 1979 Act and makes no attempt to move towards the provision of comprehensive family planning services as an integral part of the overall health system.  Neither has any attempt been made in this Bill to deal with family planning related health matters such as breast examination, cervical smear testing and menopausal and sexual counselling. It is to be regretted that the Minister did not extend the definition of contraception to include the provision of tubal ligation and vasectomy and require each health board to provide these services. Certainly the demand for tubal ligation is significant.  However, the only hospital where this service is provided is in Cork and the waiting list there is now so long that patients are not being accepted from outside the Southern Health Board area. While the operation can be performed in some private clinics, it can cost up to £250 and is clearly beyond the means of many working class families.</P>
    <P>For some women tubal ligation is the only safe and effective form of contraception. Typically these are women in their thirties who have completed their families, who very often have health problems and for whom other forms of contraception are not suitable.  I have been told by at least one doctor in the Dublin area that he has women patients who are so desperate to have the operation performed that they have borrowed money from money lenders in order to get the funds to have it done in private clinics. Clearly that is unsatisfactory and unacceptable. The Department of Health and the health service should be ensuring that <Col N="188" /> proper comprehensive facilities are available. The absence of facilities for tubal ligation is one of the most glaring shortcomings of our family planning services. Strangely enough &mdash; perhaps not strangely enough given certain attitudes &mdash; there is nothing in the law to prevent it being carried out if you have the money, but I am very disappointed that the Minister has not recognised the importance of this facility for working class women and ensured, as he can ensure, that at least one centre is in each health board area to offer this service to medical card holders and those entitled to free hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Minister has included an age limit in the new Bill although none was provided for in the 1979 Act.  This in some respects represents a backward move. The age limit has been set at 18 years, although we were told last year that the Minister would be proposing an age limit of 16 years.  Previous experience has shown that age limits are almost impossible to police and that they lead to all sorts of anomalies.  For instance, if this Bill is passed a 17 year old who will be able to get a job if he can find one &mdash; at least he is entitled to one &mdash; will be entitled to pay taxes if he is fortunate enough to get a job, is entitled to drive a car if he can afford one, will be able to join the Army if he is fortunate enough to do so and can marry if he is fortunate enough to find the person with whom he wants to live, will still not be able to buy a condom.  Presumably he could also go out to the Garda station to get a licence for a shotgun, but he still will not be able to buy a condom.</P>
    <P>Is it not ridiculous?  Does it not make a laughing stock of this House and Deputies who proclaim to be democratically elected in the interest of all the people of this State?  If the Bill must contain an age limit &mdash; I accept that there are arguments for and against an age limit &mdash; I am not too bothered.  If a person is capable of using a condom then surely the facilities should be available to that person to have that condom if he so desires.  Surely it is not unthinkable that a person would wish to prevent an unwanted pregnancy at any <Col N="189" /> age.  Regarding the talk of condoms being available to 12 year olds, could anyone please show me a 12 year old who is capable of using a condom?  It is totally ridiculous.  It is physically not possible. At least if an age limit must be brought in to placate certain sensitive feelings in this House, it should be struck at a level at which young people become sexually active.  It does not make sense otherwise.</P>
    <P>Between 1975 and 1983 over 11,000 children were born to single girls age 19 years or under.  That is over one-third of all the illegitimate births in the country. A great number of these must have involved girls under the age of 18.  This Bill will do nothing to deal with that situation. However, our main criticism of the Bill is not so much what it contains but what it should have included.  There is a failure to take any step to require health boards to supply family planning services free of charge to those entitled to free health services in other matters.  The statistics I quoted at the outset indicate that contraception and family planning are fundamental health matters and should be available free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for them.</P>
    <P>There can be no longer any justification for retaining the bias towards what are called natural family planning methods and which are referred to in the 1979 Act. As a married man with a family I can think of no more unnatural method of family planning than the Billings or rhythm method.  If anyone else here is honest he will admit, too, that it is totally unnatural to use that method.  To make a distinction between what are known as natural and what are known as unnatural methods of family planning is to distort the case.  There has been written into our legislation the theological thinking of one Church in this State, that is, that all forms of contraception other than what are known euphemistically as natural methods, are immoral and can never be right.  Therefore, this House decides that no one must be encouraged to use unnatural methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>While other methods of family planning are available in some circumstances, only the so-called natural method can be <Col N="190" /> promoted by the Minister through the health boards.  The Workers' Party are not opposed in any way to the rhythm method.  Anyone who wishes to use that method is free to do so.  I submit that those under 18 are just as entitled to use such methods as is anyone over 18. However, we recognise that these methods are not always suitable for couples, and most important, are not always in the best medical or social interest of a couple.  It is worth noting, too, that the last WHO survey on the Billings method concluded that it could not be recommended as a safe and effective method of birth control for all couples.  The provision in the 1979 Act which restricts the Minister to allocating finance for research into natural methods only should be dropped and I should be glad to hear the Minister during this debate indicate a proposal on those lines.  That provision prevents research in this country into developing safer and more effective forms of contraception.  The section in the Act which prohibits the distribution of contraceptives except by way of sale is extraordinary.  Effectively this means that anyone who passes condoms to another is in breach of the law.  The mind boggles at the kind of policing which would be necessary to put that piece of legislation into effect.  It is totally impractical. Obviously its only purpose is to placate those who trust no one, young or old.  These are the people who represent the modern version of those who used to walk around the backs of cinemas spying on courting couples, who used to make young people feel ashamed of their sexuality, who in many cases twisted and destroyed the youthfulness of young people by leading them to believe that their sexuality was in some way dirty. The reaction of some groups and individuals to this Bill suggest that many have not matured very much since those days.</P>
    <P>Many of those who engaged in intolerance and bigotry to force through the 1983 constitutional amendment are clearly using the same methods again in relation to this Bill.  For instance, there has been an attempt by opponents of the Bill to suggest that those who are anxious <Col N="191" /> for changes in the law in this regard are foisting their moral position on the public.  The opposite is the case.  We are trying to ensure that citizens can choose freely the method of family planning which suits their situation and needs. None of us who is supporting this Bill is suggesting that those who are opposed to contraceptives &mdash; and there are many who are opposed to what they refer to as artificial methods of contraception &mdash; should be compelled to use these methods, but it is clear that many of those who are opposed to the use of contraceptives are endeavouring to deny a fundamental right to those to whom contraception is morally acceptable.  In many cases contraception is a serious health consideration.  The opponents of the Bill are the ones who are trying to force their moral viewpoint on the people and they are doing so by attempting to have legislation passed which mirrors only the conservative Roman Catholic position.</P>
    <P>Some other most extraordinary claims have been made, too.  Fianna Fáil's spokesman on Agriculture, Deputy Noonan, saw fit to refer to the Bill outside this House on Friday week last.  He is reported as having said that the Bill would open the sluice gates to widespread promiscuity.  The Archbishop of Dublin spoke of moral decline and of a growth in venereal diseases.  Such statements are an insult to the people of this island and especially to the young, because what the Deputy and the Archbishop are saying is that the people of Ireland cannot be trusted to act responsibly.</P>
    <P>Contraceptives have been available widely in Northern Ireland for more than 30 years but there is no evidence there of widespread promiscuity, of moral decline or of a growth in venereal diseases as a result of the availability of contraceptives. Are Deputy Noonan and Doctor McNamara trying to suggest that the people of the Republic are less responsible than those who live in Northern Ireland?  If so, they should at least produce the evidence.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset also to my <Col N="192" /> regarding the intervention of some of the bishops as a challenge to the authority of this House.  The interventions of Doctor McNamara and of some of his colleagues have not contributed to an atmosphere for rational debate but they have raised serious questions about Church-State relations.  The Archbishop is entitled to specify what he regards as sinful for the members of his Church.  But it is the right and responsibility of elected representatives in this House to decide what should be legal or illegal for all the citizens of the State.  What the Roman Catholic bishops are saying, in effect, is that the Roman Catholic Deputies &mdash; the overwhelming majority in this House &mdash; must vote as they are told by the bishops because the bishops are the only people capable of deciding what is in the interests of the common good and of distinguishing right from wrong.  That, clearly, is an attempt to subvert democracy.  It is an attempt to subvert the Dáil's responsibility and freedom to legislate for all the citizens.</P>
    <P>Given our history and the record of the Roman Catholic church in this and, indeed, other countries, it is not surprising that the Hierarchy should attempt to impose its will on the politicians.  What is surprising, very disappointing and, indeed, alarming is that there are any politicians in this House who are prepared to cave in to that kind of dictate from bishops.  I do not care whether it is Roman or Protestant bishops, Jewish churchmen or any other variety of religious persuasion, deputies elected to this House are elected by the vote of the people and they are entitled to carry out their responsibilities in the light of the policies which they were elected to pursue in this House.</P>
    <P>In many respects we are paying the price for the failure of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Coalition parties to stand up to that kind of pressure during the debate on the 1983 constitutional amendment. It may or may not be worth remembering that it was the Taoiseach who first made a promise to introduce such an amendment.  One thing is clear.  If the new Family Planning Bill we are discussing today fails to pass through this House, <Col N="193" /> there will be very little prospect for this or any future Government, whether Coalition, Fianna Fáil, or any other combination of parties, being allowed to introduce reforming social legislation and get it through the House if that legislation is not acceptable to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.  Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side and on the Government side should think very carefully about the precedent which they may set with their attitudes to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of calls to conscience.  From my short time in this House it appears that calls to conscience are selective.  It is only when matters relating to sex, family planning or divorce come up that conscience is raised. We have not had any declarations by any Deputies in this House that it was against their conscience to vote for cuts in food subsidies, but I would argue that that is as much a moral issue as is the availability of contraceptives.  We have not had any declarations of conscience relating to the number of Deputies in this House who hold down two jobs in spite of the fact that there are 230,000 people unemployed in this State.  Surely that is a moral question which should exercise the conscience of the Deputies.  We have not had anyone declaring that he or she has qualms of conscience about the way our society treats the travelling people, or how the local authorities of which they are members consistently refuse to provide housing or services for our travelling population.  Try that as a moral question to which they should be addressing their conscience.  We have not had anybody standing up here saying that he or she has qualms of conscience about the level of social welfare payment to our poor. Surely that is a moral question which should be exercising a conscience.  I could go on for the rest of this debate listing the areas in which Deputies should be exercising their consciences &mdash; informed or otherwise, informed by themselves or by their bishops.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the crucial points is that we have been challenged by the bishops to obey.  If we knuckle under to that demand we do so at the expense of the <Col N="194" /> sovereignty of this House.  Put very simply, why should we bother standing for election, having the expense of this apparatus of democracy if all we need are a couple of dozen men sitting in Maynooth, who have the benefit of all understanding, all wisdom, who can decide what is right or wrong, what the common good is and declare &ldquo;This must be done and you must vote for it&rdquo;?  We are wasting our time.  We should not be in here at all if we accept that any group of men outside this House can dictate to the House what form legislation should take or what way any Member of this House may vote. It is a denial of democracy and should be seen and recognised as such.  The dangers inherent in it should be recognised by every Deputy.</P>
    <P>With regard to Fianna Fáil, their reaction to this Bill has shown them once again to be the most opportunistic and perhaps the least principled party in Irish politics.  They are aware that the Coalition Government are divided on the matter and have decided that the maximum political advantage must be sought, irrespective of the merits of this Bill. The question of family planning is of no concern to them.  They must play their political game by undermining the Government and scuttling this Bill if they can, even though they admit that if they defeat this Bill it will not mean a general election.  In that case the Bill will be defeated and the needs of the people of this State will have been ignored by Fianna Fáil and a combination of dissident Fine Gael and Labour Deputies in order to gain some imagined political kudos.</P>
    <P>In their cynical approach to the 1983 amendment and in their reaction to this Bill we have surely seen the final transformation of Fianna Fáil from the party which they were certainly in the thirties.  They then liked to consider themselves as a radical party.  They are now quite clearly the most conservative establishment party.  In the thirties the general understanding was that Fine Gael were the bishop's party while Fianna Fáil faced the constant threat of the clerical lash or the belt of a crozier.  Now the <Col N="195" /> transformation is complete.  For them, the determining factor is that a marginal political advantage can be drawn from this affair.  The fact that people are suffering hardship and enduring health problems is of no concern to Fianna Fáil. The republicanism of Deputy Haughey clearly bears no relationship to the nonsectarian or secularist republicanism of Wolfe Tone, or indeed of Davis.</P>
    <P>I know there are Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who have privately acknowledged the need for change in our legislation.  They have said that they intend to come into this House and speak in favour of it.  Have they anything to say about their leader's perversion of republicanism? Is there not one among the 75 people who sit on these benches, now joined by another opportunist, Deputy John O'Connell, who ten years ago was in favour of contraceptives for everybody. Now because Fianna Fáil have graciously decided to accept him into the party, he says he will vote against it.  Surely that is gross opportunism.  Surely that is immoral.  Surely that is a cause for the exercise of somebody's conscience either in this House or outside.  Surely it is cause for the electorate to exercise their consciences the next time he places himself for election.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, to which Ireland is a signatory, includes the right to choose the number, the spacing of one's children and the right to safe and appropriate methods of contraception.  This Bill is a very limited attempt to move in that direction.  I am sure the Minister and other members of his party would agree that it is a limited attempt, that it is not what they would like to have before the House.  For that reason I would ask this House to support this Bill to ensure that it passes.  I would ask those Deputies who have decided to oppose it to think again, to think of the implications for the health of women and of the implications for the authority of this House if they agree to accept dictates from groups outside this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people outside of <Col N="196" /> this House have looked askance at the debate which has been taking place. Many people look at us and wonder what the fuss is about.  This Bill is not exceptional. It is fairly simple and its provisions will not radically alter Irish society or bring about any major social change.  Its enactment can best be described as a small step along the road to remove some of the more comical provisions contained in the legislation the present Leader of the Opposition introduced and passed through this House in 1979.  It will also cause the removal of some of the more unenforceable provisions in that legislation. Even Deputy Haughey on RTE radio last summer acknowledged that aspects of his Bill were unworkable and unenforceable, that they were trying to deal in the best way possible with what was a difficult issue in 1979, but that the Bill was something that would have to be reviewed and changed.  Then we had the somewhat sexy interview in <i>Hot Press</i> magazine from the same Leader of the Opposition in December of this year when he excited the nation by confirming that he believed that our family planning laws were not right and he further excited young people by proving how truly trendy he was &mdash; he used four-letter words.  But what happens when he is finally called to book and asked to put his legislative feet running in the same direction as his interview comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens, indeed?  I agree with Deputy De Rossa on this: Fianna Fáil have in this legislation engaged in the most disgraceful piece of opportunist politics I have seen since I have been a Member of this House.  They have engaged in a piece of politics that is patently dishonest, because Deputy Haughey and his colleagues know of the imperfections in the 1979 Bill.  They know the anomalies, they are aware of the nonsense of the contents of much of that legislation.  They will tell you about it in private.  During the time of its enactment, in private in this House, they were telling other Members of the House of the nonsense of some of the provisions but that they were in a sense the first steps to deal with an issue that this House had proved <Col N="197" /> incapable of dealing with until then. What are they doing now?</P>
    <P>This Bill, it has been suggested, is not merely inappropriate but according to the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Agriculture, whose absence has been noticeable since this debate, will create apocalyptic implications for our social structure in the future.  What does Fianna Fáil know about the current situation, that they would like to cover up?  The first thing they know about the current legislation is that it allows married and single people to obtain as many contraceptives as they wish.  Under the current legislation there is nothing to stop a 13 year old child arriving at Dublin Airport with a whole case-full of contraceptives, declaring to a customs official that he wants them for his own use and going gaily through the green exit and taking his luggage with him.  There is nothing in the 1979 Act that restricts contraceptives to married people.</P>
    <P>But the Act was cleverly drafted.  We had all sorts of exciting, interesting, undefinable phrases contained in it. Under the 1979 Act people are not supposed to have contraceptives made available to them unless they want them for bona fide family planning purposes or for other adequate medical reasons to be used in the proper circumstances.  That is a paraphrase of the legislation, and it does not make any more sense than what the Act contains.  It was a political formula that was picked by the Government to try to get over what they saw as something that might be difficult.  In fact that formula does not even apply to single people who travel in and out of the State. They can bring in as many contraceptives as they wish.  So, why all the fuss?</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing in the context of extending the availability of contraceptives to single people.  The 1979 Act made them available to single people, and members of Fianna Fáil are aware of that. If they are so aware, why did Deputy O'Hanlon last Thursday in the House say that making available the sale of contraceptives to single people over the age of 18 years was a major departure from the 1979 Act?  The 1979 Act made them <Col N="198" /> available to anybody and everybody, whatever their age.  This legislation tries in its way to restrict the availability of contraceptives without the necessity of a prescription to persons over 18 years. One of the oddities is that to some extent it is a bit more restrictive than the 1979 legislation.  What other things do Fianna Fáil know about the 1979 Act that they did not tell us?  They knew it was unworkable, they know it has never worked and they know that contraceptives were freely available in this State certainly since the McGee case in 1973 and that they continued to be available after 1979 despite the Act and have at all stages been available through family planning clinics and other outlets without a prescription being required.  Why are Fianna Fáil insisting that the prescription should retain its mystical role in Irish life in the context of the availability of non-medical contraceptives?  Deputy Noonan, the Fianna Fáil spokesman for agriculture, has an interesting view of life.  He is a person who does not beat about the bush and who says what he thinks on these issues.  He dealt with the issue of the prescription in a speech he made last Friday week shortly after this Bill was published, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 9 February 1985.  In that issue Deputy Michael Noonan, Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture, assured the nation that this Bill would receive his strongest opposition and said that &ldquo;as ever we in Fianna Fáil represent the values and traditions that make us Irish and we will continue to do so on your behalf&rdquo;.  Is one of the values and traditions that make us Irish the preservation of prescriptions?  Is this one of the new national aims that Fianna Fáil have elevated to the same level of importance as that party's alleged commitment to unity and the Irish language? Is the preservation of the prescription the great electoral slogan to be used the next time we go to the polls in a general election? Will they say, preserve the prescription because it is one of the traditions that make us Irish?</P>

      <P>But is it a part of what we might be again?  What is interesting about the performance of Fianna Fáil on this legislation is that they have not suggested what might happen if the Bill is passed. Will Fianna Fáil repeal it in the event of them again coming into Government? Will they retain the legislation if it is passed?  Will they breathe a sigh of relief if the Bill is passed and adopt the view that the legislation is something they can now forget about?  I find the whole performance of Fianna Fáil on this legislation quite extraordinary and opportunistic in a way that is most unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will not achieve a great deal.  If it is passed the necessity for prescriptions will be removed.  Married people who want to obtain contraceptives will not have to go to chemist shops to get them. If they wish to obtain them from the privacy of their doctor's surgery they will be able to do so.  Doctors will no longer be prosecuted for committing criminal offences by making available non-medical contraceptives to their patients.  It seems to me that it would be a good deal more desirable that individuals should be able to obtain non-medical contraceptives in the privacy of a doctor's surgery, if they wish to do so, rather than have to go to a chemist's shop.  What role should the doctors play?  The doctors have said &mdash; they said it in 1979 also &mdash; that they do not have any desire to have to prescribe non-medical contraceptives.  It was always a bit of a joke that the 1979 Act requires a doctor's prescription or authorisation for non-medical contraceptives. It is said that once a doctor writes a prescription or authorisation a married man can rely on it for the next 25 years, if he does not lose it.  That was an odd type of prescription.  Of course, the way that legislation was presented to the House was something different.  A doctor before writing a prescription was supposed to look into the whites of the eyes of the gentleman presenting himself to him, and having done that and checked the size of his knee caps was supposed to by way of prescription determine not merely whether that person should bona <Col N="200" /> fide have access to contraceptives but how many per month he would be entitled to.  No medical doctor suggested that that was a practical formula, but that was envisaged in the 1979 Act.  It is being got around by the somewhat joke formula that a person can get an authorisation for the next 20 or 25 years.  Why is it that Fianna Fáil want to preserve the prescription for non-medical contraceptives?  I do not know.  What pretence are they engaging in and for what purpose?  Why can we not deal with social issues in an honest way and honestly acknowledge what the social realities are outside the House?  Why can we not assess different pieces of legislation that come before us on the basis of those realities?</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the only argument being advanced by Fianna Fáil is that the Bill is not appropriate, that there is no rush for it.  However, six months ago the Leader of the Opposition agreed that legislation was necessary.  In the course of an interview on radio he agreed that there were parts of the country where people did not have access to family planning aids when our courts had declared their constitutional right of access to them.  Is any Member suggesting that the Bill will introduce anything new?  It has been suggested that that is the case. There have been all sorts of predictions as to what will happen to our society, but some of the people who are opposed to the Bill are not only objecting to its provisions but to the availability of contraceptives to anybody.  Deputy De Rossa is correct in saying that.  Some Members for genuine motives believe &mdash; it is one I disagree with &mdash; that the availability of contraceptives is an evil in society and that they should not be made available. For that reason they will oppose the Bill and, equally, they were opposed to the 1979 measure.</P>
    <P>The reality is that contraceptives are and have been available in Irish society but they are not available to everybody. They are more available in urban than in rural areas because some chemists will not stock them.  The Bill seeks to make available condoms to people without the <Col N="201" /> necessity of a prescription.  The suggestion that this will lead to some dramatic change is difficult to comprehend.  A lot has been said in the debate, about young people, but young people regard what is taking place in the House as somewhat comical.  They regard themselves as responsible people who wish to have the same rights of privacy that other people have.  They read of what is happening in the House and wonder what we are debating.  I must admit that on occasions I wonder.  In 1979 non-medical contraceptives were referred to as devices, and then non-medical contraceptives, but we have advanced and we are calling them condoms.  We have been told that the number of condoms imported in the last four years is in excess of 30 million.  If 30 million condoms have been imported in the last four years who is using them?  Are there only two or three people, sexual Olympians, outside the House who have used six million condoms in each of the last four years?  Who has been using them?  They are being used by the vast number of married people and by a good number of single people conducting relationships. Why are we so anxious about making non-medical contraceptives available without prescription?  Will there be a massive increase in the import of contraceptives?  I doubt if that will happen.  We are simply going to make it easier for some people who have difficulty acquiring them at present and have a constitutional right to have access to them.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that the availability of the condom will stir the passions of the population, that people will go on a sexual rampage, that, whatever about married people, young people as soon as the Bill is passed will immediately lose their senses and be attacking each other in the streets to such an extent that the whole morality and fabric of our society will collapse.  It is a sad view of our young people.  To the people who make that argument I should like to ask them if they have seen a condom.  Very few people who have will describe a condom as something that instantly stirs the passions of those who come in contact <Col N="202" /> with it.  Let us get down to the basics and stop talking nonsense on some issues giving the impression to people outside that we are living in cloud cuckooland. The reality is that the Bill is a minor legislative measure that will deal with some of the anomalies, not all, in the 1979 Act.</P>
    <P>In the context of the contribution made by Deputy John Kelly &mdash; and I would share the view he expressed &mdash; the criminal law has no role in this area, which is an area of privacy.  The Garda have no role in the bedroom.  The Garda have no role in supervising a doctor's surgery.  It is time we dealt with issues such as this in a somewhat more mature way than we seem to have been able to do to date.</P>
    <P>What about Deputy O'Hanlon, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health?  In a sense he had to come in and present a somewhat different case from that of Deputy Michael Noonan, the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Agriculture who seemed to put himself forward as some type of expert in this area.  It was interesting to note that his comment on this Bill was the first public comment he had made on any Bill since he had contributed in this House in the debate which took place on the Control of Bulls for Breeding Bill.  I am not suggesting there was any connection between his two contributions but some people outside the House began to wonder about it.</P>
    <P>What about Deputy O'Hanlon who said that if this Bill is enacted it will result in the indiscriminate distribution of contraceptives?  Who will distribute them indiscriminately?  Does he not trust the medical profession?  Are doctors going to stand around street corners inveigling young people into buying a few contraceptives from them?  Does he not trust the chemists?  The chemists have been operating, and will continue to operate, under some of the more nonsensical provisions of the 1979 Act.  Does he not trust the health boards?  Is he suggesting that the health boards will start some major sales drive to corrupt the population, to corrupt young people?</P>
    <P>One of the problems about debating issues such as this, particularly in this <Col N="203" /> country, is that there is always a great temptation for politicians to come out with some of the wellrun old political rhetoric and cliché comments.  When one begins to examine the whole substance behind what is being said the whole thing falls extremely flat and sounds extremely odd.  Much of this debate, to my thinking, really is comical to a lot of people.  It is an issue that is serious to others.  But the vast majority of young people see people in this House getting themselves upset, many people genuinely upset, but getting themselves upset without appearing to understand the realities of life outside the building that comprises Leinster House.</P>
    <P>I just wish we could deal with issues such as this in a somewhat more responsible way.  Indeed, I wish the Opposition could do so as well.  Of course the tragedy is, that the debate that is taking place does have its serious side.  I believe that in years to come what will be remembered will not be the contents of this Bill. Probably in some months to come the majority of people will not remember what were its specific provisions.  What will be remembered will be the tone of the debate, who said what, what attitudes were taken up by religious and non-religious leaders within our community, what were the attitudes adopted by the political parties, what things were said and what implications they have for the type of State we are trying to create and want.</P>
    <P>In reality this Bill has ceased to be concerned solely with the contents of the legislation embodied in it.  It is no longer solely about family planning.  It is no longer solely about contraception.  The way we vote in this debate, I believe, is no longer a matter of mere party politics. One of those who has contributed to this debate outside this House has suggested that we are at some sort of crossroads.  I think we are; I do not believe it is the moral crossroads.  I do not believe the passage of this Bill will affect one iota the moral values of Irish society or the moral values of any of our young people.  Those moral values will not come from whether this Bill is passed, they will derive from <Col N="204" /> the type of education those young people are given as children, they will derive from the values given to them by their parents, the values they learn in their schooling.  They will not be affected one way or the other by this Bill.  But the crossroads we are at is what I would describe as a legislative crossroads that will for many years to come determine the credibility of all of us as legislators.</P>
    <P>The ultimate legislative fate of this Bill is now symbolic of our capacity to act rationally as legislators and face up to the real social realities of Irish society as we see them today.  It is also symbolic of our capacity to debate and deal in a mature and rational way with an issue about which churchmen disagree and in respect of which disagreement this House cannot and should not act as some form of legislative arbitrator or adjudicator.  It is symbolic of our capacity to translate the verbal commitment to a pluralist republic in which legislators should, in debating issues such as this, be sensitive to the perceptions, and aspirations of the different traditions on this island and the different ethos represented by those traditions.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, and no one in their right mind would suggest, that whether or not condoms are made available without prescription as a result of the enactment of this Bill will in some way result in unity between North and South.  Anyone who makes that claim is talking rubbish.  But what this debate will influence is the perception of how we are capable of governing ourselves held by all of those who belong to the minority tradition on this island and who form part of the majority in the North of Ireland.  This is the first Bill that one could describe as sensitive in this sense since the report of the New Irish Forum.  I find it extraordinary that some of the public pronouncements made by different leaders, both political and religious, have not been as sensitive as they should have been to the impressions that those comments could create, to the preceptions they contribute to and to the prejudices they confirm.  Nobody in this debate yet has referred to the report of the New Ireland Forum.  I am talking <Col N="205" /> here not about the actual contents of this Bill but I am referring to the comments made about it by religious leaders, by politicians and that is what I think will remain with us.</P>
    <P>The contents of the Bill will be quickly forgotten.  What will be remembered will be the type of debate, the type of comment made, the level of maturity with which we are able to cope with an issue such as this.  Indeed, people will be concerned at the ways in which politicians and religious leaders reacted or were sensitive to the fears and worries of the different religious traditions on this island. I am afraid that much of the public comment made lacked a great deal of the necessary sensitivity.  Whether we in this House wish to accept it or not I believe that, if this Bill is rejected, we will help to copperfasten the prejudices and perceptions that the Northern Protestant, the minority tradition on this island, has had of this Republic since its creation.</P>
    <P>Page 19 of the report on the New Ireland Forum, under the heading of &ldquo;Nationalist Identity and Attitudes,&rdquo; at paragraph 4.6 had this to say:</P>
    <P>The positive vision of Irish nationalism, however, has been to create a society that transcends religious differences and that can accommodate all traditions in a sovereign independent Ireland united by agreement....</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4.7 says:</P>
    <P>The division of Ireland inevitably gave rise to the unconscious development in both parts of Ireland of partitionist attitudes on many political, economic, cultural and social questions of importance, diminishing significantly the development of a prosperous democratic society on the whole of the island.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4.8, dealing with &ldquo;Unionist Identity and Attitudes,&rdquo; states:</P>
    <P>....Although the true nationalist ideal rejects sectarianism and embraces all the people of Ireland whatever their religion, Northern Protestants <Col N="206" /> fear that their civil and religious liberties and their Unionist heritage would not survive in a United Ireland in which Roman Catholism would be the religion of the majority of the population. They base this fear on a number of factors including the diminution of the numbers of Southern Protestants since partition and the perception that the Constitution and certain laws in the South unduly favour the ethos of the predominant religion.</P>
    <P>What will be the perception of the Northern Protestant, after all the ecclesiastical comments that have been made if this legislation does not go through?  Perhaps I am treading on dangerous ground engaging in comment such as this, but I find it extraordinary that this has not been adverted to by Members of this House.  I find it more extraordinary that the Fianna Fáil Party, the party that project themselves as the one and only true Republican party, which seek to make claim of being the sole party concerned with unity on this island are, for the sake of political opportunism, willing to sacrifice what they appeared to agree to in the Forum report.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition keeps on telling us that his party will stick rigidly to the Forum report.  On page 23 of the report it states that the new Ireland must be a society within which, subject only to public order, all cultural, political and religious belief can be freely expressed and practised.  It goes on to say that &ldquo;the criteria which relate to public legislation may not necessarily be the same as those which inform private morality. Furthermore, public legislation must have regard to the conscientious beliefs of different minority groups.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In so far as the minority churches have commented on this legislation, they have all expressed the view that it should be passed.  That, apparently, is not something that Fianna Fáil believe should be taken into account in determining how that party deals with this legislation. Chapter 5 is probably one of the most important in the Forum report and is <Col N="207" /> frequently referred to and cited by members of all parties in this House.  On page 27, referring to civil and religious liberties and rights, it says they must be guaranteed and that there can be no discrimination or preference in laws or administrative practices on grounds of religious belief or affiliation.  It says that Government and administration must be sensitive to minority beliefs and attitudes, and seek consensus.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the enactment of this Bill will result in an accommodation between the Nationalist and Unionist traditions or will solve the tragedy of the current conflict in Northern Ireland, but the failure of the Bill to be passed because of the type of public comment which has been made will copperfasten the views of the Northern Protestants, and also the views and fears of many who belong to the minority traditions and religions in this island, that there are areas of our national life with which we cannot deal as legislators except by following the traditions of one church in this House.  We should be conscious of that and of its implications.  The problem is that for political expendiency Fianna Fáil will vote against a Bill to which I believe most members of the Fianna Fáil Party have no objection.  The behaviour of Fianna Fáil in this instance is symbolic of their inability to stand over the Forum report or to behave in a manner which indicates that they genuinely agree with Chapters 4 and 5 of that report and the commitments and aspirations contained therein to achieve a form of reconciliation on this island.  Fianna Fáil are so opportunistic and cynical in their behaviour that not only are they not willing to stand over the Forum report, they have spancelled members of their own party and prevented them from expressing views in this House.  Where are the women members of Fianna Fáil?  Where is Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the chairperson of the Committee on Women's Rights?  Where are Deputy Mary Harney and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were able to <Col N="208" /> do the two steps forward, one step backwards operation at the meeting of the parliamentary party last Wednesday when, apparently, in the interests of their own selfish electoral position it was arranged that the party proceedings would be leaked so that some of their constituents would know that they did not really approve of what their party was doing in the House but, as loyal party members, they were going to vote with them in the lobbies?  Where are the Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party who are conscious of the views expressed in the Forum report to which I have referred?  Where is Deputy Dr. John O'Connell?  What has happened to him?  He is the man who rightly derided the 1979 legislation.  He came into this House during that debate in 1979 and exposed that legislation as a nonsense, unenforceable and hypocritical. What will he do now?  He will walk up the steps to the lobby to try to retain and copperfasten the provisions of the 1979 Act.  It is extraordinary that a political party which expresses aspirations towards unity and whose leader said that his own legislation needs to be reformed, can behave so cynically on such minor legislation, purely in the hope that they might win a vote on the floor of this House without looking at the consequences of their actions or the effects of their actions on the perception of the way we, as legislators, deal with the realities of life outside this House.  I am sorry that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have expressed views publicly, by way of an arranged leak of their parliamentary party meeting, do not have the courage to come into this House and tell us what they really think about this legislation.  I regret the fact that they have to play the political game and that they do not have the courage to appear here and vote with their feet in accordance with the views they expressed, not simply within the parliamentary party, but in press releases since that meeting.  The naked cynical opportunism of the exercise conducted by that party will not enhance Fianna Fáil's electoral chances.  Their behaviour on this Bill will be seen to be a major error during the course of the lifetime of <Col N="209" /> this Government.  It will be seen as an act of political cynicism unsurpassed by any previous politicking by that party.  No doubt, at the end of the debate <i>Hot Press</i> will again interview the Leader of the Opposition and we may find out what his current views are on the issues of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not think <i>Hot Press</i> has been previously quoted in this House, but it is read by a great many young people.  In the edition of 14 December 1984 there is a picture of the Leader of the Opposition on the front page.  He is wearing an open necked shirt, without a tie and he looks very well.  It could be described as a trendy photograph and the following interview took place:&mdash;</P>
    <P>On the subject of the current contraceptive debate: isn't it true that the actual behaviour and practice of young people has long since made the question irrelevant? &ldquo;(Pause) Ah, yeah, I think that is probably true enough&rdquo;.  It is all very academic at this stage. . .  &ldquo;Yeah.  (laughs) I think so, yeah&rdquo;. What about in your own day?  Was it like that then?  Ah now (laughs) To my dying day, I'll regret that I was too late for the free society.  We missed out on thatIt came too late for my generation</P>

      <P>Was the free society Deputy Haughey wanted to participate in one where a prescription for condoms was required or one where you could acquire condoms without a prescription? What was he talking about?  What was that interview about?  It was all about creating perceptions.  Here we are, we are a good political party full of trendy people, even our leader is trendy and we recognise the problems of young people, we are prepared to face up to family planning legislation.  What happens when they come into this House and are put to the test?  That is where the public relations exercise is seen to fall flat on its face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt but that, in the long term, this will be seen in the legislative <Col N="210" /> sense as not very important legislation. The debate and the vote on this issue will be seen as something of a legislative turning point and as an important political event.  I only wish that all the brouhaha about this legislation and all the statements and excitement it gave rise to could be created about other aspects of social legislation and policy which are in need of reform.  If only we could have similar excitement to force Governments to produce legislation to deal with some of the areas Deputy De Rossa referred to.  For example, three years ago when two young children, in two different instances, were battered to death because inadequate laws failed to provide sufficient powers to enable them to be taken into care, where was the public excitement? Who made speeches about it?  I and another Deputy raised that issue but we still do not have laws to deal with the area.  Hopefully we will have them shortly.</P>
    <P>What about illegitimacy?  If we are concerned about young children and since we passed the pro-life amendment 18 months ago and many then stated they also wished to ensure that young women did not cross the water to have abortions, why do we still discriminate against children born outside of marriage and turn them into second class citizens?  Why not have a similar brouhaha about that?</P>
    <P>In dealing with this issue outside the House people have failed to take into account the realities of life today.  If this legislation is not passed this House will disgrace itself in the eyes of the vast majority of young people and will be seen to be irrelevant.  The tragedy is that politicians are at a low ebb in the view of many young people.  If we are seen to be incapable of coping with a simple issue such as this to bring about a minor change in legislation in order to conform with some of the realities outside the House we will lose all public credibility as a Legislature.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who contribute to the rest of this debate will be sensitive to what I quoted from the Forum Report, to the impact of words that may be used <Col N="211" /> in a moment of passion and to the consequences for us all if we are not able to behave credibly as legislators in dealing with this issue.  I hope the Bill is passed and that we will deal with some of the other major areas of social legislation that have a higher level of importance than this issue.  When we come to deal with them and other issues such as illegitimacy I hope we will not see the more hysterical public reaction we have seen to this issue.</P>
    <P>Like my colleague Deputy Kelly I received many letters from reasonable people.  I was pleased to receive their views even though they did not necessarily coincide with my own.  I am happy to receive representations about any legislation and I am interested to hear people's views on it.  I wish that some people who should know better would express their views in a calmer way and not give respectability to a small minority in society whose views can, when a debate becomes passionate, be given an aura of respectability they do not deserve.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is passed and that next week we will get back to dealing with other business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter we are discussing is not a minor but rather a major and very serious matter.  It has not been my custom, since being elected to this House, to read speeches.  I do not propose doing that now, but while I was waiting here I endeavoured to encapsulate my thoughts.</P>
      <P>The availability of contraceptives is a social matter.  The use of contraceptives is a social moral matter.  The consequences of the use, because of their availability, becomes a political matter with social and moral consequences.  I hope that is not too convoluted for those people opposite who will be following my contribution and who might attribute something to me that I have not said.  My attitude and everything I will say is based on that formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a legislator, I must take cognisance of the consequences.  I do not propose to <Col N="212" /> follow the personality references, flippancy or levity that emanated from the two speakers who delivered themselves of their thoughts in my presence. I will speak from my experience in this House since 1969 of measures that came before the House.  Invariably they arrived after a long and gruelling lobbying outside.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I say that in 1969 I endeavoured to bring before the House legislation that would deal with the menace of wandering horses in my constituency and I was happy to note that last week we had such legislation.  The nature of legislation coming before this House has been inevitably the result of a painstaking pursuit by people outside and a dialogue between them and the public representatives.  After all the lobbying and pleading, some of it articulate and some that could only be regarded as babble depending on one's attitude towards the legislation in question, factors such as reason, logic, expediency and necessity were taken into account, and all of this preceded a measure coming before us.  It was accepted as a <i>sine qua non</i> of it being before us that the Minister concerned could show that he was satisfied it was acceptable to a cross-section of the people as a desirable social and political measure.</P>
    <P>I am sure that those who have been Members of this House during the years will accept that is a fair presentation of what preceded the introduction of measures before the House.  It also involved the Minister concerned in identifying the agent or agencies and the bodies, that had been associated with the measure. That is the normal tradition and practice with which I am familiar.  I must now ask if the present legislation stands that test.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech did the Minister identify for us all the persons, the agents, the agencies, the concerns and all the lobbyists who had been biting at his heels to introduce this legislation? I have not his Second Reading speech before me but to my recollection he did not so identify.  Rather he said it was part of the arrangement between the two parties who form the Government that <Col N="213" /> before they said goodbye to this House they would improve family planning legislation.  On the question of the legislation which the Minister introduced &mdash; we are told that when in doubt we should take account of the Irish version &mdash; it is entitled An Bille Sláinte.  In his speech the Minister did not identify why it was so urgent to bring forward legislation that could be shown to be necessary to improve the health of our nation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will bear with me, I will deal with ladies, young and old, in a few moments and I will be very interested in getting the reactions of the Deputy as to how I present my case for women.  It is not written down anywhere that one must be a woman to talk about women.  Otherwise it would be a very poor State in which we live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking that it be demonstrated to what extent the health of the women in Ireland, young and old, will be improved by this legislation.  At the moment I will confine myself to the younger women.  Unlike what Deputy De Rossa said about other speakers, I would never presume to suggest to any married lady or her husband how they should plan their family.  Neither would I presume to suggest to them what moral and religious teaching they should follow.  That is a matter entirely for themselves.  If they came to me privately for my advice I would give it to them, but so far as contributing to legislation here is concerned I have never presumed to dictate or to indicate to married people how they should look after their own family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to find out why all the normal ingredients that were evident to me in other legislation are not apparent in respect of the measure before the House. Because the interested groups or bodies have not been identified I am at liberty to surmise.  Everyone knows that an organisation called the Family Planning Organisation have an interest in the <Col N="214" /> matter.  They got some respectability in that the Minister for Health opened a clinic for them but I think they operate under rather dubious legal conditions.  I know they have a vested interest in the importation of the three million condoms that have arrived here.  Apropos of that, one would think the scourge of the nation was that we did not have more.  I do not accept that, but it is not a matter on which I will dwell here.  It appears the main thrust of the lobbying in respect of this legislation came from that agency.</P>
    <P>I saw in a document some time ago that they were happy to advertise with a certain measure of relief that the Minister for Health was compassionate and sympathetic and had some form of membership of their organisation.  It is a free country and the Minister is entitled to associate with whomever he pleases.  I venture to suggest that for a Minister who is so meticulous and so concerned about propriety that he might not have associated with them in breaking the law as it existed at the time.  It must be from that source that the request came, because the other reason advanced by the Minister is one I cannot accept on the evidence produced by him.  If he says that they are obligated to do it because it was in the to-ing and fro-ing and getting together of a piece of paper that preceded their coming into power, what about the other promises?  They are two and a half years in office now and they promised many other things of much greater importance. They promised that they would help to control unemployment.  They had Fianna Fáil jettisoned because at the point of their taking over 147,000 people were unemployed and they said that they could not tolerate that.  That figure is now nearly doubled.  They promised that they would improve the economic and social life of people, but everybody knows that it has worsened very much in their hands. They promised that they would introduce a Criminal Justice Bill.  They did, but it has not been enforced yet; no advantage of that Bill is evident yet.  Therefore, I cannot take that as their commitment to what was written down, even though <Col N="215" /> what was written down does not refer to what is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Here I am getting to the kernel of my objection to this legislation.  The Minister for Health, his party or any other party did not promise the people of Ireland that if elected they would make available to their daughters and to their sons contraceptives over the counter.  If they had done so they would not be where they are.  I ask any of the Deputies who will follow me to show me anywhere where that is written down, to refer me to any speech made by them prior to the last general election indicating that their concern for Government was that they could make contraceptives available to the young people of Ireland.  If they demonstrate that to me I will vote with them, but I know they cannot do so.</P>
    <P>Here I hope to benefit from the reaction of the two lady Deputies who are here.  Deputy Shatter and Deputy De Rossa said that people of 18 can vote and can join the Army.  They said that young people can go to work and pay taxes, so why not have contraceptives available to all these people who are over 18?  Deputy Shatter and Deputy De Rossa, knowledgeable men that they are, should know that in respect of the relationship between young people, the normal tendency is that a girl of 14, 15 or 16 relates to a boy of 18.  There may be exceptions, but I as a headmaster in a school experienced that every day of the week.  Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Shatter, even without experience of serving in a school, should know from their own experience that that is so.  During that period of what some would call calf love romanticising, girls of 16 relate to boys of 18, 19 and 20. Now I ask Deputy Monica Barnes, (1) does she accept that; (2) how does she feel in regard to a young male and his desires that Deputy De Rossa thinks should be satisfied?  Is he to take them to a girl of 15 or 16 who because contraceptives have been made fashionable by us will feel pressures that she never felt previously? Previously the normal and natural protection that she had, apart from her family training, was the fear of a baby <Col N="216" /> resulting from their relationship.  Now she has the pressure from this male who Deputy De Rossa feels is entitled to satisfy his desires.  Does Deputy Barnes want those desires satisfied on girls of 14, 15, 16 and 17 in her constituency?</P>
    <P>That is not an emotive, unreasonable presentation.  That is a presentation of fact, of the facts of life as they are for any parent, youth worker, teacher or Deputy to see if he or she is socialising with young people.  Somebody might say &ldquo;Well, if he does, what about it?&rdquo;  If he puts that calf love girl under the pressure of maybe losing the boyfriend if she does not do what he asks, is it to be argued that it is better for that girl to satisfy him?  Are we to argue that physically and psychologically it is a better thing for her? Will the Minister demonstrate to me how that is better for her health and for her family planning?  He knows as well as I know that the young man who will treat her in that fashion when it comes to settling down will search out as far as possible some girl who has never subjected herself to the satisfaction of some other man's desires in that way.</P>
    <P>That is what this legislation is about and that is its weakness.  I know that the young people in my constituency have votes but I would not pander to their ephemeral desires for the sake of getting their paltry vote.  Why should I?  I must treat them as I would treat my own.  What is good enough for mine is good enough for my neighbour and <i>vice versa</i>.  If I could be sure and had been sure in the past that the availability of contraceptives to my daughters at 14 or 15 years of age was protection for them, would add to the enrichment of their lives, would lead them to a better life here below &mdash; it is not my business to talk about the hereafter; I am talking of this purely as a matter of here below in the interests of the people whom we represent &mdash; this is where the matter of conscience comes into it.  I want to be able to face those young girls especially &mdash; leave the men aside for the moment &mdash; and say that what I did and said was not in deference to any political convenience.  I came in here with my own views and I have always expressed them. <Col N="217" /> To anybody who comes to me I give as far as I can what I regard as the best advice because then I can live with that and meet those people.  I notice a movement now by Deputies on that side away from this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no special illusions about myself. I was a normal teenager and I took life at its various stages as it came to me.  I did what was considered normal and what was expected from me at the various stages of my life.  Without apology to anyone, I can say that I was happy to live along the lines that my parents and my pastors set for me.  Indeed, I am indebted to them for the fact that at certain times in my life &mdash; and there were not too many of those &mdash; I was able to overcome the desires that Deputy De Rossa says we should all satisfy.  These were times when I left aside what might be regarded as the ephemeral pleasures for what I know now in retrospect to have been long term happiness. I do not wish to be associated with legislation which is put forward as health legislation, which is connected neither with health nor with family planning but which I regard as sick legislation.  This type of legislation reflects on society today.  We have had many outbursts and complaints, people criticising their bishops and telling us how they have been threatened but these are the people who have let down the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan, our spokesperson on Agriculture, has received some attention from those opposite in regard to a comment he made on this legislation, but anyone here who can boast of the standards and the record of Deputy Noonan in this House must be a happy man.</P>

      <P>There has been from the other side of the House an orchestration against bishops, against politicians and against anyone else who would presume to express himself on this legislation.  If one dares to speak against the Bill one is castigated as being a man of no courage, as being afraid of the bishops.  There is a confusion of licence with liberty.  There have been references to the pluralist <Col N="218" /> society, but earlier today this House found it necessary to introduce certain legislation and the necessity for that arose from the fact that there are people on this island who, in deference to what they think is a pluralist society, pursue lines and policies that are detrimental to everyone else.  In every society there must be organisation.  There must be rules and regulations, a consensus that makes it possible for us all to live as reasonable people.  There is no society in which it is possible to pander to the wishes and desires of everyone.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the attitude of the bishops as representing an attack on this House.  If we extend to other areas the Deputy's analogy of yielding to the desires of everyone, we will find greater need for worrying about the authority of this House than the fact that ministers of religion, as they are obliged to do, express their views on legislation. I do not wish to dwell on this topic to the extent that I might be accused of taking one side or the other but I do not apologise for being a Catholic, even a poor Catholic, though I should like to be a better one.  I am not in the least embarrassed that priests or bishops or ministers of other Churches should offer their views on the legislation.  Deputy Shatter asked us to consider what we were doing in regard to the views of people of persuasions other than the Catholic religion. The Deputy is one who is introducing the aspect of religion.  He accuses us of not listening to the words of the religious.  To my way of thinking a bishop whether he represents a large number of people or merely two, five or ten.  I notice that the religious of all the different persuasions who have spoken are unanimous with me in their opinion that there should be no sexual relations outside marriage.  I do not know, then, why they did not attack the legislation on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The irritability that is emanating from the people opposite stems from the fact that our society is already in a fairly unhealthy state.  I say that because the body of society is representative of all the citizens of that society.  It is well known that when we are not in the best of form <Col N="219" /> we attack other people.  The same happens in regard to society and our society is not in the best of form at the moment. It will be in very poor form if this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell unduly on what Deputy Shatter had to say but I consider his presentation to be as feeble and irresponsible a case as I have ever heard.  One would think that, as a legal man, he would be better able to present his case than might be the position in regard to the rest of us.  According to him, his concept of the need for this legislation arises from the possibility that any lone daring entrepreneurial boy or girl of 13 arriving at Dublin Airport could bring in lots of condoms. That is the weakness the Deputy sees in the present legislation.  Is he not hard up for an argument?  That is why the Deputy agrees with the Minister and it is why he disagrees with Deputy Flanagan. I have not heard Deputy Glenn yet.  As a legal person, Deputy Shatter is very sensitive to that possibility.  Perhaps he knows if there have been such cases, but I doubt it.  If legal men can earn salaries for making cases such as that, then I am in the wrong job.</P>
    <P>Like others who spoke during my presence here, I think that I have put before the House my thoughts but would add one or two random thoughts.  Deputy De Rossa said that any person who hands over a condom would be guilty of an offence.  Would he treat it as a joke if a lad of 18 or 19 years handed over one to his own daughter?  I said that I was treating this as a political matter.  I am concerned at what Deputy De Rossa said, again in pursuit of his wanting more condoms than are already available.  He said that the State should provide and pay for them, although he did not say in every case.  He said that they should be made available free to certain people.  The Deputy may be speaking for 6,000 throughout the country, but he is not speaking for the people of Finglas, of Whitehall or Santry.  At any meetings which I have attended I have never once heard a request that they should be available. I know what the reaction would be <Col N="220" /> if he were to tell the people that he thinks they should be paying for them, even though they do not agree with their being available.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Kelly that we should not always be anxious to follow the example of the island across the way. The cost to the British health scheme last year of the provision of contraceptives was £67 million.  Not too many in Finglas are in a position to contribute to that, so that young men can satisfy their desires on the young women of Ireland.  There may be people like that in other parts of the country, but I look forward to Deputy De Rossa at public meetings in Finglas repeating what he is saying here.  I have clarified my position regarding the needs or rights of married people &mdash; it is entirely a matter for themselves.</P>
    <P>I must remind the House in connection with this build-up of the emotions that it makes good copy.  It is good reading.  The papers are entitled to satisfy whatever need is out there.  They are in the business of catering for an interest, if that be so, of their readership.  With regard to the Constitution and the special position of the Catholic Church, we were all obliged, exhorted, in deference to the sensitivity of our brothers and sisters in the North to show magnanimity and remove from the Constitution what was a fact.  It was not a lie, it was not embarrassing, but they said it was.  The fact was that in this island on the matter of religion, the majority of the people are Catholic.  We were told that to remove that would help considerably towards bringing North and South together.  I did not believe at the time that it would have any effect and I do not think it has had any effect.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the Pro-life Amendment, I heard Deputy De Rossa &mdash; I cannot say that I heard the Minister for Health, but I heard the Taoiseach and countless other people &mdash; say on radio that if that Pro-life Amendment were passed, hundreds of women in Ireland would die.  That was built up to the extent that when we were canvassing &mdash; and I make no apology for canvassing &mdash; for what I saw as a protection in our Constitution against abortion I was followed by <Col N="221" /> people from The Workers' Party and other parties saying &ldquo;Deputy Tunney wants young married women to die&rdquo;.  I have in my office a question which I shall be putting to the Minister for Health, I am giving him notice, asking for particulars in respect of the number of women in Ireland who have died as a result of the Pro-life Amendment being passed. There will not be thousands, or hundreds and I shall be surprised and certainly very disappointed even if there is one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter, in this new-found South County Dublin republicanism of his presumes to lecture me and people on this side of the House as to our inadequacies and shortcomings in the matter of our republican ideals.  He gives us the crystallisation of his republicanism &mdash; that the making available of contraceptives to the young people of the North and South will be a great move in that direction, or that, conversely, the fact that we are not doing so means that we are acting in a fashion prejudicial to our cause.  I think that I have been as often in the North as anybody else here.  I have had discussion and discourse with young and old.  It is an insult to the young people of the North and South that we would say to them that the making available of contraceptives to our youth would be a step forward on the road to a Republic. It might be in the vision that Deputy Shatter has of republicanism, but not in mine.  He is hard up for an argument.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave the matter without having a work on this &ldquo;in&rdquo; word, pluralism. I heard an esteemed cleric last night say that this Bill was all about pluralism &mdash; pluralism meaning letting everybody do what he or she likes.  Is it pluralism to satisfy the desires that allow the wrongly called joy-rider to take someone else's car for kicks and kill and murder other people?  That is in satisfaction of what they think they would like to do.  Is it the exercise of pluralism that we will tolerate petty larceny, or greater sins against society, such as attacking and raping young and old?  It is pluralism that will remove from the scene what we all know is essential, which comes to us from our own Irish language, in a fashion in which <Col N="222" /> it does not come to such people &mdash; Ní bhíonn an rath ach mar a bhíonn an smacht.  Apply that at personal level, family level, Government or community level &mdash; you will never have worth-while and lasting progress or satisfaction unless you have a control of certain freedoms. That is fundamental and worth-while living.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not say in his opening speech, but I would like to know what agent or political party requested him to bring in a Bill which would make contraceptives available to our young people. On the Planning Board it is normal for a member to disclose his interest in relation to planning matter.  I would ask the Minister to disclose whether or not he has what could be regarded as an interest, because the request, the urgency and the pressure for this legislation has come from that one organisation.</P>
    <P>No bishop or cleric has put pressure on me in respect of this legislation.  They would know me too well not to know that I would not respond to that from them or anybody else, but I cannot resume my seat without saying that supposing they did I would live with my conscience and be much happier being wrong with them than right with the people who are attacking them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment on the atmosphere of intimidation that has prevailed both inside and outside this House since the Bill was introduced last week. We have heard of threats of kidnappings and burnings in relation to Deputies who are known to be supporters of this Bill.  I have reason to suspect that this was the result of an orchestrated campaign intended to discredit the families opposed to this legislation and inhibit them from making their lawful representations to their elected representatives.  These families are trying to protect their children and it is their democratic right and duty to approach those elected to represent them and to voice their opinions.  I unreservedly condemn tactics of intimidation. I know how disconcerting it can be because I have been at the receiving end. However, my philosophy is &ldquo;if you <Col N="223" /> cannot stand the heat then you have no option but to get out of the kitchen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I take a very serious view of the intimidation.  It is a tryanny endeavouring to defeat the democratic process of this House.  Who would have believed, 63 years ago when this nation won the fight to self-determination, that the elected representatives would be intimidated in a manner reminiscent of Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia?  I will instance the events that indicate an orchestration of these events.  After my first television appearance in which I indicated that I saw inherent danger in this Bill and would not support it I was subjected to a campaign of telephone torment to such an extent that it was necessary for me to leave my home.  My husband and I went to the west where we met the parents of some of the children whom we are trying to protect.  I came home with batteries recharged knowing that I was not some freak in this House who was not going to follow blindly after something that I know to be inherently wrong.  The people I met made it abundantly clear that they shared my concern about the risk involved in this Bill.</P>
      <P>At the February meeting of the National Council of Fine Gael last Friday, a delegate from my constituency without a mandate from anyone, a person who had been at a meeting the night before where she was told what would be on the agenda, for some obscure reason came up with a motion of support for the Bill.  When I asked her at whose behest she did that she was not prepared to tell me, but she got permission from the chairman to move the motion.  If that is not a denial of democracy I would ask somebody in the House to tell me what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my office here which I share with Deputy Brendan McGahon, I saw him subjected to a regime of intimidation that one would have to see to believe.  It came from his constituency chairman who told him that they would obstruct all his political functions and would deny him a nomination at the next convention.  The <Col N="224" /> same treatment was meeted out in the press to Deputy Brendan Griffin.  They are actually looking for a new candidate for the area already.  Deputy Frank Prendergast has been threatened with the loss of his livelihood as well as the unlikelihood of his getting a nomination at the next election.  Deputy Tom O'Donnell has been threatened with the withdrawal of membership of committees in the European Parliament where he is serving the people of this country extremely well. I, like them, do not intend to allow myself to be intimidated out of expressing my views on political morality and the common good.  I do not intend to allow anyone associated with an orchestrated campaign to silence my opposition to what I perceive to be a perversion of reason.  Those who support the Bill will say &ldquo;we uphold the Catholic Bishops' right to speak out on matters relating to public and private morality but we want to deny the Catholics their right to listen to their bishops and to act on what they say&rdquo;.  The meaning of the Coalition agreement to review the Family Planning Act of 1979 is being distorted and is perverting reason.  I, as a member of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, have been given a choice which is: accept the code of immorality, of international socialism and reject the teaching of your Church or get out of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.  The party rule concerning expulsion becomes like a clause in a Faustian contract and the full import of it will unfold very slowly.  The process of corruption is slow but very sure.  Today it is what appears to be a minor issue but tomorrow it will be something a little more serious.  The process of corrupting Dáil Deputies has been set in motion. The corruption gives power to those over the innocent and the just.  Government as we know it is now at an end.  No longer can the public rely on the personal integrity of those whom they elected to govern.  No longer can they rely on the conscience of those whom they elected as a safeguard for their freedoms.  In essence that means that democracy has been subverted. To quote Edmund Burke, &ldquo;All <Col N="225" /> the decent draperies of life to be rudely torn off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland are aware that something sinister is going on and they believe that we are truly at a crossroads. They see their elected representatives being subverted and forced into lobbies in support of legislation which they know in their heart and soul is wrong and will have an extremely damaging affect on our youth.  It must be remembered that a high proportion of our people are under 30 years.  What a travesty it will be to pass legislation that will deliberately destroy them.  No Member was given any mandate to do so and, as Deputy Tunney has said, if they had the courage to be truthful and put this proposal on election literature they certainly would not have entered the House as representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>It was not the Archbishop of Dublin, or any other Catholic bishop, who brought this divisive issue to the floor of the House.  At a time when we should be concerning ourselves with the appalling and enormous problems confronting us we take up the time of the taxpayer to discuss legislation that has become abhorrent to the majority of our people.  We must thank our illustrious Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, for taking up the time of the House on this issue.  I should like to put on record the fact that I resent attacks on moral standards on the grounds that they are Catholic as if to be Catholic was <i>ipso facto</i> wrong and should be shouted down.  I will not have that.</P>
    <P>I shall now address myself to the Bill. I have been reminded by many that I signed a pledge which indicated that I would support a review of the Family Planning Act, 1979.  I should like to quote what is contained in the Fine GaelLabour Programme for Government:</P>
    <P>There will be a review of the operation of the present family planning legislation with a view to providing full family planning advice and facilities in all cases where needed.</P>
    <P>It can be said that I am the last Member who can be accused of not being willing <Col N="226" /> to do that.  In June last, as the House was about to rise for the Summer Recess, I submitted an eight page document to the Minister for Health, and his Department, outlining the grounds where I saw a crying need to review the Family Planning Act, 1979.  For anybody to suggest that the amendment before the House is a review of that Act is stretching credulity beyond reason.</P>
    <P>It is a perversion of reason to say that a review of this Act, with all its flaws, can be done by saying we will extend the provisions and let our young people avail of the provisions of this inferior Bill.  It is important to stress that all Members are agreed that there is not any way the clause that makes these things available to 18 year olds can be implemented.  We are being asked to exchange one bad law for a worse piece of legislation.  Already the Dr. Andrew Rynnes of this world are telling the public that they do not have any intention of operating within the provisions of the Bill.  He is one of the people who did not operate within the provisions of the 1979 Act and he was charged and fined by a court.  He sees himself as a type of hero.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa told us that his great concern was for the health of the women of the State and he wanted safe and appropriate contraceptives.  Although I brought the submission I presented to the Minister last June with me today I did not intend to subject the House to the boredum of having to listen to me read it into the record, but it is essential that I quote some paragraphs.  There has been reference to the financial provision made in the 1979 Act for the promotion of natural family planning instruction.  That Act stated that sums of money would be set aside for that purpose.  The only people in the field at that time were those promoting the Billings method, a group of women who were doing excellent work.  When the 1979 Bill was passed they were given a grant of £35,000 in order to set up a service.  The sum was inadequate because of the tremendous demand for the service.  The grant was paid in 1980 and in 1982, instead of the grant being increased to keep pace with <Col N="227" /> inflation, they received £20,000.  We can see from that the support for natural family planning services.  In 1983 the grant was reduced to £17,000 but up to November last they had not received any money for 1984.  As chairman of the Eastern Health Board I met representatives of that group on several occasions, because the subvention was to be paid through the health board and they indicated that it was not possible to continue to offer the service.  I do not know if they have since received a grant and I hope the Minister will inform the House when replying.</P>
    <P>I shall quote the introduction to my recommendations to the Minister.  It states:</P>
    <P>The McGee case created a need, so to speak, for a public policy on family planning.  In 1979, the Fianna Fáil Government passed a Family Planning Act and in 1980 issued implementing regulations.  Since that time, the Act and its implementing regulations have been criticised from all sides but the complaints must frequently publicised have been from those who feel the law is too restrictive.  Generally, the Act has been criticised by persons who advocate greater availability of and access to contraceptive or abortifacient drugs and devices.  Opposing views, that is, the views of persons reacting negatively to what they consider permissive access proposals, have also been given some publicity.  The problem is that this has tended to focus public attention on a peripheral issue and colour the debate with emotionally charged moral overtones to the neglect of meaningful debate on &ldquo;policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Various segments and supporters of the parties in Coalition have joined the debate on these terms, i.e., the peripheral issue, while national policy has been permitted, by successive Governments in turn, to evolve under the hand of minor bureaucrats responsible to no one.  For example, the Minister for Health has conducted a media campaign of sorts which reached <Col N="228" /> its climax when he called the law &ldquo;an ass&rdquo; and openly flaunted it by participating in the opening of a facility which is commonly understood to be violating the law that the Minister is supposed to be administering.  Is there nothing more significant to debate about than the availability (or lack of) condoms? I think there is.  The effect of the Minister's activity has been to move the debate away from the real and legitimate needs of married couples. Instead, the debate revolves around questions of &ldquo;moral permissiveness&rdquo; and genuinely concerned parents are being alienated by what they see as an attack on families and interference with their children.  I am hearing this from my constituents all of the time and I think it is a dangerous mood for any Government to provoke, but particularly in a time of economic stress for the country.</P>
    <P>There are several additional pages which elaborate on what I believe should be done, but the important ones are these and I am reading them exactly because of what Deputy De Rossa has said.  Lest there be anyone else in this House under the misapprehension that we have a safe and appropriate contraceptive service let me tell them they are being deluded.</P>
    <P>In the early part of that press release I said that, since the State had entered the area of family planning, free principles should prevail &mdash; freedom of choice, safety and reliability and informed consent.</P>

      <P>Whatever can be said about the functions of the State all would agree that a legitimate function would be a product of safety.  That is even more important when the products may affect the health and the State is the primary supplier of health care.  In deference to Deputy Skelly I shall summarise, but be assured that the Minister was given all of this in June last.  Yet he introduces a Bill which he purports to suggest is a review of the Family Planning Act, totally ignoring the need to give protection to the women of Ireland.  They are being kept in the dark.  Suffice it to say that in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 23 December 1983 there was an article entitled &ldquo;More Deaths Due <Col N="231" /> to Contraception&rdquo; which commenced by saying:</P>
      <P>Deaths caused by methods of contraception may very soon exceed the number of pregnancy related deaths, according to a report in the Irish Medical Journal.</P>
      <P>In the USA, where they went into all of this many years ago, in 1969 they found there were so many women suffering side effects and death that could not be related by way of medical science to known causes, they concluded there was something peculiar going on.  A woman called Barbara Seaman researched, along with a group of other women, the effects of contraception on women in American society.  The results were so dramatic that a book she wrote became a bestseller overnight.  When published there were 14 million American women using the pill. Four years later that number had been reduced to four million.  President Reagan, with the advice of his Minister for Health, is now encouraging women to leave aside the pill and to use other methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was an article published in <i>The Observer</i> of 7 October 1984 entitled &ldquo;The pill: British win right to sue&rdquo; written by Annabel Ferriman, Health Correspondent, in which it is contended that British women have now been told of the hazards inherent in its use.  In the House of Lords they have been given a right to sue American companies who are supplying this country.  Is this a laughing matter?  I thought I heard a female voice laughing. Can anybody contend that it is a laughing matter that I, as a public representative, should possess this knowledge and remain silent at a time when we are reviewing a Family Planning Act?  However funny it may seem to those less-informed, I take very seriously the fact that so many women in this country are at risk at present with no attempt being made on the part of the Minister or his Department to inform them precisely of what are the side effects.  That in itself should constitute a reason for reviewing the Family Planning Act.  Since it would <Col N="232" /> appear that there is no hope that we can expect that kind of response or responsible consideration perhaps the Minister and some of his senior civil servants would equip themselves with the information readily available, read it, perhaps then coming back, showing due consideration to the women of Ireland because they are entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you for giving me time to speak on this very important subject and to say that I have given portion of my time to Deputy Séamus Kirk.  The pig industry is the third highest segment of the agricultural industry.  In 1983 we produced pig meat to the value of £176 million, which indicates that it is a very fine industry.</P>
      <P>However, the Irish pig industry is in the midst of a very serious financial crisis at present.  Pig feeders are losing £4 per pig although food prices are £25 per tonne cheaper than they were 12 months ago. Financial losses are being made by an industry which, by EC and world standards, is extremely efficient.  Output per sow has improved by approximately 21 per cent since 1977 and is now over 19 pigs sold per sow per annum, which compares more than favourably with any other pig industry in Western Europe.  We are not talking about a sector which is a poor performer but about what is possibly our most efficient branch of farming, namely, pig production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current crisis in the pig production sector has arisen at a time when pig farmers have not recovered from the disaster experienced between October 1983 and March 1984.  Direct employment in <Col N="233" /> the pig industry accounts for approximately 3,000 people.  These producers keep many other people in business.  The main sectors dependent on pig producers are grain growers, and it is a very valuable asset to them because grain production in the EC is now in overproduction and there is a large surplus in this country. Feed compounders, pig slaughterers, meat processors and transport operators and many service sectors are associated with pig production.  Approximately 25 per cent of all compound feeds used are manufactured in this country, and this is equivalent to half a million tonnes of feed for a sector employing 2,000 people, the feed compounding sector.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the pig sector purchased about 101 million gallons of liquid skim milk at a time when milk was in oversupply and skim milk powder an embarrassment to the EC.  This was also a major asset to the dairy industry, because their products would have polluted our rivers and lakes if the pig industry had not taken them up.</P>
    <P>The curing industry here is, by and large, out of date.  The modernisation of this sector has been very slow during the past decade.  Consequently, pig processing costs are high and we have in general a legacy of weak, high cost processing units which puts us at a commercial disadvantage when we attempt to sell abroad. The industry needs a rapid injection of capital to modernise our many outdated plants so that we may sell competitively in foreign markets against the Danes and the Dutch.</P>
    <P>Pork slaughters get preferential treatment as far as payment of veterinary levies is concerned.  Curers are subject to a levy of £1.10 per pig while pork slaughterers are not obliged to pay any levy.  This puts commercial and licensed curers at a very serious disadvantage and has caused certain damage to the industry, because many of the pigs are killed in slaughter houses which have very poor standards.  I do not wish to elaborate on this as it might harm the industry but legislation must be introduced in this area as soon as possible.  It has been going on for some time, we have now come to the end of the road and we must legislate. <Col N="234" /> The Departments of Health and Environment must also be involved in drafting the necessary Bill.</P>
    <P>The veterinary levy is an anomaly which should not exist.  Southern curers should not be asked to pay this levy until such time as there is equality within the island.  This applies to pork slaughter houses and licensed curers.  The veterinary regulations and control of slaughtering premises should be similar irrespective of whether one refers to the licensed bacon curers or pork slaughterers. Standards of processing should be equal, irrespective of whether the product is being sold on the home or export markets.  The distribution of pig meat on the home market is haphazard, erratic and extremely expensive.  At present, pig producers get 52p per pound while the consumer pays, on average, £1.30 or £1.40 per pound.  The producer is not getting an adequate reward for his efforts while many middle men are making substantial gains for that industry.</P>
    <P>Marketing abroad is not as effective as it should be.  Our bacon curers should be able to sell products equal to those of the Danes and Dutch on the UK, Japanese or other markets.  While our processing industry is making the necessary rapid investment to compete effectively on foreign markets, we need a market development funds to tide us over this critical period.  Within the constrains of EC legislation it should be no problem for the Minister for Agriculture to seek a grant of £1 million or thereabouts, interest free, for the retention and development of our pig industry in the short term.  We did this in the past.  A previous Minister for Agriculture set up a market development fund and I was a member of the committee dealing with this matter.  It worked quite well for a while but, perhaps for lack of discipline by the curers, it did not make a profit, which was not good for the industry.</P>
    <P>Pig producers are largely in favour of such a development but some curers and pork slaughterers are holding up progress. The pig industry needs the leadership of the Minister for Agriculture and his Department and, if this leadership is <Col N="235" /> not forthcoming and if we do not establish a medium term development fund, that vital industry will contract by 30 or 40 per cent in a short space of time.  It is obvious that that contraction has set in already, and one of the most efficient farming industries in Europe will drop possibly to one million pigs reared per annum.  We cannot afford this at present, and many people will be on the dole.  Thousands of farmers and pig producers will go out of business and there will be less demand for grain and other service sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister should act before it is too late.  There should be rapid investment in the processing sector.  He should introduce common legislation and veterinary standards for all processors.  He should bring producers, curers and all other interested people around a table and set up a fund, which would not be outside his European brief.  In order to save this vital industry £1 million would need to be invested in it.  Northern producers have many advantages over us.  They have a meat industry employment subsidy worth in the region of £1.50-£2 per pig and that is paid with EC approval.  They have a transport subsidy to the UK which is paid by the UK Government because they are an island off the UK.  We received a FEOGA subsidy from the EC in 1974. That saved the industry and gave it stability.</P>
    <P>There are a total of 22 licensed curers and ten large pork slaughter houses.  This is not covered by any legislation and no standards have been set.  People in the pig industry have borrowed in the region of £80 million-£100 million from the banks and ACC.  We cannot stand idly by and allow the industry to die.  The value of the industry to the economy is £100 million or 8 per cent of gross agricultural output.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> the Minister revealed that:</P>
    <P>... he could not intervene to help the pig industry although he said it was going through &ldquo;a particularly difficult time at present&rdquo;.  This was mainly due <Col N="236" /> to uncertainty over export arrangements, but was purely a matter for the industry itself to resolve, he added.</P>
    <P>He said that in Cork last night to the Cork Dairy and Food Science Society at UCC.  In his contribution on the budget he did not make any reference to the pig industry.  I appeal to him to do something for the industry.  Agriculture has suffered a lot, and I hope we do not see the same thing happen in this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for this opportunity to contribute to the debate.  There is no doubt that those involved in the industry are primary producers, processors or in the marketing and distribution end.  The industry is in a serious state.</P>
      <P>Traditionally the pig industry has been of a cyclical nature.  We have a good year, a mediocre year and a bad year.  The ability of pig producers to balance the good and bad times means the difference between survival and going to the wall. Over the last number of years the pig industry improved enormously.  There has been a dramatic change from the time when four or five sows were kept on a small holding.  That kind of project is no longer viable.  ACOT must be complimented for the contribution they have made to the overall efficiency of production in the industry.  Without their input, advice and guidance the industry would not have developed as it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is in a crisis.  As a result of lack of know how at the marketing end and because of the costs involved in curing, slaughtering and marketing the good work done at the primary producing end goes for nought.  It is only a matter of time until the large units into which huge investments have been pumped and on which huge repayments must be made will not be able to take any more.  This is one of the more labour intensive segments of the agricultural industry, and if such units were to close it would be a sorry day for the nation.  Most economic commentators agree that the pig industry has great potential for expansion and development.  It is a question of the <Col N="237" /> Minister indentifying the potential that exists and setting a campaign in motion to expand the industry.  Without his intervention it is only a matter of time until the industry collapses.  The consequences of that would be loss of revenue to the Exchequer and increased unemployment.</P>
    <P>The threat of a levy on cereal production is hovering over us, and the prospects are not good for the coming year.  In those circumstances one would think we would look to the pig industry.  There is no outlet for barley and other cereals, and the EC are looking at ways and means of curtailing cereal production.  If the Minister had a co-ordinated development plan of action for the pig industry he could do much to relieve the plight of cereal producers who will find themselves in difficulty before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and Minister of State to examine the industry and take the necessary measures to get it back on the rails.  They must ensure that it is on the road to expansion for the benefit of those who are involved in it and those who will become involved in it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for raising this important matter, and I shall respond briefly to a few of the points raised. Deputy O'Keeffe referred to pork slaughter houses.  It is intended to have a Bill drafted to provide for standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local slaughtering premises catering for the home market on a par with those already applying to premises dealing with the export market.</P>
      <P>With regard to the transport subsidy in the North, experience has proved that it helps our producers since it helps to divert products to Britain that might otherwise land on our doorsteps.  With regard to expansion of the industry, we are already more than self-sufficient in pigmeat and any further expansion will have to be met with corresponding expansion in exports.  I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The pig industry has been going through a difficult period for some time now, largely due to the combined effect of several separate problems.  On the home market &mdash; where about 70 per cent of our pigment production is consumed &mdash; producer prices have fallen sharply. This situation has been caused by a continued weakening of demand resulting in excess supply and a consequent pressure on prices.  On the export market, changes in export arrangements have created a difficult situation for exporters.  Since we are well more than self-sufficient in pigmeat production, it is obvious that a significant expansion in export levels is essential to ensure the viability of the industry.</P>
    <P>Mindful of the market difficulties, the EC Commission is being pressed by Ireland for the fullest utilisation of the EC support mechanisms for the pigmeat regime, specifically the earliest possible introduction of a scheme of aids for private storage and for the strengthening of the levels of refunds payable on exports from the EC.  In relation to the introduction of a private storage scheme, however, the current decline in our producer prices has not been shared by most other EC member states, and this factor has mitigated against reintroduction of private storage aids.  I will, of course, continue to do all in my power to help to secure this aid.</P>
    <P>On the question of exports, however, the collapse of the industry's own export support scheme and the winding-up of the Pigs and Bacon Commission Ltd. are developments which are regrettable but I must remind Deputies these are really matters which are the responsibility of the industry itself.  In this connection, I note the recent introduction of a new voluntary support scheme by the industry.  There can, of course, be no question of any direct financial input by the State, as any such moves would be contrary to EC rules.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties being experienced by the industry, it is heartening to note that we are still sending pork cuts to Japan.  It is vital that having succeeded in gaining a foothold in this <Col N="239" /> market in recent times we make strenuous efforts to retain our presence there even though the level of exports refunds is now lower than 1983 when we shipped over 10,000 tonnes to that market. Obviously there is a need in the longer term to seek the development of a more resilient industry at all levels.  Our producers, while already among the most efficient in Europe, must strive for even higher levels of productivity.  They must also aim for the highest quality, since that offers the surest means to compete effectively on the export and domestic markets.</P>
    <P>At factory level, there is vital need for a rationalisation and modernisation of slaughtering premises and this involves our Department, the industry and the IDA.  The recent spate of closures have highlighted the fact that rationalisation by attrition is not in the best interest of the industry.  Rationalisation must be on a planned and orderly basis.  This is the only sensible way to put the industry on a sound footing.  A centralised slaughtering policy to implement this has been drawn up, and unless considerable advances can be made in the implementation of this <Col N="240" /> policy there will be a very serious decline in plant investment with all the obvious consequences this would imply for the industry at all the various levels.  Unless, therefore, we begin to tackle the job of rationalisation seriously now, we will be putting many more jobs at risk and we will be lessening our ability to compete.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to draw attention to the fact that since 1982 pigmeat exporters have not been paying veterinary inspection fees on pigs.  These fees are charged for a service provided and therefore, must be paid.  The amount currently outstanding is in excess of £4 million. Discussions with a view to recouping these amounts are taking place between officials and bacon curers.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that this problem will be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>It is clear that as Minister the means of support open to me are limited but where we can help we will work willingly to do so, but in the final analysis the caution &ldquo;physician heal thyself&rdquo; applies with great force to the pigmeat industry.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware that where a passport is issued to a husband and his wife is included on the passport, Irish-passport regulations provide for the husband or the husband and wife to use the passport but in this instance the wife individually cannot use it and she must apply for a separate passport; if he considers this to be discrimination; if he will create a situation where a passport issued in the husband's and wife's name can be used by either or both parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>A passport is issued to one holder.  The holder may include his or her spouse on the passport at time of issue free of charge.  He or she may also include his or her children on the passport.  A passport on which a spouse is included is known as a joint or family passport.  It is however the passport of the holder, and cannot be used by an included spouse or children unless they are travelling in the company of the holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No discrimination now exists between men and women.  I have ensured in the last year that the new passport booklet and application forms make it clear that a spouse (i.e. male or female) may be <Col N="44" /> included on the passport.  Previously the passport booklet and the application forms referred to the inclusion of a wife.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a spouse or children on a holder's passport is a useful facility to families.  It would not however be in conformity with normal passport practice to issue a passport which could be used separately by an included spouse on an equal footing with the holder.  In fact even the inclusion of spouses on passports is now quite rare in European countries.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of a spouse or of children on an Irish passport does not interfere with their rights to obtain individual passports should they so decide.  Since we made no additional charge for the inclusion of a spouse or children at time of issue, there is no element of double charging should they decide later to take separate passports.</P>

However, when the relevant regulations providing for the change in arrangements were made in August, 1984 all those cases that could be readily identified as having been rejected for non compliance with the earlier `one year' rule were reviewed. By November, 1984 over 150 grant applications which had previously been rejected had been allowed under the new arrangements.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  In the absence of a standard health services price index, the percentage changes in allocations have been expressed in real terms by using the annual average consumer price index increases.  These were 10.4 per cent in 1983 and 8.6 per cent in 1984.  The forecast 1985 increase is 5.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>2.  The figures for &ldquo;1983 over 1982&rdquo; and &ldquo;1984 over 1983&rdquo; relate to the revised approved allocations in each of these years.  The allocations for 1985 will be revised in the light of approved pay increases.  The figures quoted for &ldquo;1985 to 1984&rdquo; consequently relate to the change in the original approved allocation for 1985 as compared to the original approved allocation for 1984.</P>
    <P>3.  The difference in percentage changes as between health boards can be explained by a variety of factors including differences in pay/non-pay relationships, differences in numbers eligible for cash allowances and the relative extent to which health boards avail themselves of facilities in extern voluntary hospitals etc. (the percentages quoted in the table are derived from the allocations for direct expenditure (including provision for the expenditure of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board)).</P>
    <P>4.  A significant factor in the relative situation of the Southern Health Board was the provision of a special allocation to meet revenue expenditure arising from the commissioning of the new hospital in Tralee.</P>
    <P>5.  The allocations to health boards (from which the percentages quoted in the table are derived) are expressed in net terms taking account of income accruing to the boards such as patient receipts etc.  Such income increases from year to year and, when taken into account, improves progressively the spending levels of the boards.</P>

      <P>The situation in regard to non-capital payments is that such payments are made to health boards who determine their distribution between programmes and services throughout their areas.  Information is not available in my Department which would facilitate the identification of the proportion of such payments which would relate to individual counties.</P>
      <P>The non-capital payments made in the years 1982, 1983 and 1984 to the health boards which are responsible for the organisation of health services in the counties mentioned were as follows:</P>

      <P>The accident and emergency services in Dublin city are provided on a rota basis by eight major Dublin hospitals.  The purpose of the rota is to ensure that there is a 24 hour &ldquo;on call&rdquo; emergency hospital service available for accidents and emergencies in the Dublin region.  The position in relation to waiting times is that all genuine emergencies are dealt with as a matter of urgency and I am satisfied that the present service is adequate to deal with genuine accident and emergency cases.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when the Government intends implementing the EC Recommendations on social security for volunteer development workers which was submitted by the Commission to the Council of Europe on 12 December 1984, thus providing health care; sickness benefit &mdash; maternity benefits &mdash; invalidity benefits &mdash; old age benefits and survivors' benefits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft EC Recommendation on Social Security for Volunteer Development Workers is still under discussion by the working party on social questions and has not yet been adopted by the Council of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Deputy will recall that the Minister for Finance in his Budget Speech on 30 January last announced that the Government wish to ensure that the social insurance position of volunteer development workers will be safeguarded during their absence abroad in developing countries.  In this context regulations <Col N="76" /> will shortly be made which will afford such workers continuity of social insurance cover and will thus continue their entitlement to the various social insurance benefits on their return to this country. These regulations will take into account the principles enshrined in the draft EC Recommendation.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the draft recommendation relating to the availability of health care to volunteer development workers have not yet been finalised.  The question of the provision of health care to such workers will be examined in the light of the recommendation as adopted by council.</P>

      <P>The person concerned lodged an appeal on 26 October 1984 against a decision disallowing her claim to old age pension.  An appeals officer requested further information on this case before giving his decision.  When the social welfare officer called on her to make further <Col N="77" /> inquiries she informed him that she did not wish to pursue the appeal any further and she accordingly withdrew her appeal and confirmed this in writing.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from self-employment exceeded the statutory limit.  He appealed against this decision and an appeals officer on 5 April 1984 also assessed him with means exceeding the statutory limit.  He made a repeat claim to unemployment assistance on 30 November 1984 and his case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at £20.40 weekly, the appropriate rate £31.75 less means £11.35.  His means were derived from the value of board and lodgings in his fathers home.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and following review of his case a deciding officer in a revised decision assessed him with (1) nil means from 27 September 1984 and (2) £16.20 means from 4 November 1984.  He was informed that this was a revised deciding officer's decision and as such that he had the right to appeal against it.</P>
      <P>It is still open to him to appeal if he is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £15.55 weekly the appropriate rate £31.75 less means £16.20 weekly.</P>

He appealed against this disallowance and he is being afforded another opportunity of disclosing full details of his means and his case has been referred to a social welfare officer to pursue inquiries.  When these inquiries are completed his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be <Col N="80" /> determined in the light of the amount of means assessed against him.

      <P>The person concerned claimed a contributory old age pension on 12 January 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the beginning of the year in which he entered into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.  The Department's records show that he had a total of 111 contributions in the required period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984. This is equal to yearly average of only three and, therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>

These checks are to establish whether or not the claimant was absent from work for the period in respect of which benefit was claimed and medical details of the claims are not disclosed to the employer.  The practice is a necessary control requirement and is not a breach of confidentiality.</P>

      <P>The circumstances of the person concerned were reviewed in December 1984 following representations on her behalf for an increase in her widow's non-contributory pension.  The local social welfare officer reported that the previous means assessment of £28.84 per week, derived from a life interest in a holding, remains unchanged.  Her application for an increase was therefore refused and she was notified of this decision and of her right to appeal against it if dissatisfied.  No appeal was received.</P>
      <P>Her present rate of pension is £17.30 per week.  This is the rate appropriate to a widow over 66 years of age with no qualified children and whose weekly means exceed £28.00 but do not exceed £30.00.

An overpayment of pension, which arose as a result of non-disclosure capital at an earlier assessment, is being recovered by withholding £4.00 a week from this entitlement and a pension of £21.50 a week is, accordingly, being paid to her.  In the light of the information provided in relation to the transfer of the holding, the Deputy's representations have been accepted as a claim to increased old age pension on her behalf. The case is being referred to the social welfare officer for investigation.  When the inquiries are completed a decision will be made and the pensioner will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>A total of 91 offenders have been sentenced to penal servitude for life since 1964.  Six offenders were discharged from court following appeals or re trials.

      <P>Two of this group failed to keep the conditions of their temporary release and are regarded as being illegally at large. They are believed to be residing outside the jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Sixteen under 2 years; Eight from 2 to 3 years; Three from 3 to 4 years; Two from 4 to 5 years; Two from 5 to 6 years; Five from 6 to 7 years; Five from 7 to 8 years; One from 8 to 9 years; Two from 9 to 10 years; Four from 10 to 11 years; One from 13 to 14 years; One from 16 to 17 years.

      <P>My Department have requested the Commissioners of Public Works to prepare a sketch scheme for the proposed additional accommodation for Scoil Mhuire, Tullamore, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>When these plans have been received in my Department and examined, my Department would hope to be in a position to negotiate a local contribution towards the cost of the project and to sanction a grant.  Preparation of contract documents by the commissioners would then follow.  It is not possible at this stage to say when it may be possible to place a contract for the project.</P>

      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers is one where an employer applied for assistance under the scheme in respect of four additional employees recruited within 1984.  The scheme as structured, assists additional recruitments within a limit of two per annum and accordingly, two of the recruitments did not qualify for payment in 1984.  As the recruitment limit is, however, calculated on an annual basis, the employer concerned may recruit two additional employees under the scheme in 1985.</P>

      <P>Under the national plan <i>Building on Reality 1985-87,</i> the sum of £1 million has been made available to me this year to provide capital grant aid towards the construction of community and recreational facilities.  There are very heavy demands on the limited funds available to me and it will only be possible to grant-aid a small number of the many deserving applications received.  The offer of £75,000 to Firhouse Community Council was one of the largest allocations of grant aid under the programme.  I regret that, in view of the number of competing demands, it is not possible to increase the amount of that offer.  Officials of my Department recently met representatives of Firhouse Community Council to explain the position fully to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 12 of Chapter Four of <i>Building on Reality</i> outlined the key features of the social employment scheme.  Additional details are as follows: The scheme will be operated by the National Manpower Service.  The £70 wage will relate to an average two and a half days, 20 hour week.  There will be flexibility in working arrangements so as to allow, for example, sponsors to operate on a week on, week <Col N="129" /> off basis.  Participants will be free to engage in alternative work on their days off.  Participants in the scheme should, in general, be over 25 years and must be in receipt of unemployment assistance in the period immediately preceding recruitment. Participants must be unemployed for more than one year but periods during which unemployment benefit, disability benefit were received or periods of training and, within limits, temporary work, will be reckonable in calculating the year. Periods of employment under the scheme will qualify for special credited contributions in a person's social insurance record but will not reckon towards qualification for unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>No local authority has indicated refusal to participate in the scheme or indicated that it is impracticable to do so.  A number of local authorities have expressed an interest in the scheme, but pending its commencement, have not been invited to submit formal applications.  I propose to launch the scheme officially on 22 February and explanatory leaflets, etc. will be available from that time.</P>
